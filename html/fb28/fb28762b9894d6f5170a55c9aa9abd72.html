October 22, UVU5 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 27259 
eqUality and dignity can be a living reality 
for all AnlericaPsi and , 
I'Vheriaa thia vital and. liable purpose has 
been effeetivey advanced by President Lyn-
don_ B. Johnson, whose breadth of. Vision and 
brilliant leadership in this field are acknowl-
edged with gratitude and admiration by the 
American people; and 
Whereas under President Johnson's out-
standing effective leadership, the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act 
of 1961 have the potential to eliminate racial 
discrimination in many aspects of American 
life; and 
Whereas the implementation of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 have not met the high standards 
established by President Johnson and the 
Congress; and 
Whereas the high hopes of the American 
people are being frustrated by the slow 
implementation of these laws; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Young Democratic Clubs 
of America meeting in contention that: 
Article 1. We call, upon the Department 
of Justice to use its extensive powers under 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to assign ad-
ditional Federal voting registrars in all the 
many counties where Americans are still 
denied the right to vote by unconstitutional 
means. 
Article 2. We call upon all Federal agencies 
to implement title VI of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 which requires the withdrawal of 
Federal funds whereVer racial discrimination 
exists in federally supported programs until 
that racial discrimination ends, 
Article 3. The Young Democrats of America 
are encouraged to devise, implement and 
support programs which secure to all groups 
the right to share fully and equally, with 
dignity, in American society. 
FAIR HOUSING RESOLUTION SUBMITTED BY THE 
Yourro Dsztrocaaric CL17,0 or NEW JERSEY 
Whereas in, the ,1960 election campaign 
presidential candidate John F. Kennedy 
pledged that, if elected, he would ban dis-
crimination practices in the Government's 
helping operations with a "stroke of the 
pen"; and 
Whereas on November 20, 1962, President 
Kennedy placed his signature on Executive 
Order No. 11063 banning discrimination in 
federally aided housing, and including a dec-
laration that exclusion of Americans from 
stich housing because of their race, color, 
creed or national origin is "unfair, unjust, 
and inconsistent with the public policy of 
the United States as manifested in its Con-
stitution and laws;" and . 
Whereas the order, though an important 
advanced principle, is limited in scope and 
(1) fails to embrace existing housing, even if 
such housing is federally assisted, (2) fails 
to cover loans by federally aided savings and 
loans associations and other similar institu-
tions, and (3) fails to protect against dis-
criminatory practices by these lenders; and 
Whereas housing segregation is tied directly 
to slums and slum conditions, to segregated 
schools, to inequalities in employment and 
to the poverty which haunts millions of 
Negro Americans and other minorities so 
movingly outlined by President Johnson in 
his Howard University speech in June 1965; 
and 
Whereas it remains the responsibility of the 
executive branch of the Government to com-
plete the task of prohibiting discrimination 
in federally assisted housing, which it set 
out to accomplish in 1962: Now, therefore, 
bp it 
Resolved by the Young Democratic Clubs 
of America meeting in convention, That we 
d.O.,hereby _respectfully urge the President of 
the jiri1te-&-t.OsteS to alnend Executive Order 
N9. 1I068 84011PWC. ? - 
I. To prohibit discriminatory practices in 
mortgage loans by all banks and lending 
No. 198-19 
institutions which are subject in any manner 
to regulation., supervision or control by an 
agency of. the Federal Government. 
2. To cover all federally aided housing 
which was built or contracted for prior 
to November 20, 1962, and which continues 
to enjoy Federal assistance. 
In addition to the foregoing recommenda-
tions, the YDCA also urges action on the 
following administrative matters: 
1. The procedural power provided various 
Federal housing agencies to grant exemp-
tions from the scope of the order should be 
withdrawn. Under this power the Federal 
Housing Administration has excluded the 
resale of single family homes. This exemp-
tion vitiates the reach of the order and 
minimizes its effectiveness. 
2. The President's Committee on Equal 
Oportunity in Housing should be directed to 
assume broad responsibility for the imple-
mentation of the order and should be pro-
vided with sufficient staff and budget ex-
pansion to administer an effective national 
program. 
RACIAL VIOLENCE RESOLUTION 
Whereas in recent months lily-white 
southern juries, ignoring the overwhelming 
weight of the evidence, have in several cases, 
refused to indict or convict white southern-
ers accused of serious crimes of violence 
against both Negro and white citizens denied 
the equal protection of the law; and 
Whereas the punishment of those guilty 
of crime is essential to the protection of the 
rights of the innocent and the failure to 
punish persons guilty of crimes such as 
murder against any citizen is a denial of the 
equal protection of the laws promised all 
citizens; and 
Whereas these recent events indicate that 
it may be impossible to obtain judges or 
juries in southern courts which are not biased 
against civil rights workers, and biased in 
favor of those who commit crimes against 
them; and 
Whereas bias on the part of the court and 
jury in favor of accused defendants is as 
detrimental to the preservation of law and 
order as is bias against such defendants: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the YDCA strongly deplore 
the denial of equal protection of the law of 
these Southern States; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge that crimes of vio-
lence against civil rfghts workers and any 
other citizen denied the equal protection of 
the law be made Federal offenses, to be tried 
in Federal court after indictment by a Fed-
eral grand jury, in the hope that cases in 
these courts may be tried free of the racial 
bias which, in State courts, denies to civil 
rights workers the equal protection of the 
laws. 
M/SS/SSIPPI RESOLUTION?INTRODUCED BY 
MICHIGAN 
Whereas this 15th biennial convention of 
the Young Democratic Clubs of America has 
chartered a Mississippi Young Democratic 
organization which is racially integrated and 
broadly representative of all the people of 
Mississippi who support the national Demo-
cratic Party and the progressive programs of 
President Lyndon B. Johnson; and 
Whereas the 1961 National Convention of 
the Democratic Party meeting in. Atlantic 
City, N.J., declared its national policy to be 
one of requiring and encouraging all State 
Democratic Parties to be racially integrated 
and open to all loyal Democrats and the spe-
cial Lawrence Subcommittee of the Demo-
cratic National Committee is now formulat-
ing a program to enforce this policy; and 
Whereas Mississippi is a politically de-
pressed area Where the lack of a loyal Demo-
cratic Party organization and unconstitu-
tional restrictions on the right to vote which 
meant that nearly half of all eligible Missis-
sippians were not allowed to vote in 1964 
elections resulted in the electoral votes of 
Mississippi being cast for the representative 
of rightwing reaction and negativism; and 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
sponsored by the Johnson administration 
has recently been signed into law which 
enforces the right of every American to 
register and vote regardless of race and 
which the Democratic Party and the John-
son administration are committed to vigor-
ously and expeditiously enforce; and 
Whereas the absence of any other affiliated 
Democratic organization in Mississippi which 
supports the national Democratic Party 
means that the Young Democratic organiza-
tion of Mississippi must build an organiza-
tion from the ground up; and 
Whereas the members and officers of the 
young Democratic organization of Mississippi 
are to be particularly commended and are 
especially deserving of help by the Young 
Democratic Clubs of America because the 
current political situation in Mississippi 
means that it requires special acts of courage 
to affiliate with and support the national 
Democratic Party: Now be it hereby 
Resolved by the Young Democratic Clubs 
of America meeting in convention that. 
Article 1. The Young Democratic Clubs of 
America hereby pledge every form of assist-
ance necessary for the Mississippi Young 
Democratic organization to grow and flourish 
so that it may build the Great Society in. 
Mississippi. 
Article 2. The President of the YDCA shall 
appoint a select committee to develop and 
administer a detailed program to implement 
article 1 which shall include but not be lim-
ited to the encouragement of nationally 
prominent Democrats to speak in Mississippi 
under the aegis of the Mississippi Young 
Democrats and the recruitment of Young 
Democrats who are expert in membership 
recruitment and voter registration to help the 
Mississippi Young Democrats. All aspects of 
the detailed program shall be at the request 
of and with the approval of the executive 
committee of the Young Democratic Clubs of 
Mississippi. 
Article 3. A special Mississippi fund is 
hereby established which will be used to help 
the Mississippi Young Democratic organiza-
tion to register voters, recruit members, and 
? establish an active Young Democratic pro-
gram in Mississippi. The national executive 
committee shall solicit contributions to the 
fund from regional, State, and local organi-
zation of Young Democrats and from groups 
sympathetic to a vigorous Young Democratic 
organization in Mississippi. 
Article 4. The convention hereby calls upon 
its regional, State, and local organizations to 
adopt and help particular units of the Mis-
sissippi Young Democrats by providing 
funds, supplies, and expert help under the 
direction of the special Mississippi com-
mittee. 
INTOLERABLE CONDITION OF SHAW 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
(Mr. WHITENER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for I 
minute, to revise and extend his remarks, 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. WHITENER. Mr. Speaker, in 
recent months Members of Congress and 
the public have been greatly concerned 
about the intolerable condition of Shaw 
Junior High School. Anyone familiar 
with the condition of that school facility 
must agree that it should be abandoned 
at the earliest possible date and a new 
facility established. 
This is easier said than done. A 
school even though in bad physical con-
dition, which is serving several hundreds 
Approved For Release 2003/09/26 : CIA-RDP67600446R000500080005-4 
Approved &sInIteEassslciga0iatibil8-___RDfiges0R446R00050MON9,-422, 
27260 1965 
of students, cannot be summarily aban-
doned without providing another phys-
ical plant to accommodate the dispos-
ses.sed students. In the ease of the Shaw 
Junior High School many problems are 
presented which would not be present 
in a small town or rural area. There is 
the problem peculiar to a metropolitan 
area of finding a site within the service 
area of the school that is being aban-
doned, and this is particularly true in 
the case of Shaw. 
Another problem that presents itself 
is that if a new site is located in the 
Shaw area it will be necessary to dis-
possess residents and small business op-
erators who are currently residing and 
operating in the area to be used for a 
future school building. 
These are real and existing problems 
which are much mire difficult to solve 
than many are willing to admit. It is 
quite easy to be critical of the Board of 
Education, the District Commissioners, 
and the Congress for continuing to use 
this substandard school facility, but it 
Is another thing to find a solution to the 
problem. This is particularly true in 
view of the fact that vacant land which 
the Board of Education already owns 
has recently been made available by the 
Board of Education to the Recreation 
Department for the John F. Kennedy 
Memorial Playground. 
The playground is serving a very use-
ful purpose, and the recreational oppor-
tunities it affords are badly needed. 
So with these complex problems it 
appears that there can be no solution by 
any one department or agency of the 
government of the District of Columbia. 
In order to accomplish a proper solution 
without imposing undue hardship upon 
any segment of the local population it 
seems to me that the time has come 
when several agencies and departments 
must sit down and discuss this matter 
and undertake to work out a prompt 
solution. 
I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that in 
view of the fact that Shaw Junior High 
School is located in an area which lends 
itself to urban renewal that the board 
of education, the District Commission-
ers, the Recreation Department, the Re-
development Land Agency, the National 
Capital Planning Commission, the Na-
tional Capital Housing Authority, and 
the President's Special Assistant on Dis-
trict Affairs should Immediately consider 
the. possibility of instituting effective 
measures to correct the situation sur-
rounding Shaw Junior High School and 
the area in which it is located. It seems 
to me that it may be possible for an 
urban renewal project to be planned 
which would make land available for the 
building of a new school facility while 
the present Shaw Junior High School is 
being used and then upon the completion 
of the new facility to convert the read 
estate upon which the school is located 
into housing or some other appropriate 
use. 
I think the time has come when posi-
tive action must be taken. The need for 
such action should be clear to any ob-
server. It is certainly clear to those of 
us Who have had a close relationship to 
the many problems confronting the peo-
ple of the District of Columbia. 
As one Member of the Congress I ex-
press the hope that such action be forth-
with considered and pledge my personal 
support in any way possible in accom-
plishing the elimination of an intolerable 
situation in our Nation's Capital. 
(Mr. WHITENER asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
N IMMIGRATION 
(Mr. SHER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FISHER. Mr. Speaker, while we 
all sympathize with the plight of the 
political refugees who want to escape 
Castro's communistic tyranny, the time 
would seem to be overdue when our 
friends and allies in the free world should 
share with us the responsibility for pro-
viding a home for these unfortunate 
people. 
About a quarter of a million Cubans 
have already been admitted since Castro 
took over. Under the new program none 
in military age will be permitted to leave 
Cuba. Most of the new refugees will be 
the elderly, the young, the ill, and cer-
tain anti-Castro elements. The Asso-
ciated Press has estimated that there 
are 50,000 of these people awaiting de-
parture from the island. There may be 
more. 
It would seem that the United States 
should insist upon other countries ac-
cepting more of the fleeing Cubans. 
What about Canada, Argentina, Aus-
tralia, and many other nations which 
are quite capable of absorbing more im-
migrants? It will be recalled that we had 
a joint arrangement with other countries 
In the handling of European displaced 
persons following World War II. The 
United States accepted most of these 
refugees. That fact, plus the large num-
bers of Cubans already admitted, makes 
It even more imperative that our Govern-
ment insist upon our allies sharing with 
us the solution of this problem. 
LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
THE LAST 91/2 MONTHS 
(Mr. GILLIGAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GILLIGAN. Mr. Speaker, at the 
close of this historic 1st session of the 
89th Congress, most of the Nation's 
newspapers, magazines and journals 
have exhausted their glossaries of ad-
jectives in describing the legislative 
achievements of the past 91/2 months. 
"Hard working," "productive," "ener-
getic," "imaginative," "precedent-shat-
tering" are some of the terms used by 
the most respected and influential jour-
nals of the day in describing the 89th 
Congress, and although probably no sin-
gle Member of the House is completely 
satisfied with everything that has been 
done in this Chamber since January, 
surely the overwhelming majority of the 
Members must be highly gratified at the 
manner in which the House and its great 
committees have handled this torrent of 
legislation. Surely it must be acknowl-
edged that the House has worked its will 
on these great programs, and that the 
actions of the Congress have reflected 
quite accurately the judgment and deci-
sion of the American people at the polls 
last November. 
The discussion and debate about this 
great legislative program?begun in the 
committees and in the well of the House?
will and should continue in the months 
and years ahead in all sections of the 
land. But if we are to maintain our 
traditions as a representative democ-
racy, and if we are to continue to give 
an example to the other nations of the 
world?and especially the newly emerg-
ing nations who are tentatively groping 
their way towaftl responsible self-gov-
ernment?it is essential that the con-
tinuing political dialogue in America be 
conducted in a manner befitting a proud 
and free people, who have a great tra-
dition of responsible self-government to 
defend and build upon. The manner in 
which we debate the course our Gov-
ernment should take in the months and 
years ahead is of paramount impor-
tance; reasoned discussion, buttressed 
by the careful analysis of the facts, is 
the minimal standard the American peo-
ple should require in the debate of pub-
lic issues. Certainly, loose talk, appeals 
to prejudice, inflammatory statements, 
scurrility, the resort to epithets, which, 
while distasteful, might have been tol-
erable in an earlier age, can no longer 
be acceptable in the public arena. All 
of the verbal paraphenalia of the hate 
groups and the extremists of every de-
scription must be resolutely shunned if 
our citizens are to have the opportunity 
to understand the problems which beset 
our society, and be enabled to make a 
reasoned and reasonable choice of solu-
tions. 
As an example of the kind of discus-
sion of public affairs which contributes 
very little to the understanding of the 
issues and problems which confront the 
American people, I would like to quote 
from an article which was published in 
the Cincinnati Post and Times-Star on 
October 19, 1965: 
Former Ohio Congressman Robert Taft, Jr., 
believes a major issue of the 1968 congres-
sional campaign should be the abdication 
of its responsibility by the present "rub-
berstamp Congress." 
In a talk before the Republican Forum in 
Denver, Colo., last night, Taft charged the 
present Congress has meekly surrendered the 
rights and duties of the legislative branch 
to the executive. 
Congress has passed administration bills 
with little or no debate, Taft said, and has 
provided no effective examination or dissent 
of programs. 
"At times the conduct of the present ma-
jority in Congress seems more in the 'tradi-
tion of Hitler's Reichstag than the long rec-
ord of independence we have had on Capitol 
Hill," Taft said. 
My distinguished colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle can, I am sure, decide 
for themselves how appropriate, and how

PERSECUTION OF JEWS IN SOVIET 
RUSSIA 
Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. 
President, I wish to express my support 
of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 17, 
as previously passed b ythe U.S. Senate, 
which is now awaiting concurrence by 
the Senate with House amendments. 
This resolution, expressing the sense of 
the Congress in condemnation of the per-
secution of Jewish citizens by the 
U.S.S.R., is a measure of the indignation 
aroused in many areas of the world by 
the discriminatory treatment being ac-
corded its Jewish minority by the Soviet 
Government. 
By focusing the attention of the world 
on the restrictive treatment accorded to 
Russian Jewry, there may be some hope 
of greater relaxation of the rigid regula-
tions on the religious practices of that 
faith and other faiths. 
It is not surprising to me when the 
U.S.S.R., as a basically atheistic nation, 
acts to repress those who profess reli-
gious beliefs. I can but hope that the 
Soviet Government, in an effort to en-
hance its public image abroad, may make 
it easier for Jewish citizens and others 
to practice their respective faiths. Actu-
ally, I am told that action in recent times 
to permit the printing of approximately 
10,000 Yiddish prayerbooks represented 
some concession, although, admittedly, a 
small one in view of the approximately 
21/2 million Jews in Soviet Russia. I am 
also informed that representatives of the 
Yiddish theater groups have been per-
mitted some travel among parts of the 
Soviet Union. Unfortunately, all church 
groups are heavily restricted in Russia, 
although, perhaps, the Russian Ortho-
dox Church fares better than others as 
it does have an organization in Russia. 
Visitors to that country report that 
while the synagogues are poor in appear-
ance, the Baptist Church also is in poor 
condition. 
Again, I wish to associate myself with 
the pending resolution condemning the 
persecution of persons by Soviet Russia 
because of their religion. I am proud to 
have served as one of its cosponsors. 
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, the 
Attorney General of the United States, 
Nicholas Katzenbach, has won the re-
spect and admiration of a great many 
people both in and out of Washington. 
His efforts on behalf of the Voting Rights 
Act passed this year, as well as other ac-
tions on behalf of justice for all our 
citizens, have won acclaim from leaders 
in the race relations field across the 
Nation. We are fortunate to have such 
a competent man of convictions and 
skills as head of the Justice Depart-
ment. 
A recent issue of the Indianapolis Star 
presented a profile view of Mr. Katzen-
bach in an appraisal written by Joseph 
E. Mohbat, of the Associated Press. I 
ask unanimous consent that this article, 
subtitled "The President's Lawyer," be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER?NICK KATZENBACH 
OUTLINES HIS FOUR MAIN GOALS 
(By Joseph E. Mohbat) 
WAsims-croN.?One of the newest weekend 
visitors to President Johnson's retreat at 
Camp David, Md., is a bald-psted, tall, some-
what dishevelled man who?according to 
Washington gossip?wasn't supposed to last 
long enough to get his name on the big 
office door in the Department of Justice. 
Nicholas deBelleville Katzenbach, the 65th 
Attorney General of the United States, has 
by all signs won the esteem 'of the Chief 
Executive. 
The President, according to some, looks 
upon the 43-year-old lawyer as one of the 
brainiest men in government today. ? 
Yet, for 5 months Nicholas Katzenbach 
cooled his heels, holding the title of Deputy 
Attorney General and hearing the stories that 
Lyndon Baines Johnson would most cer-
tainly bring in another man to replace 
ROBERT F. KENNEDY. KENNEDY was leaving 
last year to run for the Senate from New 
York, and the notion was that Mr. Johnson 
felt Katzenbach was too closely identified 
with Kennedy. 
But in January Katzenbach got the word. 
He was going to be Attorney General. As 
such, he became a member of the Cabinet, 
"the President's lawyer" so to speak, and 
head of the Department of Justice. The De-
partment, with 30,000 employees, runs such 
wide-ranging affairs as the FBI, the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service, antitrust 
prosecutions, enforcement of civil rights 
legislation, the Bureau of Prisons, and the 
U.S. marshals. 
What does Katzenbach have to say about 
his job? What are his goald as the Nation's 
highest law officer? 
"It's hard to talk about it generally," he 
says, "except for my obvious feeling that 
it's terribly important to achieve an even-
handed administration of justice, and that it 
be done entirely on merits. 
"I guess there are four things I'd really 
like to accomplish, if I have enough days, 
months, or years allotted to me here: 
"I think our fiscal and administrative sys-
tem in the Department is outmoded, and 
I'd like to do something like Secretary Mc-
Namara did over at Defense. I'd like to 
know how much it costs us to administer 
Justice, and thus I'd know a lot more about 
my Department. I'd like to know, for in-
stance, to what extent we could use com-
puters on the. Immigration Service or the 
FBI. 
"I'd like to come as near as possible to 
clearing up civil rights problems enough so 
that you almost wouldn't need a civil rights 
division in this Department to insure that 
Constitutional guarantees are being en-
forced. This would be best for the country, 
certainly, 
"It would be hard to find anything more 
Important than the job to be done on the 
crime front. (Katzenbach heads the newly 
formed National Crime Commission.) We're 
going to step up the drive against organized 
crime. I want to see what we can do with 
crime in the streets. 
"And I'd like to see whether we can come 
up with a good, rational, coherent, effective, 
and understandable antitrust policy. Per-
haps we simply haven't articulated it well 
enough in the past. But I think the in-
fluence of our antitrust division should go 
far beyond actual cases; it should influence 
and reflect the economic policies of the Gov-
ernment." 
The President's lawyer pauses a moment, 
then says: 
"I don't know?perhaps I've bitten off 
more than I can chew. But I'd sure like to 
try it." 
As a public official, Katzenbach is ad-
mired by his supporters for two main rea-
sons: his gift as a conciliator, and his will-
. _

September 22, 1965 CONGRESSIUN coRD ? SE.NA:1 E --?3905 
hearings on S. 597 showed the plight 
of our health science libraries. The 
American Medical Association presented 
the findings of a 1964 study that showed: 
Only 15 of the 87 medical school 
librarie,s,have sufficient space; 
More than one-half of the medical 
school libraries were built prior to 1933; 
As long ago as 1957 more than one-
half of the medical school libraries were 
filled to capacity or had exceeded their 
capacity; 
Only 14 of 87 existing medical schools 
have the recommended level of 100,000 
volumes on their library shelves; and 
There are 6,000 health science libraries 
but only 3,000 librarians with specialized 
training or experience in the health sci-
ence library field. 
The rapid rate at which we are ac-
cumulating new medical knowledge 
makes it imperative that we take action 
now to strengthen and expand our health 
science libraries. 
CONSTRUCTION 
S. 597 would authorize an aggregate 
of $50 million over a 4-year period, 1967-
70, for grants to nonprofit institutions 
to pay up to 75 percent of the costs of 
constructing health science library facil-
ities. 
'TRAIN/NG, RESEARCF/, BASIC RESOURCES 
The legislation would also authorize 
appropiations of $45 million for the 5 
years 1966-70 to finance first, training of 
health science library personnel; second, 
assistance to special scientific projects 
dealing with advancements in the sci-
ences related to health; third, research 
and development in health library sci-
ence; fourth, improvement of basic 
library resources; and fifth, temporary 
support for scientific publications. 
REGIONAL HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIES 
To supplement health science library 
services, the bill authorizes appropria-
tions of $22.5 million over the fiscal 
years 1966-70 to establish and maintain 
regional health science libraries. The 
need for regional service has become 
acute with the groVith in he size of the 
medical literature. It is neither eco-
nomically feasible nor necessary for each 
medical library to try to build its col-
lection to encompass even a sizable part 
of the whole of medical literature. 
In total S. 597 authorizes appropria-
tions amounting to $117.5 million over 
the 5 years 1966-70. The legislation is 
supported by the Medical Library As-
sociation, the Association of Research 
Libraries, the Special Libraries Asso-
ciation, the Chairman of the Board of 
Regents of the National Library of Medi-
cine, the Association of American Medi-
cal Colleges, the American College of 
Physicians,. the American Heart Asso-
ciation, the American Medical Associa-
tion, the American Dental Association, 
and the Medical Library Center of New 
York. Many other associations, uni-
versities, colleges, and individuals con-
tacted the committee in writing to ex-
press their support for S. 597. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, Will 
the Senator from Alabama yield? 
Mr. HILL. I yield. 
Mr. DOMINICK. I am happy to join 
No. 175-19 
the Senator frOm Alabama, who has 
done such great work in this field. As 
the Senator knows, I have been active in 
title II of the Higher Education Act, try-
ing to do something in connection with 
library facilities. This is another step 
in the same area, which I congratulate 
the Senator on accomplishing. 
I raised one question prior to this time, 
which is a fundamental principle, so far 
as I am concerned, whether we had a 
limiting authorization for each year, or 
whether the authorization was open 
ended. My understanding is that the 
committee changed it so that it is a lim-
iting authorization; Is that not correct? 
Mr. HILL. The Senator is correct. 
Mr. DOMINICK. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. HILL. Let me take this opportu-
nity to express my appreciation to the 
Senator from Colorado for the fine help 
which he gave in having the bill acted 
upon by the committee. 
Mr. DOMINICK. I am happy to have 
been able to cooperate. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Alabama yield? 
Mr. HILL. I am happy to yield to the 
Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MORSE. I wish to express my 
congratulations and compliments to the 
Senator from Alabama [Mr. HILL] for 
his leadership in carrying through the 
present bill before the Senate to the point 
of passage, which is about to take place. 
As the Senator from Alabama knows, 
we on the Committee on Labor and Pub-
lic Welfare, which has jurisdiction over 
all education legislation, are very much 
concerned with the problem which con-
fronts us in connection with the libraries 
of the United States. 
There are various educational insti-
tutions, as the Senator from Colorado 
has just pointed out, in the higher edu-
cation bill, S. 600?in regard to which we 
go to conference with the House tomor-
row?which has a title devoted to the 
question of providing Federal assistance 
to institutions of higher learning in this 
country, in an endeavor to raise library 
standards and to provide more adequate 
facilities for the students of the country. 
One of the features of that kind of bill 
Is a provision that will be of assistance 
to the Library of Congress, providing 
funds and facilities so that the Library 
of Congress can be of assistance to the 
college libraries of the country?public 
libraries also for that matter?in help-
ing them to improve their library 
services. 
The need, however, for assistance to 
medical libraries is just as great, and it 
falls under the jurisdiction of the sub-
committee of the Senate committee, over 
which the chairman of the full com-
mittee also serves as chairman of th 
subcommittee. 
The bill the Senate is considerin 
stands in the same class, in my opinion, 
with the title of the higher education 
bill which provides similar assistance to 
the libraries of the country. I am very 
glad that the Senator has been persist-
ent in regard to this matter. 
Let me say to the medical profession 
that this is another example of Federal 
aid which the medical profession has re-
ceived from the taxpayers of the country 
for decades. This is another example 
that proves the position I have taken 
over many years, when I have listened 
to doctors opposing medical care legisla-
tion, that their memories are short, that 
the assistance and aid which the Fed-
eral Government has given them over 
the years, in payment of part of their 
medical expenses, and providing the 
laboratories and facilities so that they 
could become doctors, puts them, in my 
judgment, in an untenable position 
when Congress seeks to come to the 
health assistance of the needy and aged 
of this country with a medical care bill. 
Be that as it may, I wish the doctors 
of this country to know that once again 
I can be counted upon to come to their 
assistance in seeing to it that facilities 
are provided so that we can continue to 
train the best doctors in the world. I 
say that because American doctors are 
the best doctors in the world. The 
trouble is that a great many of them 
lack a social conscience. 
Mr. HILL. Let me say to the Senator 
from Oregon that he has rendered a 
great service in behalf of having the 
committee report the bill favorably to 
the Senate. He is here now to vote for 
passage of the bill. He has rendered out-
standing service in the passage of the 
higher education bill, which does so much 
for libraries generally throughout the 
country, and which will be of vast sig-
nificance and great help to these libraries. 
I express my appreciation to him for 
what he has done to help in the passage 
of the pending bill, and also for the great 
work he did in passage of the higher edu-
cation bill, which will do so much for 
libraries generally. 
Mr. MORSE. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the committee 
amendments be agreed to en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OleriCER. Without 
objection, the committee amendments 
will be considered en bloc; and, without 
objection, they are agreed to. 
The billwas ordered to be engrossed for 
a third reading, read the third time, and 
passed. 
The title was amended, so as to read: 
"An Act to amend the Public Health 
Service Act to provide for a program of 
grants to assist in meeting the need for 
adequate health science library services 
and facilities." 
Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I move that 
the vote by which the bill was passed 
be reconsidered. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I move 
that the mo ion to reconsider be laid on 
the b 
otion to lay on the table was

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN W. WYDLER 
OF NEW yoax 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 24, 1965 
Mr. WYDLER. Mr. Speaker, recently 
our Nation has been flooded by bio-
graphical sketches of the late Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy. Included in 
these biographies are the authors' re-
spective versions of the late President's 
Intimate musings, deliberations, reason-
ing, and conclusions over the episode of 
the Bay of Pigs These biographies refer 
to formerPresident Eisenhower's role 
during his administration in events lead-
ing up to the Bay of Pigs denouement. 
With these words, the editor and pub-
lisher of Newsday, Harry F. Guggen-
heim, introduced a truly remarkable 
Interview- with President Eisenhower an 
the part he played long before the 
tragedy of the Bay of Pigs. 
President Eisenhower, in the interest 
of historic accuracy, has given the public 
facts about these earlier events. At a 
recent meeting at Gettysburg with Mt. 
Guggenheim and Mr. Earl Mazo, Presi-
dent Eisenhower gave his account of the 
situation as it existed when he left the 
White House. I consider this a truly 
remarkable document and one which 
will set the record straight on this most 
important event on the history of our 
Nation. 
The intervir follows: 
IKE SPEAKS OUT : BAY OF PIGS WAS ALL 
(By Earl Mazo) _ 
After our country's humiliation at the Bay 
of Pigs in 1961, Republican ex-President 
Eisenhower's only comment was to call for 
bipartisan unity behind Democratic Presi-
dent Kennedy. That was in keeping with 
Eisenhower's lifelong practice of supporting 
the Nation's Commander in Chief in times 
of crises. 
Over the years General Eisenhower has 
demonstrated little taste for political parti-
sanship and absolutely none for partisan 
excesses. In fact, he usually has ignored 
politically tinged distortions on his per-
formance as President, military leader, and 
elder statesman. 
Now, however, he feels it would be well to 
set therecord straight on at least a couple of 
items in recent intimate histories of the Ken-
nedy administration, by Arthur M. Schle-
singer, Jr., and Theodore C. Sorenson, rank-
ing members of Kennedy's staff. The gen-
eral and several of his knowledgeable former 
Government associates view the Schlesinger 
and Sorenson attempts to link the Eisen-
hower administration with the Cuba invasion 
fiasco and discredit EisenhoWer-appointed 
military and intelligence experts as a per-
version of history and a disservice to the late 
President Kennedy, who never sought to 
duck responsliblity for his executive 
decisions. 
The specifically disputed material by both 
riters is summed up in this paragraph from 
he Sorenson version: "On January 20, 1961, 
John Kennedy inherited the plan, the plan-
ners, and most troubling of all, the Cuban 
exile brigade. * * * Unlike an inherited 
policy statement or Executive order, this in-
heritanee could not be simply disposed of by 
Presidential recision or withdrawal." 
Eisenhower declares, "There was no tactical 
or operational plan even discussed" as of the 
day he turned the Presidency over to John 
Kennedy. During the transition period be-
tween the election in November 1960, and 
the inauguration in January 1961, Eisen-
hower reviewed for his successor all pending 
matters, including a secret program inaug-
urated less than a year before to equip and 
train anti-Castro Cuban refugees. The retir-
ing President stressed that there had been no 
decisions as to how the Cuban forces would 
be used, if at all. Eisenhower had made no 
commitments that might bind the new 
President in dealing with the Castro prob-
lem. In fact, the armed refugee group was 
still so small and relatively unprepared that 
it could easily have been disbanded if the 
incoming administration considered its 
existence unnecessary. 
As for the nonpolitical experts Kennedy 
chose to retain for his administration?
notably Allen Dulles, Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, and the military Joint 
Chiefs of Staff?Eisenhower says: "These 
men over decades of devoted service have 
shown their capabilities, their sense of logic, 
their understanding of the problems involved 
In this kind of venture. There is no more 
expert group in their profession than these 
men * * * I had the greatest confidence in 
them." 
Nothing the former President was told 
Kdnnedy and others after the Bay-of-
Pigs debacle diminished his faith and con-
fidence in Dulles and the military chiefs. On 
the other hand, he believes the very dis-
paragement of these seasoned professionals 
shows how unqualified the former Pres-
idential assistants were to deal with the sort 
of problem involved in a critical interna-
tional venture like the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
Like most Americans, President Eisen-
hower welcomed the end of the Batista dic-
tatorship in 1959 and hoped the new regime 
of Fidel Castro would live up to its promises 
of free elections and democracy in the exotic 
island republic just 8 jet minutes from 
Florida. Within a year, however, Castro 
created a dictatorship that was worse even 
than l3atista's and President Eisenhower had 
concluded that strong measures might be 
required to thwart what appeared to be 
Castro's intention of establishing an out-
post for Communist subversion in the West-
ern Hemisphere. 
Exactly what would have to be done?and 
when?remained to be thought out and 
decided. But the gravity of the situation 
neither awed nor frightened those facing it. 
Eisenhower and his administration's military 
and intelligence experts were not strangers to 
the nuances of contending with Communist 
intrusion in Latin America. Ex-Dictator 
Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, whose efforts to 
make Guatemala a haven for the Soviets led 
to his downfall in 1964, would bear witness 
to that. 
In mid-March 1960, President Eisenhower 
decided that the United States would se-
cretly aid anti-Castro Cubans. The CIA was 
directed to train and equip volunteers at 
bases in Guatemala, Panama, and southern 
Florida. The covert military instruction 
program was started partly in response to 
pleas by hundreds of refugees for something 
constructive to do. It was felt training 
would bolster the spirts of thousands who 
A5435 
were fleeing the Castro dictatorship, and 
would give them hope that, in time, they 
would be able to do the job of ousting the 
Communist regime. 
In essence, the long-range Eisenhower pol-
icy was to encourage and prepare Cubans to 
liberate their country. President Eisenhower 
kept in close- touch with developments 
through the summer and autumn, and per-
sonally reviewed numerous ideas and sug-
gestions that normally would have been 
sifted out before reaching the White House. 
(For example, he rejected a proposal that the 
Cubans be trained in Samoa to insure tighter 
security than was possible in Central Amer-
ica.) 
In recalling that period, the general notes 
the Bay of Pigs was never mentioned or con-
sidered in discussions of possible alternatives 
and contingencies. Most attention focused 
on prospects for an operation of some sort 
In or near the Escambray Mountains where 
a government in exile might establish itself 
on Cuban soil. 
Before there could be serious planning, 
however, the Cubans needed not only a well-
supplied fighting force but also the leader-
ship to organize a functioning government in 
exile. The leader or leaders had to be recog-
nized and accepted by the Cuban people. 
That eliminated experienced individuals 
from the Batista regime and several leaders 
of peppery political factions who bristled at 
the thought of cooperating or sharing the 
glory of overthrowing Castro. 
The Cubans were still without their own 
leadership when President Eisenhower re-
tired and President Kennedy was inaugu-
rated as America's Commander in Chief. In 
Washington, the changeover of Executive 
command, with Democrats replacing Repub-
licans in nearly every key position through-
out the Government, was the smoothest in 
modern times. The harmonious transition 
was directed by the President and President-
elect. 
The departing administration could not 
avoid bequeathing certain critical problems 
to its successor. But efforts were made to 
lighten burdens, where possible. There was, 
for instance, the last minute Eisenhower di-
rective ordering thousands of dependents of 
overseas service personnel returned to the 
United States. A review of the international 
trade and monetary: situation convinced 
Eisenhower that America's worsening bal-
ance-of-payments position would require 
drastic action sooner or later. Since the 
everyday spending of service families added 
up to an enormous annual dollar drain, the 
recall of dependents was among priority 
measures Treasury officials expected the Ken-
nedy administration to consider. By issu-
ing the recall directive himself, Eisenhower 
took the onus for that unpopular action, and 
spared the new President. 
The balance-of-payments situation was one 
of three major unresolved problems Eisen-
hower reviewed at length for Kennedy at 
transition sessions. The Communist threat 
in Laos and Castro's Cuba were the others. 
"I told him exactly what we had been doing 
(in the Cuban refugee program)," recalls 
Eisenhower, "and pinpointed the centers at 
which apprOximately 500 men were then 
being trained." 
Eisenhower felt that Kennedy shared his 
judgment that the new administration need 
not rush a decision regarding the Cubans. 
"At no time did I put before anybody any-
thing that could be called a plan (to invade 
Cuba)," declares the former President. He 
emphasizes that there was "no mandate, no 
commitment by me or anyone in my admin-
istration," and he doubts that Kennedy felt 
"he was frozen to any position by me." 
Among Eisenhower's last, words to Ken-
nedy before the ceremonial ride up Pennsyl-
vania Avenue to the inauguration was: "You

people will have to decide what to do." The 
two men did not speak with each other again 
for 3 months. Then, after the Bay of Pigs 
disaster, Kennedy hurriedly invited the gen-
eral to Camp David and sent a White House 
helicopter to Gettysburg for him. 
Kennedy stated he sought the visit to 
"bring (Eisenhower) up to date on recent 
events and get the benefit of his thoughts 
and experience." The President met the for-
mer President at the landing pad. It was 
April 22. (The Bay of Pigs invasion had be-
gun on April 17, and within a day or two 
Castro had wiped it out.) Eisenhower re-
calls that Kennedy seemed quite composed, 
but eager to talk out his young administra-
tion's humiliating experience. 
It was a long and wide-ranging conversa-
tion. Like many military figures who had no 
inside information as to what happened, the 
general wondered whether the intasion really 
had been launched, as reported, without air 
cover and other elementary ingredients fami-
liar even to junior officers, like plans for rein-
forcing and resupplying the beachhead. 
? At one point Eisenhower asked his host if 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff had approved the 
battle plan. Kennedy nodded and said, 
"with a few changes." Among other things, 
Kennedy explained, the original plan had 
been trimmed to avoid letting the world see 
"America's hand" in the operation. Eisen-
hower suggested that the country's prestige 
and power should never by committed un-
less its Chief Executive was determined to 
win. "There is no alternative," said the 
general. "Force is a naked, brutal thing in 
this world. If you are going to use it, you 
have got to be prepared to go all the way." 
That afternoon Eisenhower stated at a 
news conference that all Americans should 
"support the man who has to carry the re-
sponsibility for our foreign affairs"?mean-
ing, President Kennedy. Subsequently, the 
former Republican President publicly reaf-
firmed his backing of the Democratic Presi-
dent at every opportunity, including Repub-
lican political gatherings, until the crisis 
? 
atmosphere abated. 
While reflecting recently on the blunders 
that insured defeat at the Bay of Pigs?and 
thus entrenching, instead of overthrowing 
the Castro dictatorship?Eisenhower was re-
minded that Guatemala probably still would 
be a Communist strfarighold if political 
advice had prevailed during a crucial stage 
of the anti-Arbenz venture in 1954, as hap-
pened during the anti-Castro venture in 
1961. 
The invasion of Guatemala, which was led 
and conducted by Guatemalan volunteers 
but covertly sponsored and supplied by the 
United States, floundered just as it was on 
the brink of success. The crisis stemmed 
from sudden lack of air support. Two of the 
liberating force's three aircraft had been 
destroyed, and without replacements the in-
vasion would be doomed. 
In Washington, President Eisenhower 
summoned military, intelligence and diplo-
matic experts. A State Department spokes-
man argued for a political, not a military 
decision. He contended that by sending 
replacement aircraft to Guaten;a1a, America 
would risk having its role in the anti-Arbenz 
venture discovered, and that, in turn, would 
damage our prestige throughout ,Latin 
America. 
Allen Dulles, the intelligence director 
whose agency was masterminding the in-
vasion, argued that the airplanes were essen-
tial to success?and therefore should be sent. 
President Eisenhower agreed with Dulles. 
And a couple of days later the Communist 
regime in Guatemala was overthrown. 
Eisenhower's reasoning in that crisis was con-
sistent with the adviCe he offered President 
Kennedy 9 years later. "If our hand had 
been discovered, then it was more Important 
than ever that we win," he said. 
U.S. Office of Education: A Growing 
Federal Bureaucratic Octopus 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HAROLD R. COLLIER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 1965 
Mr. COLLIER. Mr. Speaker, under 
leave to extend my remards in the 
RECORD, I include the following two edi-
torials from the Chicago Tribune which 
should be a source of deep concern to 
the legislators of this country, as well as 
to every citizen and school board member 
In the United States: 
[From the Chicago (Ill.) Tribune, Sept. 22, 
1965] 
FEDERAL TENTACLES /N THE SCHOOLS 
Representative ROBERT H. MicNKL, of Illi-
nois, has 'come upon a secret memorandum 
which he says is proof that the Federal Gov-
ernment "is insidiously planning a complete 
takeover" of our public school systems. 
The memo contains the minutes of a recent 
meeting of the Office of Education and deals 
with the agency's "future role and responsi-
bilities" in relation to State and local agen-
cies. It states that "no Office of Education 
hand is to be tied down by (1) having to deal 
only through a backward State education 
agency, or (2) not being able to deal directly 
with urban jurisdictions, however competent 
the State agency, when direct relationships 
seem most in the public interest." 
The Illinois Republican has run into a 
curtain of silent in his efforts to find out 
why the Office of Education is so eager to 
bypass "backward" (meaning, no doubt, un-
cooperative) State agencies. If its motives 
are innocent and are consistent with the 
Government's repeated assurances that Fed-
eral aid will not mean Federal control of 
education, then why the secrecy? 
Mr. MICHEL thinks that there is "some-
thing to hide," and with good reason. The 
Office of Education's hand has already begun 
to wander into affairs not properly its own. 
Two out of every five high school physics 
students, Mr. MICHEL says, are using text-
books prepared under Federal auspices. 
Federalization is even spreading to the hu-
raan.ities. One Office of Education official 
has talked of designing "the total English 
curriculum from kindergarten through col-
lege years." 
Beyond this, the Office of Education has 
ordered hearings to determine whether Fed-
eral funds should be denied to school districts 
in six Southern States which are accused of 
fail to desegregate. The Supreme Court has 
ruled that the diberate segregation is a mat-
ter for Federal concern; but is the Office of 
Education, which is supposedly dedicated to 
improving education, the proper agency to 
carry out social reforms which are often likely 
to detract from the quality of education? 
The Office of Education has been nagging at 
Chicago's school officials?not for failing to 
desegregate, but apparently for failing to 
bring about forced integration, which is not 
a matter for Federal concern at all and is 
bound to interfere with the quality of edu-
cation. 
In short, the evidence is all too clear that 
the Federal Government intends to use Fed-
eral aid as a means of exerting control over 
State and local school affairs and that the 
Office of Education's interests will not even 
be confined to academic matters. 
A wise Supreme Court ruled in 1936 that 
"the power to confer or withhold unlimited 
benefits is the power to coerce or destroy." A 
more subservient and less wise Supreme 
Court ruled 6 years later that it is wholly 
proper "for the Government to regulate that 
which it subsidizes." Once the subsidies 
start, control is sure to follow?despite all 
protestations to the contrary. We said so 
from the beginning,, but the control has 
come even faster than we thought. 
[From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 24, 1865] 
SCHOOL BRAINWASHING 
"Just who's writing those classroom 
tests?" asks the Republican congressional 
committee newsletter, with reference to 
some items in nationally used intelligence 
tests and current events periodicals. The 
newsletter cites 'a series of objective test 
Items in which the answers offered convey 
explicitly or implicitly partisan conclusions. 
This can be done in both of two ways. 
Answers which only a blindly proadminis-
tration Democrat could accept as statements 
of fact are called correct. (Example: "The 
President's Great Society is a place where 
America is growing richer, stronger, happier, 
and wiser." True or false? Approved 
answer: True.) 
Replies which testmakers concede to be 
false present a disparaging but presumably 
plausible image of Republicans, one which 
will influence many youngsters who will 
never come back to the item to consider 
which responses are wrong and why. (Ex-
ample: "A club that accepts only very rich 
members is said to be (a) snobbish, (b) ex-
clusive, (c) conservative, (d) Republican, 
(e) un-American." Approved answer: "Ex-
clusive," but meanwhile "Republican" has 
been associated with such negative terms as 
"snobbish" and "un-American.") 
Nationally published objective tests are 
extremely popular with school authorities 
for a number of reasons. They are inexpen-
sive, require no local effort in preparation, 
and no thought in grading. Also, they save 
time. But they are easy to manipulate in 
such partisan ways as the Republican news-
letter rightly decries. And they are in-
herently too oversimplified for the complex-
ities and ambiguities of judgments in the 
social studies. An instrument that may 
work well in arithmetic does not necessarily, 
work well in political science. 
However, objective tests will be used, 
and they will be less than thoroughly objec-, 
tive. If they are to be loaded to a minimum 
extent, publishers should insist (as obviously 
they are not always doing) on having repre-
sentatives of differing views examine politi-
cally significant items. If a reasonable man 
of strong views protests an item as unfair to 
his party or his principles, perhaps that item 
should not be put before children to be 
rated as right or wrong, true or false. 
As educators generally want Federal hand-
outs that Republicans for the most part 
oppose, any bias in school tests is likely to 
be against Republicans rather than for them. 
-Republicans especially have reason to be 
vigilant against the intrusion into the 
schools of whitewash and smear. And edu-
cators who care about truth will do well to 
minimize their reliance on devices that in-
vite oversimplification.

Anarchy?A Major Threat Today 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. SAMUEL L. DEVINE 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22,1965 
Mr. DEVINE. Mr. Speaker, Albert 
Schlossberg, National Editor of the Jew-
ish Veteran, in an editorial in the Sep-
tember 1965 issue gave a well-reasoned 
analysis of the law and order issue 
facing this Nation today. 
With the automatic cry of police 
brutality being used by many lawless 
elements to cover their activities, arti-
cles such as written by Mr. Schlossberg 
are most welcome. 
The article follows: 
ANAacny?A MAJ"OR THREAT TODAY? 
(By Albert Schlossberg) 
America has been especially blessed, for 
the framers of the Constitution saw to it 
that we would have a strong framework of 
rules and regulations to bind us together as 
an intelligent society. Deep-rooted In that 
Constitution has been an ever-present, firm 
respect for law and order. 
Of late I have heard murmurs, from many 
sources, that perhaps this traditional Amer-
ican philosophy is outmoded. Manifesta-
tions of the conundrum have cropped up in 
scattered sections of the United States, and 
In some quarters we have heard "We'll only 
obey the laws that we agree with." 
Is this the first chink in the dike that 
has kept America immune from any threat 
of anarchy? Let's explore the issue, with-
out taking sides and see where our investi-
gation leads us. 
From a neutral vantage point I'd like to 
examine one facet of our society that seems 
to be in danger of an imminent breakdown, 
the relationship of the citizen, you and me, 
to the people charged with the duty to pro-
tect us, the police departments, local and 
State. The catalyst in this instance seems 
to be a catch-phrase, often loosely used, "po-
lice brutality." 
Well, what about "police brutality"? 
What happens in your mind when you hear 
those two words? Do you think of Hitler's 
storm troopers? Stalin's 0.0.P.U. or Bull 
Connor's "special deputies"? 
When is a police officer "brutal"? Just 
how far can the representative of the law 
go in the pursuit of his duties? The train-
ing manuals of almost all police departments 
in the United States contain instruction in-
dicating that the officers are authorize to use 
"reasonably necessary" force when intactng 
an arrest. The policeman is warned that it 
is not his duty to "punish" a suspect by us-
ing unnecessary force. It is made clear to 
the law enforcement personnel that under 
the American system a suspect 113 consid-
ered innocent until proven guilty to the sat-
isfaction of a judge or jury. 
Perhaps you saw the same TV news broad-
cast that I did the other evening. A re-
porter was interviewing a young man who 
had been injured while participating in a 
demonstration in a northern city. The 
young man explained how he had been in-
jured, and then concluded by stating, in 
response to a query, that the participants 
in the demonstration had been "instructed 
to chant 'police brutality' if a police officer 
attempted to place them in custody." 
Let's not delude ourselves; of course, if 
we examine the record we will find that 
among the nearly 200,000 policemen in the 
United States there certainly are some who 
are brutal and we will also find, it seems to 
me, a sadist or two who get their kicks out 
of beating up on a prisoner. However, you 
will also find many dedicated individuals 
doing an often thankless job that you or I 
would refuse to accept. By and large the 
cop on the beat or in the patrol Car is no 
different from a cross section of any profes-
sion, or selected group in our modern-day 
society?some good, some bad, some medi-
ocre, and mostly average citizens. 
The policeman's lot is not an easy one. 
In the United States, in 1964, 18,000 police-
men were assaulted in line of duty. Of the 
18,000, 57 were murdered and nearly 8,000 
received serious injuries. 
Several communities seem to be on the 
right track in their search for an answer 
to the charge of police brutality. Philadel-
phia, Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, 
and Washington, D.C., to name a few, have 
standard procedures set up to handle in-
vestigation of any charges of brutality that 
may be made against the members of their 
departments. Philadelphia has adopted a 
policy of an "all civilian" review board, while 
others believe that the beat approach to the 
problem is through an "all police" board or 
a combination of the two, a "civilian-police" 
committee. Each of the plans has some 
merit, and as a result of their diligent 
search for the right way progress is being 
made. 
Washington, D.C., has a method of han-
dling complaints of police brutality that, 
at this distance, looks pretty good. In the 
vernacular, it is "put up or shut up." Trans-
lated into more acceptable language it sim-
ply means that if you have a legitimate com-
plaint against a police officer and wish to 
press the charge you must file a sworn affi-
davit. In 1964, as a result of this policy, 
11 complaints were filed with the review 
board. Of the 11 officers charged, the com-
plaint against 2 was dropped before it reached 
the board, 2 policemen were found innocent 
and 7 were found guilty. No whitewash 
there, according to those statistics, at least. 
Until the millenium is reached and the 
world becomes completely civilized we need 
police to protect us from ourselves, and 
from each other. It is a thankless, nasty 
job at best, usually underpaid and often 
maligned by disgruntled citizens who have 
a personal "beef" against an individual 
officer. 
Under conditions such as these, the police 
deserve all of the support that we can give 
them. We must recognize their shortcom-
ings, hold them responsible for their actions, 
but make them aware of the fact that we, 
the civilians, will guard their right to the 
same principle that we cherish, to be con-
sidered Innocent until proven guilty. 
Statement on Behalf of Bernard L. Boutin 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. J. OLIVA HUOT 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22,1965 
, Mr. HUOT. Mr. Speaker; 2 weeks ago 
President Johnson nominated Mr. Bern-
ard L. Boutin to become the Deputy Di-
rector of the Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity, an extremely important and 
sensitive post in the war on poverty. 
The strongest testimony to Mr. Boutin's 
qualifications is the fact that the Senate 
Labor and Public Welfare Committee did 
not require hearings before approving 
his nomination. For this reason, I was 
unable to testify on behalf of my long-
time friend. I therefore place in the 
RECORD, the statement I had prepared 
on his behalf: 
Mr. Chairman, my name is J. OLIVA HUOT, 
Congressman from the 1st Congressional 
District of New Hampshire. 
It is a distinct privilege and honor for 
me to appear before the Senate Labor and 
Public Welfare Committee in support of the 
nomination of my long-time friend, Bernard 
L. Boutin, as Deputy Director of the Office 
of Economic Opportunity. 
When I served on the school board in the 
city of Laconia, N.H., Bernard Boutin was 
the mayor. This gave me an excellent op-
portunity to observe closely the outstanding 
administrative ability and selfless devotion 
to public service that are the hallmarks of 
this man. 
From the mayor of Laconia, Bernard Bou-
tin was picked by the late President John F. 
Kennedy to become the Administrator of 
the General Services Administration. This 
was a remarkable jump?from mayor of a 
city of 15,000 to management of a billion-
dollar agency. Yet, I have heard nothing 
but praise and admiration for the job he 
did?both from those who served under -him 
and those who were affected by the activities 
of GSA. 
More recently, as executive vice president 
of the National Association of Home Build-
ers, his guidance and leadership significantly 
contributed to the passage of the housing 
bill of 1965 and the bill to establish the 
Department of Housing and Urban Affairs. 
Bernard Boutin is unquestionably qualified 
for this job. He is also unquestionably de-
voted to service of his country and par-
ticularly aware and sensitive to the acute 
human problems with which he will be 
dealing. 
The people of New Hampshire are justi-
fiably proud of Bernard Boutin. I am proud 
of him and I know that as Deputy Director 
of the Office of Economic Opportunity the 
entire country will be equally proud. 
I urge speedy confirmation of this out-
standing appointment.

Therefore, I am delighted to insert in 
the RECORD the following official state-
ment by Gov. John Dempsey: 
CONNECTICUT TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL 17, PRYOR, 
Samuel P. Pryor, Jr., of Greenwich, one of 
Connecticut's most distinguished citizens, is 
known throughout the world both for his 
prominence in the?aviation Industry and for 
great humanitarian service to' his fellowmen. 
Now that he is retiring after many years of 
outstanding service as an official of Pan 
American World Airways, it Is fitting that 
we accord due recognition to Sam Pryor and 
pay him the tribute he so justly deserves. 
Men and women in all walks of- life, in 
cities in virtually all the countries of the 
world, know Sam Pryor as a leading citizen of 
the State of Connecticut. 
In two wars in which our Natioi has been 
,involved, fighting for the preservation of our 
way of life and for the principles of freedom 
and justice, Sam Pryor has rendered con-
spicuous and highly important service. 
Beyond all this, moreover, Sam Pryor has 
been a real friend to countless numbers of 
people. Appeals for assistance in any cause 
benefiting mankind always have received 
from him a ready response. 
For all of these reasons, and because he 
Is a man In whom we of Connecticut take 
Much pride, we salute Samuel F. Pryor, Jr., 
both as a great citizen of our State and as a 
truly great American.

Evnaysorox uns CL,US 
(By Lucius Beebe) 
When the American scheme of things, al-
ready factually bankrupted by a long suc-
cession of giveaway administrations and now 
steering a collision course with absolute col-
lapse, achieves the end fOr which its poli-
ticians have headed it: a society of con-
sumers with no producers and no incentive 
to produce, the startling thing will, to the 
historical perception, be the equanimity and 
good cheer with which a once great people 
approached their own dissolution. 
Other ,civifizations jaa,ve gone down, most 
Of them fighting. But it took the Roman 
Empire a full thousand years to be liquidated 
and even the British, grapire, wantonly de-
stroyed within the memory of living genera-
tions, didn't liquidate itself without an argu-
ment. 
The United States is ?going down the drain 
of _history with complete equanimity and in 
a pletbora_of Idiot slogans. Some of them 
ikettia,so-c11g,. 
rights are so alaunclantly meaningless since 
the goals and aims they envisioned were 
already in universal practice and availability 
as to be merely patently spurious. But "the 
Great Seciety," which if it is only fraction-
ally achieved will spell the social and eco-, 
nOrnic engl of the United States as a COM.-
+ 
1 
ponent of organized world power, is fraught 
with persuasive mendacity. 
The basic philosophy of President John-
son's ideal is, of course, the purchase for 
material considerations of the perpetuity in 
office of the Democratic looters of the Amer-
ican economy. Its belief is that abundant 
and rich rewards of every sort, not merely 
the opportunity for their achievement, 
should be made available to absolutely 
everybody with no regard for his own invest-
ment of labor, intelligence or responsibility. 
In other words everybody is going to be 
a member of the country club set without 
the troublesome bother of lifting a finger 
to deserve it. This is what President John-
son means by the Great Society. Just who, 
in this benevolent scheme of immortality 
for the Democratic Party, is going to produce 
the material abundance on which the vision 
is predicated doesn't bother the Presidential 
mentality. A single monolithic electorate 
of 200 million voters all supporting the 
straight Democratic ticket on the basis of 
the cash favors of the administration is 
all that concerns the planners in Washing-
ton. paving already destroyed the value of 
money, they now propose the destruction of 
competition and a scheme of economic and 
social rewards that has hitherto been based 
on the individual investment of work and 
Intelligence. 
The peculiar ambivalence of the Presi-
dential aims is apparent when you consid-
er that, on the one hand the administration 
makes a valiant pretense of creating jobs 
for everybody while on the other hand prom-
ising that, job or no job, everybody is go-
ing to belong to the country club and have 
five cars in the garage. Why then a job 
at all? 
That the intelligence of the American 
people has been so eroded with soft lying 
and political blandishments as to seriously 
accept such a scheme of things as not only 
possible but actually desirable is not a flat-
tering commentary on the collective Ameri-
can mind. Most of us are available to flat-
tery and large numbers of people are avail-
able to systematic delusions and the grand 
scale Of mendacity made possible by con-
temporary government and communications, 
but to accept without batting an eye the 
proposition that the machinery of society is 
going to continue indefinitely with every-
body a consumer and nobody on the pro-
ducing end is not rational. 
In actual fact it contributes materially to 
the theory in some circles that entire nations 
can become mentally unbalanced, usually 
advanced to explain the conduct of Nazi 
Germany. 
Nothing in history suggests that some-
thing 'for nothing is a workable social or 
economic hypothesis. The erosion of com-
petition and destruction of a system of re-
wards is almost immediately fatal to the 
society that embraces such quackery. 
Even the Russians are daily becoming more 
aware of the circumstance, having learned it 
the hard way. For some decades Commu-
nist Russia tried living on slogans, even 
as President Johnson would have us all do. 
It was found not to be a satisfactory diet. 
Mapping the Ocean Floor 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HASTINGS KEITH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Mr. KEITH. Mr. Speaker, the fine 
public information offices?and the very 
talented people who work in them?am 
A5947 
one of the Navy's greatest assets. Navy 
information officers are dedicated men 
who work quietly, modestly, and effi-
ciently, making every effort to draw at-
tention to what they are publicizing and 
yet skillfully avoiding the temptation to 
draw themselves into the spotlight. 
One outstanding example of such a 
topnotch operation is the Naval Ocean-
ographic Office Public Information Sec-
tion. Its Deputy Director, Bob Niblock, 
is a good writer and an outstanding pub-
lic information man. 
Following is one of many instances 
of the very fine job the public informa-
tion section is doing for the Naval Ocean-
ographic Office. I am proud to include 
in the RECORD this very interesting article 
written by Bob Niblock about the ex-
citing work the Navy is doing in mapping 
the ocean floor. 
Chartmaking of the three-dimensional 
ocean is a very important part of the 
modern Navy's role. For without an un-
derstanding of its operating environment 
the Navy would be at a great loss. 
The article follows: 
1From the Washington (D.C.) Post, 
Oct. 17, 19651 
NAVY IS MAPPING THE OCEAN FLOOR 
An accelerated U.S. Navy effort to learn 
more about the ocean environment in which 
its ships and submarines operate has been 
a prime moving force for some exciting new 
programs of research and exploration in 
recent years. , 
Research ships now operate in all parts of 
the world gathering information for a three-
dimensional picture of the ocean. Vehicles 
to explore the greatest depths are being 
designed and built and successful experi-
ments point to the day when men may live 
and work in the sea for extended periods. 
Based on the current growth rate, oceanog-
raphy?the science of the seas?is a career 
of the future. 
An organization which has undergone 
major changes because of the current push 
is the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (form-
erly the U.S. Naval Hydrographic Office) at 
Suitland, Md. 
Commanded by aptly named Rear Adm. 
Odale D. Waters, its once modest program 
has sprouted into a three-department under-
taking involving more than 700 men and 
women. 
Oceanographers from the Suitland office 
range the globe studying everything from 
the drift of Arctic ice floes to the tempera-
ture variation and distribution of Gulf 
Stream sealife. All programs are directed 
primarily toward bettering -the defense capa-
bility of the U.S. Navy. But they also assist 
dozens of nonmilitary activities, from deep-
sea fishing to long-range weather forecasting. 
Many of the Oceanographic Office's proj-
ects have a distinctly pioneering flavor. 
Like the one carried out in a deep section 
of the Atlantic near Nassau, known as the 
Tongue of the Ocean. 
There the Navy's Bureau of Ships is de-
veloping a facility called the Atlantic Under-
water Test and Evaluation Center. When 
completed, it will provide a deep ocean test 
range for submarines, surface ships and 
their weapons systems. The Oceanographic 
Office was asked to draw a picture of this 
3,000-square-mile ocean test tank. 
In researching the area, a two-man sub-
marine was used to survey the steep lime-
stone cliff which surrounds Andros Island, 
largest of the Bahama Islands, and extends 
underwater for more than 600 feet. 
A four-man team of divers and scientists 
was sent from the Oceanographic Office. 
Washington Oceanographer Roswell F. 
Busby headed the group which included 
Chester Bright of La Plata Md a veteran

During descents in the 22-fOot vessel, 
Busby could look through any of 17 plexi-
glass portholes as he made his scientific ob-
servations on a portable tape recorder, There 
was voice communication between the sub 
and surface tending vessel and at one point 
during the hour-long first dive Busby de-
scribed coral formations looking like "bou-
qUets of telephone poles." 
Bright made the second dive. Using movie 
and still cameras, he made his photo docu-
mentation as the sub cruised downward 
along the cliff. On each dive, they descended' 
to 600 feet. 
High winds and rough seas canceled out 
3 days of operations, but in nine dives the 
team covered most of the critical sites in 
the AUTEC area. 
They returned with valuable data, photo-
graphs and sketches, which are now being 
used to draw up plans for cable laying 
operations. 
There were other bonuses from the under-
taking, according to Busby. Although their 
mission was applied research, the team 
saw and photographed an underwater forma-
tion which had been theorized but seldom 
Seen. 
On the face of the escarpment about 200 
feet underwater, they discovered a shelf 
cut into the coral which helped to docu-
ment the fact that the levels of the sea 
were much lower at one time, since this 
kind of shelf is most likely to have been 
cut by intertidal erosion centuries before. 
In addition, said Busby, "we learned a lot 
about working with small, deep-diving re-
search submarines and about their potential 
as a useful research and survey tool." 
The 50th Anniversary?U.S*. Marine Corps 
Reserve 
? EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
Os, 
HON. CLARK W. THOMPSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Today, more than at any other time in 
its history, the Marine Corps Reserve 
stands equipped, trained, and ready to 
answer the call of its country to defend 
once again that freedom which has been 
won by so costly a sacrifice. 
In 1916, at the urging of the then Sec-
retary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and 
the Commandant of the Marine Corps, 
Maj. Gen. Commandant George Barnett, 
the Congress passed "An act making ap-
propriations for naval service for the fis-
cal year ending June 30, 1917, and for 
other purposes." One of the other pur-
poses was to set forth provisions regard-
ing a Marine Corps Reserve. President 
Woodrow Wilson signed the act into law 
on August 29, 1916, and Secretary Daniels 
promptly issued Navy Department Gen-
eral Order No. 131 on August 31, 1916, 
which contained the following state-
ment: 
A U.S. Marine Corps Reserve to be a con-
stituent part of the Marine Corps and in ad-
dition to the authorized strength thereof, is 
hereby established. 
The first official strength report of the 
Marine Corps Reserve shows only 3 of-
ficers and 32 enlisted men as of April 1, 
1917. From that small beginning, how-
ever, the reserve grew to 6,467 in World 
War land to a peak strength of 357,417 
during World War II. At the present 
time, the Marine Corps Reserve numbers 
141,000, of which 7,000 are now on active 
duty, 100,190 are in Ready Reserve, and 
the remaining 33,810 are in Standby Re-
serve or retired. 
The Marine Corps has always claimed 
the proud distinction of being ready to 
fight for its country whenever and wher-
ever needed, and the Reserve has stood 
ready to back up that claim, and it con-
tinues to do so today. I think it is en-
tirely fitting that we should honor such 
an organization. 
Two Hundred Panamanians Trained in 
uba for Isthmian Subversion 
Mr. THOMPSON of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, August 29, 1966, will mark the 
50th anniversary of the formal establish-
ment of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. 
Yesterday I introduced a bill calling on 
the Postmaster General to issue a stamp 
at the appropriate time next year to 
commemorate this highly significant 
event in the history of a great organiza-
tion?an event which is equally great and 
significant in the history of the United 
States and in the struggle of all free peo-
ple to defend freedom with life's blood or 
with life itself if need be. 
The U.S. Marine Corps has written on 
the pages of history of this Nation feats 
of dedication and heroism unsurpassed 
In the annals of man?and the citizen-
marine has shed his blood and offered up 
his life side by side with the regulars on 
every beachhead and in every battle from 
Chateau Thierry to Iwo Jima to Vietnam. 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DANIEL J. FLOOD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 1965 
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, in a num-
ber of addresses before this body, I have 
?described the Panama Canal as a key 
target for communistic revolutionary 
conquest and vigorously opposed the em-
ployment of alien Panamanians in se-
curity positions, especially on the Canal 
Zone police force. 
Recent information from the isthmus 
is that more than 200 Panamanians have 
been trained in Red Cuba in preparation 
for aggressive subversive activities 
against Latin America. 
In order that the Congress and the 
people of our country may be informed 
on this matter, I quote a news story from 
a well-known and respected isthmian 
newspaper: 
[From the Panama (11.P.) Star & Herald, 
Sept. 28, 1965] 
TWO HUNDRED TRAINED IN CUBA FOR SUBVER-
SION HERE?EXILE TELLS OF PLANS 
More than 200 Panamanians have been 
trained in subversion in Communist Cuba 
in preparation for their part in Panama of 
an overall Communist aggression plan against 
Latin America, a handless former diplomat 
of the Castro regime said in a news con-
ference yesterday. 
He is Odon Alvarez de la Campa, 45, who 
until March of this year was minister coun-
selor of Castro's embassy in Madrid, Spain. 
He has joined the anti-Castro movement in 
exile. He lost both hands while engaged in 
sabotage work for_Castro's underground army 
in the fight against the Batista regime. 
Prior to being assigned to Madrid, he had 
served as deputy chief of the Castro police. 
Alvarez de la Campa said he learned of 
the Cuban plan of aggression against the 
Latin American nations at a meeting he at-
tended in Paris in January of 1965. This 
meeting, held in the Cuban Embassy in 
Paris, was presided by Ernesto (Che) Gue-
vara, the third-ranking man in the Cuban 
Communist hierarchy. 
Students .from all Latin American coun-
tries who had attended a Communist con-
gress in Warsaw, Poland, attended the meet-
ing, 'Alvarez de la Camps declared. 
Guevara, the former diplomat said, told 
the . students of the decisions reached at a 
congress of Latin American Communist 
Parties held in Havana in November 1964, 
and urged them to return quickly to their 
countries in order to intensify the subversion 
plans. Guevara, according to Alvarez de la 
Campa, was concerned by the failure of pro-
Castro guerrillas to stop elections in Vene-
zuela and to take over in Brazil, then gov-
erned by Joao Goulart. 
"I have been inside the training camp in 
Cuba," Alverez de la Campa said. "Not only 
are the latest weapons employed there, but 
the most modern tactics of subversion are 
taught. There are not only Cuban but 
Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese instruc-
tors." 
Alvarez de la Campa said that because of 
his familiarity with the pattern of Com-
munist infiltration from Cuba, he is certain 
that arms have been cached already in Pan-
ama for future Use. - 
He said Castro agents move in Europe 
through Prague, Paris, and Madrid and that 
the Spanish capital serves as the gateway 
to Latin America for agents assigned to 
the Western Hemisphere. 
In Latin America, Alvarez de la Campa 
,added, the vital centers of Communist traffic 
are Mexico -City, Montevideo, Uruguay, and 
Santiago, Chile. In these cities, he reported, 
false travel documentation is -provided for 
Communist agents. 
He said agents trained in Cuba infiltrate 
government, labor, and student organizations 
and their strategy is' to capitalize on social 
conditions in each country in order to carry 
out propaganda, agitation, and terrorism, and 
bring about armed conflict. 
Cuba's campaign of penetration and sub-
version in Latin American countries has been 
intensified in recent months, according to 
Alvarez de la Campa.. He said events in 
Peru, Guatemala, Venezuela and other coun-
tries should not be regarded as isolated out-. 
breaks, but as part of an overall hemisphere 
campaign. 
This subversion, he declared, is aided by 
both Russia and Communist China. The 
ideological split between the two Red giants 
has not been carried into-Cuba, he explained, 
and the Castro regime receives economic and 
military aid from both Communist powers. 
Alvarez de la Campa said he believes

A6094 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX 
Otepka, taking advantage of the reor-
ganization of the file room, of which Norpel 
had charge, discovered something curious. 
A number of clearances for high appointees 
had been predated to the time of their hir-
ing. They had been put at once on the pay-
roll without any investigation into their 
background. Inquiry quickly showed that 
sOrne had very dubious or even adverse rec-
bras. When. news Of this spread through the 
Department, a number of those employed de-
cided they did not want a Government job 
after all, 
Orders Came down that Norpel would be 
more usefill away from the files, and they 
Were remeved froM. Otepka's jurisdiction. 
Norpel was set to work on special clearances. 
Simultaneously, Boswell transferred some of 
the functions Of the evaluations division to 
his own executive office, including the files. 
They were now safe from probing security 
Men. 
HERE Is vialEUE SEILLE ENTERS THE PICTURE 
On April 16, 1962, John F. Reilly, who had 
been a senior lawyer for the Federal Com-
munications Commission, was brought in to 
succeed Boswell. Congressional testimony re-
vealed that his job was to "get Otepka." A 
stratagem was thought up to make this easy. 
Otepka was offered a 10-months' course in 
the National War College. Otepka surprised 
by this bounty, found out that he was not 
to be returned to the Security section, so he 
said, "No, thank you." 
David Belisle was brought from the Na-
tional Security Agency as Deputy Director, 
Otepka's old post. He had supervision over 
Otepka's evaluation division, as well as the 
moribund special project. Obviously, a 
squeezeplay was being attempted against 
Otepka, and while technically he retained 
his old status, actually he was being down-
graded. Anything that came from the Otepka 
office now was sure to meet objection, if only 
for a "t" not crossed, while the top was dis-
regarding and violating actual personnel 
security procedures, promulgated by the 
White House and sanctioned by Congress 
as Executive Order 1040. This is still the 
basic regulation. A flood of waivers from 
the top circumvented Clearances. 
Civil Service in December 1962 resurrected 
the Wieland case by sending to the State 
Department new evidence that was developed 
after the Senate Internal Security Subcom-
rnitte's exploration into the fall of Cuba. 
This naturally went to Otepka, who assigned 
it to the old special project group. Reilly 
Called for the special Wieland file almost at 
once, and this was the last seen of it until 
May 1963. No work had been done on it. 
Harry M. Hite immediately was assigned to it. 
Norpel and his security associates began a 
departmentwide search for documents re-
lating to the new data. Reports spread in 
the Department that they were hitting pay 
dirt. 
The boom was lowered again. This time 
it dropped right through the hull. The 
evaluation division phones were tapped by 
orders that came though Reilly. A futile 
effort was made to attach microphones in the 
offices. 'The, classified trash that was dis-
carded daily into burn bags, to go into the 
furnace, was diverted and pored over mi-
nutely. Surveillance of Otepka's selectees 
was begun. Officers and secretaries in con-
tiguous security areas were persuaded to act 
as informants on all movements of the group, 
to report what then Men said, and to assess 
their intent and actions. 
`04.11411T,?23., 19.03,_a raid took place of the 
Qr,pka premises, indistinguishable from any 
ra d that_might have 'Wren place of a nar-
Cates ..ring or even a Red espionage ring. At 
11:50 ani,, Mrs. Evnice Powers, Otepka's per-
sonal seereterY, was called by Reilly and sent 
to a different office for a spurious rush job. 
At 11.53 a..rn, Billy N. Hughes was summoned 
4,11tI hanciedhis tranger to routine investiga-
tion in a Washington field office. Reilly sug-
gested he go to lunch at once instead of re-
turning to his old office. 
At 11:56 a.m., Norpel was summoned and 
likewise was handed the same transfer orders, 
and he, too, was told, "There's no need for 
you to report back to your office; go out to 
lunch, and then report to your new office." 
At the stroke of noon, Otepka, having been 
similarly summoned, walked into Reilly's of-
fice. All this time, Belisle hovered over the 
scene, as a bodyguard might have done. 
Otepka was given an obviously make-work 
assignment apart from his old staff. He was 
banished to a cubbyhole to "write a hand-
book on security operations." He returned 
to his office to find Mrs. Powers, Hughes, and 
Norpel there. They were experienced enough 
in surrptitious and illegal techniques to 
know there was something phony about this. 
And there was. 
THREE OFFICES?NOT ONE?RAIDED AT ONCE 
The public impression, from what has been 
published, is that Otepka's office alone was 
summarily entered and searched. Actually, 
a raiding party simultaneously at about 
12:10 p.m. entered the office of Otepka, the 
adjoining separate office of Mrs. Powers, and 
farther down the hallway, the combined of-
fices of Norpel and Hughes. While others 
watched, wondering what crime had been 
committed, Reilly superintended the seizure 
of all safes and the immediate changing of 
all combinations on the locks. All records 
and file material were removed from the 
desks. Even the personal belongings of the 
exiled staff were impounded, and could be 
obtained only later under the surveillance of 
a guard. 
If only such energy could be focused on 
our Communist enemies. 
Norpel worked on routine investigations of 
job applicants, the sort of thing he had cut 
his teeth on in the FBI in 1951. Hughes 
shortly after was pressed into accepting a 
permanent assignment as a field agent in 
Memphis, Tenn. In January 1964, Norpel 
made his first appearance as a witness before 
the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, 
on instructions relayed through his superior. 
Intermittently, for the past several years, 
the subcommittee had been calling witnesses 
from the security branch, on the basis of 
information sent it from numerous alarmed 
sources. 
Following his testimony, Norpel was asked 
if he was satisfied with his assignment, and 
when he replied in the negative, was trans-
ferred back to the evaluations division. Ap-
parently, anywhere they went, this group in-
sisted on doing a thorough job. On March 15, 
1964, the old group, except Hughes was re-
assembled, along with Howard J. Shea, an 
old State Department hand. and Edwin A. 
Burkhardt, and was reconstituted as an un-
defined section of the Bureau of Inter-
American Affairs. They were supposed to be 
engaged in some supersensitive task. But 
the required files and facilities were kept 
from them. They twiddled their thumbs, 
chafing and protesting over the inaction. 
Loughton settled for a consular assignment 
abroad. Gardner went upstairs. 
Norpel was placed in charge. He kept in-
sisting on something to do, and continued 
being fed a line about the super-secretness of 
it all. He did his usual probing, nonethe-
less, and came up with what he surmised 
they should have been seeking. His secu-
rity background led him to the right trail. 
ThIS was evident when the same boom came 
down. Out of the administration's wood-
work came the same influences that divert 
or paralyze any government project once it 
threatens to really hurt the Communists. 
Norpel was ordered to El Paso, Tex., where 
there never had been a State Department of-
fice. Shea was ordered to Denver, Colo. 
Hite and Burkhardt were left behind, with 
the same ambiguous non-assignment, where 
October 22, 1965 
they still are in virtual quarantine. Otepka 
on April 30, 1964 was told to delay his previ-
ous meaningless task, and take on a new one, 
reading the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD in order 
to record the views of legislators on security 
matters. Norpel and Shea, of course, did 
not accept punitive exile, and have been 
dropped from the payroll, and are considered 
discharged. Now it is up to the public, Con-
gress and the press. The Otepka and the 
Norpel cases, and those of the others, must 
not be separated.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE 
OF lp-r-As 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. TEAGUE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
the October l965 edition of the magazine 
Army published by the Association of the 
U.S. Army contains an article written by 
Jack Foisie of the Los Angeles Times on 
the war in Vietnam, and the men who 
are fighting it. It is entitled "My Third 
War" and I commend it to all those in 
this body who have seen service in mili-
tary combat: 
ME THIRD WAR 
(By Jack Foisie) 
SAIGON.?When my "friends and neighbors" 
of the draft board selected me for a year of 
military training back in mid-1941, I hated 
the thought of being in the Army. Even 
after Pearl Harbor, and the year became 
"for the duration" and learning to shoot 
took on purpose, I remained at heart a 
civilian. 
Now I am in Vietnam?in my third war. 
Of course, I am no longer a soldier. / am 
a correspondent. I also was a correspondent 
during the Korean war. And midway 
through World War II, I became an Army 
combat correspondent. 
But in uniform or out, I have remained a 
civilian, and at least in the last two conflicts 
I have?I fear?sometimes gloried in the 
independence enjoyed by a correspondent 
even when among the military. Yet if I 
ever really hated military life (and there 
were days in basic training when I thought I 
did), I hate the Army no longer. Nor any 
other of the Armed Forces. 
A career as a military reporter, spanning 
2 decades, has been time enough for my 
prejudices to wear away. 
This is not to suggest that in 1941 I was 
a pacifist. But neither was I a fired-up 
patriot. Although just beginning in journal-
ism, I had already taken on a speck of the 
cynicism that is an occupational disease 
(and some would say, a necessity) in our 
business. 
And so I believed that the war then con-
fined to Europe was not our affair; that 
much of the discipline of the military was 
needless harassment, and that officers as well 
as sergeants were narrow thinkers and had 
chosen the military as a career because they

will risk turning public opinion in this 
country against the rescue effort. 
In this latter regard, members of the exile 
community must realize that there is al-
ready a large and legitimate segment of pub-
lic opinion in the United States which doubts 
the wisdom of admitting more Cuban refu-
gees on a mass basis. Gov. Haydon Burns, 
of Florida has expressed his concern that an 
additional flow of Cuban nationals into this 
State will add to economic problems, spe-
cifically in the area of employment. 
Other critics foresee an increased burden 
on State and national welfare programs since 
many of the escapees will arrive with the 
clothes on their backs as their only personal 
possessions, and no immediate job prospects. 
Such fears are not without justification. 
We are not surprised that Castro is anxious 
to create these problems for the United States 
But we would be surprised if members of 
the Cuban exile community cooperated, 
wittingly or unwittingly, in aiding him in 
this cause. A disorderly reply to the Castro 
challenge would create the sort of chaos 
here which already exists in Cuba. We don't 
want that. 
On the other hand, it is extremely impor-
tant that those who seek to take advantage 
of the Castro escape hatch have an oppor-
tunity to do so. Naturally, we would prefer 
an internal revolution in Cuba which over-
throws Castro completely. But his continu-
ing control of the military apparatus seems to 
rule that out. His opponents have neither 
the arms nor the organization to displace 
him. 
Rather than see these people rounded up 
Hungarian-style and moved to some Cuban 
Siberia, we would prefer that an efficient 
means of freeing them from Cuba be devel-
oped and that a fair and intelligent resettle-
ment program be organized once they are 
out of communism's clutches. 
Of course, it would be an error to bring 
more refugees to this country only to plunge 
them into a cesspool of poverty and psycho-
logical depression. But isn't that what the 
Ideological war with communism is all 
about? We must prove that we can face 
problems such as these and solve them with-
out damaging our own strong socioeconomic 
system or simply moving victims of com-
munism from one bad situation to another. 
This is not a job for amateurs. It is not 
a task to be carried out alone by emotion-
struck exiles already in the United States. 
If Castro is truly determined to open the 
doors of his country to those desirous of 
leaving, the exodus must be handled wisely 
and in context with existing U.S. policies. 
If it is successful and so complete that we 
may be relatively sure only pro-Castro ele-
ments remain on the island, then it will be 
far easier from the standpoint of conscience 
to increase economic pressure on Cuba; to 
blockade the island and to wage psychologi-
cal and physical warfare against Castroisrn. 
But that is for the future. Our concern 
now is with the present and with the best 
possible means of taking advantage of the 
latest strange and wonderful twist in Castro's 
reasoning. 
The Norpel Case 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. H. R. GROSS 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, in the pub-
lication Tactics, of the date of Septem-
ber 20, 1965, is an article by Mr. Edward 
Hunt calling attention to the case of 
Mr. John R. Norpel, Jr., who has been 
the victim of unwarranted punishment 
by officials in the State Department be-
cause of his support of Otto F. Otepka. 
Norpel is being punished because of 
his honesty and loyalty, not only to Otto 
Otepka but to his country. It is incred-
ible that those entrusted with the proper 
conduct of the State Department have 
been permitted to make a mockery of 
the civil service which was designed to 
protect efficient, honest, and loyal em-
ployees of the Federal Government. 
The article by Edward Hunt follows: 
BACKGROUND ON OTEPKA'S DEFENDERS: STUDY 
PAPER ON NOR,PEL CASE 
An integral, although separated part of the 
Otepka case is the Norpel case. Actually, 
it also might be called the Shea case, the 
Hite case, the Hughes, or the Burkhardt case. 
The issue in the Norpel case is a fundamen-
tal one by itself, with its own significance in 
the maintenance of freedom. If Otto F. 
Otepka were to be restored to his post in 
the State Department, and his rights as a 
citizen upheld, it would be a pyrrhic victory 
if Norpel and the others were not likewise 
vindicated. 
The basic issue in the Otepka case is the 
right of Senators and Congressmen to obtain 
correct information from any source as guid-
ance in drafting laws and for policy guidance. 
The other side of the identical coin is the 
right of the American citizen, in or out of 
government, to contact or be contacted by 
his Representative in Congress. 
Surely it does not require any book learn-
ing to know that it is impossible for any 
legislator to write intelligent laws, if when 
he asks a question of a government employee 
or office holder, he is led astray, misinformed, 
or lied to. Free society could not exist with-
out this right of his being fully protected. 
The issue in the case of John R. Norpel 
Jr., is a person's right, surely in government, 
not to be penalized or discharged when his 
superior falls from favor or is fired, or to be 
forced to repudiate and betray him in order 
to get on the right side of his new boss. 
Every American has read about the dismis-
sal or disgrace of some official in Soviet Rus-
sia, and how everyone related personally or 
professionally to him was purged, as well. 
What American while reading this has not 
felt a self-satisfied glow of satisfaction that 
this could not happen in the United States? 
Well, it has happened to Norpel, and to all 
these others. 
Surely it does not require any book learn-
ing to know that we cannot expect the in-
terests of the United States to be uppermost 
in the mind of any government employee or 
functionary if he knows that if he does not 
play ball with the top, and stand ready at 
any time to doublecross or knife anyone 
who receives the displeasure of the top, he 
will be tossed to the wolves, and the public 
not give a damn, the Congress look the other 
way, and the press be closed to him. 
This is haw it is under despotism, of course. 
What we have not realized, of course, is that 
With the best will in the world, it is impos-
sible to institute a news management pro-
cedure, allowing officials to decide when they 
believe it convenient to Ile to the public, 
press, and Congress, and to insist on a policy 
of one voice in government, without gradu-
ally building up a dictatorship, with the in-
evitable police state required to enforce it. 
This is modern despotism. 
OUR SMUGNESS IS ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN 
This reminder should be brought to the 
attention of every man or Woman in govern-
ment, whether in the White House or a city 
hall. It should be brought to the attention 
of every professor of political science, and 
should be digested by every newspaper re-
porter-and voter. The Otepka case and the 
Norpel case are the symbols of these two 
fundamental issues. We have been so con-
fident that such despotic and unfair proce-
dure could not happen to us that we fail to 
recognize these things when they occur 
under our noses. They are given such dis-
sembling names as institutional loyalty, 
which replaces patriotism. 
Norpel, who is married and has two 
daughters, is cleancut in looks and character. 
Although only 40 last August 6, he has given 
half his years to patriotic work, from the 
U.S. Army to the FBI, to the State Depart-
ment. His is the sort of outlook and career 
that those bent on softening up the United 
States seek to corrupt. ' He even was an 
Eagle Scout. But he can meet eggheads on 
their own ground. He has his B.A., studied 
law, is a member of Phi Delta Phi legal 
fraternity and Alpha Epsilon national honor-
ary society, and has been a teacher in Phila-
delphia and in the FBI. His FBI work 
ranged from specialization in investigative 
photography to penetration of Communist 
underground activities to developing com-
plex espionage cases. He was highly com-
mended by J. Edgar Hoover in the designing 
of an investigative device for security tasks, 
and Hoover also commended him on other 
occasions in connection with security opera-
tions. 
Otto Otepka brought him into the State 
Department in July 1961 to work on a special 
project suddenly ordered for an exhaustive 
review of the security backgrounds of all at 
officer level. Preliminary studies were being 
made by two other security evaluators, Harry 
M. Hith and Billy N. Hughes. Otepka as 
Deputy Director of the Security Office, 'also 
brought in as evaluators, Raymond A. 
Loughton from the Defense Department, 
who was upset over being overruled regard-
ing Adam Yarmolinsky, and Francis V. 
Gardner, recently with FBI. Howard J. Shea 
at this time was an investigative supervisor 
under Otepka. Edwin A. Burkhardt, evalua-
tor, had been brought over previously from 
the Civil Service Commission by Otepka, who 
also had been connected with the Commis-
sion. 
The project was begun under the instruc-
tions of William 0. Boswell shortly after this 
career Foreign Service officer became Director 
of the Office of Security. His role was to 
eliminate the Scott McLeod image. The 
routine work of the office proceeded, and in-
cluded the William A. Wieland case, which 
Otepka completed in August 1961, and 
passed it directy to Roger Jones, who re-
cently had become Deputy Under Secretary 
for Administration. Boswell simply refused 
to have anything to do with it, and the ill-
fated Salvatore Bontempo, given a political 
plum as administrator of the Bureau of Se-
curity and Consular Affairs, was out of the 
picture. He resigned after a controversial 6 
months, during which Congress and the 
press asked what a man of his total lack of 
experience was doing in such an office. Nor-
pel during this period was trying to retrieve 
the voluminous, scattered information in 
State Department files that were hidden all 
over the place. 
FIRST BACKLASH IS REDUCTION IN FORCE 
Obviously the team that was assembled 
was actually digging into the records. This 
obviously never had been intended. The ex-
pectation was that Otepka would be mature 
enough to know his men were supposed only 
to be going through the motions. The boom 
was dropped. Otepka was informed of a sud-
den need for a reduction in force. His post 
and -24 other security jobs were abolished. 
Otepka now was made chief of the Division of 
Evaluations, taking his project staff with 
him. Norpel went along. They now had to 
handle all the routine cases of applicants, 
and with a greatly reduced total staff, a big 
backlog built up. Without anyone having to 
say a word, the special project was pushed to 
the side for lack of time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX October 22, 1965 
? Many Cubans relocated elsewhere have re-
turned to Miami. 
The social and economic impact on Miami 
of thousands of additional Cuban refugees 
obviously could be severe, if the orderly in-
flux approVed by President Johnson were not 
observed. ' 
One would guess that this was in the mind 
of the sly, whiskered dictator when he re-
versed usual Communist tactics and offered 
to ,remove, rather than erect, barriers to 
emigration. It is' a severe indictment of the 
Castro Communist regime that thousands of 
Cubans are eager to vote by boat against it, 
as so many thousands of East Germans voted 
by foot against their rulers until the Berlin 
wall was erected. But, by opening the door, 
Castro gets rid' of many countrymen who do 
not support him and lessens the drain on 
Cuba's skimpy economy. 
If the United States should turn an 
armada of 'refugee S away because they are 
not following an orderly process orimmigra-
tion, Castro would have ammunition for 
propaganda branding this country as in-
humane and hypocritical. Cubans already 
here understandably would be upset if their 
relatives Were not admitted freely by the U.S. 
Government, after Castro hacrset them free. 
Castro may not be as loony aS he appears. 
There's probably a cynical grin behind the 
beard. 
[From the Lincoln Evening Journal and Ne-
braska State Journal, Oct. 14, 1965] 
CASTRO'S BOMBSHELL 
Recently Fidel Castro began giving one of 
his long rambling talks which covered every-
thing from poverty to bureaucrats. Then he 
dropped a bombshell, saying that any Cuban 
With relatiVes in the United States could 
leave the island after October 10. 
President Lyndon Johnson reciprocated by 
Saying they would be welcomed. Then the 
stampede was on. Everyone from diplomats 
down to the Cuban in the street is searching 
for the reasons for Castro's new open door 
policy. 
One thing is certain, many Cubans don't 
trust the Cuban dictator and are making a 
mad dash to get out while the leaving is pos-
sible. Cuban exiles in this country are aid-
ing their friends and relatives despite the 
?U.S. Government's plea for an orderly exit 
and the promise of safe transportation. 
This mass exodus should disillusion any 
remaining Castro admirers in Latin Ameri-
ca,. It also has provided bath a challenge 
and a problem for the United States. 
The proximity of Florida places the bur-
den on the southern part of that State. Flor-
ida Gov. Haydon Burns proposed a four-
point Federal program to prevent refugees 
being 'dumped in the Miami area for re-
settlement and school officials there were told 
not to admit new wave Cuban refugee chil-
dren to classes until Federal funds were avail-
able for classrooms and teachers. 
There has also been grumbling in some 
labor groups about the added competition in 
the job markets. It seems evident that the 
Cliban Government is not going to cooperate 
in an orderly flow of refugees. 
? The United States can absorb the refugees, 
but Florida cannot, without help. That help 
Should be forthcoming?quickly before the 
tempers rise in that State. Possibly it was 
Castro's plan to embarrass the United States, 
but this he should not be allowed to do. 
? -President Johnson may have been impet-
'VOUS and perhaps the ground rules should 
have been laid before extending the welcome. 
But both Castro and the President have 
spoken. In international circles Castro's 
word means nothing but Uncle Sam's is re-
spected. 
' The 1:Tufted" States now must make the 
-"best of:a- difficult situation. It dare not dash 
114-6 'Of englaved men and women. Cas-
tro has also given-it an Opportunity for a 
great propaganda coup against the Commu-
nist world. 
[From the Atlanta Journal, Oct. 14, 1965] 
CARING FOR CUBAN REFUGEES 
A number of agencies here are wisely start-
ing work to care for a fraction of the Cuban 
refugees expected to come to this country 
in what promises to be a major exodus. 
It will be a welcome exodus. Like the 
tens of thousands before them, they will be 
fleeing from the cruel band of communism. 
For reasons not fully known Fidel Castro 
has said that he will let down the barriers 
to all who want to leave Cuba. 
Whatever the reasons it is a happy oppor-
tunity for a brutalized people to make their 
way to freedom. 
Freedom for those who can leave, as it 
has been for practically all who have escaped 
before, logically lies in the United States. 
This country is not only the traditional 
haven for the oppressed but it has also held 
a burning anger against Castro and his 
fellow Communists and an abiding sym-
pathy for the Cubans. 
As these refugees arrive it is the respon-
sibility of the entire country to resettle them 
and start them in new lives. The Federal 
Government should lead the way. States 
and communities should follow through with 
their own arrangements. 
'Miami has been all but swamped with the 
refugees. Other parts of Florida have been 
burdened with large numbers. This should 
not be, They are a national problem which 
should be the enthusiastic concern of all 
Americans. 
[From the Chicago Daily News, Oct. 16, 19651 
CUBA'S NEW EXODUS 
It is for Fidel Castro to decide whether the 
exodus from Cuba will be confied to the dar-
ing few skilled enough to venture the passage 
in sman boats or enlarged to number in the 
thousands. 
For reasons as unfathomable as his initial 
offer to let refugees leave his island prison, 
Castro has thus far indicated a willingness to 
cooperate with an orderly and larger depar-
ture. 
Is Castro merely trying to get rid of "un-
desirables"? Will he eventually demand a 
ransom, financial or political? Is he being 
prodded by his Soviet bosses to maks a con-
ciliatory gesture? 
Whatever the answers, the Cuban refugees 
ought to be welcomed by Americans. 
They will be a temporary burden, especially 
to the Miami area, which has absorbed so 
many in the past. But their presence and 
their plight affords an opportunity for the 
United States to live up to its tradition as 
a haven for the oppressed. 
The opportunity is a national one, and 
Gov. Haydon Burns of Florida is right in 
asking other States to do their share. 
Fortunately, Chicago already has the 
mechanism for absorbing many more refu-
gees. The Cardinal's Committee for the 
Spanish Speaking and the Cuban Associa-
tion, which it supports, have integrated 
thousands with a minimum of public de-
pendency. (The story is told elsewhere in 
today's paper by reporter Norman Glubok.) 
The doors of these organizations are now 
being crowded by refugee Cubans anxious 
to receive friends and relatives who might 
form part of a new exodus. Chicagoan 
should give them wholehearted support. 
[From the Boston Globe, Oct. 13, 19651 
THE ROAD TO EXILE 
When Fidel Castro startled an audience at 
Havana a fortnight ago by announcing that 
anyone discontented with his regime could 
migrate to the United States, he posed sev-
eral riddles. They remain unanswered. 
Was he referring only to those in Cuba 
who have relatives living in exile in this 
country? Or was his purpose broader? Was 
he merely reaching for an expedient to rid 
himself of leaders of the growing passive 
resistance movement among Cuba's peas-
antry and workmen? Whatever his aims, 
was he ready to cooperate with the United 
States to facilitate an orderly exodus of the 
thousands who undoubtedly would like to 
accept his offer? 
President Johnson, taking note of Castro's 
proposal, was careful to emphasize that the 
United States will give first priority to 
Cubans having relatives in this country, and 
to political prisoners. But he indicated a 
broader policy: "Those wso seek refuge here 
will find it." 
Washington's efforts to obtain a rational 
working agreement with Havana are still 
bogged down. Castro's suggestion that he 
will manage matters as he sees fit doesn't 
help. As a result, while intermittent boat-
loads of refugee Cubans turn up off Florida, 
our own Government faces a number of 
problems. 
Whether, as some estimate, 300,000 or 
more Cubans are preparing to seek freedom 
here, or (as is more likely) the realistic 
figure would be nearer 50,000, rigorous con-
trol of admissions is of necessity part of U.S. 
policy. The immigration laws make that 
mandatory. Even when latitude is allowed 
for political asylum precautions are needed. 
This should not mean serious hardship 
for the fugitive Cubans who, in fact, can 
only benefit oy orderly procedures. Mean-
time the problems created by the prospec-
tive arrival of some 5,000 refugees a month 
need attention and farsighted planning. 
That was the scale of the influx prior to the 
Cuban missile crisis, when 350,000 Cubans 
fled abroad from Castro's tyranny and some 
270.000 of them came here. 
Our Government has already spent about 
$190 million helping resettle and retrain 
these refugees, one-third of them in and 
around Miami. Private agencies have con-
tributed a similar amount. Yet nearly 16,000 
are still on relief. Clearly the $12 -million 
asked of Congress by the President to deal 
with the situation now developing is too 
modest. 
Neither Miami nor Florida's Dades County 
can absorb unaided. a new heavy influx of 
refugees. The problem obviously is Federal, 
not local. No true American will fail to 
welcome these unfortunates; but the wel-
come will be the more beneficial to all, in-
cluding the refugees, if backed by an ade-
quate Federal economic and educational 
program. 
UNCLE DUDLEY. 
[From the Tampa (Fla.) Times, Oct. 11, 
, 1965] 
NOT A JOB FOR AMATEURS 
If the evacuation of refugees from Cuba 
is to be a success it is extremely important 
that Cuban exiles in the United States coop-
erate fully with Government plans for han-
dling this unusual Castro-approved exodus. 
In their anxiety to aid friends and rela-
tives leave Cuba, Cubans already in the 
United States may defeat their purpose by 
rushing a small boat floatilla across the 
Florida Straits. 
First, the number of escapees picked up 
by small boats would be low compared to the 
total removed in an organized evacuation. 
Second, unless the rescue of these people 
from Castroism is orderly, there is a danger 
of injustice, accidents and error. One such 
"error" occurred over the weekend when 
exile operators of a refugee pick-up craft 
swapped gunfire with a Cuban militia patrol. 
Castro could use auch an incident to cancel 
his open-door order and take retaliatory 
measnres. against those would-be escapees 
who have identified themselves. 
Third, any rescue effort which is not 
tightly supervised by Governinent agencies

the innate hospitality and friendliness of 
all Americans. 
The following editorials from across 
the country attest to the willingness and 
friendliness with which the whole Nation 
welcomes those who have the courage to 
flee from tyranny: 
[Prom the Miami Herald, Oct. 18, 19651 
GUIDELINES FOR REFUGEES 
Once we khew a family whose elderly 
father grew ill but could not go to a nursing 
home for care. So he moved in with one 
of his sons. The others promised to help. 
Well, you know the story, Through the 
fault really of nobody at all, the one son 
became the sole support of the ailing father. 
South Florida would not equate its Cuban 
visitors with a sick old man but rather with 
an ailing freedom that somehow must be 
nursed back to robust good health. Yet it 
cannot perform that function if new and 
heavier burdens are laid upon it by the re-
settlement in this area of large groups of 
exiles. 
It seems to us that Representative DANTE 
FASCELL framed the issue properly before the 
House the other day when he observed that 
"the Major burden is the ability of one area 
to take to its heart and absorb into its eco-
nomic life, thousands more who flee 
tyranny." 
There is no reason the United States Gov-
ernment cannot do this job with order and 
dispatch if it addresses itself seriously to 
the question as a metter vested with the 
national interest. 
Mr. FASCELL has suggested a number of 
guidelines. All of them are good. Some must 
be adopted. Here they are: 
1. Entry should be limited to reuniting 
divided families and releasing political 
prisoners; beyond that the United States 
should not now go. 
2. Miami should be only an entry and 
processing point and not a staging or reloca-
tion center. 
3. Transportation of refugees from Cuba 
should be at all times under the strict super-
vision and control of, U.S. authorities. 
4. Necessary personnel and equipment 
should be kept in the south Florida area to 
enforce the laws and to safeguard the secur-
ity of the United States. 
5. The United States must have final de-
termination on who is admitted. 
6. Refugees must be security screened and, 
if considered a security risk returned to 
Cuba. 
7. The rate of entry of Cuban refugees 
into the United States should not exceed 
the rate of relocation. 
8. No agreement should contain any terms 
or conditions which in any way could be 
interpreted as changing the position of the 
United States against Fidel Castro and his 
government. The United States must remain 
firm in its determination to rid the West-
ern Hemisphere of communism and to allow 
? the people of Cuba to restore a democratic 
government. 
This policy would commit Congress to a 
responsibility for as well as an understanding 
of the Cuban refugee problem. 
? It would by no means close the door on 
refugees. 
Indeed, point 8 gives purpose to the 
reception of refugees beyond a humanitarian 
impulse. For if the United States is to help 
achieve a free Cuba it must of course be 
receptive to those who seek sanctuary. 
[From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 16, 
1965] 
CUBAN REFUGEES 
Refugees from Fidel Castro's Cuba may 
soon be flooding into Florida at the pre-
Cuban missile crisis rate of more than 1,000 a 
Week. The Cuban Premier's surprising an-
nounceinent that anyone on the island who 
? _ 
wants to leave might do so, together with 
, 
President Johnson's offer to accept all refu-
gees, is a fascinating development. We have 
grown accustomed to conununism's iron cur-
tain approach to the desire of its peoples to 
emigrate. 
There is speculation that Mr. Castro's mo-
'tives were both political and economic. He 
could rid the country of opponents of his 
regime and at the same time strengthen 
the hard-pressed economy by seizing their 
possessions. 
Mr. Johnson's motives were first of all hu-
manitarian. From his point of view the 
exodus, moreover, may be considered a propa-
ganda victory, illustrating to the world the 
dissatisfaction of many Cubans with life un-
der Castro's communism. 
Whatever the motives of the two leaders, 
if the plan does actually materialize it will 
pose certain problems for the United States. 
There will have to be another crash program 
to absorb the refugees as well as long-range 
planning and effort to integrate them into 
the social and economic structure of the 
:country. It will demand the joint endeavor 
of private agencies and local, State, and Fed-
eral governments. 
Many of the refugees have neither the 
language background nor the skills neces-
sary to support themselves in the American 
economy. They axe bound to add to the Na-
tion's unemployment and welfare problems. 
In some cases their presence may limit job 
opportunities for Negroes. Special educa-
tional and job-training programs will cer-
tainly be needed. 
And the Nation as a whole is going to 
have to find places for the new arrivals. 
Florida, and especially Miami, have borne 
heavy and disproportionate burdens. About 
one-third of the 270,000 refugees who have 
come since the Cuban revolution still live 
in Miami. When and if the new flood of 
refugees does come, both Government and 
private agencies should be ready with plans 
to locate them, insofar as possible, in areas 
of opportunity beyond the borders of Florida. 
[From the Washington Post, Oct. 5, 1965] 
WELCOMING CUBANS 
The administration is wise to hold Pre-
mier Castro to his offer to let Cuban refugees 
come to the United States irrespective of 
technicalities. Whether or not Castro mis-
understood President Johnson's suggestion 
that the International Red Cross assist with 
preparations, this country's expressed will-
ingness to negotiate reasonable arrange-
ments will serve the double purpose of re-
affirming the traditional American haven for 
those in distress and of dramatizing any 
Castro attempt to renege. Federal help in 
resettling Cubans with relatives already 
here as well as political refugees should pre-
vent too great a burden from falling on 
Florida. 
At the same time the administration's 
position would be even more impressive if it 
could take Castro up on his additional pro-
posals?that Americans be allowed to travel 
to Cuba, that Cubans in this country be 
permitted to visit relatives in Cuba and re-
turn, and that Cubans in Cuba be permitted 
, to visit relatives here and return. Such 
procedures are impossible now because 
Latin American countries have agreed to 
discourage travel to and from Cuba as a 
curb on subversion. The State Department 
has allowed journalists to visit Cuba but 
not others, and American passports are en-
dorsed with a prohibition. 
Although restrictions of this sort cannot 
easily be ended, they still are of dubious 
principle. Restrictions on travel are ba-
sically a totalitarian device. Even with the 
acknowledged security dangers and possibil-
ity of propaganda facades, there is nothing 
like seeing for yourself to bring out essen-
tial truths and encourage open societies. 
If there are to be barriers to free travel, let 
them come from the Communists. 
[From the Evening Star, Oct. 5, 1965] 
THE NEW EXILES 
The offer of unqualified refuge to Cubans 
who wish to leave the island gave a dramatic 
ring to the President's Ellis Island speech. 
In terms of national sentiment, even in terms 
of propaganda, it was the natural response to 
Castro's sudden decision to open the doors. 
But virtually unlimited immigration from 
Cuba creates a host of new problems for 
Florida and the city of Miami. Since 1959, 
Miami has been the West Berlin of the 
Cuban nightmare. More than 200,000 Cu-
ban refugees have flowed into the city, most 
of them remaining there on temporary 
"parole" status. Miami, aided by State and 
Federal funds, has been a kind host. Refu-
gee children attend the public schools. 
Jobless refugees go on the public-assistance 
roles immediately, although Florida resi-
dents must live there for 5 years before 
receiving a dole. The exiles are allowed to 
hold jobs, and the result has been a serious 
rise in jobseekers in Dade County, particu-
larly in unskilled categories. Some resettle-
ment has been achieved. The majority of 
exiles hover in southeast Florida, where the 
climate and culture are their own, awaiting 
the day of return. 
Yet this very hope for an end to Ca,stroism 
argues for some sort of limitation an future 
immigration from the island. Castro's offer 
puts a foreboding seal of permanence on his 
revolution. It is a way of cleaning house 
and battening down the hatches. What he 
seems to be angling for, in effect, is a second 
Cuba set up on our own shores?a con-
venient dumping ground for unemployables 
and malcontents. This may or may not be 
true. Castro may really wish to reopen 
channels of communication between the two 
nations. But given his muddled speeches, 
who can tell? 
The Cuban refugee has an unprecedented 
hold on the Nation's conscience. This was 
made clear in the President's response to 
Castro. And the Federal Government will 
doubtless take on more of the responsibility 
for feeding and resettling the exiles. 
What cannot be reckoned is the cumu-
lative effect the new immigration will have 
on the exiles themeselves?on their morale, 
their hopes, their dreams of eventual re-
turn. If the open-door plan goes through, 
Castro will have his safety valve. But the 
exiles will not, and their bitterness is bound 
to increase as problems of resettlement be-
come more complicated. It is not a happy 
prospect, in the long run, for anyone in-
volved?except perhaps for Castro himself. 
[From the Oregonian, Oct. 10, 1965] 
SLY CASTRO 
According to Cuban exiles in Miami, Fidel 
Castro apparently meant his recent state-
ment that all Cubans who wished to join 
relatives in the United States would be free 
to do so. Castro not only has opened the 
door; he has stocked a small port with food 
and other provisions for his departing coun-
trymen and has sent telegrams to exiles in 
Florida inviting them to come to Cuba by 
small boat to fetch their relatives. 
Already some small craft have made the 
voyage safely through waters which formerly 
were so closely guarded by Communist tor-
pedo boats that they became known as 
"death corridor." Many Miami residents 
are worried that their city and State will be 
flooded by refugees before the UB. Govern-
ment can arrange for their relocation 
throughout the country in an orderly man-
ner. Of 244,000 alien Cubans already in the 
United States, more than a third live in the 
Miami area and almost half in Florida.

The Soviets hit this critical stage in the late 
1950's."" 
Page 98: "Everyone understands the prob-
lem: According to one estimate by a leading 
Soviet mathematician, 60 percent of the 
country's potential industrial output is being 
wasted by inefficiencies in planning and ad-
ministration." 
U.S. News & World Report, May 3, 1965: 
"The Communist system in most of the 
eastern European nations is falling apart. 
There Still is dictatorship but the totalitar-
ian state is gone and communism as an ideol-
ogy is dead in all satellites except Bulgaria." 
In sum, central planning for business and 
Industry just wouldn't work. The Russians, 
being human, followed their own self-inter-
est and did things the easiest, rather than 
the best, way. And, as always when central 
planners have to defend themselves, for a 
long time they managed to use figures to 
cover, the faults. 
Finally in 1962 (a year after the Berlin 
wall spilled the beans, and Communist 
leadership, staring economic defeat in the 
face, became willing to listen to anyone) 
up popped a Russian liberal named Liber-
' man. (You must remember that, in Rus-
sia, a liberal is against central planning.) 
A professor. 
He proposed a diabolical, ingenious new 
Soviet scheme, the Liberman plan. 
He called it "The plan, profits, and bo-
nuses" (pretty nervy right there) and this 
was the idea: 
Liberman said the public knows what the 
public wants. Let each factory develop its 
own production targets, product designs, and 
selling techniques (fancy words for indi-
vidual and company initiative) based on 
what it thinks the public will buy (West-
erners would call this, "the economy of the 
marketplace"). 
The reward is profits for the factories and 
bonuses for the workers when they make 
goods that sell, and only when they sell, 
rather than on what some central planner 
directed factories to make and people to buy. 
(That's individual responsibility and oppor-
tunity.) 
If this sounds like something that's been 
going on In the United States for a long 
tirne?a market-oriented, profit-motivated, 
economic system, guided by decentralized 
individual decisions, that's not remarkable. 
It is. 
Liberman had visited the West. He knew 
this would work. And Khrushchev had been 
In the West?he could see how well it worked. 
Lenin had said, "We'll even learn, if neces-
sary, from the capitalists," and it sure was 
necessary, so they decided to try it out. In 
the spring of 1964, just before I heard about 
that newborn advertising agency, they be-
gan to take steps. 
After 2 years of kicking Liberman's ideas 
around, while things got worse and worse, 
Ithrushchev held his breath and gave Liber-
man the green light to try his plan in the 
galenent industry?men's suits. Let's quote 
again from the Huntley-Brinkley report, just 
13 months later?NBC: Huntley-Brinkley Re-
port, November 4, 1964: "The pioneer in the 
new profit system has been the suit factory, 
Bolshevichka. No more directives from the 
genius in the planning committee. Bol-
shevichka fins orders from retail stores like 
QUM. That's all. But it's never been done 
before. The stores order what they think 
their customers want. Bolshevichka pro-
duces it. The order is delivered to the store 
and the customers either buy it or they don't. 
If the merchandise doesn't move, the order 
Is cut or rescinded. Bolshevichka changes 
the model, 'cuts the price, or does what any 
producer Would do once he recognizes that 
laeAepends on Customers and that the cus-
tomer frrigHt.- Since the new system began, 
?not a S'ingtd 136IsheVichka suit has had to go 
into, storage PrOthiction is up. Profits are 
up. Which means more money for the work-
CONGRESSIONAL' 'RECORD ? APPENDIX 
ers. Such euccess depends entirely on cus-
tomer acceptance of their product, so the 
Bolshevichka workers have a basic profit in-
centive to satisfy the customers' demand for 
quality." 
Incidentally?and this is important?this 
didn't work at first because the clothing fac-
tory couldn't get satisfactory cloth from its 
suppliers, so Khrushchev pushed the new 
method onto them, too. There's no stop-
ing this, you see. And if Professor Liber-
man has his way, substantially all of the 
Russian economy will be based solely on 
profits, determined on the basis of goods 
actually sold at retail. The single best indi-
cator of a firm's performance will be per-
cent of profits on invested capital. (Sound 
familiar?) 
Well, Liberman is getting his way?fast. 
In the months since then, with the econo-
mist Kosygin as Premier, the new scheme 
has been spreading rapidly. And, of course, 
we know that factory profits increase when 
customers are satisfied?through better 
service, quality, or price. So using profits to 
measure success in Russia will gradually im-
prove the quality of all their production. In 
some fields this won't take long at all. 
In that clothing factory, for example, 
bonus payments doubled in 2 months as the 
quality and profits improved. In 6 months, 
the plant was running at full capacity as 
more and more customers' wanted the Bol-
shevichka brand name in their suits. Ob-
viously, they needed some competition. So, 
by January 1, 1965, 400 more apparel factories 
had been switched to the profit system. 
Since then, papers, magazines, and TV 
have been full of reports about the new Rus-
sian revolution. Let's pick up a few ex-
cerpts. 
Time, February 12, 1965, pages 23, 25, 28, 
29: 
"Russia's growing community of prag-
matic, highly professional economists and 
engineers understands very clearly what has 
happened, and is sure that it has the cure--
even if much of it has to he borrowed from 
the capitalists. One editor proposed aboli-
tion of Russia's 50-percent consumer goods 
tax, argued that all Soviet revenues could 
be derived from a profits tax, once profit 
was made the universal indicator, 
"The manager of a giant construction 
complex even went so far as to use the 
phrase 'supply and demand' in pleading for 
a free-wheeling open market for consumer 
goods, admitting that it would necessitate 
major reliance on that old capitalist tech-
nique of market research by firms. 
"Last month a Moscow economist proposed 
that the profit motive even be extended to 
agriculture. 
"Izvestia recently lamented that while the 
United States has 50 university-level busi-
ness-management schools, Russia has none. 
"Liberman?When asked if he tries to 
inculcate his students with notions of 
profitability, he smiles and says, 'Yes, but 
very carefully: I say that it is my opinion, 
but there are many objections. I explain 
them all, and the students draw their own 
conclusions.' " 
Business Week, October 31, 1964, page 99: 
"Prices will be set by producers and re-
tailers?not planners. Under the old system 
It took 6 to 12 months and the approval of 
nine different agencies to set a price on a 
new product. 
"Employment will be determined by man-
agers who can expand or contract their labor 
force freely, Wages will probably still be set 
by the state, but plant directors will be 
allowed to increase wages up to 50 percent, 
out of profits, for good worker performance." 
Page 100: 
"There are risks as well as potential gains 
in the Soviet experiment. Healthy competi-
tion will no doubt increase among factories 
for retail customers and among both fac-
tories and retailers for the consumer. With 
AGo89. 
competition will come a buildup of the mar-
keting efforts that are already well under-
way. 
"For the Russians, marketing expenditures 
are not such an easy pill to swallow; such 
'wastes' were once considered among the mis-
fortunes reserved for capitalism. It now ap-
pears that they are essential to any mass 
production-mass consumption economy." 
Associated Press, March 27, 1965: 
"'The biggest task now,' said first Secre-
tary Brezhnev, 'is to * * * make a wider use 
of economic and moral incentives in all sec-
tions of production on collective and state 
farms, which should be allowed greater inde-
pendence in their economic activities.'" 
Newsweek, February 18, 1965: 
"For Muscovites, long accustomed to only 
the meagerest selection of fresh produce in 
winter, the abundance available at the Cen-
tral Peasant Market last week was a strange 
sight. 
"One peasant who arrived in Moscow last 
week told Newsweek correspondent Robert 
Korengold that he had traveled 2 days and 
2 nights from Baku, 2,200 miles away, arid 
had laid out $24.42 for his train ticket. But 
he added, he expected to clear about $333 on 
the load of pears that he had brought with 
him. When a woman shopper exclaimed 
that 5 rubles ($5.65) was far too much to pay 
for a kilo of pears, the man from Baku re-
torted: "It's 5 rubles, lady, because you can't 
get things like that here in winter." 
"Behind this new march on Moscow lies 
a decision by the new team in the Kremlin. 
They have ruled that a peasant no longer 
needs written permission to bring his wares 
to Moscow. In keeping with their tendency 
to favor economic policies that work re-
gardless of whether they coincide with Marx-
ist dogma, Russia's new rulers are apparently 
willing to tolerate an expanded private trade 
in food. 
'As for the Moscow housewife, she's ap-
parently delighted with all the fruits and 
vegetables now available. Said one Muscov-
ite shopper: 'Maybe if this system works and 
the peasants keep producing, we will have 
so much that the prices will go down,'" 
New York Times, March 28, 1965: 
"Last December 9, Premier Kosygin casual-
.ly announced, as though it were the most 
natural thing in the world, 'We shall proceed 
toward planning on the basis of orders 
placed by consumers in all branches of the 
national economy.'" 
Central planning also involved a lot of 
change of plant managers who were moved 
around like civil servants during a reduc-
tion in force. The "first in line" got the 
job regardless of training or ability. Now 
they are throwing that out. Merit will be 
the basis for promotion, they say. 
You can see how far things have gone 
when you realize that profits can now in-
crease "bonuses" of workers by 40 percent 
and of managers by 50 percent, automati-
cally, and the workers' bonuses can be "ad-
justed" by management. "Supply and 
demand, market research, business schools, 
free prices, hire and fire authority, arbitrary 
bonuses out of profits, merit promotions, 
competition, marketing efforts, economic 
policies that work." When you gather all 
those words together the jigsaw puzzle be-
gins to take shape, 
So remember, when you read in the papers 
about another way in which the Soviets are 
"copying" the West, they aren't exactly. This 
Is no longer reluctant "copying" of isolated 
intances, they are simply following and 
expanding?rapidly?their new way of life. 
Now, I could go on. There are more and 
more examples. 
But the cat's out of the bag. The Rus-
sians have discovered our secret weapon. 
No kidding. 
So they've ?revolted again. This time it 
will work.

.'A6091) CONGRESSIONAL RLCORD ? APPENDIX 
Pravda has announced a true truth: That 
nothing really happens until somebody buys 
something. 
That, once out of hunger, they don't buy 
until they want to buy?and that business-
men who make them want to buy, legiti-
mately, with attractive, high quality prod-
ucts and persuasive salesmen, are the heart 
of progress. 
That, by and large, for most things, central 
planning, socialistic systems work for con-
servation?like parks?and protection?like 
the military and the Food and Drug Admin-
istration and social security but they're not 
munch good for progress. And in the world 
*e're Ip, we progress or die. 
Progress requires an economic system that 
Is market-oriented, profit-motivated (some 
incentive; usually but not necessarily money, 
of course), competitive, with decentralized, 
independent management. 
This is the biggest joke on American 
party line followers in 100 years. I wish 
Mark Twain were still alive. He'd love this. 
Can't you see the bearded party line pick-
ets in Times Square carrying signs that 
shout: "Up with profit; down with central 
planning," "We want piecework now." 
Of course, the Russians may flub this 
second chance. Politicians and politics can 
ruin any economic system, and in Russia 
this would be easy because the state--that 
is, the Communist Party?is the sole stock-
holder. 
But there's no guarantee that even dedi-
cated Communists will let this chance go 
by. The turnabout has been and is bound 
to be so dramatic that they'll think twice 
before they fire a good market-oriented 
Manager. 
Progress doesn't require private ownership 
of the tools of production, anyway. Freedom 
may, but not progress. 
Prosperity doesn't know the difference be-
tween the state taking half the profits in 
taxes and giving half the profits in bonuses, 
as long as management is being measured 
by return on investment. 
(Management that's free to make a legiti-
mate profit is the key. Ansco film kept very 
competitive for 20 years even though the 
U.S. Government owned all the stock a ? ? 
just as competitive as if a Million stock-
holders had owned it.) 
The government let Geneml Aniline's man-
agement rim the show as long as the "return 
on investment" stayed up, and that's what 
Russia's talking about. 
.Assuming that Russian leadership will be 
satisfied with the prosperity that the new 
system is sure to bring and will act pretty 
Much like other stockholders, pretty soon 
the major difference in our two economic sys-
tems may be the words "capitalism" and 
"communism." 
The important points are: ? 
1. This old-fashioned market-oriented 
American system will work a ? ? even if it's 
called the new Liberman plan * ? * no mat-
ter who owns the stock, as long as the mana-
gers are measured on profits, not politics (or 
even, as we know here in America, on a little 
of both) and the workers get bonuses, or 
raises, for making goods that sell. 
2. Russia, if she keeps this up ? * * (and 
how can they put the chicken back in the 
egg?) * * * Russia will grow productive, 
strong and powerful. 
3. Once a country tastes the value of 
change and of the use of profitable new 
ideas, they won't want to go back. Pros-
perity keeps men in office. Next thing for 
the Russians to invent is the installment 
plan?consumer credit?and that won't be 
long now. 
4, The Russians aren't "copying" bits and 
pieces of "Western methods" any more. 
What we see in the papers is not evidence of 
reluctant imitation but of the growth of 
their own new total system. There's a sub-
tle and important difference. 
The satellites are in on this, too. Fact is, 
some of them are way ahead. 
Czechoslovakia has decentralized authority 
and has shifted from plan-fulfillment to 
profits as a measure of managerial success. 
They call it "gross value realize," but as one 
Czech interviewed on TV recently said, "What 
counts is whether you sell the stuff and can 
do it at a profit." 
Hungary has profit sharing and?hang on 
to your hats?the payment of interest on 
capital. The prime rate is 5 percent. 
There's another bit of termite-steel. In-
terest is even worse than advertising to 
Marxists. Better keep your eye on Hungary. 
Or Yugoslavia. 
Yugoslavia, it turns out, has been an the 
profit system for quite awhile. In fact, they 
have actual stockholders, although only the 
workers themselves own the stock in the 
factory. Nevertheless, they've gone so far 
that a factory can go broke and all the man-
agement people lose their jobs if they fail to 
make a profit. 
That's incentive. 
And things are rapidly getting worse for 
Marx and Lenin. 
By now, according to reports from a mem-
ber of a recent trade mission, 85 percent of 
all arable land in Yugoslavia is back in pri-
vate hands and any business employing five 
or fewer people can be privately owned. 
There's no income tax on the first million 
dinars, with a 50-percent maximum tax. 
They still call that "communism" in Yugo-
slavia. What would you call it? 
Even East Germany is talking about it. 
Brand-name advertisements are appearing 
on the billboard kiosks here and there. 
And you know how industrious the Ger-
mans are. If they are allowed to be effective, 
they have a tendency to be. 
If they eat well and have choices?as you 
always do in a market-oriented, profit-moti-
vated economy?then many won't be so des-
perate to leave East Germany. Business-
men, salesmen, marketing men and advertis-
ing men will pop up everywhere. 
When that happens?for better or worse?
the wall will come tumbling down. 
Obviously, this tremendous 180? change in 
the Soviet economic system calls for a re-
examination (not necessarily a change but 
a reexamination) of our attitudes and Amer-
ican foreign policy. 
I warned you at the beginning that I was 
not going to assume that this change in eco-
nomic theory would make Russia a bosom 
pal of the United States. Neither can I as-
sume that it will make her more of an enemy. 
But in a way, the question of what to do 
about Russia's coming economic might is 
more perplexing than the what to do about 
the Chinese bomb * ? * because we know the 
bomb is evil as far as we are concerned, and 
we can't be sure whether Russia will use the 
atomic power of profits as a friend or as 
a foe. 
Of course, some folks say that we've been 
drifting toward Government control, cen-
tral planning, and deprofiting of American 
business and Government support of non-
productive nonworkers to the point where it 
won't be long until we cross systems with 
Russia and change sides. Wouldn't that be 
something. And It could happen. 
Certainly, we've just about wiped out pro-
duction incentive pay only to find Russia 
thriving on it. Would our unions accept a 
40 percent "you get It only if your produc-
tion sells" bonus and "management discre-
tion"? 
And, honest now, that Czech on TV said, 
"We in Czechoslovakia now believe (get this) 
that "what is good for society is also good 
for the individual company; and what is good 
for the individual company is good for so-
ciety."

Ever hear anything like that before? 
When an American said that he almost got 
jeered out of the President's Cabinet. 
Surely we want to avoid that switchover. 
But we'll have to watch our step. 
For Russia is now on the right track, eco-
nomically. 
And we know that Russians are smart and 
capable, as well as clever, so there's no need 
for us to underestimate them. 
They're wise to central planning and state-
supported nonworkers by now?they've had 
a go at it. Forty long say years of it. Boy, 
how they must regret those wasted years. 
Will they glorify initiative, profit, bonus, 
work, self-improvement, personal responsi-
bility, opportunity, salesmanship a ? * and 
start spreading wealth the "American" way? 
I think the odds are at least 80 to 20 that 
they will. 
Well, you make the U.S. foreign policy. 
How are you going to react? 
Do you want to encourage Russia toward 
a high-powered, highly motivated economic 
system? Should we show her how to build 
her marker-oriented economy now that she's 
willing to listen? 
Or, if we have any influence, should we try 
to talk her out of this "profitable idea"? 
She'll be asking * * * wanting to know how 
American salesmen do it. Asking for sales 
and advertising know-how. 
Will encouragement and help just be aid-
ing the enemy * a a or will it be man's last 
, great hope? 
What will happen if we do drift toward 
a Government-controlled central-planning, 
nonincentive, state support for nonworkers, 
system ? ? a until we cross the Russian drive 
toward their new, effective, decentralized, in-
centive, more-pay-for-more-effective-work 
system? 
Will we then become the second most 
powerful nation in the world, economically? 
Is this how they hope to "bury" us?with 
our own discarded weapons? 
You make policy in the United States. 
What do you think?

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DANTE B. FASCELL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 1965 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, last week 
I called upon the appropriate committees 
of Congress to insure that any agree-
ment between Cuba and the United 
States on the entry of Cuban refugees 
into this country must contain certain 
conditions and safeguards for the south 
Florida area as well as the United States, 
The response to that speech, Mr. 
Speaker, has been most gratifying. The 
chairmen of the appropriate subcommit-
tees have assured me of their full con-
sideration. Already the House Foreign 
Affairs Subcommittee on Inter-Ameri-
can Affairs has held hearings. 
Especially gratifying to me and to all 
the people of south Florida has been the 
expression by people in all parts of the 
United States of a willingness to assume 
both this privilege and the burden of 
additional thousands of Cuban refugees. 
Congress has recognized that the ref-
ugee problem is a national one, and I am 
happy that in this case it so ably reflects

Must be counted as jobless when they lose a 
job and search for another, the Department 
argues. 
, There is evidence, though, that any judg-
ment of the seriousness of current unemploy-
Went requires more than just an awareness 
of the over-all jobless rate. Interviews with 
more than 60 jobless individuals such as Mr. 
Anderson a,nd Mrs. Barita, at State unem-
ployment offices and other spots in the 
Youngstown, Pittsburgh, and Erie, Pa., areas 
and talks with State and Federal employment 
specialists in a number of States suggest that 
hard-core unemployment is a much smaller 
problem than the Government's official job-
less figure would indicate. 
FEW ARE UNDER REAL STRAIN 
? This survey indicates that a large segment 
of the ranks of the currently unemployed is 
Wade up of persons only temporarily idle 
while between lobs or not seeking employ-
ment in any more than a cursory manner. 
Another_ sizable group includes wives, sons 
or daughters of the family breadwinner, who 
often don't have to support their families. 
Many others are people who find it difficult 
to get work because of old age, lack of train-
ing, education or physical or emotional 
Capability. - 
A sampling of unemployed persons in 
Toungstown and Erie turned up 34 family 
household heads out of work. Of these, 
only four had been jobless longer than 3 
months, or were actively looking for work 
and were without immediate prospects. 
Ameng 16 nonbreaclwinners, only one wanted 
work and hadn't found it for some time. The 
rest were either laid off seasonally, were be-
tween jobs, or indica:ted they weren't under 
much strain to find another. Of the five who 
could be classed as hard-core unemployed, 
one Was a heart patient and one an alcoholic 
Stich sampling itself can be misleading, 
of course, since such persons as the large 
nurnber of teenagers in the market and the 
Unemployed who've exhausted their State 
payments obviously don't show up at State 
compensation offices. Nonetheless, nearly 
tWo-thirds of the Nation's unemployed are 
covered by such payments. And many State 
employment officials say their over-all job-
less rates are no-longer cause for major con-
cern. This gives evidence that the brisk 
economy is, for now anyway, overcoming the 
effects of automation on employment. 
In Ohio, where the jobless rate is about 
percent Heman Pound, director of unem-
ployment compensation, exclaims, "It's al-
most fantastic that you can get down this 
low in an industrial State. I don't know 
What full employment is, but this is getting 
pretty close.? 
The Journal survey turned up a good 
many persons even among jobless pay re-
cipients who weren't eager to find any job 
Other than one they might be recalled to, and 
some none at all, 
One reason for their lack of concern is that 
their joblessness is only temporary and not 
111,1111ns too much financially_ U.S. long-term-
Unemployment (15 weeks or more) was under 
3, percent at mid-September. State officials 
maintain that a considerable amount of 
short-term unemployment is inevitable as 
the result of such things as businesses clos-
ing and new ones starting, seasonal fluctua-
tions and other changes. 
. "I don't want to take any job that isn't 
better than- the one I had,' say g a laid-off 
, machine operator at a toy factory in Erie. 
He was put out of work about 21/2 months 
earlier because of the plant's seasonal close-
down, but with full expectation of early re-
call, Meanwhile, he has been subsisting on 
unemprOyment compensation. 
Many of the interviewed jobseekers weren't 
9,047, eager to find work even though 
they had' no 'Yong-term 'prospects for get-
ting employment. Mr. Anderson, the re-
tired steel plant worker, is a case in point. 
He says he was forced to retire at 65 in 1963 
and couldn't find a desirable job afterward?
one comparable to his $575-a-month mill 
position. 
"What the heck?they don't bother with 
an old man?too many young fellows out 
looking for work," Mr. Anderson snorts. He 
finally gave up seriously trying to find a 
job, though he still makes some modest at-
tempts, at least while drawing unemploy-
ment compensation benefits. Those benefits, 
which lately ran about $85 a month, supple-
mented $70 in pension from the steel mill, 
$124 in social security benefits and a $48-
per-month veteran's pension. The jobless 
pay ran out in June, but in September Mr. 
Anderson's wife started drawing $46.50 
monthly in social security benefits of her 
own. "I really didn't need a job," Mr. An-
derson admits; his income and living ex-
penses "run nip and tuck." 
A retired storm window salesman inter-
viewed in the Youngstown office of the State 
bureau of unemployment compensation ex-
presses a similar lack of fervor about seek-
ing work. He says he spends 41/2 months 
every winter as a racetrack betting teller in 
Florida, then comes home to Youngstown 
and collects jobless pay. "I'm 77?I can't 
get work here," he explains. 
State employment offices and private agen-
cies cite numerous instances of jobs going 
begging either because many persons ostensi-
bly in the labor force don't particularly want 
a job or are too selective in what they'll ac-
cept---.as to pay or type of work. State un-
employment officials in New York City report 
difficulty in filling such relatively unattrac-
tive and low-paying jobs as shirt-pressers in 
dry cleaning shops. And "thousands" of 
employable young persons in the Philadel-
phia area are "not only not work-oriented, 
but hardly even trying to find work," ac-
cording to Jack Brown, executive director of 
Pennsylvania's Bureau of Employment Secu-
rity. 
SOME JOBS SNUBBED 
Employment agencies say that many per-
sons who once would have filled domestic-
help positions now turn up their noses at be-
ing cooks, cleaning women, or maids, causing 
a surplus of such jobs. Servants willing to 
live in the homes where they work are espe-
cially hard to find, agencies say. 
Part of the problem of heavy Negro unem-
ployment, jobless experts add, is that Negroes 
no longer are willing to fill the menial jobs 
that they traditionally have held. The civil 
rights movement of the last few years has 
helped foster a resentment toward such work, 
they say, and the low pay of many such jobs 
often doesn't offer enough attraction to Ne-
groes who are already getting relief benefits. 
Harry King, a 40-year-old Negro who for-
merly drew $1.75 an hour washing windows 
of high-rise buildings, lost his job last sum-
mer when the washing concern folded. He's 
been taking in $100 a month, often less, by 
odd painting jobs. He also gets $41.50 twice 
a month on relief. Standing on a street cor-
ner in Pittsburgh's Hill district, a Negro 
ghetto, Mr. King makes it clear that he 
doesn't want any job that pays under $70 a 
week. "What's the sense of my taking a 
job for less?" he asks. "By the time I pay 
carfare and my rent, I've got nothing left. 
Very few people mind working, but they'd 
like to get something for it." 
There are also a number of jobless persons 
Who want work and probably could find it if 
they were willing or able to move to get avail-
able jobs. When a major steel company in-
terviewed over 1,200 men laid off when Stude-
baker Corp. closed its South Bend, Ind., plant 
in an attempt to 1111 openings for steelwork-
ers at a mill about 50 miles away, only 3 
ended up being hired. 
"I would have said that everybody we in-
terviewed was suitable?we'd have taken 
them, but they didn't take us," comments an 
official of the steel company. 
Many jobless persons, to be sure, are seri-
ous about wanting work. But, it is also 
clear, an important segment of that group 
isn't in dire need of jobs and their inclusion 
in Government statistics on the unemployed 
app rs to saint an unduly gloomy picture. 
AN REFUGEE SITUATION 
(Mr. HARVEY of Indiana (at the re-
quest of Mr. BROYHILL of North Caro-
lina) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. HARVEY of Indiana. Mr. 
Speaker, on my monthly radio-TV 
broadcast, which goes back to my con-
gressional district in Indiana, I had as 
my guest yesterday my good friend and 
colleague, Congressman PAUL ROGERS of 
Florida. 
Because of Mr. Room' interest and 
understanding of the Cuban refugee sit-
uation and, since he represents a section 
of south Florida, it is my feeling that the 
Congress and the Nation should be inter-
ested in Congressman ROGERS' observa-
tions. 
During our discussion, I am happy to 
say, Congressman ROGERS offered many 
enlightening observations; however, one 
of the most important referred to the 
fact that Castro unilaterally initiated the 
recent sending of refugees to our shores, 
without the consideration or the release 
of hostages or political prisoners. 
Mr. ROGERS went on to say that it is 
Indeed a pitiful sight to see these people 
landing on our shores in boats of all 
kinds. It was also mentioned that it is 
unfortunate the Organization of Amer-
ican States has not been invited to play 
a more predominant role in the final 
determination of the fate of these people. 
As a Congressman from the Midwest 
it seems appropriate to remind my col-
leagues that this problem is not a local-
ized problem, affecting only Florida, but 
it is a national problem involving 
security. 
The fact remains that our intelligence 
sources were caught completely off guard 
by Castro's announcement and the prob-
lem of screening processes?which must 
necessarily go on to insure that Castro 
is not planting agents in the United 
States?is a real difficult one which I 
believe the Congress should concern it-
self with. With Cuba now a Communist 
satellite in our hemisphere every pre-
caution must be taken to insure the 
authenticity of these refugees. 
Insofar as the reuniting of families is 
concerned, there is no question about the 
justifiable humanitarian side of this 
problem. We owe the State of Florida 
our applause for what she is doing for 
these people; however, as it relates to 
the Nation, it seems in order to remind 
the Nation of the Communist doctrine 
as it tries to infiltrate and conquer from 
within. 
Again, my thanks to Congressman 
ROGERS for sharing his valuable time 
with me and the people of the 10th Con-
gressional District in Indiana. 
PROPOSAL TO MAKE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA PART OF THE STATE 
OF MARYLAND 
(Mr. BETTS (at the request of Mr. 
BROYHILL of North Carolina) was granted 
rermisscon to extend his remarks at this

would train at the same time for the 
,job, not with company X, but with 
tiOrnpally Y. Of course, company X should 
'not be charged with the cost of the retrain-
ing from Which it derives no economic bene-
fit, 4tne?ver, it would be relatively easy to 
Set tip -the mechanism whereby the costs of 
refiaining could be borne by the ultimate 
rtar. Furthermore, the Federal tax laws in-
hibit, instead of encourage, the mobility and 
flexibility of labor which are so vital in 
coping with frictional and structural unem-
ployment. 
Probably the reality most often overlooked 
is that the displaced worker frequently is 
not the one best suited to be trained to 
take on the newly created job. The obsolete 
jobs tend to be considerably inferior to the 
jobs newly created by automation. Further-
more, the jobs going begging today are Jobs 
which demand skills higher than the na-
tional average of skills. The process of train-
ing for the high skills in demand usually 
requires that a person holding down a good 
job upgrade his skill in order to prepare for 
the new and better job. His old job then 
becomes available for someone below him in 
the ladder of skills, who will upgrade his 
skill in a similar and simultaneous manner 
through night school or on-the-job training. 
Meeting the changes demanded by automa-
tion requires a massive and constant up-
grading process all along society's ladder of 
skills. 
A person holding down a job which is 
too easy for him does a disservice to himself, 
to society, and to the person with less natural 
abilities who could be doing the less demand-
ing job. For example, a person with two arms 
who preempts a job which a one-armed man 
might do and who refuses to undertake an 
available job which requires two arms 
thwarts the upgrading process which auto-
mation demands. 
Finally, I would observe that possibly we 
face a problem which has never before been 
presented to us quite so clearly. Yet it is 
an age-old problem. With the continued 
upgrading of skills and with greater em-
phasis upon brain instead of brawn, those 
who were born with very limited mental 
talents could be phased out of the labor 
market. Throughout much of history the 
person deficient in brawn tended to be an 
economic drone. A similar situation may 
now be developing with regard to those en-
dowed with very limited mental capacities. 
However, / believe that by a system of proper 
job analysis we can find a sufficient number 
of economically sound jobs which persons of 
limited IQ can perform. Even many of 
those we presently institutionalize can per-
form useful tasks during a period of cyber-
nation. After all, a human brain with a 
60 IQ is still a much more versatile and 
usable thinking apparatus, particularly with 
regard to dealing with variables, then the 
inost talented computer. 
MANY IN UNEMPLOYMENT COUNT 
DO NOT COUNT 
(Mr. CURTIS (at the request of Mr. 
Baovnna. of North Carolina) was 
granted permission to extend his re-
marks at this point in the RECORD and 
to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, the ad-
ministration places a strong emphasis on 
reducing the unemployment rate to an 
arbitrarily defined level. This level is 
now set at 4 percent of the work force 
as measured by our present Bureau of 
Labor Statistics-BLS. The administra-
tion seems to forget that our unemploy-
ment statistical series gives us at best a 
very crude indication of real unemploy-
ment. Criticism comes from opposite 
sides, one side arguing from time to time 
that the series underestimates real un-
employment, the other side arguing that 
it overestimates real unemployment. My 
01/11 judgment is that probably both sides 
are correct. When we are in an economic 
doWnturn the series tends to underesti-
mate and in periods of economic upturn 
it overestimates. 
A recent survey conducted by the Wall 
Street Journal indicates that the present 
estimate of unemployment, 4.4 percent 
of the work force in September, is un-
realistically high and that determina-
tion of the real significance of the pres-
ent level of unemployment requires more 
than just an awareness of the overall 
jobless rate. The survey concluded that 
a large segment of the group presently 
labeled "unemployed" is made up of per-
sons only temporarily idle while between 
jobs or not seeking employment in any 
more than a cursory manner. Another 
sizable portion includes wives, sons, or 
daughters of the family breadwinner. 
These unemployed often do not need 
work to support their families. Many 
others are people who find it difficult to 
get work because of old age, lack of train-
ing, education or physical or emotional 
capability. 
There is a further sign that unem-
ployment may not be as bad as the sta-
tistical sampling leads us to believe. 
State employment offices and private 
agencies cite numerous instances of jobs 
going begging either because many per-
sons ostensibly in the labor force do not 
really want a job or are too selective in 
what pay or type of work they will se-
lect. What is true, I believe, is that there 
is a high incidence of people not work-
ing in our society, not working because 
of lack or incentive or lack of skills, not 
because of a lack of jobs. Not working 
Is not the same as unemployed as de-
fined in our BLS unemployment sta-
tistics. 
The proof of this important fact lies in 
a statistical series to which too little 
attention has been paid; namely, the 
"Labor Force Participation Rate." In 
1964 that rate was 57.4 percent, the low-
est since 1947. The rate in 1956 was 59.3 
percent, and averaged 58.54 percent for 
the decade 1951-60. The average for 
the first 4 years of this decade 1961-64 is 
57.51 percent. If the labor force par-
ticipation rate in 1964 was 59.3 percent 
as it was in 1956, and not 57.4 percent, 
2,548,717 more, men and women would 
halt been in the labor force. Attention

Still Jobless?" in the RECORD at this point. 
wHo Is STILL JOBLESS?-MANY IN GOVERN-
MENT'S COUNT ARE No UNDER STRAIN To 
WORK 
(By Albert R. Karr) 
YOTJNGSTOWN.-William J. Anderson, 66, 
relaxes on a lounge chair on the front porch 
of his modest home here and relates how he 
retired as a steel plant millwright late in 
1963. He looked for a job until his Ohio un-
employment compensation ran out last June 
and since then has taken life easy. 
"I do not want to be tied down anymore-
I worked since I was 10 years old and that 
was long enough," he says. 
In nearby Hubbard, Ohio, Mrs. Kay Barita, 
52, leaves her chores in her paneled kitchen 
long enough to tell a visitor how she worked 
for 20 years until she was laid off at a meat 
packing factory last fall. For half a year she 
drew $42 a week in jobless pay, which came 
on top of her husband's take-home pay of 
about $125 a week. She tried until recently 
to find a new job. Now, she says, "They have 
my name. If they need anybody, they can 
just call me." 
Mr. Anderson and Mrs. Barita are among a 
good many people throughout the United 
States who recently have been looking for a 
job. Also, like an unknown number of oth-
ers, they haven't been particularly eager to 
find work, are not in serious need of employ-
ment and are not readily employable. 
Significantly, either one conceivably could 
have been counted as unemployed in the 
U.S. Government's monthly survey of the 
Nation's work force and thus contributed to 
the sample on which Uncle Sam calculated 
the percent of the work force that is jobless. 
Any interviewees who say they are not work-
ing and are looking for a job are classed as 
unemployed. Yet neither Mr. Anderson nor 
Mrs. Barita would seem to fit most people's 
notion of the "hard-core unemployed"-
those desperate for jobs who are searching 
for any means to keep themselves and their 
families clothed and fed. 
FIGURES 'UNDER FIRE 
How typical are people like Mr. Anderson 
and Mrs. Barita among the unemployed? 
No one knows for sure, partly because it is 
nearly impossible to say whether a particu-
lar person really wants a job and needs it. 
But there is a growing amount of criticism 
of use of the Government's raw figures on the 
total unemployed. 
Administration officials were pleased that 
the official jobless rate dropped to 4.5 percent 
of the work force in mid-July, the lowest since 
1957, in the face of a seasonal influx of teen-
agers in the job market, and fell further to 
4.4 percent in mid-September. But they still 
express concern at even this much unemploy-
ment in a record-shattering economy. 
Many of the critics say that the 4.4 per-
cent figure is unrealistically high and is used 
wrongly to justify Government measures 
aimed at creating jobs. Federal officials, 
while admitting their jobless estimate is an 
imperfect measure of unemployment, say 
that any alternative method might under-
state or overstate the problem even more. 
So-called "secondary workers" such as teen-
agers and married women are included in 
the listing of' unemployed, the Labor Depart-
ment says, because they account for over 
one-fourth of all workers; if they're to be 
counted as employed when working, they

point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr BE'r IS Mr. Speaker, only with 
the thought of trying to be helpful, I am 
offering a plan for the solution of the 
District of Columbia problem. In doing 
this, I make the following observations: 
First, pure home rule is difficult to re-
solve because of a genuine constitutional 
question as well as the inability to solve 
the problem of financing; 
Second, representation by a nonvoting 
delegate is no representation at all; 
Third, giving the District two Senators 
and representation in the House on the 
basis of its population elevates it to the 
rank of a State when, as a matter of law 
and fact, it is only a city; and 
Fourth, it is, however, difficult to deny 
any community as large and important 
as the District of Columbia the right of 
representation in the Federal Congress. 
This is more justified than home rule. 
After all, representation is basic in our 
philosophy of government. 
I have therefore introduced a resolu-
tion for a constitutional amendment 
providing that, for the purpose of rep-
resentation in Congress, the District 
shall be considered a part of the State of 
Maryland. This would permit its local 
government to remain, as now, under the 
legislative control of Congress. But it 
would, provide representation. in the 
body which controls it. The two Mary-
land Senators would represent both the 
State and the District and be elected by 
the voters of both the State and the 
District. The District of Columbia would 
be divided into congressional districts as 
if it were a part of Maryland and, for the 
purpose of redistricting, Maryland and 
the District would be considered together 
as if they were one State. 
This plan could not be classified as 
retrocession because nothing would be 
ceded to Maryland. It would leave the 
District just as it is, a Federal city under 
legislative control of Congress, but, at 
the same time givetits residents repre-
sentation in Congress. 
Such a proposal does, however, con-
flict with the 23d amendment, which 
treats the District as an entity. This 
difficulty is best overcome by repeal of 
the 23d amendment and inclusion of its 
provision in the new proposal. The 
resolution reads as follows: 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America 
In Congress assembled (two-thirds of each 
House concurring therein), That the follow-
ing article is proposed as an amendment to 
the Constitntion of the United States, which 
shall be valid to all intents and purposes as 
part of the Constitution only if ratified by 
the Congress.

CONGRESSMAN CLEVELAND COM-
MENTS ON RESULTS OF SECOND 
NEW HAMPSHIRE DISTRICT 
QUESTIONNAIRE 
(Mr. CLEVELAND (at the request of 
Mr. BROYHILL of North Carolina) was 
granted permission to extend his re-
marks at this /point in the RECORD and 
to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, for 
the third successive year, I have sent 
questionnaires to my? constituents and 
wish to take this opportunity of present-
ing the results to the House. I wish I 
could also share with my colleagues the 
many interesting and constructive com-
ments which constituelits returned with 
their answers but space limitations do 
not permit. 
The questionnaire was mailed general-
ly to all postal patrons in my district last 
June. I believe the replies are an im-
portant indication of how a large group 
of thoughtful citizens feel about some of 
the current issues facing the Nation. 
LUMP LEGISLATION 
Because so many of the legislative pro-
posals of the Great Society come to us 
packaged in large omnibus bills contain-
ing numerous, distinctly separate pro-
grams under one attractive-sounding 
title, it proved difficult to frame questions 
that could be answered "yes" or "no." 
. There is a growing tendency to legislate 
by lump and by label, a tendency I view 
with concern. This situation, however, 
provides no excuse for not asking the 
people how they feel on the issues and, 
although I do not always agree with my 
constituency?and cerainly all of them 
do not always agree with me?I think it 
is important to the cause of good gov-
ernment that issues be discussed and 
ideas exchanged. 
In the following reporting of the re-
sults, I have noted not only the "yes," 
"no" and "not sure" tabulations but also 
the figures showing the number of 
blanks, which in some instances are sig-
nificant. Question 9(c), for example, ap-
parently was poorly drafted as indicated 
by the large number who did not answer 
it. 
DISTRICT SWITCHES ON FOREIGN AID 
Perhaps the most significant informa-
tion provided by the results is the gen-
eral disfavor now accorded by my dis-
trict to the foreign aid program. My 
previous polls had not clearly indicated 
this. It is obvious that my constituents 
now feel that the foreign aid program 
should be carefully reevaluated and I 
agree. 
Before getting to the results, I want to 
comment briefly on my own positions on 
the questions. Many constituents who 
replied asked how I felt on these issues 
and I think they are entitled to know. 
CLEVELAND ANSWERS QUESTIONNAIRE 
I am on record as supporting U.S. 
policy generally in Vietnam and the 
Dominican Republic, although reserv-
ing, of course, the right' to criticize 
these policies when I think they are 
26895 
wrong. My chief criticism continues to 
be that our Government has not made 
our intentions to stand by our commit-
ments clear enough. Such failures, in 
my, opinion, have always encouraged 
miscalculations by aggressors. 
I voted again' thisyear to continue the 
foreign aid program, although I voted 
for the moderate cuts that were made 
and voted, also, against continuing aid 
to Indonesia and Egypt, and countries 
trading with North Vietnam. 
AcAncsr REPEAL OF 14(b) 
I voted against repeal of section 14(b) 
of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act. I sup-
ported the voting rights bill, after first 
cosponsoring and voting for the broad-
er, more equitable Republican alterna-
tive, which, among- other things, would 
have retained literacy tests where not 
clearly discriminatory. Also, I voted for 
the clean elections amendment proposed 
by Republicans to help insure that bal-
lots are honestly cast and counted. 
I have long favored increasing a Con-
gressman's term from 2 to 4 years, but 
only if there is added a limit on the 
number of terms that a Congressman 
can serve consecutively. 
GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION 
Although I strongly oppose Senator 
DODD'S gun control bill (S. 1592) because 
it goes too far, I do feel that strengthen-
ing of Federal control over the distribu-
tion of firearms is in order. I will sup-
port legislation that bans the shipment 
across State lines of mail-order weapons 
to those under 18 and to persons with 
felony convictions. I would support 
Federal control over the transportation 
of concealed firearms, and I would sup-
port legislation to impose increased pen-
alties for crimes involving the misuse of 
firearms, and legislation to curb the flood 
of foreign firearms that are being 
dumped here. In my opinion, the fore-
going objectives can be obtained without 
denying ownership of firearms to Amer-
ican citizens of good repute using them 
for lawful purposes. Legitimate gun 
dealers, hobbyists and sportsmen need 
not be penalized nor should any legisla-
tion be permitted to infringe on a citi-
zen's right to keep and bear arms as 
guaranteed by the second amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. 
NEW DEPARTMENT?FARM SUBSIDIES?
IMMIGRATION 
I voted against creating the new Cabi-
net-level Department of Housing and 
Urban Affairs, supporting instead the 
Republican proposal to create a new of-
fice of Housing in the Executive Office of 
the President. This would have done 
the job more efficiently, I believe, and 
was far more comprehensive. I strongly 
favor limiting the dollar amount of sub-
sidies that could be paid to any one farm 
or farmer. Evidence from governmental 
sources shows that Federal farm subsid-
ies are going to large farm operations 
in disproportionate amounts while the 
small farmer is not being helped. 
I voted for the new immigration law, 
the chief purposes of which are to permit 
the reuniting of families, the entry of 
persons with needed skills, and the abo-
lition of the outmoded national origins 
quota systems.

DRAFT-IMPORTS-REFORMS NEEDED 
I oppose ending the military draft but 
favor a revision of procedures to guar-
antee fairer and more equitable treat-
ment for all young men. 
I favor Federal income tax exemptions 
or credits far the cost of higher educa-
tion and have introduced legislation to

I favor quantitative restrictions or 
agreed upon quotas to limit imports of 
woolen products as promised by the Ad-
ministration for 4 years, and also re-
strictions and quotas for other imports 
of a similar nature. Beyond that, I have 
long advocated a general reform of the 
U.S. tariff schedule so that the rates of 
duties will reflect the differing wage rates 
in foreign countries shipping goods to us. 
New rates should also reflect those cases 
where the manufacturing of goods being 
shipped to the United States is being sub-
Questionnaire results 
sidized by foreign governments. The 
purpose of such rates would not be pro-

FURTHER COMMENT ON CONDI-
TIONS AT THE SALT LAKE CITY, 
UTAH, VETERANS' ADMINISTRA-
TION HOSPITAL 
(Mr. SAYLOR (at the request of Mr. 
BROYHILL of North Carolina) was 
granted permission to extend his re-
marks at this point in the RECORD and 
to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, Members 
will recall that on Tuesday, the 19th, 
I made reference in the RECORD and 
quoted a number of passages from an 
official report of the Veterans' Adminis-
tration concerning conditions at the Vet-
erans' Administration Hospital, Salt 
Lake City, Utah. May I emphasize 
that the report is an official VA report; 
It is not conclusions or findings on my 
part. 
This morning, I was visited by the 
Associate Deputy Administrator, the 
Deputy Chief Medical Director, and 
an Assistant Chief Medical Director, who 
presented me with the following state-
ment on behalf of Dr. McNinch, the Chief 
Medical Director, which I ask unanimous 
consent to insert as a part of my re-
marks at this point: 
STATEMENT BY DR. JOSEPH H. McNINcH, VA's 
CHIEF MEDICAL DIRECTOR, ON THE SALT LAKE 
CITY VA HOSPITAL 
The recent publicity of alleged irregulari-
ties at the Salt Lake City VA Hospital was 
based on a report by VA's own InternaL audit 
service following an extensive audit of sta-
tion activities. Such audits are conducted 
periodically within the VA organization as a 
sound management device to assure the ade-
quacy of personnel and programs. 
A followup study of the report by our De-
partment of Medicine and Surgery generally 
supported the findings of the internal audit 
service, and corrective action has been taken. 
I am satisfied personally that the hospital 
is rendering excellent medical care to sick 
and disabled veterans, and that the adminis-
trative laxities that were uncovered have been 
ended. 
By far the most serious of the allegations 
was that resident physicians had refused a 
nurse's request to check the condition of a 
patient she believed to be seriously ill. The 
hospital director confirmed this allegation, 
and reported that it involved isolated inci-
dents on just one of the many wards at the 
hospital-a geriatric ward. Partly to blame 
was a misunderstanding between the psy-
chiatric service and the medical service as 
to supervisory responsibility for the geriatric 
ward. 
The officer-of-the-day physician deter-
mined to be primarily responsible for non-
response to the nurse's request was repri-
manded by the hospital chief of staff the day 
immediately following the first incident. 
When the same resident physician-who has 
since left VA's employ-again failed to re-
spond in a similar situation, the patient was 
seen in a matter of minutes by another 
physician. Although some irregularities in-
cluded in the audit 'report required further 
Investigation and confirmation, I considered 
the failure of physicians to respond to call 
so serious that, when I received the audit re-
port, I took immediate action to require the 
director to take measures to assure there 
would be no repetition of such incidents. I 
have received assurances that there will be 
none. 
On October 12, the Administrator of Vet-
erans' Affairs approved disciplinary actions 
recommended by me in connection with the 
total report on the hospital. These actions, 
which are now being carried out, will be 
noted In the official records for each of staff 
members involved. 
Mr. Speaker, I also insert as a part of 
my remarks the text of letters presented 
to me by officials of the Veterans' Ad-
ministration at their conference previ-
ously referred to: 
AUGUST 30, 1965. 
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR, 
VA Hospital, 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Dear : I have had presented to me the 
report of internal audit that was conducted 
at your station from May 19 to July 23. This 
report has some 210 recommendations., 
These are not yet fully staffed out because 
of the brief time that has elapsed since 
receipt. 
There are three items which do not need 
further staff work to announce my positive 
position. I want my positive position to be 
known to you and I desire that you make 
this position crystal clear to every member 
of your professional staff. 
Item 1: It is set forth in the audit report 
(p. VIII-2) that "some service chiefs state 
that their primary responsibility is to the 
teaching program first, research second, and 
the care of the veteran third." Nothing 
could be farther from the truth. I have on 
many occasions stated in strong language 
that the primary mission of DM & S is the 
care and treatment of the veteran patient.. 
It is for the purpose of strengthening our 
medical competency to achieve this goal that 
we engage in the most worthwhile activities 
of research and teaching. It does the VA 
medical program irreparable damage to have 
members of the professional staff disseminate 
such Ill conceived and fallacious views. You 
are directed to take immediate steps to see 
that these staff members are properly 
oriented to the mission of DM & S. 
Item 2: I am most distressed to read in 
the internal audit report (p. VIII 4-5) about 
the difficulties that your station is experienc-
ing in getting proper OD coverage of the 
geriatric ward. It is inconceivable that 
physicians will refuse to respond to emer-
gency calls from nurses who are caring for 
these patients as apparently is occurring at 
your station. Has the age of specialization. 
advanced (regressed) to that degree that 
specialists have relinquished their profes-
sional and moral obligations to the sufferer.

FOCUS 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, an ar-
ticulate and dedicated Harvard-trained 
Cuban exile, Dr. N'estor Carbonell, Jr., 
delivered a speech early this year which 
escaped the attention of the Nation's 
Press. Dr. Carbonell addressed the 
Second Annual Conference on Latin 
American Affairs at Princeton University 
on April 24, 1965. His four-part speech 
was entitled, "Cuba in Focus." I rec-
ommend it to the attention of my col-
leagues and readers of the RECORD and 
ask that it be printed in the body of the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CUBA IN FOCUS 
(Address delivered by Dr. Nestor Carbonell, 
Jr., at the Second Annual Conference on 
Latin American Affairs, Princeton Univer-
sity, on April 24, 1965) 
I. warms VERSUS FALLACIES 
welcome this opportunity to participate 
in this seminar on Cuba, organized under the 
auspices of a leading university which pro-
motes the exchange of ideas, the confronta-
tion of opinions, In an atmosphere of free-
dom. and respect for all. 
I value very highly the inalienable right to 
concur or dissent which we are exercising 
here today, for I come from a country where 
this right no longer exists. It has been 
abolished by a regime which boasts of having 
popular support, but does not dare to hold 
free elections; which claims to be fulfilling 
the economic and aocial 'needs of the people 
of Cuba, but has had to ration food, clothing, 
and other 'essentials of human life. A regime 
Which promised to embrace the doctrine of 
humanism, but has resorted to purges, mas-
sive arrests and deportations, and to the fir-
ing squad. A regime which purported to 
Convert the barracks of the Batista dictator-
ship into schools, but has transformed the 
island into the second military power of this 
hemisphere. A regime which announced the 
Mass distribution of private estates and 
farms among the peasants, but which instead 
?reaped large State cooperatives, policed by 
the government and opposed by an increas-
ing number of peasants, whose resistance or 
lack of iriterest has determined a decline of 
more than 45 percent in the levels of agricul-
tural production. A regime which raised the 
banner of national independence and self-
determination, but has converted Cuba into 
a Soviet colony which threatens the peace 
and security of the hemisphere and disrupts 
the Alliance for Progress plans of economic 
development and social reforms for Latin 
'America. 
R. 110'w DID IT HAPPEN? 
You may still wonder how could this have

Cubaj, tioW could this Coirimunist takeover

dictator lied under the pressure exerted by 
'national resistance and by the embargo upon 
slpments of arms to Cuba decreed by the 
v Ment Of the '17nUed StateS, 
0 entrenched in the mountains and 
portraYek aS an evangelic redeemer by a 
, 
formidable international propaganda ap-
paratus, took advantage of the political 
vacuum which ensued. His promises of free-
dom, honesty in public administration and 
economic and social reforms under our 1940 
Constitution, were only intended to give him 
time to place his men in key posts and to 
lay the foundations of the Communist 
regime. 
When demagogic slogans did not suffice 
to calm the people of Cuba, the Castro regime 
resorted to class struggle and to the dis-
semination of terror. Thousands of Cubans 
from all walks of life were either arrested, 
executed, or exiled. In spite of this, inter-
nal resistance, which included sabotage in 
the cities and guerrillas in the mountains, 
began to undermine the regime. Then came 
the Bay of Pigs disaster which allowed Castro 
to defeat the invading forces and to capture 
many of the underground leaders who had 
not been informed of the details of the in-
vasion. Notwithstanding this major defeat, 
Internal resistance grew again, and it grew 
so powerful, that the Castro regime pierced 
the veil of Communist secrecy to secure the 
open and massive military aid from the So-
viet bloc. 
Even though the captive people of Cuba 
have not received the corresponding support 
from the Americas, in accordance with the 
Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assist-
ance, the struggle against Communist do-
mination continues inside Cuba, and the 
ramifications of the conspiracy against the 
Castro regime have reached the upper strata 
of the army and the militia, which at this 
very moment are being subjected to another 
violent and indiscriminate purge. 
III. WHY CUBA? 
Why was Cuba chosen by international 
communism as its launching pad for subver-
sion and aggression in this hemisphere? A 
close look at the map of the Americas will 
give us the answer. From a geo-political 
standpoint, Cuba lies in the center of what 
has been called the American Mediterranean. 
Ever since its discovery by Columbus in 1492, 
Cuba has been regarded as a key to the new 
world. 
In connection with the strategic impor-
tance of Cuba and the threat posed by its 
progressive fortification and subversive 
activities, a noted American strategist, Brig. 
Gen. J. D. Hittle, stated the following: 
"Cuba stands astride the north-south sea 
lanes upon which the wartime survival and 
the economic well-being of the Americas de-
pend. It commands the Caribbean and the 
Atlantic approaches to the Panama Canal." 
"The Russian takeover of Cuba constitutes 
the most significant strategic achievement of 
world CODUITUDISIII SUICD_ the fall of mainland 
China in the Red orbit. What it means is 
that Russian communism has leap-frogged 
NATO, jumped the Atlantic, Which histori-
cally has been our protecting moat, and 
established a bastion in the strategic heart of 
the Western Hemisphere." (ColmasssioNAL 
RECORD, Appendix*, July 25, 1963, pp. A4697-
A4698.) 
The entire hemisphere, especially the Latin 
American republics, have suffered the lethal 
effects of the Communist takeover of Cuba, 
which is used as a training center for Latin 
American terrorists, as an arsenal which sup-
plies arms and ammunitions to Communist 
guerrillas, primarily in Colombia, Venezuela, 
and Guatemala, and as headquarters for So-
viet espionage, propaganda and infiltration 
In the Americas. 
Today, two and a half years after the Oc-
tober missile crisis, the fortification of the 
Island continues under the direction of So-
viet experts. Military installations are still 
being constructed or enlarged, some of them 
connected with reinforced caves and tunnels, 
or with the deep bays of Cuba. 
` the Cuban underground has recently' re-
pm-ted the arrival of a great variety of highly 
sensitive electronic equipment from the So-
viet Union, supplementing those previously 
Installed in Cuba. It is very difficult to de-
termine at this `time the purpose or implica-
tions of this electronic buildup. However, it 
is pertinent to recall that the Senate Pre-
paredness Subcommittee of the United States 
disclosed not too long ago that "the potential 
exists to establish electronic warfare capa-
bilities based on Cuba," and that "potenti-
ally, Cuba is a base from which the Soviets 
Could interdict our vital air and sea lanes. 
It can now be used for the air, sea, and elec-
tronic surveillance of our military activities 
in the Southeast United States and the 
Caribbean." (Interim report on the Cuban 
military build-up issued by the Senate Pre-
paredness Subcommittee, May 9, 1963.) 
IV. WHAT TO DO 
Faced with this grave challenge, what can 
we do? 
The majority of freedom-loving Cubans 
do not expect, nor desire to turn back the 
clock of history, but rather look to the fu-
ture for opportunities to attain social and 
economic progress and political stability un-
der freely elected governments. With this 
In our mind and in our heart, we shall con-
tinue to exercise our inherent right to 
struggle against oppression. 
This right, which is also a solemn obliga-
tion, shall not be relinquished now as it 
was not relinquished during the 30-year 
struggle against Spanish colonial rule. Re-
sistance against the Cuban Communist re-
gime shall continue through all possible 
means, including sabotage, infiltration and 
psychological and guerrilla ?warfare; with 
full knowledge that the odds are now against 
us, but with the firm conviction that the 
will of our freedom-loving people shall ulti-
mately prevail. 
Our objective is not only to recover our 
national independence and our right to self-
determination, but also to prevent a major 
world conflagration which would certainly 
ensue if international communism is allowed 
to endure in Cuba and to make new inroads 
upon Latin America. 
As we continue this bitter struggle, we 
trust that this great country will honor the 
1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal 
Assistance and the 1962 Congressional Joint 
Resolution on Cuba, whereby the United 
States committed itself to "work with the 
Organization of American States and with 
freedom-loving Cubans to support the as-
pirations of the Cuban people for self-
determination." 
From this powerful and generous country 
we expect the recognition of our belligerence 
and the aid consistent with its national in-
terests and worldwide commitments. 
International communism cannot and will 
not separate us. In times of peril and in 
times of peace, in times of sorrow and in 
times of joy, in times of despair and in 
times of hope, we shall remain united. For 
Cuba and the United States are indissolubly 
linked by geography, history, and the com-
mon ideals of freedom and progress under 
God. 
WATER SHORTAGES 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, I have ad-
dressed the Senate on several occasions 
during this session on the question of 
water shortages and the urgent need to 
increase our supplies of potable water. 
We must redouble our efforts in solving 
the problems of pollution. We must 
conserve our water through control of 
evaporation. We must experiment with 
weather modification in order to pro-
vide more Wafer. We must divert from

surplus areas to water deficient areas. 
We must desalinize our sea water and 
convert our brackish water into fresh, 
? pure water. We must work with our 
neighbors to bring water from remote 
areas of the continent into the dry 
areas of this great North American Con-
tinent. Today, I wish to call the atten-
tion of the Senate to recent publications 
on water and suggest that they be read 
In full. 
The first is the October 23 issue of 
the Saturday Review which contains a 
series of articles under the general head-
ing, "The Crisis in Water." Since the 
articles are lengthy, I do not ask that 
they be reprinted in the RECORD, but I 
highly commend them for reading by my 
colleagues. I would hope that all of 
them could read the articles in there 
by Stewart Udall, Wallace Stegner, Glad-
win Hill, and John Leer, as well as re-
gional reports from various areas of our 
country. 
The second is an article that appears 
in the current issue of the U.S. News & 
World Report, and is an interview with 
General Cassidy, the Chief of the Army 
Engineers. I ask unanimous consent 
that the article in the U.S. News & World 
Report be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
WATER PROBLEM IN UNITED STATES?WHAT 
CAN BE DONE ABOUT Ir: INTERVIEW WITH 
THE CHIEF OF THE ARMY CORPS OF EN-
GINEERS 
(NOTE?Is the United States running out 
of water? Will water troubles keep getting 
worse? Isn't there anything the country 
can do to assure adequate supplies of water, 
ready at the tap and free of pollution? What 
about floods? Can water problems be solved 
by trapping flood waters and then releasing 
them later when shortages threaten? These 
and related questions are on the minds of 
millions as water problems?drought, floods, 
pollution?Spread across the country. To 
get authoritative answers, U.S. News & World 
Report invited Lt. Gen. William F. Cassidy, 
Chief of Army Engineers, to its conference 
room for this interview with staff members.) 
Question. General Cassidy, as population 
skyrockets on the east coast, on the west 
coast, and in other areas, is there to be a 
water problem of major proportions in this 
country? 
Answer. I would say that there are ma-
jor water problems right now. There are 
parts of the United States, most of them in 
the West, where the balance between water 
supply and demand is now and always has 
been precarious. And now In a part of the 
country where we have always thought of 
water as being abundant we are faced with a 
difficult problem. 
Question. Do you mean in the East? 
Answer. That's right. 
Question. Is? the problem in the East one 
of water supply or proper utilization, or both? 
Answer. Both. The drought has lasted for 
4 years. But, basically, there is sufficient 
water in the East?both surface water and 
ground water. But some of the sources have 
become heavily polluted and are no longer 
usable. There is pollution by industry, pol-
lution by municipalities, and there is salt-
water pollution. 
All these things are going on in the East, 
where we see a metropolitan area taking 
shape that stretches all the way from. Boston 
down to Norfolk. To meet the needs of this 
vast strip city in the future, we must spread 
out and have a fully planned program of 
water development. 
At the same time, we can't overlook prob-
lems that are developing all across the 
United States. Unless we get busy now, some 
parts of the country will face serious short-
ages by 1980, because by then our demand for 
water is going to double. And then demand 
will almost double again by the year 2000. 
Question. What should be done to assure 
all parts of the United States enough water 
In the future? 
Answer. Proper water management is the 
key. That means many things: pollution 
control and pollution abatement to protect 
the quality of water; transfer of water from 
one river basin to another; storage of heavy 
runoffs so that we prevent floods and, at the 
same time, save water for future use. Cer-
tainly the drought in the East illustrates the 
need for proper water management. 
Question. Is the East going to face more 
severe shortages of water in the future than 
the West? 
Answer. Not if water use and development 
is managed properly. There is more water in 
the East than there is in the West, so that, 
cared for properly?and this very definitely 
means conservation and pollution control?
the East can go a long time before it becomes 
as short as the West. 
Question. Where are the shortages most 
serious? 
Answer. The areas of most serious short-
age, taking them by basins, are these: the 
upper Rio Grande and the Pecos; the south-
ern California area, although the California 
water plan will go a long way toward solving 
that problem; the upper Missouri area. 
These are the areas that will suffer the 
earliest shortages, if we think of the way 
those areas would like to develop in the 
future. Their development may be limited 
by water shortages. 
Question. When you listed the basins 
which face the worst shortages, you didn't 
mention the Delaware or the Hudson. Why 
pot? 
Answer. We were talking about severe 
water shortages. That area is not short on 
water. It requires development and proper 
management. As you get out in the West, 
it becomes a question of amount of water 
potentially available for development. 
WHAT THE EAST CAN DO?
Question. Is the vast metropolitan area 
from Boston to Norfolk going to have to shift 
to some elaborate water plan such as the 
one in California? 
Answer. I think they will have to come 
to combined systems of water management. 
Now we have individual systems of manage-
ment. In northern New Jersey, for instance, 
there are many, many water companies. The 
problem there, if they're going to continue 
to supply the growing area, is for those peo-
ple to get together and acquire and manage 
water, so that they can alleviate the short-
ages that might come in years of drought. 
Basically, the problem is in the size of the 
water-collecting agencies. They don't have 
enough water within the area to run through 
a period of drought, so they'll have to reach 
out for more water and for more storage of 
water. 
Question. Are there going to have to be 
more large dams and reservoirs in the East? 
Answer. Yes, there will have to more 
storage facilities and more development. 
There is a large amount of underground 
water in those States which can be tapped 
more heavily than it is at present. There 
must be a great effort in the Eastern States 
toward pollution control. This is one of 
their major problems. The water in many 
areas is now unusable without very heavy 
treatment. 
Question. Take New York City. The Hud-
son flows by with plenty of water in it, yet 
the city has a water problem. Why? 
Answer. Well, that has been mentioned 
quite often, but, if we go way back in history, 
we find that Henry Hudson was looking for 
fresh water as he sailed up the Hudson, but 
he found it was salt. The Hudson opposite 
New York City has a high salt content from 
the ocean. It isn't until you get pretty well 
up the Hudson that you begin to get water 
fresh enough for use. You see, that river is 
tidal all the way to Albany. But the Hudson 
will not become a good watersupply stream 
until pollution is abated. 
Question. Where are new dams and reser-
voirs needed in the East? 
Answer. Let's take the Delaware basin as 
one where we have a going project: 
Now, the Delaware serves a four-State area, 
and for many years the States tried to get to-
gether to solve their water problems on the 
Delaware. 
A study by the Corps of Engineers was 
authorized, and took quite a few years to 
carry out. In order to prepare the compre-
hensive plan it produced, we not only had to 
work with the States and get their full 
agreement on what would be done within the 
basin, but we had to work with all of the 
other Federal agencies concerned with water, 
so that we would come out with a truly 
comprehensive plan. The plan that has been 
worked out for the Delaware basin contem-
plates many headwater developments, and it 
contemplates, also, major storage dams down 
lower in the valley. 
Question. By headwater development, do 
you mean dams on tributaries? 
Answer. On tributaries, and on some quite 
small tributaries. These run into the hun-
dreds, so that there will be the water stor-
age in the upper areas and then major stor-
age down in the lower basin. Tocks Island?
near the Delaware Water Gap?is the largest 
one of these reservoirs. The proposed system 
of Federal reservoirs will provide a flow of a 
billion gallons a day from storage reservoirs 
during low-water periods. The total basin 
plan will provide almost double this supply. 
Question. Would it meet the current emer-
gency? 
Answer. It would meet the current needs 
if the system were built. 
Question. How much is this plan going 
to cost, over all? 
Answer. The major Federal reservoirs 
called for by the plan will cost about a 
quarter of a billion dollars. To construct-
all of the reservoirs contemplated by the 
comprehensive plan will require expenditures 
exceeding a half billion. Additional large 
expenditures will be made for nonengineer-
ing activities. 
Question. If the drought in the Northeast 
continues for another year or two, will that 
part of the country face a crisis of disaster 
proportions? 
Answer. No, there is time to head off dis-
aster. For the immediate future, if the 
drought continues, wells can be drilled to 
take care of northern New Jersey. Camden 
can probably take care of itself by drilling 
wells, too. Philadelphia could move its Del-
aware River intake upstream, or other mess-
ures--such as releases of upstream water?
could be taken to hold the salt water wedge 
below the present intake at Torresdale. 
Question. How about New York City? 
Answer. New York City will have to con-
serve its water supply. I believe the city's 
best solution to another year of drought is 
to begin to correct its water system so as to 
conserve all the water possible. I think water 
meters would help, too. 
For the long range in the Northeast, as 
far as the Federal Government is concerned, 
we are expediting the Delaware project as 
much as we can. Here we're talking on the 
order of 1969 and 1970. 
Question. Does desalting of water offer an 
alternative, or a supplement, to the kind of 
projects that you've been describing?

Another group embarked in a stolen boat 
and while in Cuba was used for anti-Ameri-

These things must not be allowed to con-
tinue. 
Ten days after Fidel Castro announced 
all Cubans were free to leave the country, 
no U.S. official has yet spoken out firmly 
and clearly to lay down ground rules for 
an orderly movement. 
South Florida's huge exile population 
doesn't know what to expect. Many, there-
fore, try to make the best deal they can to 
get their people out of Cuba. This is an 
invitation to disaster. 
Greater Miami doesn't know what to ex-

This is no time to appeal to Fidel Castro 
to act like a reasonable person. He knows 
now his offhand speech was an incredible 
mistake for his cause and could depopulate 
his country. 
His interest is in trying to rectify his 
error. 
The interest of the United States is to 
show that, given the opportunity, the people 
of Cuba choose freedom. This would be the 
end for Fidel. 
He is on the hook and the United States 
has the initiative. If we allow the situation 
to drift until he can squirm off, the hopes of 
the Cuban people will be dashed and thier 
eventual freedom postponed again. 
Let the proper officials speak up now and 
the U.S. position be made unmistakable. 
THE EQUAL TIME ABSURDITY 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, an im-
portant question which I hope Congress 
can consider next year is whether to 
amend or eliminate section 315 of the 
Federal Communications Act. I am 
pleased that the National Conference on 
Broadcasting and Election Campaigns, 
held recently in Washington under the 
auspices of the Fair Campaign Practices 
Committee, Inc., dealt with this issue. 
As the author of S. 1287, a bill to amend 
section 315 of the Federal Communica-
tions Act, I am keenly interested in the 
matter of the equal time on the air for 
candidates for public office. 
An excellent editorial identifying the 
shortcomings of section 315 as it is pres-
ently written appeared in the Philadel-
phia Inquirer of October 8, 1965. 
I ask unanimous consent that this edi-
torial be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows. 
THE EQUAL TIME ABSURD/TY 
Section 315 of the Federal Communica-
tions Act requires broadcasters to give candi-
dates for public office equal time on the air. 
This means that a station which wants to 
give major candidates an hour of free time 
to present their views or engage in debate 
must give equal time in comparable time 
slots to all the other minority candidates, 
In concept, this-regulation appears demo-
cratic and noble enough in purpose. In 
practice, it can prove unfair and absurd, as 
can be plainly witnessed today during the 
mayorality campaign in New York. 
There are two major party candidates for 
the office: Jokix V. LINDSAY, who holds both 
the Republican and Liberal nominations, and 
Abraham D. Beame, the Democratic nomi-
nee. Running also are five minority party 
candidates. The best known of these is the 
Conservatives' William F. Buckley, Jr. 
Others are the nominees of the United Tax-
payers' Party, Socialist Workers Party, the 
Socialist Labor Party, and even something 
called the Losers' Party. 
Should the broadcasting stations in New 
York plan coverage of the two or three im-
portant candidates, outside of the regular 
newscasts exempt from the law, they would 
have to clutter up their schedules, and the 
air, with equal coverage of all the other can-
didates, no matter how obscure and how re-
mote their chances of election. 
Because of the expense involved, the sched-
uling difficulties, and public indifference to 
the views of most of the minority candidates, 
the stations have naturally gone slow in 
extra coverage of the top candidates. 
The stations are frustrated, the campaign 
loses a sparkle it might otherwise be given, 
and the public loses out. The equal-time 
provision has become an added incentive to 
anonymous characters and political crack-
pots to run Mr office for the sake of per-
sonal publicity. They know that if one can-
didate receives free air time, they, too, must 
obtain it. 
The practical answer lies in modific ? 
of the FCC provision so as to bar a rdities 
as well as discrimination. Pennsylvania's 
Senator HUGH 8COTT is sponsor of a bill 
which would make the equal time regulation 
apply only to parties which received 10 per-
cent of the vote in the preceding election. 
This would seem to be a reasonable compro-
mise, but the Scott bill lies in the bottom 
of the bin in a Senate committee. The 
debacle in New York provides a good reason 
for resurrecting it. 
ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE FOUNDING OF GEORGE 
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW 
SCHOOL 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, 
October 11, 1965, marked the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of the 
George Washington University Law 
School. Today, as the 15th oldest law 
school in the United States, it ranks 
sixth in enrollment. 
To honor this institution and its dis-
tinguished alumni, many of whom have 
served and are currently serving in Con-
gress, our Federal Courts and through-
out the Government and Armed Forces, 
a special convocation was held on Tues-
day, October 12, 1965, at which Asso-
ciate Justice William Joseph Brennan, 
Jr., of the Supreme Court of the United 
States, received the honorary degree of 
doctor of laws, and delivered the address 
of the evening. 
Being an alumnus of the George 
Washington University Law School, and 
a former member of the Law School fac-
ulty, I wish to make available to my col-
leagues in the Congress and to those who 
read the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, Justice 
Brennan's remarks on this occasion. 
I ask that the statement be printed in 
the Appendix of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

WNGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 26307 
hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out 
more than a dozen projects in this area. 
But in the same densely populated urban 
eorapleX, an interstate highway is planned. 
It Is sorely needed to break a traffic strangle-
hold Which is delaying economic and social 
progress throughout the region. It would 
be built with Interstate Highway funds, 90 
percent supblied by the Federal Govern-
ment. The highway would pass through or 
near a number of urban redevelopment 
areas. This causes local officials to insist 
that, in order to avoid construction of a 
Chinese wall through the communities, the 
freeway should be built below existing sur-
face level. 
This, the Federal Bureau of Public Roads 
refused to do. According to the Bureau, It 
wOuld cost the highway trust fund an ad-
ditional 85 million. Arguing the local case 
for a depressed freeway, officials pointed to 
the obvious evidence of dilapidated residen-
tial and commercial areas alongside an ele-
vated railroad structure which is located 
only a half-mile from the site of the pro-
posed freeway. Here, they said was proof 
positive that an elevated structure can de-
press property values and help create new 
slums. 
Only an ingenious financial solution ar-
rived at by State highway officials in cooper-
ation with city officials saved the day and 
permitted the freeway to be built at a lower 
level. 
This is an absurd situation. The Federal 
Government, through HHFA, would be pay-
ing out of one pocket for urban redevelop-
ment at 20 times the cost of depressing the 
highway through these urban renewal areas. 
Clearly, these Federal programs are in con-
Alia. Two Federal pocketbooks are in-
volved, one, the loan and, grant fund of the 
Urban Renewal Administration and the other 
the highway trust fund of the Bureau of 
Public Roads. Because the immediate de-
cision involved highway design, the Bureau 
of Public Roads was the tail which wagged 
the urban dog. 
Clearly, this situation will not be helped 
one iota by elevating HHFA to the same 
status as the Department of Commerce, in 
which the Bureau of Public Roads is housed. 
Rather, a referee is needed in this dispute 
between urban redevelopment priorities and 
highway location and design. A White House 
office manned by persons with extensive ex-
perience in State and local problems would 
seem to be a more appropriate umpire. 
There are other problems, too, in the urban 
scheme of things, with regard to the relative 
place of highways and rapid transit plans. 
Some months back, the White House re-
lea,sed a technical report prepared by a group 
of experts which suggested, in part, that 
more express buses, operating in reserved 
traffic lanes, might be mass transit's answer 
to the growing problem of traffic jams that 
tend to strangle our metropolitan areas. 
Conceivably, the Mass Transportation Act 
now on the books, will yield not nearly as 
much an increase in rail passenger facilities 
as it will a significant increase in express 
buses on our highways. 
There is clearly no objection to locating 
mass transit programs under the Housing 
and Home Finance Agency. But a signifi-
cant increase in the number of buses on the 
streets would quite obviously affect what 
anOther agency of Government is trying to 
do to combat air pollution. And this is un-
der the jurisdiction of the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare. 
Today, these activities of the Federal Gov-
ernMent are administratively unrelated. Nor 
would they be related under the proposal 
submitted by the President and approved by 
Congress to create a Department of Urban 
Affairs and Housing. 
Beyond this, duplication and waste would 
Inevitably follow if mass transit plans are 
centered in the new Department while an-
other Federal agency, the Department of 
Commerce, continues to guide, finance, and 
control the construction of urban and sub-
urban roads. 
We cannot divide responsibility and ex-
pect sound decisions for the most efficient 
use of the taxpayers' dollars in meeting over-
all community needs. 
Nor will the new Federal Department help 
you in your efforts to wage a war on poverty. 
For the new Department created In part to 
establish a more direct line between Wash-
ington and the cities will do absolutely noth-
ing, per se, to make you partners in the ad-
ministration of local antipoverty programs. 
Beyond that, how many of you have seri-
ously considered how you are going to find 
your increased share of funds?a 40-percent 
increase?required by law if the poverty pro-
gram is to continue beyond August 20, 1966? 
The program calls for Federal assistance 
for the development, conduct, and adminis-
tration of community action programs up to 
90 percent of costs for the 2-year period 
ending August 20, 1966, or 50 percent there-
after. 
Local governing bodies, to say nothing of 
city managers, are generally bypassed by the 
direct contact between poverty officials in 
Washington and local action groups, but 
where will the pressures go for continuation 
of the program with 40 percent less Federal 
participation? 
Why, the pressures are just as liable to 
end on the desk of the city managers?and 
you know it. You are going to be hounded 
by a public acclimated to the program. But 
you will be asked to find the money for a 
program in which you have participated 
not at all. 
Now, the purpose of my comments has not 
been to detract one iota from the important 
role the Federal Government can, and must, 
play in solving metropolitan problems; 
rather, I hope that I have left with you today 
a healthy skepticism regarding the Federal 
Government's ability to offer instant solu-
tions to perennial metropolitan problems. 
The same administrative hurdles that have 
impeded solution of these problems by State 
and local officials are merely multiplied by 
the current trend of Federal intervention. 
Instead of a proliferation of agencies at 
the Federal, State, and local levels with 
overlapping jurisdictions and built-in self-
interests, can't we begin to talk about inter-
jurisdictional planning agencies that will 
benefit from the knowledge, finances, and 
energies of all three levels of government as 
they seek common solutions to problems that 
are indeed the common property of us all 
regardless of where we live. 
If an Office of Community Development 
in the White House could be designed to 
accomplish this goal, I feel we would be 
taking a real step in the proper direction. 
WEARY OF ALL DEMONSTRATIONS 
Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. 
President, for those of us who support 
the administration's policy in South 
Vietnam, it is heartening to know that 
not all the opponents of that policy be-
lieve in public demonstrations or pro-
Communist protests. 
The Wheeling, W. Va., News-Register 
recently has voiced opposition to the ad-
ministration's policy on South Vietnam 
but an editorial which appeared in the 
Sunday,' October 17, 1965, edition voices 
stronger criticism to protest demonstra-
tions. 
I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
torial be printed in full in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered printed, as follows: 
WEARY OF ALL DEMONSTRATIONS 
Regardless, Of one's personal views on 
U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, 
there can be no condoning the type of pro-
test demonstrations being staged around the 
country. 
To tell the truth we are sick and tired of 
all demonstrations, marches, riots, and dis-
orders and we believe the majority of Ameri-
cans are weary of the same. By now it 
should be clear that even the most sincere 
and honest of these protests sooner or later 
become the vehicles for infiltration by pro-
Communist agitators, wild-eyed beatniks, 
and ordinary law breakers. 
On Friday the Senate Internal Security 
Subcommittee released a study to support 
what it termed the Communist infiltration 
and exploitation of the teach-in movement 
on U.S. policy in Vietnam. 
The report read, "A substantial Communist 
infiltration (of the teach-in movement) is 
demonstrable, a much more substantial in-
filtration is probable, and there has been a 
tragic blurring of the distinction between 
the position of those who oppose our involve-
ment in Vietnam on pacifist or idealist or 
strategic or other grounds, and those who 
oppose our involvement in the war because 
they are Communists or pro-Communists." 
Simply because a movement of this nature 
is sponsored by an institution of higher 
learning does not mean that it is free of 
Communist taint or exploitation by extrem-
ists and even hoodlums. Many a worth-
while cause has been terribly damaged be-
cause of such infiltration and Americans are 
becoming increasingly disgusted with such 
mob tactics. 
There is nothing wrong with speaking out 
in disagreement with Government policies, 
but there is no need to resort to mass rallies 
in the streets, sit-in demonstrations and dis-
orderly conduct which disturbs the peace 
and welfare of the country. 
Already we have spawned such shocking 
episodes as seeing young Americans tearing 
up their draft cards and, rebelling against 
military service. Unfortunately, the protest 
movements set an example for our younger 
people and in a way many of these efforts 
directly involve the youth. 
What must be remembered is that half of 
today's world population is under 18 years 
of age. By next year half of the U.S. popu-
lation will be under 25. Youth therefore is 
a potentially explosive force, which unless 
channeled into productive paths, can lead 
in the future to upheaval and rioting for the 
mere thrill of rioting. If there is no way 
left in our Nation to register a dissenting 
opinion, other than through civil disobedi-
ence and mob tactics, then we are in a sad 
way indeed. 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF 
ELLEN BROWNING SCRIPPS 
Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, I 
should like my colleagues to note that to-
day is the anniversary of the birth of 
Ellen Browning Scripps, one of the most 
intelligent and selfless ladies our coun-
try has known. I want to take this occa-
sion to express the pride and gratitude 
with which the people of Illinois remem-
ber Miss Scripps, for her belief in the 
power and glory of education, a belief 
which she supported by inestimable 
philanthropies. 
Ellen Browning Scripps was born in 
London on October 18, 1836. Her family 
moved to the United States while she 
was still a child, and she spent her girl-
hood in Rushville, Ill. She attended 
public schools in Rushville, and taught 
school herself after graduation from

tically and wait for the poor to help them-
selves. Industrialization, which needs for-
eign aid, creates a new demand for farm 
products and helps the farmer progress from 
peasant to entrepreneur. Any schemes for 
agricultural improvement will create an addi-
tional need for foreign exchange, and will 
be strangled at birth unless aid is forth-
coming. But the aid-givers could give a 
greater part of their help in ways that stim-
ulate agricultural reform without appearing 
to be an undue interference in the recipient's 
internal affairs. The FAO in its latest report 
suggests that more aid should be given for 
general schemes of agricultural development, 
rather than for big projects like irrigation 
dams. 
UNTAD (the 'United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development) may also help 
agricultural reform if it can generate a new 
breed of international commodity agree-
ments that force primary producers to con-
trol production of surplus commodities. 
Were there a genuine prospect of output 
limitation by the producers, importing coun-
tries might more easily agree to finance the 
support of the international market. The 
International coffee agreement has begun to 
move hopefully in this direction with the 
aid of the World Bank, although the polit-
ical difficulties 61 controlling coffee pro-
duction in a country like Brazil are enor-
mous. 
Also in the air are the schemes, mostly 
of French or European Common Market ori-
gin, for using planned surpluses of food-
stuffs grown in the rich countries in a pur-
poseful way to aid development in the poor. 
The FAO commented that, though the idea 
is controversial, a choice does not exist be-
tween avoiding, or deliberately planning for 
a surplus, but only between whether a sur-
plus willy-nilly is planned or unplanned. 
"Prom that point of view, planned food aid 
may be preferable." This at least may be 
some consolation for the hungry, but one 
must remember they cannot eat words. Only 
the rich can. 
Castro's Latest 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
otr 
HON. CORNELIUS E. GALLAGHER 
OF NEW rEllstx 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENtATIVES 
Thursday, October 14, 1905 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, the 
magnanimous offer by President John-
son to admit refugees from Castro's 
regime is in keeping with the spirit of 
American concern for oppressed people 
everywhere. This action is a concrete 
example of our Nation at its best, offering 
itself as a haven for those persons who 
desire true freedom and relief from 
tyranny. 
I think that the following editorial 
from the Newark (t4 J) Evening News is 
a fair representation of the praise and 
support elicited from many private citi-
zens and newspapers throughout the 
country. I respectfully submit it for the 
RECORD; 
ASTRO'S LATEST 
PMICWA 4.21.1.Ason acted in the interest of 
humanitarianism in offering refuge to 
Cubans wanting to come to this country. 
He could have done no less. 
The motive behind Fide Castro's sudden 
? decision to open the gates remains unclear. 
Whatever it may be, he cannot escape the 
obvious admission of failure which the de-
parture of those voluntarily leaving the land 
of their birth would represent. 
Efforts will be made in Washington to pace 
the flow by limiting the number of refugees 
to 5,000 a month. If this influx were to 
continue, Cubans could account for half 
of the 120,000 immigrants from the Western 
Hemisphere who would be permitted to enter 
the United States under the newly enacted 
legislation. 
Even though this could impose a barrier to 
prospective citizens from friendly hemi-
spheric nations, the desire to maintain the 
United States as a haven for the oppressed 
should be transcendent. Safeguards must 
be employed, however, to prevent Castro from 
undertaking a wholesale eviction of unem-
ployables and others burdening the Cuban 
economy. 
The International Red Cross would be the 
ideal intermediary to assure that humani-
tarian considerations prevail. Castro's re-
fusal to deal with the Red Cross or some 
equally disinterested third party would be a 
sure sign of bad faith and a signal to call 
the whole thing off. 
A Trip Behind the Iron Curtain 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDNA F. KELLY 
OF NEW 'YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 14, 1965 
Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, as chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Europe of 
the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
I always seek out new information from 
those who travel behind the Iron Cur-
tain, in those countries in the Common-
wealth of Russia and those nations 
within the scope of the Subcommittee on 
Europe. 
The article which I insert in the REC-
ORD today is by William J. Farrell, a 
college classmate of my late husband at 
Columbia College, New York. Mr. Far-
rell was a: stockbroker in iNTew York City 
until the stock market crashed in 1928, 
whereupon he left for the west coast and 
became associated with banking inter-
ests in California. During these years he 
served his country in both major en-
counters, World War I and World War 
IL Now retired, Bill Farrell is devoting 
his time and energies to travel and 
writing. 
His most recent trip was made to the 
Balkan countries. Although an upcom-
ing article on this recent trip is not yet 
completed, I have gathered various 
pieces of information concerning free-
dom of religion in these Iron Curtain 
countries, from correspondence with 
him. 
The principal, personal contacts he 
made were with guides and a few hotel 
clerks, most of whom were young boys 
and girls?university students on sum-
mer vacations. They were obviously well 
schooled in what they were to answer to 
questions about religion. They claimed 
freedom of religion existed but stated 
that religion was practiced mostly by 
older people. He was told that young 
people were not interested in religion be-
cause they were much too occupied with 
other activities and had no need for it. 
A5813 
He then asked a few of these young 
People if church attendance would hinder 
their advancement in the party. Most 
denied this vigorously. However, he 
reached a very few who replied guardedly 
that the practice of any religion would 
not be of any help to them in advancing 
their positions. 
Upon visiting two services on a Sunday 
in the heart of Bucharest, he found 16 
people attending a Roman Catholic Mass 
in St. Joseph's Cathedral at noon and 
nearby, 20 people attending an Orthodox 
service. 
Obviously and regrettably, freedom of 
religion is a freedom not easily enjoyed 
but rather guardedly practiced, if prac-
ticed at all. 
Now, in order to share with my col-
leagues, the wealth of observations con-
tained ? in William Farrell's excellent 
account of his 1964 trip, I present his ar-
ticle, "A Trip Behind the Iron Curtain": 
A TRIP BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN - 
(By William Farrell, retired staff member) 
JUNE 30, 1964.?The magic date had finally 
arrived. This meant retirement and enough 
time to make a trip I had been working over 
in my mind for almost 2 years. 
The nucleus of my plan was to join a group 
in Moscow which would continue an addi-
tional 3,000 miles into central Asia. We 
would visit such legendary cities as Alma 
Ata, Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, and 
Dushanbe (called Stalinabad before Stalin's 
fall from favor). Literally dozens of inter-
esting sights are to be seen in these cities, all 
of which bear the impressive marks of their 
antiquity. 
Earlier stops on my itinerary?the World's 
Fair, a tour of southern Ireland (after a 
flight from New York to Dublin), and an-
other tour of the Shakespeare country in 
England?were incidental. So were the stops 
on the return from central Asia at Copen-
hagen, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Paris, and up 
and down the Rhine. My focal point was the 
Russian trip. 
Central Asia is truly a storied land. Its 
beginnings predate written history. Alex-
ander the Great captured Samarkand in the 
4th century B.C., to be followed around the 
13th century by Genghis Khan and Tamer-
lane, 
Each city I intended to visit was an im-
portant link in the ancient "silk road" ex-
tending from China to southeastern Europe. 
The whole area, at present made up of some 
half-dozen Soviet republics, lies about 2,500 
to 3,000 miles southeast of Moscow, east of 
the Caspian Sea (south of Siberia), and di-
rectly north of Afghanistan. When we were 
at Alma Ata, during a trip through the 
mountains, we were assured that we were 
only 35 miles from the border of Red China?
Sinkiang Province, to be exact. The great 
barriers of the Hindu Kush Mountains and 
the Pamirs lie to the south. Until the ad-
vent of the jet, travelers had described this 
as one of the most ina,cessible spots on 
earRtrhio'r inquiries, about the area, brought 
suggestions that September would be the 
most pleasant month as far as weather con-
ditions were concerned and this proved to 
be the case. I found that midsummer tem-
perature in Tashkent, Bukhara and Samar-
kand sometimes reach a high of 120? F. 
September 1 found me, on schedule, at 
London Central Airport as the PA system 
droned out the familiar, "Your attention 
please?Aeroflot flight No. 032 nonstop to 
Moscow, now loading at gate No. 4?all 
aboard please." I hope I never lose the thrill 
I get when the flight being called is my 
flight?and this was something special.

A5814 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX October 14, 1965 
Aeroflot is the airline that operates all 
nOndillitary flights for Russia, both domes-
tic and foreign. My plane was a TU-104, 
called a Tupolev. It flies at 500 to 550 m.p.h. 
and is approximately the Russian version of 
our 707 or DC-8, seating 70 to 100 persons. 
Close examination of the interior revealed 
that our planes are more luxuriously furn-
ished, but the noise from the jets did not 
seem remarkably greater?at least as I re-
call it. 
Three hours and forty-five minutes later 
we landed at Moscow airport. There I joined 
tour No. 50, made up of 23 other people who 
would be my traveling companions for the 
next 17 days. Ours was an English-speak-
ing tour. England, Scotland, Canada, United 
States, and Italy (a young couple) were 
represented. A young Russian girl, about 
25 years old, named Nina introduced herself 
as our Intourist guide. She would remain 
with us to handle all details of our trip until 
we returned to Moscow on September 17. 
Intourist, by the way, is a government bu-
reau which supervises all travel and hotel 
accommodations within Russia. At each 
city visited, we were to be joined by a local 
_guide to explain sights of interest. 
Immigration officials scrutinized our pass-
ports and special visas very carefully; how-
ever, the customs section didn't even ask us 
to unlock our luggage. They did require 
us to list carefully all foreign currencies and 
any gold or silver jewelry. We found that 
sb.utterbugs could have themselves a "ball." 
Picturetaking was completely unrestricted, 
except at airports, railway stations, and mili-
tary installations. 
As we drove toward Moscow from the air-
port, we noticed the great number of four-, 
six-, and eight-story apartment buildings. 
This is a partial answer to one of their most 
pressing problems?housing. This same situ-
ation prevailed in all the central Asian cities 
visited?new apartments and business build-
ings?everywhere new construction. The 
long booms and control cabs of the construc-
tion cranes were silhouetted against the sky, 
much as palm trees dot the Los Angeles sky-
line. 
The main streets of Moscow are notably 
Wide, in most cases accommodating 12 traffic 
lanes, with a broad center dividing strip 
Which was usually planted with flowers. We 
also noticed that these streets were kept 
spotlessly clean. Apparently there are no 
litterbugs in Moscow. As yet, ordinary traffic 
is not heavy enough to tax these facilities, 
but passenger buses by the hundreds ply the 
streets in all directions. 
Our hotel was the Ukraine, built 6 or 7 
years ago. With two 12-story wings and a 
central tower of 27 stories, it contains 1,100 
rooms arid covers an entire city block. The 
Russians refer facetiously to its style of 
architecture as "post-Stalin." The lobby of 
the Ukraine (and this may be said generally 
of all the hotels where we stayed) was huge, 
plain, dull, and poorly lighted. 
In the guest rooms, the plumbing was 
strictly antique. I still wonder where they 
managed to dig up such a collection of curi-
osities. In some hotels the wash basin would 
be in one room or small' compartment, the 
shower or tub in another, and the toilet in a 
third. I always enjoy a good game of hide 
and seek, but not when I'm looking for the 
bathroom. However, I admit that all our 
rooms were clean and comfortable, if you 
forget the plumbing. To sum up on hotels, 
they would be about fourth class in this 
country. If you are the finicky type, you'd 
better stay home. Room service, for in-
stance, doesn't exist. 
In each hotel, we were assigned the same 
tables for the duration of our stay, and the 
same waitresses served us throughout. The 
tables were always set with baskets of assort-
ed fruit an.d four or five large bottles of nim-
eral water, orangeade, or fruit juices. Tap 
water was not potable. There were no 
menus and no tips. Breakfast was a varia-
tion of cereals, eggs, ham, bacon, toast--
the usual. However, one morning I didn't 
recognize the first offering on my plate; it 
was a smoked sturgeon. I ate it and liked 
It, although it was a radical departure from 
my ordinary breakfast routine. The follow-
ing morning it started with a plate-filling 
slab of cheese surmounted by four generous 
slices of salami. Chalk up another radical 
departure. 
In Moscow we were served generous por-
tions of caviar at dinner three nights. Each 
meal also brought a large plate of sliced 
white bread and black bread. After one sam-
ple everyone ate the black bread. It was 
delicious. It was not quite as heavy as pum-
pernickel and always ovenfresh. Although 
lunch was usually built around a hearty, 
space-filling soup, the dinner menu was var-
ied. It might be beef, veal, lamb, or other 
meats prepared in conventional ways, or per-
haps a shashlik at which the central Asians 
excel. Boned roast chicken was also a fre-
quent favorite. In addition to these stand-
bys, various vegetables were served along 
with potatoes or rice. Desserts were much 
the same as ours, but ice cream always was 
our favorite. It was excellent. These back-
ward people haven't yet discovered that ice 
cream can be made without cream. 
Five days of sightseeing in Moscow pretty 
well covered the conventional sights. We 
saw the Kremlin?twice from the inside?
and the metro (subway) with its marble 
platforms, arches, decorative statues, murals 
done in mosaics, and paintings. We also 
saw many museums, cathedrals, the univer-
sity, and the Exposition of Soviet Economic 
Achievement?a collection of beautiful 
buildings, somewhat reminiscent of the New 
York World's Fair. Each industry and re-
public has its own building for exhibiting its 
products. 
On September 6 we left Moscow for Alma 
Ata, arriving there 5 hours and 20 minutes 
later. When Russia took over the central 
Asian cities, they followed a general policy 
of preserving the native quarter of the city, 
which is composed mostly of mud huts. They 
built their own new buildings a short dis-
tance away. So, it is still possible to observe 
life, in these ancient quarters, very much as 
it has existed for many thousands of years. 
Some of the mud huts are gradually being re-
placed by modern construction, but a large 
portion will always be preserved for tourist 
appeal. 
Alma Ata and Dushanbe do not contain any 
distinguished landmarks. Tashkent is a 
city of over a million population, located in 
the center of a large cotton-producing area. 
One of the largest cotton mills in the world 
is located here. A small percentage of the 
people still wear attractive and colorful na-
tive costumes. 
We were getting toward the end of our 
journey with visits to Bukhara and Samar-
kand, the ancient Marcanda. Bukhara is 
known best for the rugs bearing that name. 
Actually, the rugs are made elsewhere, 
but the principal market is Bukhara. Until 
1920, the Emir ruled with a cruel and an 
absolute hand. Sometimes criminals were 
thrown into the bug pits to be slowly de-
voured. Prominent on the skyline is the 
tall and beautifully proportioned Kalyan 
Minaret. Condemned men were taken to 
the top of this tower, known as the Tower 
of Death, and pushed off, falling to their 
deaths on the stone flags 130 feet below. 
Here we also saw the Timor Tower, Job's 
Well, and many other impressive struc-
tures. Our, last stop in Bukhara was a 
mosque where we were permitted to enter 
during a religious service. The worshippers 
prostrated themselves on their prayer rugs, 
which they had spread in the open air in 
the tree-covered courtyard on the mosque. 
Here again the feeling of remoteness from 
the world and the vast distances from 
"regular" civilization possessed us. When 
you get so deep in the far placed. that the 
Mohammedans turn southwest to face 
Mecca, you know your're more than 45 min-
utes from Broadway. 
Samarkand offers a wealth of interesting 
places. Among them is the Observatory of 
mug-Beg, the astronomer. His records, 
compared with present-day findings, show 
an amazing accuracy. The Our Emir, or 
Tomb of Tamerlane, is located here. Tamer-
lane's sarcophagus is made of a mineral 
called nephrite and is said to be the largest 
single piece of this material ever known. 
For his epitaph, he chose to have inscribed, 
"Were / alive today, mankind would trem-
ble." The Shah I Zind is long stairway, 
flanked on both sides by a succession of the 
beautiful tom,bs of Tamerlane's family. 
These are probably the best preserved of the 
various grcura. 
Registan Fquare is formed by a collec-
tion of mosques and madrasahs or schools. 
Its impressive blue and blue-green tile domes 
had fallen i'-to disrepair, but one, which had 
been expertly restored recently, offers the 
hope that the entire group may soon receive 
like treatment. Lord Curzon, visiting in 
1888, spoke of It as "the noblest public square 
in the world," superior even to St. Mark's 
Square in Venice. 
Dushanbe was the last stop on our tour. 
The hotel dining room was "undergoing 
repairs," so we ate at a large restaurant 
opposite the hotel and across the main 
public square. It must be the largest pub-
lic square in all Asia. On our last night in 
Dushanbe, Intourist gave up a farewell 
dinner, featurirg much caviar and cham-
pagne. The next day a 6-hour, nonstop 
trip in an IL-18 returned us to Moscow 
and the National Hotel?reputedly the best 
in Moscow. At least the National and Metro-
pole, products of the turn of the century, are 
highly recommended by old Moscow hands. 
I think they are right. 
The next morning, September 17, the 
group broke up and each member enplaned 
for his separate destination. Two of us left 
Moscow -early on our SAS flight to Copen-
hagen. 
On our departure, as on our arrival, cus-
toms showed no curiosity about our luggage. 
However, the same immigration official, who 
had scrutinized our travel documents so 
closely on arrival, .was again on duty at the 
clearance desk to repeat the process in great 
detail. When our passports were returned, 
we noted that the special visa, which had 
been carefully stapled to that document, had 
been as carefully removed. 
We walked downstairs to the loading level 
and were about to start up the plane's gang-
way when a voice at my elbow asked for my 
passport. It was our old friend again, but 
this time he was accompanied by a pretty 
blond girl, who joined in the inspection. 
They went through the whole ceremony 
again, just as seriously and carefully as he 
had done it not much over a minute before. 
He finally returned the passport and indi-
cated that I was free to board. Obviously, 
no one is going to switch passports in the 
brief interval between the desk and the 
plane, and get off scot free from behind the 
Iron Curtain?not, at least, while "Ivan 
Horatius" is guarding the bridge. 
Arriving at Copenhagen Airport, we care-
-fully sought out a customs or immigration 
officer. There was none to be found. , We 
made inquiries. Still no officials. There 
was nothing to do but call a cab and go to 
the hotel. Needless to say, I felt neglected.

Their lobbyist succeeded in securing a 
10,000-ton special quota for Owen-
Illinois. 
Arguments that American consumers 
would be without sugar if the bill failed 
to pass were also without foundation in 
fact. Under existing legislation the cur-
rent quotas would continue to apply if 
the House had voted down the proposal. 
With the defeat of HR. 11135, we could

A Significant Vote in the U.N. 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 14, 1965 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, it is 
necessary for us to consistently remind 
the State Department that the greatest 
abuses of colonialism today are found 
In the Communist colonial practices of 
the Soviet Union and Red China. I regret 
that Ambassador Goldberg did not use 
the opportunity during the recent U.N. 
debate on Rhodesia to emphasize that 
the only major colonial powers were the 
two Communist dictatorships, the 
U.S.S.R. and Red China. However, 
columnist David Lawrence, writing in 
yesterday's Evening Star, directs our 
attention to this question, and I insert 
his column in the RECORD at this point 
as part of my remarks: 
A SIGNIVICANT 'VOTE IN THE U.N. 
(By David Lawrence) 
An event of tremendous significance has 
just occurred in the United Nations. By a 
vote of 107 to 2, the General Assembly has 
called on Britain to refuse to accept a 
declaration of independence by Rhodesia, 
because the latter's present government will 
not grant a majority of the inhabitants self-
rule but will continue to give a white minor-
ity.the preponderant power. 
- While there is a widespread feeling that 
the black man in Africa should have his 
rights, the incident raises the question of 
why the same principle shouldn't be applied 
to the people of other countries where a 
white majority have been and still are being 
denied the right to rule themselves. 
Thus, for example, the populations of 
Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Ru-
mania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, 
and Estonia are overwhelmingly white, but 
their independence is impaired by an out-
side power which holds them in subjugation 
under "Communist colonialism." 
. The fact that the General Assembly of the 
United Nations now is insisting on self-
government for different nations throughout 
the world which have been ruled by outside 
powers is an encouraging sign. The captive 
nations in Eastern Europe, however, have 
never had the benefit of a United Nations 
resolution declaring that they should enjoy 
independence and be allowed to develop au-
tonomonsly without interference from other 
governments. Certainly the United Nations 
has never advocated the use of "all possible 
force" to deal with this problem, as it has 
just recommended with respect to Rhodesia. 
In the case of the satellite countries in 
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union supposedly 
gave independence to this bloc of nations 
but nevertheless has managed to retain con-
trol through the apparatus of the Commu-
nist Party and often with military forces. 
The Russians try to spread the impression 
every now and then that these Eastern Eu-
ropean countries are independent and can 
make trade arrangements with other parts 
of the world. But the fact remains that 
they do not really have self-government. 
So any pronouncement by the United Na-
tions today with respect to the right of self-
government for the people of Rhodesia, the 
majority of whom happen to be black, could 
be taken to mean that the world's biggest 
international organization may soon express 
itself in favor of the principle of self-govern-
ment for white people who have came under 
the yoke of the Soviet Union in Eastern 
Europe. 
It is significant that the United States 
voted for the resolution to hold up the grant 
of independence to Rhodesia by Britain, and 
in a friendly understanding with the British 
Foreign Office has undertaken to work in 
harmony with the authorities there. Pres-
sure is to be brought to bear on the Rho-
desian whites to prevent them from becom-
ing independent under a government which, 
it is argued, wouldn't reflect the will of the 
majority of the people. There are nearly 4 
million tribesmen, mostly uneducated, and 
250,000 whites possessing skills of various 
kinds. 
The State Department here has indicated 
it will participate in economic sanctions 
whereby trade would be cut off and aid of 
various kinds would be interrupted if the 
Rhodesian leaders insist upon separating 
themselves from the British and going it 
alone. 
But, it will be asked, just why shouldn't 
Britain and other countries be willing to 
apply the same formula to Red China? For 
the Peiping regime has undertaken to pre-
vent a majority of the people in South Viet-
nam from maintaining their independence? 
The United Nations has, in effect, ap-
proved all measures of economic or military 
force that may be necessary to insure the 
independence of Rhodesia under a govern-
ment chosen by a majority of its people. 
This gives hope that in the future perhaps 
the same concern will be felt and similar 
measures adopted to insure the right of the 
majority of the people of Vietnam to govern 
themselves without interference by a minor-
ity aided by Red China or the Soviet Union 
or any other country. Some day, too, per-
haps the peoples of Eastern Europe will be 
helped by the United Nations to regain the 
independence they once enjoyed. 
Reporter Everett Allen Cited for Coverage 
of Cuban Freedom Movement 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HASTINGS KEITH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 14, 1965 
Mr. KEITH. Mr. Speaker, the mount-
ing exodus from Castro's Cuba is a dra-
matic reminder that Cuban men and 
women are willing to risk their lives and 
give up lifelong homes for exile and un-
certainty to find freedom. 
It should remind us too that their sons, 
brothers, and husbands have suffered 
Imprisonment and death in the fight to 
free their island home of Communist 
tyranny. The tight continues. 
A5819 
Sunday night, in. New York City, two 
major free Cuban organizations in this 
country reaffirmed their determination 
to see Cuba returned to the family of 
free nations. In so doing, they paid spe-
cial tribute to several American journal-
ists for their help in exposing Castroism 
and bringing the story of the free-Cuba 
movement to the American people. 
I am proud to note that special tribute 
was paid a resident of my congressional 
district, Everett S. Allen, a staff writer 
for the Standard-Times of New Bedford, 
Mass., who has written penetrating 
articles on the Cuban situation since 
1959. 
Everett Allen and the newspaper for 
which he has written many prize-win-
ning articles, the Standard-Times, very 
early saw the menace of Castroism. 
Allen characterized Fidel Alegandro Cas-
tro Ruz as a "pistol-toting drunkard," 
and termed ,him a "power-hungry des-
pot." The Standard-Times was one of 
the first, if not the first major American 
newspaper to explode the Castro myth 
and expose him as a dangerous pro-Com-
munist despot. In 1959, when the Amer-
ican Society of Newspaper Editors in-
vited Castro to be their principal speaker 
at an annual meeting, the editor of the 
Standard-Times urged that the invita-
tion be withdrawn. When it was not, he 
refused to attend the meeting and con-
tinued to warn his readers of the true 
character of Castro?this at a time when 
most other newspapers were writing of 
Fidel as a colorful liberator of the Cuban 
people. 
In 1962, Mr. Allen wrote a major four-
part series on Castro, a series 4 months 
in the preparation and one which was 
based in large part on exclusive inter-
views and correspondence. 
Accepting his award in New York last 
Sunday, and a similar tribute in behalf 
of former U.S. Ambassador to Cuba 
Arthur Gardner, Mr. Allen told the 
Cuban patriots they must have patience 
in addition to their courage?"patience 
deriving from the knowledge that we in 
North America who believe Cuban liberty 
is of the greatest fundamental import-
ance to all mankind will stand with you 
for as long as history requires." 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the account of this award ceremony, as 
a reminder to all of us that the passage 
of time has done nothing to diminish the 
cause of a free Cuba, or to lessen the 
danger to the Western Hemisphere from 
this Communist camp in the Caribbean: 
STANDARD-TIMES WRITER HONORED?CUBA 
EXILES VOW To CONTINUE FIGHT 
NEW Yorac, October 11.?Several hundred 
anti-Castro Cuban exiles, representatives of 
two major free-Cuba organizations in the 
United States, reaffirmed their determination 
to "continue the fight until our beloved 
country is free again" at a 3-hour public 
rally here yesterday. 
A highlight of the event, coinciding with 
the start of National Newspaper Week, was 
the awarding to nine American daily news-
papers, four Spanish-language publications, 
and three U.S. magazines of "diplomas of 
honor" for coverage "in defense of the brave 
and valiant men and women who struggle 
to free Cuba from the tyranny of Commu-
nism and to reincorporate our republic in, 
the family of free nations of the American 
Continent," ?

by calling on the United States to charter 
a vessel to be named "Freedom Ship, to bring 
over from the Red inferno that is Cuba to-
day, those seeking freedom, to be reunited 
(in the 'United States) with their families." 
Senate-House Conference on the Public 
Works Appropriation Bill Fails To In 
chide $300,000 for Fremont Dam of 
the Lower Teton Project 
=TENSION OF RENIARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE HANSEN 
or /DAM) 
TFIE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 14, 1965 
Mr HA.NSEN of Idaho. Mr. Speaker, 
Idaho has fared well in the public works 
appropriation bill for 1966 as agreed to in 
conference between the House and Sen-
ate, and which passed the House today. 
Included was $11,844,000 for five impor-
tant projects in my State, four of which 
are in the Second Congressional District. 
These Projects, and the amounts appro-
priated for them,. are: Dworshak?
Bruces Eddy?Reservoir, $11 million; 
Portneuf River and Marsh Creek, 
$400,000; Ririe Reservoir, $300,000; 
Heise-Roberts extension, $100,000; and 
Blackfoot Reservoir, $44,000. Funds for 
the -Bilge and Blackfoot Reservoirs are 
for planning, while the rest are for con-
Struction. 
However, Mr. Speaker, I must say I 
was naturally disappointed that the 
Senate-House conference on the public 
Works appropriation bill, in its wisdom, 
did not Include the $300,000 provided in 
the Senate version of the bill for the 
Frerriorit Dam of the lower Teton proj-
ect. It Is a good project, and one I believe 
to be of vital necessity to the residents 
of the area. 
1Vir Speaker I am sure Members of the 
, 
House are aware of the great rampart of 
Motintains?sometimes called the Amer-
ican Alps?which lie south of Yellowstone 
National Park, and along the Idaho-
Wyoming border. These towering peaks 
Of glacier-filled crevices, and of breath-
taking"beauty, are called the Tetons and 
form a major part of Teton National 
Park. 
It was in the shadow of the rising sun 
under this majestic vertebrae of Mother 
Earth that I was born and reared. 
Flowing out of these high places are 
crystal clear but swift and turbulent 
streams. Coursing through deep 
canyons the waters from the fast-melting 
snow in the spring emerge and flow out 
upon the broad, flat valleys below, 
inundating everything in their path. 
Later in the year, as the heat of summer 
reaches its peak, the snowpack recedes 
to a point where little melting occurs, and 
the streams slow to a trickle. Thirsty 
crops are too frequently left to wither in 
a land of little rain. These conditions 
have worsened as times have changed 
and as the area has become more highly 
developed. 
Lands that can provide abundant yield 
year after year remain irregular and 
unpredictable and economic conditions 
have worsened for some 30 years. 
The proposed Teton Dam is primarily 
and initially designed to provide supple-
mentary water and to control spring 
flooding. 
In House Report No. 1715, 88th Con-
gress, 2d session, accompanying H.R. 
2337, a bill to authorize this dam we 
find: 
This is a multipurpose development 
designed to make maximum use of the avail-
able water resources in the area. The con-
struction and operation of this proposed 
project would provide irrigation service to 
151,400 acres of irrigable land. About 
114,400 acres are in a highly successful irri-
gated agricultural area and would receive 
a supplemental water supply. The other 
37,000 acres which are presently dryland 
farmed would receive a full water supply. 
The project would also provide substantial 
flood protection to a highly developed area 
in the Upper Snake River Basin, which has 
suffered severe damage from floods in recent 
years; make available about 75 million 
kilowatt-hours of electric energy annually 
for project pumping and for disposal 
through the Federal Columbia River power 
system; and, in addition, would provide new 
recreational opportunities in the area. 
For the past 30 years, water users as well 
as businessmen in the Fremont-Madison Ir-
rigation District, an area which is subject 
to both drought and floods, have been urg-
ing the construction of a dam and reser-
voir on the Teton River, At the present 
time, there are only two small reservoirs for 
water storage in the area, and the water 
which is impounded is subject to prior 
downstream rights. The canals which serve 
the Fremont-Madison Irrigation District 
lose their natural flow early in the irriga-
tion season resulting in late season water 
shortages. A supplemental water supply for 
the existing irrigated land in the district is 
the greatest need in the area. This area is 
completely dependent upon agriculture, and 
the frequent crop losses due to drought 
conditions have a serious adverse impact 
which is felt not only by the local economy 
but throughout the entire State. 
The new land which would be brought 
into irrigated production would be a great 
asset to this area, strengthening and firm-
ing up the economy and providing for di-
versified crops on lands presently devoted 
to dryland grains. 
This same area, for which Arm water sup-
ply is so badly needed, is also subject to 
serious flooding. Floods and drought con-
ditions in the same year are not uncommon. 
The spring floods in many years cause in-
undation of farmlands, homes, and areas of 
October 14, 1965' 
improvements, as well as threaten the life 
and health of humans and livestock. Sub-
stantial economic losses have occurred. The 
seriousness of an alternate drought and 
-flood cycle was vividly illustrated in 1961 
and 1982. During the summer of 1961, Fre-
mont and Madison Counties were declared 
a drought emergency area. In February 
1962 extremely high runoff caused record 
floods in Henry's Fork and Teton River val-
leys and the Snake River plain. Thus, 
within 6 months, the same area was de-
clared a drought area and a flood disaster 
area, Destructive floods occurred in the 
area just a few weeks before the committee 
held hearings on this legislation in June. 
The committee was impressed with the ex-
tent of damage indicated by photographs 
furnished during the hearings. A large per-
centage of the ftoodflows that have been so 
damaging are contributed by the Teton 
River, and storage space in the proposed 
Fremont Reeervoir would provide substan-
tial protecVon against future floods. 
Electric energy that would be made avail-
able would be an additional valuable asset 
that is needed to meet the ever-expanding 
power requirements. 
At the prePc?t time, recreation facilities in 
the area are taxed to the limit. The recrea-
tional opportunities that would be made 
available by construction of this project in 
the form of boating, camping, fishing, etc., 
would help meet the increased demand. 
Mr. Speaker, support of this project 
- has been completely bipartisan. The 
first bill on it was introduced by the late 
Senator Henry Dworshak in the 87th 
Congress. It was later reintroduced and 
cosponsored by Senators FRANK CHURCH --
and LEN B. JORDAN in the 88th Congress 
on the Senate side, and by my predeces-
sor, Representative Ralph Harding, on-
the House side. It currently has the, 
wholehearted support of the entire Idaho 
congressional delegation. 
Twice the Idaho State Legislature has - 
memorialized the Congress in its sup-
port. Following is the text of Senate 
Joint Memorial No. 5, Idaho State Leg-
islature, 38th session, in such support;

selves generously to the National Red 
Cross. 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 1 minute. 
As I stated earlier, we are not getting 
a precedent by a governmental contribu-
tion to the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, because some 59 govern-
ments do now contribute. Admittedly, 
this is the first time the United States 
would make a voluntary contribution as 
a Government to that society. 
The National Red Cross societies 
themselves do,make individual contribu-
tions from their awn societies. So far 
as I know, that would likewise continue. 
With respect to the necessity, this is, 
of course, a matter of opinion. I respect 
those who have different opinions. 
As pointed out in the hearings on pages 
8 and 9 and as pointed out in the report, 
the request for funds to help with budg-
etary problems did come from the inter-
national committee in 1963 and was fol-
lowed up by specific requests to all gov-
ernments to increase contributions, 
Including the U.S. Government. This is 
the reason why this was initiated by our 
own Department of State. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
YATES). The question is on the motion 
of the gentleman from Florida that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the bill 
H.R. 8715. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was

AMEND _TULE ?RELATING TO

Mr. FASCEJ4L. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 9336) to Amend title V of the In-
ternational Claims Settlement Act of 
1949 relating to certain claims against 
the Government of Cuba. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Jill. 9306 
Be it enactql by the House and Senate 
of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, Thar section 
501 of the International Claims Settlement 
Act of 1949 (22 U.S.C. 1643) is amended by 
striking out "which have arisen out of debts 
for merchandise furnished or services ren-
dered by nationals of the United States with-
out regard to the date on which such mer-
chandise was furnished or services were ren-

"arising out of debts for merchandise fur-
nished or services rendered by nationals of 
the United States WW/Ceut regard to the date 
on Which such merchandise Was furnished or 
services were rendered or". 
SEC. 3. Section ,506 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 
1643e) is amended by striking out ": Pro-
vided, That the deduction of such amounts 
shall not be construed es divesting the United

Sc 4, Section 50(0 OT Such Act (2'2 
U.S.C. 16441) is amended by striking out 
together with a 'statement of the evidence 
relied upon and the reasoning employed in 
reaching its decision". 
SEC. 5. Section 611 of such Act (22 U.S.0 
1643j) is. amended to read as follows: 
"APPROPRIATIONS 
"SEC. 511. There are hereby authorized to 
be appropriated such sums, not to exceed 
$750,000, as may be necessary to enable the 
Commission to pay its administrative ex-
penses incurred in carrying out its functions 
under this title." 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
YATES). Is a second demanded? 
Mrs. BOLTON. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a second. 
The-SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection a second will be considered as 
ordered. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
9336 which is to amend title V of the 
International Claims Settlement Act of 
1949 relating to certain claims against 
the Government of Cuba. 
In the last session of Congress a simi-
lar bill was passed by this same body 
authorizing the adjudication of claims 
by U.S. citizens against the Castro goy-
'ernment. In the closing days of last 
year's session, the other body voted out 
a bill which differed from the House 
version. On the last day of the session 
and for no other purpose in mind other 
than to have Cuban claims on our statute 
books, we reludantly accepted the Sen-
ate version. 
H.R. 9336 is similar to the bill passed 
last year. An authorization for an ap-
propriation for adjudication expenses is 
limited to $750,000, and is the same as 
provided by the House version last year. 
When a settlement with a free and inde-
pendent Government of Cuba is agreed 
upon and paid, the United States will be 
reimbursed for the administrative ex-
penses in the adjudication of these 
claims. 
The enactment of this legislation is not 
to be construed as any intention to au-
thorize an appropriation now or in the 
future of Federal funds for the purpose 
of paying the claims of U.S. nationals 
against the Government of Cuba. This 
bill provides only for the receipt and 
determination by the Foreign Claims 
Settlement Commission of the amount 
and validity of claims of U.S. nationals 
against the Government of Cuba. 
The other amendments referred to in 
this bill are substantive and relate to the 
principles of international law and do-
mestic laws; such as, statute of limita-
tions, and laches. 
More than 5 years have -passed since 
the Castro government began confiscat-
ing the property of U.S. nationals and 
prompt adjudication of claims would be 
in the best interests of all concerned. 
H.R. 9336 provides the necessary au-
thority to set the machinery in motion 
for an orderly determination of the 
amount and validity of claims of U.S. na-
tionals against the Government of Cuba 
while the means of documenting and 
supporting such claims are still available. 
Adjudication of such claims have been 
delayed because of a lack of an appro-
priation. If this matter is further de-
layed, witnesses and claimants may die 
and records may be lost, thus making 
It Increasingly difficult to substantiate 
claims. Moreover, the prompt receipt 
19705 
and determination of amounts and valid-
ity of the claims will provide the De-
partment of State with an accurate rec-
ord for use in any future negotiations. 
For these reasons, I urgently recom-
mend that H.R. 9336 be passed by the 
House. 
Mrs. BOLTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa 
[Mr. Gsossl. 
Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I desire to 
commend the gentleman from Florida 
[Mr. FASCELL] for this bill. I served on 
the subcommittee which considered this 
legislation. I think it is good legislation 
and ought to be passed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There 
being no further requests for time, the 
question is on the motion of the gentle-
man from Florida that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill H.R. 
9336. 
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds having voted in favor thereof) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the 
table, 
GORGAS MEMORIAL LABORATORY 
Mr. SELDEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
511) , with amendment to increase the 
authorization of appropriations for the 
support of the Gorgas Memorial Labora-
tory. 
The Clerk read US follows: 
S. 511 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House 
of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That, effec-
tive for fiscal years ending after June 30, 
1963, the first section of the Act entitled "An 
Act to authorize a permanent annual appro-
priation for the maintenance and operation 
of the Gorges Memorial Laboratory", ap-
proved May 7, 1928, as amended (45 Stat. 491; 
22 U.S.C. 278), is amended by striking out 
"$250,000" and inserting in lieu thereof "not 
to exceed $500,000". 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is a sec-
ond demanded? 
Mrs. BOLTON. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a second. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. With-
out objection, a second will be considered 
as ordered. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SELDEN. Mr. Speaker, S. 511 
would increase the annual authorization 
for appropriations for the Gorgas Me-
morial Laboratory from $250,000 to $500,-
000. 
The laboratory was established in 1929 
through legislative agreement between 
the Governments of the United States 
and the Republic of Panama. Since that 
time the Gorgas Laboratory has been 
performing a valuable, needed service in 
research in tropical diseases. Its re-
search activities also have implications 
which extend beyond the tropics. Many 
of the human and animal diseases that 
flourish in tropical regions are also found 
in, or may spread to, the temperate 
zones. 
The laboratory collaborates with many 
other research and public health orga-
nizations, including the Middle America 
Research Unit, a laboratory in the Canal

Zone operated by the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in col-
laboration with the Water Reed Army 
In,stitute of Research. 
The Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, lo-
cated in Panama City, Republic of Pan-
ama, is the operating research establish-
ment of the Gorgas Memorial Institute, 
a private, domestic, nonstock corpora-
tion. U.S. contributions to the labora-
tory started in 1929 with an annual per-
manent authorization of $50,000. The 
authorization for the laboratory was in-
creased to $150,000 in 1949, and $250,000 
In 1959. In 1960, the Congress author-
ized $500,000 for the construction of new 
facilities at the laboratory, making it 
one of the best equipped of its kind in 
Latin America. The additional author-
ization provided for in this bill will make 
it possible to fully utilize these new facil-
ities. 
The Gorgas Memorial Laboratory has 
an international reputation and a long 
standing record of service in the western 
hemisphere. The Republic of Panama 
has cooperated closely with the labora-
tory in the achievement of its objec-
tives. The management of the institute 
has administered the funds made avail-
able with prudence and care. The 
Board of Directors meets annually with-
out compensation and determines poli-
cies of the institute. An advisory group 
of noted scientists assists in developing 
the research program. There are 26 
members of this group, primarily doc-
tors, and 23 of them represent U.S. 
institutions. 
Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I urge that 
the House act favorably on this measure 
to permit the Gorgas Memorial Labora-
tory to carry on its important work. 
Mrs. BOLTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for 
me to have the honor of presenting this 
bill. The Gorgas Laboratory has been 
doing for many years an outstanding job. 
It has been a remarkable demonstration 
of what willing, dedicated people can 
do to blot out diseases, particularly trop-
ical diseases, such as are found there. 
General Gorgas himself was a most 
amazing man; kindly to a degree and 
his heart as big as the world. It seemed 
very fitting when the Laboratory was es-
tablished that it should take the form 
that it did. It is a very great pleasure 
to me to approve the bill. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentlewoman yield? 
Mrs. BOLTON. lam glad to yield to 
the gentleman. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I should like 
to commend the committee, and in par-
ticular the subcommittee, for bringing 
out this bill upgrading the Gorgas Me-
morial Laboratory. As has been well 
said here by the gentleman from Ala-
bama [Mr. SELDEN] and the gentle-
woman from Ohio [Mrs. BOLTON] this 
memorial laboratory is an outgrowth of 
the successful attempt of this country 
to build the Panama Canal. It is from 
stroll sources, and the discovery of "yel-
low-jack" and the vector for controlling 
malaria, that the Memorial Laboratory 
was organized on a gradually evolving 
and cooperative basis between Panama 
and this Government, our Army Sur-
geons General and the great men of 
preventive medicine such as Gorgas him-
self, Cummings, Reed, Rickets, Leonard 
Wood, who was memorialized yesterday 
at Fort Leonard Wood, having an Army 
hospital named after him, in which I 
was privileged to participate, and others. 
Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, it is note-
worthy that all of the memorabilia that 
were in Cuba which was liberated as a 
result primarily of some of these early 
preventive medicines discoveries in the 
so-called Spanish-American War, had 
been destroyed by burning in the streets 
of Cuba, after the Castro takeover. 
Mr. Speaker, I know personally of the 
research that has evolved from the Labo-
ratory and of the great men of science 
who have functioned and studied and 
researched and developed good for hu-
manity therein. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
bill for one other reason, if the gentle-
woman from Ohio will yield further, and 
that is as stated, it cooperates with the 
Pan American Health Organization 
which is a subdivision of the World 
Health Organization in needed matters 
that do cross international boundaries. 
But this is uniquely American and West-
ern Hemispheric organization and labo-
ratory. 
Mr. Speaker, lest we become too 
deeply involved in one organization of a 
strictly "international character" taking 
over all research and functions, espe-
cially under its aegis, in situations par-
ticularly unique to the Western Hemi-
sphere, Latin America, and our Cen-
tral American friends in particular, I 
strongly urge the support of this bill. 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOLTON. I thank the gentle-
man from Missouri very much for his 
contribution. 
Mr. SELDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Florida [Mr. FAscEml. 
(Mr. FASCELL asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, in sup-
port of the request for the additional au-
thorization for the Gorgas Memorial 
Laboratory, I wish to point out that the 
great work performed by the laboratory 
directly contributes to the health of U.S. 
citizens. 
As an example, one project currently 
being worked on deals with migratory 
birds since there is evidence that viruses 
such as St. Louis encephalitis and Vene-
tuelan equine encephalitis are transmit-
ted to the United States by these migra-
tory birds. When World War II broke 
out, and the United States lost its source 
of quinine and troops in southeast Asia 
were riddled with malaria, it was the 
work done by the first director of the lab-
oratory, Dr. Herbert Clark, that permit-
ted the U.S. Army to prescribe Atabrine 
safely and in sufficient dosage to control 
the situation in southeast Asia. I pray 
to God that no similar problems will arise 
In South Vietnam, but we must be pre-
pared. 
There is no duplication between the 
work of the laboratory and other agen-
cies. It works closely with the Pan 
American Health Organization and the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infec-
tious Diseases. The Gorgas Memorial 
Institute which runs the laboratory also 
works closely with private institutions; 
one such program is a graduate research 
program with Louisiana State University 
where teachers and graduate students 
are sent to the laboratory in Panama for 
short-term periods to pursue work in 
tropical medicine. Similarly, the insti-
tute has close relationships with other 
American universities?Stanford, Har-
vard, and Kansas, to name a few. This 
aspect of the program will be expanded. 
The General Accounting Office an-
nually reviews the expenditures of the 
institute and the laboratory, and the 
Comptroller General's report has been a 
part of the laboratory's annual report for 
many years. The GAO has never criti-
cized any expenditure made by this 
worthy enterprise. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend favorable 
consideration of this bill to increase the 
authorization of appropriations for the 
support of the Gorgas Memorial Lab-
oratory. 
Mr. SELDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time. 
The SPEAKER. The question is on 
the motion of the gentleman from Ala-
bama that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill S. 511, with an amend-
ment. 
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds having voted in favor thereof) 
the rules were suspended and the bill as 
amended was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the 
table.

quirements providing control over intrastate 
traffic in these drugs, and making posses-
sion of stimulants and depressants except 
under specified conditions illegal. As is al-
ways the case, if a particular State law or 
regulation places more stringent controls 
over these drugs, those requirements must 
be complied with. 
DRUGS COVERED 
Barbiturates and amphetamines are spe-
cifically named in the law. However, the 
law speaks in terms of "depressant or stim-
ulant drugs" which also includes any drug 
which contains any quantity of a substance 
which Is found to have a potential for abuse 
because of its depressant or stimulant effect 
on the central nervous system or its hallu-
cinogenic effect. Thus, the Secretary of 
Health, Education, and Welfare can bring 
additional drugs under the controls of the 
law by regulation. He may also exempt 
drugs which would otherwise be included 
within the literal language of the law when 
the controls are riot necessary for the pro-
tection of public health. HEW *Under Sec-
retary Wilbur Cohen revealed that the De-
partment has been reviewing additional 
drugs with a view to having necessary regu-
lations promulgated by the date the bill 
takes effect?February 1, 1966. 
FEDERA,L REGISTRATION 
Manufacturers, compounders, and process-
ors and other firms already registered under 
the Drug Amendments of 1962 are required 
to indicate whether they are producing or 
distributing stiniulant and depressant drugs 
in their registration statement. The act 
does add wholesalers, jobbers, and distrib-
utors of stimulant and depressant drugs only 
to the list of firms 'which must register. 
Wholesalers anti jobbers were exempted from 
the registration under the drug amendments 
of 1962. 
Wholesaling, jobbing, or distributing is de-
fined as selling any depressant or stimulant 
drug "to any person who is not the ultimate 
user or consumer." The report of the House 
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com-
mend pointed out that pharmacies main-
tained in conformance with applicable State 
laws are exempted from the registration 
requirement. 
Presumably, pharmacists who occasion-
ally furnish a medical practitioner with 
Office supplies or a fellow pharmacist with 
supplies to replenish his stock pending re-
ceipt of an order from a manufacturer or a 
wholesaler would not have to register; how-
ever, a pharmacist regularly engaged in 
wholesaling ofiThe supplies to physicians or 
dispensing stocks to other pharmacists 
would be reqUired to register. 
Since it Is clear that the law contemplates 
a complete and accurate record, the pharma-
cist must indicate the name and address of 
the pharmacist or physician to whom he de-
livered the supply, the kind and quantity of 
the drugs involved. The pharmacist (or the 
physician if he otherwise must keep records 
under the law) receiving the drugs must also 
make a record showing the name of the phar-
macist from whom received, the kind and 
quantity of drugs involved, and the date. 
No registration number is required, because 
the law speaks of "the registration number, 
If any, * * *" and pharmacies are not re-
quired to register with the HEW Secretary. 
RECORDS , 
The Senate Committee on Labor and-Pub-
lic Welfare report-notes the intention to "es-
tablish controls upon the distribution of 
depressant and stimulant drugs throughout 
the chain of distribution, from ;the basic 
manufacturer to * * * the ultimate con-
sumer." Each person handling stimulant 
and depressant drugs must prepare a com-
plete inventory of all stocks on hand as of 
the effective date of the legislation?Febru-
ary 1, 1966?and keep the inventory for at 
least 3 years. Thereafter, a record must be 
maintained. 
For stimulant and depressant drugs re-
ceived: the kind and quantity of the drug; 
the name, address, and registration number 
(assigned by HEW) of the person from whom 
received; the date of the transaction. 
For stimulant and depressant drugs ens* 
pensed: the kind and quantity of the drug 
dispensed or otherwise disposed of; the name, 
address, and registration number (generally 
not applicable for pharmacists or physicians) 
of the person obtaining the drug; the date of 
the transaction. 
The records must be kept. for 3 years un-
less State laws specify a longer period. 
In most instances, the wholesaler or manu-
facturer invoice will comply with the receipt 
record and the prescription file or patient 
chart with the dispensing record provided 
all the required information is available. 
The law also provides that the HEW Secre-
tary shall exempt from the provisions of the 
act by regulation any drug which may be 
sold over-the-counter; combinations, which 
include one or more substances in such 
quantity, proportion, or concentration suffi-
cient to prevent the stimulant or depressant 
drug from being ingested or absorbed in 
large enough quantities,to cause the stimu-
lant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect. 
INSPECTION 
The record of receipt and disposition of 
depressant or stimulant drugs must be avail-
able for Food and Drug Administration em-
ployees to inspect. Pharmacists may main-
tain separate flies in much the same manner 
as is now done for narcotics and where this 
is clone, both the Senate and House com-
mittee reports make it clear that the inspec-
tion authority is limited to those separate 
files. However, the law specifically provides 
that no separate records need be kept and 
the records need not be in any special form. 
Normal business and pharmaceutical records 
are sufficient. In hospitals, patient order 
files and patient medical charts are sufficient. 
In the debate on H.R. 2 on the floor of the 
House, a colloquy between Congressman 
HARRIS and Congressman ROGERS of Florida 
pointed out that the inspection authority is 
not intended to confer any broader searches 
than the records for stimulant and depres-
sant drugs. The Congressmen agreed that 
"this does not in effect authorize fishing ex-
peditions" of the pharmacists' records. 
_ In light of the prior congressional denial of 
inspection authority to FDA agents, .a court 
will have to rule on whether an FDA in-
spector can utilize any evidence he may dis-
cover which does not relate to stimulant or 
depressant drugs where no separate records 
are maintained. 
The law and both committee reports em-
phasize that no special records need be 
maintained. This would be effectively nulli-
fied if evidence not relating to stimulant or 
depressant drugs was gathered under H.R. 
2's inspection authority and later used 
against the pharmacist. This would force 
pharmacists to maintain separate records or 
relinquish rights they otherwise would have. 
PROFESSIONAL SAMPLES AND PHYSICIANS 
The House debate clearly indicates that a 
record must be made of professional samples 
of stimulant or depressant drugs obtained 
from medical representatives. Likewise, the 
medical representative has to keep a record 
of the disposition of any professional sam-
ples to pharmacists or physicians. This is 
to preclude the development of a gap in trac-
ing the distribution of these drugs. 
Physicians and other licensed practitioners 
who regularly engage in dispensing stimu-
lant or 'depressant drugs to their patients 
and who make a charge for the drugs "either 
separately or together with charges for other 
professional services" must also keep records 
of receipt and disposition and make them 
available for inspection. 
WHO MAY LAWFULLY POSSESS 
Manufacturers, processors, and wholesale 
druggists dealing in stimulant or depressant 
drugs must register .with the Secretary of 
HEW and may then lawfully possess the 
drugs in the usual course of their legitimate 
businesses. Common carriers and their em-
ployees are also authorized to possess the 
drugs in the usual course of their legitimate 
business. Stimulant and depressant drugs 
may lawfully be possessed by (1) pharma-
cies; (2) hospitals; (3) clinics; (4) public 
health agencies which maintain establish-
ments in conformance with any applicable 
local law's regulating the practice of pharma-
cy and medicine; (5) physicians; (6) den-
tists, and other practitioners licensed by 
State law to administer depressant or stimu-
lant drugs in their practices; (7) persons 
utilizing the drugs in research, teaching, or 
chemical analysis as long as the drugs are not 
for sale; (8) officers and employees of Fed-
eral, State, or local governments while acting 
in the course of their official duties; (9) 
nurses and other medical technicians who 
are under the supervision of a practitioner 
licensed by law to administer stimulant and 
depressant drugs while acting in the course 
of employment or occupation and not on 
their own account; (10) employees and 
agents of groups (1) through (7) noted 
above while acting in the course of their 
employment; (11) patients or a responsible 
member of the patient's household for his 
personal use or that of a member of his 
household or for administration to an animal 
owned by him or a metnber of his household. 
PRESCRIPTION ORDERS AND RENEWALS 
Prescription orders, to comply with record 
requirements, must contain the name and 
address of the patient and the date of issue 
which are the normal requirements for all 
prescription orders. There is no requirement 
that the prescription order must be written 
and signed by the prescriber; stimulant or 
depressant drugs may be dispensed on tele-
phoned or oral instructions according to the 
usual practice. However, no prescription 
order can be renewed more than five times 
and no prescription order can be dispensed or 
renewed more than six months after the date 
of issue. If the prescriber indicates a larger 
number of renewals or a longer duration, the 
five renewals and six month limit still apply. 
However, if there are no renewal instructions, 
then the prescription is nonrenewable. 
These requirements apply to all prescrip-
tions after the effective date of the law re-
gardless of the date on which they were writ-
ten. After the 5 renewals or 6 months has 
elapsed, the physician may prescribe addi-
tional renewals for a like period. 
UNLAWFUL ACTS AND PENALTIES 
Any person who violates the provisions of 
the act is subject to the penalties of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Con-
viction carries a punishment of imprison-
ment for not more than 1 year, and a fine of 
not more than $1,000 or both for the first 
offense and imprisonment for not more than 
3 years and a fine not more than $10,000 or 
both for subsequent offenses. An additional 
penalty has been added where stimulant or 
depressant drugs are sold to a person under 
21 years of age. For a first offense, the pun-
ishment is imprisonment for not more than 
2. years and a fine not more than $5,000 or 
both, and subsequent violations carry a pen-
alty of not more than 6 years imprisonment 
and a fine of not more than $15,000 or both. 
Violations include possession of stimulant or 
depressant drugs except as authorized in the 
law; failure to prepare and keep an accurate 
record of receipt and 'disposition of stimulant 
and depressant drugs; refusal to access to or 
copying of any of the required records; re-
fusal to permit authorized inspections; dis-
pensing or renewing any prescription more 
than 6 months after its date of issue or

mately succeeded, with a generous assist 
from the United States, in toppling Ful-
gencio Batista's regime on January 1, 1959, 
and selling Cuba out to communism. 
It was not until December 2, 1961, that 
Castro finally acknowledged what was by 
that time obvious; 1. e., that he was a dedi-
cated agent of the international Communist 
conspiracy. But he declared on that occa-
sion: 
"Did I believe (in Marxism) on 26 July 
(1953) ? I did believe on 26 July. 
The mistake the U.S. State Department 
made in believing Castro was not a Commu-
nist in 1953 was only the first in a long 
series of blunders that continued to charac-
terize our policy toward communism in this 
hemisphere. Whatever reasons there may 
have been for believing Castro was non-
Communist in 1953 or 1959, there is no doubt 
whatsoever today that he and his regime are 
disciples of Marxism, and that Cuba is the 
center for subver:ion in Latin America. 
The United States, however, is abstaining 
from even encouraging Cuban refugees in 
another "26 de Julio" movement that would 
fulfill the betrayed promise of free elections, 
democratic government, and liberty for the 
people of Cuba. 
The spirit of the 26th of July movement 
long ago was betrayed by Fidel Castro and 
his clan of Communist conspirators. The 
brave, freedom-loving Cubans now have no 
one to help them revive that spirit. 
Ending the U.N. Deadlock 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. BENJAMIN S. ROSENTHAL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, August 18,1965 
Mr. ROSENTHAL, Mr. Speaker, un-
der leave to extend my remarks in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, I include at this 
point the lead editorial which appeared 
in the New York Times of August 17, en-
titled "Ending the U.N. Deadlock." 
The possibility that our Government 
would revise its position had been re-
ported in the press recently, and I had 
previously indicated my strong support 
of a more flexible position which would 
remove the deadlock which has paralyzed 
the General Assembly and affected the 
work of the United Nations for a year. 
The editorial follows: 
- ENDING THE U.N. DEADLOCK 
Washington's decision to terminate the 
controversy over Soviet and French peace-
keeping arrears was based on a recognition 
that there was no other practical way to 
preserve the world organization. 
The year-long deadlock in the General 
Assembly demonstrated conclusively that the 
United Nations could be destroyed, but that 
it could not be strengthened, by the futile 
effort to force a great power to contribute 
to peacekeeping operations of which it dis-
approved. 
Most member countries of the world or-
ganization came to this conclusion months 
ago. For this reason alone, it has been clear 
for some time that Washington, had no real 
alternative but to acctpt the majority view. 
The United States could not set itself up as 
the sole guardian of the U.N.'s interests, no 
matter how unassailable its legal position. 
Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg pointed up 
the most crucial aspect of the problem yes-
terday when he said that "the United States 
agrees, in light of present world tensions, that 
the General Assembly must proceed with its 
work." The need to preserve the U.N. for a 
possible role in Vietnam as well as the Other 
troubled areas has made it increasingly ur-
gent that the Assembly meet, vote and re-
sume normal business next month. 
40 The revision of the American position In..
Compromises within the Johnson ad-
ministration and in Congress. Some of the 
strains this created were reflected both in 
what Ambassador Goldberg said yesterday 
and in what he left unsaid. One thing left 
unsaid was what the United States would do 
to help the U.N. wipe out its $108 million 
deficit. 
Britain and the Scandinavian countries 
have shown the way with unconditional do-
nations of $18 million. Washington, pre-
sumably, is waiting for the Soviet Union to 
keep its promise of a "substantial contribu-
tion." Washington would have been wiser 
to state?as Adlai Stevenson urged before his 
death?that the United States intends to 
help the United Nations in its finances re-
gardless of what other countries do, 
A similar position might well have been 
taken in another respect. If the Soviet 
Union has been wrong to open a breach in 
the Assembly's authority to assess ,its mem-
bers, is the United States right to open this 
breach wider by emphasizing?before any 
issue arises?that it "reserves the same op-
tion"? Suggesting that Washington might 
emulate Moscow in this regard is a poor con-
tribution to strengthening international 
morality. 
The paramount consideration, however, is 
the need, to end the debt crisis and put the 
General Assembly. back to work. Eauallv 
important, the United States has not yielded 
on the Assembly's authority to initiate 
peacekeeping operations when the Security 
Council, which has the primary responsibil-
ity, is immobilized by a veto. Voluntary 
contributions have effectively financed such 
operations in the past and there is no reason 
why they cannot in the future. 
Taken as a whole, the new flexibility in 
the American position is welcome. It will 
not resolve all the difficulties that face the 
United Nations. But, by resolving the pres-
ent impasse, it will preserve the world or-
ganization for a future in which it can grad-
ually again grow in strength. 
Eccentrics Unnecessary 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, August 18, 1965 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, the 
Des Plaines Valley News, an independent 
publication serving communities in 
southeast suburban Cook County, pro-
duced a brief editorial in its Thursday, 
August 12, edition which I believe is a 
most timely and significant comment on 
a phase in current civil disobedience 
actions: 
ECCENTRICS UNNECESSARY 
In the flood of those photos of marchers 
for various movements or demonstrations 
allied with the Negro cause for equality, the 
aim for peace for Vietnam, and the rebellion 
at the college campuses are seen the eccen-
trics. 
These are those bearded, unkempt indi-
viduals that in earlier days one Would class 
as "bums." These seldom bother to wear 
common attire, but always wear the extreme. 
They are passionate in their demands. The 
causes, they suport are sometimes as queer 
as their apparel. However, note that where 
some cause gets public attention and TV 
coverage these individuals are surely seen 
to be among the other, more dedicated lead-
ers of the movement, 
The citizens that watch are treated with 
contempt. Apparently this group finds that 
such oddity catches the attention of the 
public. 
One cannot pass judgment on the plight 
of these individuals but it would do well if 
the leaders of important causes sort of im-
prove their image and exile the eccentrics or 
face attention of the sort that they rather 
not have. 
Praise Due Self-Policing Efforts 
of Nation's Pharmacists 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. PAUL G. ROGERS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
' Tuesday, August 10, 1965 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
as a member of the House Interstate and 
Foreign Commerce Committee, which 
handled the recently enacted Drug Abuse 
Control Amendments of 1965, I was 
pleased to see the efforts taken by the 
industry to fully effect the provisions of 
the new law. 
The American Pharmaceutical Associ-
ation has just circulated a reference 
guide explaining the provisions of the 
new law to various health practitioners. 
This effort stands as a fine example of 
the type of cooperation and initiative 
needed to curb the illicit traffic in barbi-
turate and amphetamine drugs. 
I include the American Pharmaceuti-
cal Association pamphlet in the RECORD 
at this point: 
H.R. 2 AND You?A R5.3,ERENCE GUIDE TO THE 
DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMENDMENTS OF 1965 
FOR HEALTH PRACTITIONERS 
(Norm?After more than a decade of pro-
posals'and hearings, the Drug Abuse Control 
Amendments of 1965 establish special con-
trols for depressant and stimulant drugs. 
Practitioners of the health professions know 
the measure as H.R. 2 by Representative 
HARRIS (89th Cong.), the Dodd bill (88th 
and 87th Congs.), after its sponsor, Senator 
DODD, the Boggs bill in earlier Congresses, 
and the barbiturate and amphetamine 
proposal.) 
The American Pharmaceutical Association, 
the national professional society of pharma-
cists, presents the highlights of the new law 
affecting the health practitioners here. The 
purpose of this effort is to educate those who 
must practice under this new law as to the 
requirements established and acquaint them 
with their individual responsibilities created 
under the legislation. We firmly believe that 
the pharmacists of this country conscienti-
ously assume their ethical and legal obliga-
tions. The American Pharmaceutical As-
sociation hopes this commentary will foster 
an understanding of the purposes and details 
of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 
1965. 
The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 
1965 amend the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act and place additional controls 
over stimulant and depressant drugs through 
increased recordkeeping and inspection re-

August 18, 1965 \ CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- APPENDIX A4639 
In fact as well as any man I have ever known. 
This did not prevent him, however, from 
committing his most disastrous political 
blunder?the attack on the Supreme Court. 
But, it did enable him to govern New Stork 
State during the Seabury inyestigation of 
the late Mayor James ..T. Walker's administra-
tion, without assisting Judge Seabury in the 
least and without favoring the Democratic 
organization at all. Both sides assailed him. 
Both called him the man on the flying trap-
eze, but neither sensed that he enjoyed that 
role very much. 
His sense that his place in history de-
pended on what he did for the common man 
was called demagoguery by his opponents. 
I just won't accept this at all. I sat in 
those early cabinet meetings, and I can tell 
you there was no time for demagoguery. 
The hour was too late and the days too full 
of anxiety for any thought other than the 
welfare of our country. The banks had been 
closed and reopened, but they were shaky. 
Millions were jobless and millions were hun-
gry. 
Those pieces of legislation pounded out in 
the forge of imminent national failure were 
entrusted in a large measure to me?opera-
ting as chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee?to effectuate on the Hill. Many 
men took part in their formation?and it 
is significant as the late Speaker Sam Ray-
burn, of Texas, pointed out, that of the 100-
odd basic acts?such as labor legislation, 
banking reforms, securities regulation, social 
security and many others?not one has been 
repealed and all have been augmented by 
both parties in succeeding sessions of the 
Congress. Accordingly, it is unkind, unfair 
and untrue to call Mr. Roosevelt a demagog 
on this score. 
To be sure, he loved the approval of the 
people and the lionization by his huge fol-
lowing. But who doesn't? Loving applause 
ahd rabble rousing are two different things. 
There are two factors which prevented F.D.R. 
from becoming a rabble rouser. First, and 
you may believe this or not, he was deeply 
conservative. He hated to spend public 
money unnecessarily, and he dreamed of the 
day he could balance the budget. 
I shall always remember an evening I spent 
with him after dinner in the White House 
as he was going over with me matters on 
which of necessity required his approval. 
I,shall never forget when he said if the price 
of cotton which I think was then 6 cents 
a pound in the' market could be raised to' 10 
or 11 cents, and corn and wheat could 
be raised from the price offered in the Kansas 
City markets, comparable with the increase 
on cotton?and if it were possible to in-
crease the national income from approxi-
mately, as I recall it, $57 to $65 billion at 
that time?to approximately $75 billion we 
would be able to balance the budget?which 
if my memory serves me correctly?was ap-
proximately $7 billion. 
The public needs, and the necessity of 
spending held his mind; but close to his 
heart was the idea of stopping Federal spend-
ing as quickly as he could. At the slightest 
rise in the economic health of the country, 
he would stop spenditg. In fact, he stopped 
Vending so abruptly in 1937 that it brought 
about a recession. Perhaps nothing illus-
trates how conservative he was at heart 
more than the discovery that the ex-presi-
dent of the New York Stock Exchange, 
Richard Whitney, was an embezzler. Had 
F.D.R. been a demogog, he would have 
gone to the country screaming, "I told you 
so," and demanded fuller powers. Ile could 
have gotten them, too. But he did nothing 
of the kind. Perhaps it is an index to F.D.R. 
the man that tears came to his eyes, "I 
can't believe that Dick would do such a 
thing," he [mid and added "Poor Groton." 
They had been schoolmates there. 
One of his great qualities was to turn 
reverses into a joke. Thus, when he lost the 
purge elections, defeating only one opponent, 
the chairman of the Rules Committee, John 
O'Connor, of New York, he laughed off his 
defeat with the marvelous wisecrack, "It 
was a bad season, but we won the Yale 
game." 
Another time, when his executive secretary, 
the very able James Rowe, urged him to take 
an action to which he was opposed?accord-
ing to Jim Rowe, the President said, "Jim, 
you've made a forceful argument, but by 
accident we're not going to do it." 
"By accident?" asked Rowe. "What acci-
dent?" 
"The accident that the people of the 
United States elected me President instead 
of you," F.D.R. laughed. 
I have told you that he was a man who 
could throw off a jibe, but there was one 
which cut him deeply. That came at a time 
when he was convinced that the country had 
to prepare for war. Taking the cue from his 
agricultural plan of reducing craps by a 
third, the President's foreign policy was 
described on the Senate floor as a plan to 
plow under every third American boy. That 
hurt, hurt deeply, so deeply that it was 
weeks before he rallied enough to be very 
angry about it. 
He liked nothing better than new ideas 
and interesting people and he especially 
liked to talk to them over a cocktail at day's 
end. He fancied himself as a great cocktail 
mixer, with few equals in martinis, and 
without parallel in old-fashioneds. 
He was deeply aware of the prerogatives 
of the Presidency. He insisted that the great 
respect for the office be observed because none 
respected it more than he. Thus, he was 
annoyed when an autograph seeker pre-
sumed to go upstairs in the White House 
to get it. He refused and ordered him ex-
pelled. 
Although his life had been attempted in 
Miami, it affected him little. He was a 
fatalist about that, and as I have previously 
said, he was deeply religious. He often said, 
"If they want you, they'll get you, and there 
isn't anything you can do about it." In 
fact, it was the Cabinet which intervened 
to put more protection around him. The 
Attorney General, Robert II. Jackson, was 
summoned to the White House one mid-
night, and found only one old guard between 
Pennsylvania Avenue and the Lincoln Room. 
He protested strongly and after that Mr. 
Roosevelt consented to more security 
measures. 
He, of course, loved the Navy, because of 
his boyhood sailing days. He also, of course, 
had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
under President Wilson, a job also held at 
one time by President Theodore Roosevelt. 
With his admirals he was in especially close 
contact. He could take criticising of his 
other departments very well, but those at-
tacking the Navy were on thin ice. He 
would shut off those critics with a single 
sentence "What do they know about battle-
ships?" 
His administration has been described as 
the greatest royal court since Louis XIV. 
There is a certain element of truth about 
this. While the President was bold in imag-
ination, sivift in execution, and highly 
knowledgeable about government finance, 
administration was not one of his strong 
points. He was little less than grand in his 
delegation of authority; he was magnificent 
in backing up the men he appointed, but 
unfortunately he often appointed two de-
partments with sweeping powers to do the 
same job. This resulted in terrible depart-
mental fights, which F.D.R. dearly loved. 
Since both sides bitterly complained to him, 
he kept himself, at least, fully informed. 
His method of reaching policy decisions 
in those early days is worthy of note. I have 
for it the greatest admiration. He would in-
vite all points of view to the White House 
for dinner, or immediately thereafter. He 
would introduce the subject for discussion, 
and then listen to all sides. Sometime after 
11 o'clock he would turn to Miss LeHand 
and say "Missy, I think this is the best we can 
do." He would then and there dictate his 
ideas in a memorandum. All had had their 
say, and all had a pliecise idea of what the 
President wanted. Thereafter, very fre-
quently, would delegate the job to two com-
peting departments, and the fur would start 
to fly. 
Nor did his idea of administration stop 
there. His kitchen cabinet, often had more 
access than the regular Cabinet. Hopkins 
and Corcoran were his principal lieutenants 
after the death of Louis Howe and to the 
annoyance of many department heads their 
word was law more often than not. It is in 
pattern that these two men also ended up 
at loggerheads as did many of his department 
heads. 
This dislike of ordinary channels led him 
to value new faces and new ideas. In that 
respect, he was very typical of the age in 
which he was educated. He had a little 
knowledge of nearly everything. He was an 
avid reader, with a great memory, and there 
was scarcely a subject on which he could 
not contribute an anecdote or an observa-
tion. This accounts in part for his great per-
sonal charm. The experts of the country 
who had spent lifetimes on a particular sub-
ject would find that F.D.R. knew enough 
about it to grasp immediately what they were 
talking about. This wide range of interest, 
these smatterings, if you will, gave F.D.R. 
the ability to be a great and sYmpathetie 
listener, without which quality he could not 
have been the justly famous conversational-
ist that he was. 
If he had a single great love, / believe it 
was American history. On this, he was an 
authority, as is President Truman. For Mr. 
Roosevelt, it had the excitement of contest. 
One could almost see him visualizing him-
self on how he would have acted had he 
been President at that time. He had a 
genuinely deep affection for our country, re-
garding it as the greatest romance of his-
tory. That spirit, I think characterized his 
administrations while I was in the Cabinet. 
One almost felt the warmth and keen in-
terest of the administrations since George' 
Washington, and here I will say that, in my 
opinion, there has never been an administra-
tion?Republican or Democratic, without it. 
The Cabinet and the President of the United 
States are, in our history, majestic, and I 
never knew a man holding such position who 
did not give the country the best that was 
in him. I have no patience with those cynics 
who believe that there is no such thing as 
consecrated public service. 
I have said that it is difficult to separate 
the man from the work, and it is. But by 
their works shall ye know them, and if this 
be the standard, F.D.R. stands anclfored in 
American history with the rest of our great-
est Presidents. 
As for F.D.R. the man, and myself, I have 
this to say. Since it is fair to say that we 
parted on principle, it also follows that we 
met on principle, the principle of what was 
best for New York State and later the Re-
public. For 12 full years, we saw the result 
of our labors enacted into laws which still 
stand as the laws of our country, laws which 
are now endorsed in the platforms of both 
parties. 
Further, the pattern of concern for our 
fellow Americans has been elaborated to a 
principal and permanent goal of the Nation. 
None of these would have been possible 
without President Franklin Delano Roose-
velt. 
And so, it is my absolute conviction that 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt the man?can 
safely rest his case before God, the American 
people and history?on the works and deeds 
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32d Presi-
dent of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ?APPENDIX August 18, 1965 
[From the Detroit (Mich.) Free Press, Aug. 
6, 1965] 
FARLEY CALLS F.D.R. "CONSERVATIVE"--? 
SPEAKS AT KALAMAZOO 
KALAMAZ00.?A man politically close to 
Franklin 13. Roosevelt Thursday night de-
scribed the New Deal President as "deeply 
conservative," a man who "hated to spend 
public money unnecessarily" and one who 
"dreamed of the day he could balance the 
budget." 
This assessment of Roosevelt came from 
James A. Farley, his Postmaster General 8 
years and, as Democratic national chairman, 
director of the first two of his four success-
ful campaigns for the presidency. 
The assessment was made in a lecture, 
"FDR?The Man," prepared for delivery as 
the last in a series on "The Roosevelt Era," 
sponsored by Kalamazoo College to com-
memorate the 20th anniversary of his death. 
The Nation's worst depression existed 
when F. D. R. took office. The world's worst 
war was raging when he died in office. 
Farley and Roosevelt split politically when 
the latter decided to seek a third term. Far-
ley opposed more than two for any man, 
and he said Thursday "severance took place 
on a basis of principle, not personality." 
Farley, now chairman of the Coca-Cola Ex-
port Corp., prefaced his description of Roose-
velt as deeply conservative by saying: "you 
may believe this or not." 
"The public needs and the necessity for 
spending held his mind. But close to his 
heart," Farley said, "was the idea of stopping 
Federal spending as quickly as he could. 
"At the slightest rise in the economic 
health of the country, he would stop spend-
ing. In fact, he stopped spending so 
abruptly in 1937 that it brought on a re-
cession." 
Farley said Roosevelt liked nothing better 
than new ideas and interesting people and 
especially liked to talk over cocktails at day's 
end. 
"He fancied himself," Farley added, "as a 
great cocktail mixer, with few equals in mar-
tinis, and without parallel in old-fashioneds. 
* * 
"I believe he was gifted with a sense of ' 
destiny and of leadership," Farley said, 
"Which stood him and the Nation in good 
stead in hours of grave crisis." 
Ticking off landmarks in New Deal legisla-
tion, such as social security and banking 
reform, Farley said "we saw the results of our 
labors enacted into laws which still 
stand ? * ? laws which are now endorsed 
In the platforms of both parties." 
"And so," he concluded, "it is my absolute 
conviction that Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
the man?can-safely rest his case before God, 
the American people, and history?on, the 
works and deeds of Franklin Delano Roose-
velt, the 32d President of the United States." 
"His administration has been described as 
the greatest royal court since touts XIV. 
There is a certain element of truth about this. 
While the President was bold in imagina-
tion, swift in execution and highly knowledg-
able about Government finance, administra-
tion was not one of his strong points." 
The former Cabinet member said "11,e was 
little less than grand in delegating author-
ity," but "unfortunately he often appointed 
two departments with sweeping powers to do 
the same job." 
"This resulted in terrible departmental 
fights, which F. D. R. dearly loved."

Aug. 6, 1965] 
PARLEY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BOTH F.D.R., 
L.B.J. 
(By Tim Richard) 
If James A. Farley is enthusiastic about 
the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
whom he served as Postmaster General and 
Democratic National Committee chairman, 
he is just as -enthusiastic about the works 
of President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
"He will go down in history as one of our 
greatest Presidents," Farley said of L.B.J. 
"No President has put through as much 
controversial legislation as Johnson, and in 
such a short time." 
The old New Dealer was asked in an inter-
view this morning to contrast the personal-
ities of F.D.R. and L.B.J. 
Roosevelt was the Harvard- and Columbia-
educated aristocrat, "even tempered, not too 
explosive. He didn't like criticism; no Presi-
dent does. 
"Like all men, he could be very small at 
times," Farley said, recalling F.D.R.'s re-
fusal to do favors for persons who had of-
fended him sometime in the past. 
"He liked to be told he was tough, but he 
wasn't," Farley said. 
Johnson, on the other hand, was born in 
meager circumstances, received a less elab-
orate education in Texas colleges, started as 
a teacher, then went to Washington as a 
congressional assistant, Farley recalled. 
"He's politically minded, and he likes the 
political atmosphere of Washington," Far-
ley said. "He isn't going to try to hurt, 
he won't attempt punishment, of someone 
who votes against him." 
Whereas Farley said unboastfully that he 
handled F.D.R.'s relations with individual 
Congressmen?"they knew I spoke with the 
authority of the President"--Johnson takes 
charge of congressional relations himself. 
"His personal relations with Senator Digit-
SEN (Republican leader) are as close as with 
Senator MANSFIELD (Democratic leader)," 
Farley observed. 
One exception to L.B.J.'s no-retaliation 
rule occurred when the President became 
sensitive to the criticism of Senator PRANK 
CHrracx, Democrat, of Idaho, over the ad-
ministration's Vietnam war escalation pol-
icy. 
Johnson asked CHURCH where he got his 
ideas, and CHURCH replied he read liberal 
columnist Walter Lippmann. Farley chuck-
led as he recalled L.B.J.'s retort: 
"The next time you want a dam, talk to 
Lippmann about it."

PARLEY DESCRIBES F.D.R. IN TALK HERE 
(By Rob Warden) 
James A. Farley, at '77, characterizes 
Franklin 13. Roosevelt as a man who "rests 
his case with God, the American people, and 
history." 
Speaking Thursday night at Kalamazoo 
College, Farley commented that he "broke 
with President Roosevelt because of prin-
ciple, not because of personality." 
Farley, U.S. Postmaster General during 
F.D.R.'s first two terms, resigned in 1940 
because he opposed the idea of a President 
breaking tradition by seeking a third term. 
Concluding a lecture series commemorat-
ing the 20th anniversary of President Roose-
velt's death, Farley called F.D.R. "a deeply 
good man, and really quite religious." 
"It is unkind, unfair, and untrue to call 
? Mr. Roosevelt ?a demogague," Farley said. 
"He was deeply conservative, and dreamed 
of the day he could balance the budget." 
"Big Jim" was Democratic national chair-
man and directed the successful Roosevelt 
presidential campaigns in 1932 and 1936. He 
is currently board chairman of Coca Cola 
Export Co. 
Farley's talk Thursday night concerned 
only the first two terms of President Roose-
velt, while Farley was a member of the 
cabinet. 
Referring to his resignation from the ad-
ministration, Farley said, "Men must be very 
close to have a split between them become 
first-page news." 
The public needs and the necessity for 
spending held Roosevelt's mind, but close to 
his heart was the idea of stopping Federal 
spending as quickly as he could, Farley said. 
"At the slightest rise in the economic 
health of the country he would stop spend-
ing. In fact, he stopped spending so 
abruptly in 1937 that it brought on a re-
cession," Farley recalled. 
Roosevelt liked to be surrounded by inter-
esting people with new ideas and he particu-
larly enjoyed discussions with them over a 
drink at the day's end, Farley said. 
"Mr. Roosevelt was exceptionally canny 
and knowledgeable," Farley said, "and he 
liked nothing better than new ideas and new 
faces." 
"He fancied himself as a great cocktail mix-
er, with few equals in martinis, and without 
parallel in old-fashioneds. 
"His administration has been described as 
the greatest royal court since Louis XIV. 
There is a certain element of truth about 
this," Farley observed. 
"While the President was bold in imagina-
tion, swift in execution and highly knowl-
edgeable about government finance, admin-
istration was not one of his strong points," 
Farley added. 
Farley said Roosevelt enjoyed much more 
freedom of action in his first two terms than 
in the last two when "the compulsions of war 
and of failing health assailed him." 
Giving his personal estimate of F.D.R., 
Farley said "I believe he was gifted with a 
sense of destiny and of leadership which 
stood him and the Nation in good stead in 
hours of grave crisis." 
Farley, who stands 6 feet, 2 inches and 
weighs 215 pounds, said he admired F.D.R.'s 
vitality in lieu of the handicap that polio 
had imposed on him. "In this way," Farley 
said, "he was like Theodore Roosevelt. They 
both had great physical vitality, and they 
both had physical handicaps." 
President Roosevelt, however, was less than 
perfect, Farley said. "He often appointed 
two departments with sweeping powers to do 
the same job." 
Looking back 25 years at the history he 
helped? make, Farley commented that F.D.R. 
"stands in Amer tory with the great 
Presidents."

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, August 18, 1965 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, as 
we watch the growing demands of 
some Communist-infiltrated organiza-
tions and other groups of well-meaning 
but misguided Americans, and as we ob-
serve the voices of appeasement within 
the hierarchy of this administration, it 
would be practical for us to heed the 
very timely commentary on history 
which appeared in the Seymour Daily 
Tribune recently: 
TWELVE YEARS LATER 
July 26, 1953?July 26, 1965. 
For Castro and his fellow Communists, 
12 years of struggle, then triumph, then 
total, tyrannical dominion over the island 
and people of Cuba. 
It was 12 years ago that a 1:land of rebel 
Cuban youths with Fidel Castro at their 
head attacked the Moncada Barracks in 
Santiago de Cuba. This was the first strike 
in a 51/2-year guerrilla campaign that ulti-

And in its preoccupation with Vietnam, the 
Ainerican public has failed to notice very sig-
nificant and troubling developMents south of 
the border. ' 
But events are not only proving that Cas-
tro's threats are not so empty, but are also 
calling into question many of the smug as-
suiriptions about developments in such places 
US Venezuela. 
' Any comparisons to Vietnam area are of 
Course to the earliest stages of that war when 
victims of terror and ambush were listed by 
the dozens rather by the thousands. 
? 
ASKOMPTION' IN' ItiTEZITELA 
With regard to Venezuela:it bas been as-
sumed in Washingten that the success 2 years 
ago in holding free elections in spite of oppo-
sition from Communist terrorists had more 
or less settled he guerrilla problem. 
After all, it was reasohed the Venezuelan 
Government was freely ohOsen, left of center, 
and -very, progressive in social good works. 
More than moat people on this earth, Amer-
icans cling to the myth that good govern-
raent is of itself a defense against Commu-
nist guerrillas. 
. Very handily for the Communists, we have 
been brainwashed into assuming that Com-
munist terrorists can thrive only if most of 
the people are against a government. It is 
a very unhistbric assumption. 
In. Europe, the destruction of Czechoslo-
vakia's popular and progressive government 
by a Communist minority is just one of many 
examples of the fact that the Communists 
usually take Over in spite of the will of the 
Majority. 
, 
' YEN5ZTTF4, TASsoN 
In Venezuela, the lessen is that terrorist 
guerrillas, if supported from the outside 
(Cuba) can dangerously increase their 
troublemaking capacity in spite of good gov-
ermilent--a government that has among 
Other things effectively worked at matters 
of land reform and helping the peasantry. 
- As in Vietnam, the peasants of Venezuela 
may hate the guerrillas, but they will not ex-
pose them for fear of torture and death. 
The discovery of 5 tons of armaments 
-hidden in the Han Antonio Del Gauche re-
gion of Venezuela this week follows a gun 
battle in the same area between military 
forces and guerrillas. A secret guerrilla 
headquarters of the FALN (National Libera-
tion Armed Forbes) was even undovered in 
the, petroleum center of AnZoatguil State. 
' 
TRAINING r?k CLDMR/LLAS 
But if Castro and company' have their way, 
this is but a foretaste' of far Verse to "come. 
According to reliable 'reports reaching 
WaShington, guerrilla training?once con-
fined ip Cubit itself--;-is gaiiag on in the Vene-
zuelan *fates Of tare and Falcon, The guer-
rilla chieftain Is a 'former "Venezuelan news-
paper than, 'Fabrthi6" Ojeda. " 
The Venezuelan' National Liberation Front 
believes in, the formalities. It is officially 
represented in Cuba by German Layret, who 
recently went through the fornialitk of sign-
ing , a "mutual aid pact" with the Vietcong 
representative in "Havana. 
Castro's press and radio made much of 
this and openly boasted that the pact her-
alded," the, atart Of-Vietnani:type wars, not 
just in Venezuela but in other parts of Latin 
America. Clearly, the Communist guerrillas, 
like their counterparts in Asia, are planning 
carefully and diabolically for the years ahead. 
Weapons and central direction are coming 
from cube and will continue to do so?as 
lpng as" the fed: State's Permits this to 
goon. 
The question is whether the United States 
- can afford to look the other way while Cuba 
- provides the transmission belt for" weapons 
with which the Communists plan to subvert 
the bemispliere. 
In Vietnam; we waited 'until almost the 
11th hour before' attempting seriously to 
interrupt outside sources of supply of men 
and material. Isn't there a lesson to be 
learned from that tragedy? Or are we to 
be paralyzed into inaction by failing to take 
seriously Castro's threats of turning Latin 
America into a series of Vietnam's?

OF 
HON. 'JAMES A. HALEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. HALEY. Mr. Speaker, in this 
time of domestic turmoil and interna-
tional crisis, it is refreshing to hear some 
one speak with a calm sane voice. For 
this reason I have asked permission to 
irclude in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, my 
friend, Mrs. George L. Burr's column, 
"One Woman Comments," which ap-
peared in the August 19, 1965, issue of 
the Winter Haven, Fla., Herald. 
Josephine Burr, as she is known to her 
many friends and readers, gives sound 
advice that is worthy of the attention of 
readers of all ages?not just the young 
people entering college to whom these re-
marks were addressed. If more people 
lived,Mrs. Purr's philosophy, this world 
would be a more stable and more whole-
some place in which to live: 
ONE WOMAN COMMENTS 
(By Josephine G. Burr) 
Let us forget the trials of the National 
Council of Churches this week while I write 
a letter to my granddaughter. She is only 
6 and starting to school, but I am going to 
pretend that she is 18 and starting to college 
because I hope some college-bound boy or 
girl will read this and possibly think a bit 
more carefully when he gets to the campus. 
DEAREST VICKIE: I know you are a bit fear-
ful as you leave home this fall, for you are 
actually going out into the world alone for 
the first time. A college or university cam-
pus is a world of its own and a place where 
you will meet all kinds of people. You will 
either thoroughly enjoy your life there, as I 
did, or be heartsick because you did not 
realize your great opportunity to learn what 
life is all about. Life of today is much more 
complicated than it was for me 50 years ago, 
however, so I think maybe I can help if you 
will heed. 
First you young folks are much more aware 
of what is going on in the world today than 
we were back in 1913. There are peculiar 
"isms" abroad in the land, wild-eyed terror-
ists, and some who believe communism will 
save the world from destruction. But there 
ire also many good ideas, many fine thinkers. 
I hope you have absorbed from your prob-
lems class in high school or the course you 
took in communism that Florida high schools 
require, the dangers that lurk in these pecu-
liar subversive minds. I am sure you read 
of the troubles the Berkeley, Calif., campus 
had last fall. Many people thought it all the 
fault of Communist off-campus folk who 
created this trouble. I think they had their 
part in it, but let's face it, there is unrest on 
every college campus today created by this 
changing world in which we find ourselves. 
'The "Wave of the Future" that Ann Morrow 
Lindbergh wrote about back in the 1040's has 
overtaken us. Every nation, however small, 
is trying for the highest kind of freedom and 
to equal the good things that we here in 
America have enjoyed for so long. They hate 
us for having found them first, and since 
this is the "land of the free and the home 
of the brave," they are trying to prove, in 
their strivings, that we are wrong and they 
are right. Revolution is in the air and the 
world is so rampant for freedom that we be-
gin to wonder if we are as free as we have 
always taken for granted we were. Let us 
not waiver?ever?in our ideas of what free-
dom really is and how to keep it. That is 
what you young folks of today must work to 
preserve. 
One thing I want to emphasize as you start 
your college career?please do your own 
thinking. You will doubt yourself at times 
and your ability to think right, but do not 
allow the thoughts of someone else to be-
come yours unless you have spent hours try-
ing to find out the truth about controversial 
subjects. You, Vickie, have been fortunate 
in growing up in a normal home. Many of 
the young people you will meet have warped 
minds because they were not so fortunate. 
Grief, money troubles, broken homes, liquor, 
can tear up lives and create so much unhap-
piness, especially in young people's minds, 
that they become unstable in their think-
ing and their emotions. Look into the back-
ground of those who seem different and try 
to discover why they are different?then feel 
sorry, be tolerant, but do your own thinking. 
But we were discussing freedom. When I 
was in college no one questioned it. Since 
then we have helped France and England 
preserve their freedoms in World War I, then 
again in World War II when the madman, 
Hitler, tried to change things to his warped 
mind's way of thinking, we sent our young 
men to fight for freedom. Now the Russians, 
who realized they 'were being ruled by a mad 
king, cannot seem to be happy just changing 
their own world. They are being led by the 
Ideologies of three other mad men, Karl Marx 
of Germany, Lenin, and Stalin. But some-
thing has happened in our own land of the 
free that is very frightening. We do not 
all seem to appreciate that our Founding 
Fathers planned well and there are too many 
Americans trying to change our world. 
Two characteristic stand out in all this 
strife of today?hate and fear. They are not 
new?they ruled the German Kaiser, they 
definitely ruled Hitler, and today they rule 
all the odd people who think change is the 
only road to freedom. The one thing to me 
that will make you realize we have been and 
still are on the right track in America, will 
be your absorbing the education that you are 
about to undertake. However, you must keep 
your feet on the ground; you must believe, as 
you have been taught, that there is a God 
above us all who strives to help us; and that 
if you live by the Golden Rule, you cannot 
get off the right course for long. Education 
also means tolerance to me, Vickie, for all 
people are not made alike?everyone has his 
good points and his bad ones. Just be sure 
you can tell the difference and are not led by 
bigotry or mass thinking, but by your own 
careful estimation of what is the best course. 
I am sure you will know and if you become 
confused, pick out a person you love and trust 
and talk it all out. 
One last admonition and to me it is very 
Important. I want you to have fun and 
enjoy your college life as well as its oppor-
tunities, and the best way to do this is to 
join with a group of congenial folks in a 
Greek letter society. Today they are, the last 
sure bulwark of Americanism on the college 
campus. They exist for the sake of friend-
ship; they are governed by men and women 
who have been careful in their thinking. 
Their first loyalty is to God and country and 
they provide a "home away from home" where 
you can find folks reared as you were reared, 
girls and boys who think about life as you 
do and have been forewarned by parents and 
fraternity elders about the dangers of today. 
You will find folks you can talk to and dis-
cuss things with, but best of all, you will 
find real friends.

dinlinishes men's respect for it strikes at the 
Very heart of orderly, democratic, and pro-
sive living. This does not mean that all 
laws are either right or perfect. It does not 
Mean that laws should not change and 
evolve. But it does mean that the security, 
health, and progress of men and of nations 
lies in a respect for law and a willingness to 
obey it. 
In the last few days two prominent Ameri-
cans have addressed themselves to this very 
question, but from sharply different view-
points. ComMenting on the Los Angeles 
riots, former President Eisenhower said, "I 
believe the United States as a whole has been 
becoming atmosphered * * * in a policy of 
lawlessness. If we like a haw, we obey it; if 
we dont, we are told: 'You can disobey it.'" 
Also discussing the west coast rioting, New 
York -Senator ROBERT P. KENNEDY is quoted 
in an interview as saying that it was sense-
less to tell Negroes living in northern slums 
to obey the law, that to these Negroes the 
law is the enemy. 
The Kennedy statement is deeply disturb-
ing. "Even granting the fact that many 
Negroes do in fact regard the law as their 
enemy, Will the Kennedy statement do any-
thing to change their view? Will it not, 
rather, give them the impression that in-
natienal figures look with sympathy 
upon their breaking of the law? As a former 
Attorney General who had shown himself 
active in securirig wider Negro protection un-
der law, Senator KENNEDY is in a particularly 
favorable position to remind the Negro that 
the law is, in fact, his greatest safeguard. It 
Is regrettable that this opportunity was 
missed. 
We agree without reservation with Presi-
dent Eisenhower's statement: "I believe we 
Must 'have greater respect for law. This 
means 'to me we must review our * * 
moral standards." 
Great efforts are now being made nation-
ally on behalf of the Negro. Greater efforts 
Will doubtless be made in the future. While 
it is true that many of these efforts are be-
lated, It is also true that they are being made

To Our Soldiers in Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
er 
HON. JOHN A. RACE 
WISCONSIN 
IN 111E HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. RACE. Mr. Speaker, the current 
issue of the Jewish Veteran carries a 
front page editorial entitled, "To Our 
Soldiers in Vietnam." 
This editorial, representing the official 
view of united Jewish war veterans, ana-
lyzes the role of Red China, not only in 
the "narrow confines" of the Vietnam 
struggle, "but also in the light of all its 
worldwide implications." 
Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my 
remarks I request that the editorial be 
printed at this point in the RECORD, and 
commend its careful reading to my col-
leagues: 
To Ova SOLDIERS IN VIETNAM 
The veterans community of the United 
States wants you to know that we stand 
four-square in support of your sacrifice in 
the cause of freedom. As citizens who have 
borne arms for this Nation before you, we 
realize full well the importance to your 
morale and fighting spirit the assurance that 
the whole country is fully aware of the 
nature of your mission and the vital im-
portance of it. 
At the heart of the American involvement 
In Vietnam is the confrontation of the grow-
ing power and influence of the world's most 
dangerous and irresponsible nation?Red 
China. 
Debates are in progress about the Ameri-
can strategies and tactics in Vietnam, the 
rights and wrongs of our involvement, and 
the issue of escalation. These are questions 
which should rightfully be examined and 
discussed in the Congress and by the public. 
But we must not lose sight of the basic 
motivation for the pending mobilization of 
Reserves and the expanded American com-
mitment in southeast Asia. 
Red China leaves us no alternative but a 
firm stand on every periphery of that restive 
aggressive goliath. 
We do not intend to make a case for the 
Saigon leaders of South Vietnam as the most 
perfect and desirable exponents of freedom. 
We hope and pray that better leadership for 
our side can be found. In the long struggle, 
We cannot defeat communism except through 
the dynamic appeal of a better idea?the 
true ideology of freedom. 
But in the larger picture, we are con-
fronted with such a massive peril that the 
deficiencies of the Saigon regime are some-
what beside the main point. The basic issue 
at hand is the dedication of China, a nation 
whose population is three of or four times 
as large as our own, to defeat and obliterate 
us. To them we are the mortal foe. They 
have served notice that they intend to crush 
us and our way of life. 
Today, China has the atomic bomb. Crude 
though their weapon may be when compared 
with the supermegaton power in American 
hands, the fact remains that the least re-
sponsible regime on earth has the power to 
Ignite a thermonuclear conflict. Millions of 
Chinese may be wiped out. But other na-
tions could be involved in a holocaust which 
Russia mi? ht not be able to avoid despite 
its present differences with Chinese ex-
tremism. 
-RED CHINA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 
Right now, China is seeking to gain her 
ends by exploiting so-called wars of national 
liberation. That is her role in the bloody, 
confused and unhappy affair in Vietnam. It 
also seems to be her objective elsewhere, even 
in the Near East where the Chinese are seek-
ing among other goals, to foment Arab guer-
rilla violence against Israel to create a tacti-
cal diversion to Vietnamese conflict. 
Let us also examine the role of Red China 
toward Israel. Peiping blackballed Israel 
back in the days of the Bandung Confer-
ence of Asian Nations, alleging that Israel 
was "an imperialist creature" and had no 
right to exist. Israel had previousry recog-
nized Red China diplomatically because, 
whether one likes it or not, Red China exists. 
But Peiping did not reciprocate and rejected 
a diplomatic exchange because her only 
thought of Israel was as a scapegoat to use 
in appealing for Arab sympathies. 
Arab guerrilla attacks on Israel, if carried 
to lengths that would inflame the whole tense 
frontier problem, would spread, confuse, and 
Intensify the world crisis. It would help the 
-Vietcong by keeping American forces on the 
alert in the Mediterranean and Europe. The 
U.S. 6th Fleet, for instance, could not relin-
quish its marine components for duty in 
the Far East, if trouble were brewing in the 
Near East. 
Such a move would also inflame the Arab 
masses to serve Chinese ends by intimidating 
Arab leaders into closer support of the 
Peiping line. China, instead of Russia 
would become the most militant activist and 
leading exponent of Arab fanaticism against 
Israel. 
Peiping feels that an Arab-Israel war could 
diminish mounting American pressure in 
Vietnam, extricate China from a military 
showdown for the present, and provide more 
time far development of atomic weapons and 
delivery systems. Such strife is consistent 
with Chinese attempts to foment "anti-
imperialist" disorder throughout southeast 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
Offers have already been made by China 
to the extremist "liberation front" of Pales-
tinian Arab refugees. Headed by Arab agi-
tator Ahmed Shukairy, an Arab delegation 
was welcomed to Peiping and promised 
money, weapons, and military training if 
they would launch a "liberation war" against 
Israel. China envisaged internal sabotage 
by Israel's Arab population, creation of an 
armed underground movement, bombings, 
sabotage, and infiltration raids from outside. 
Mao Tse-tung told the Arabs that "an Al-
gerian delegation told us once that Algeria 
lost a million lives in the guerrilla struggle 
for independence. I told them that peoples 
should not be frightened if their population 
decreases in the course of a liberation war, 
for they will enjoy a period of peace after-
ward in which they can again multiply." 
Peiping considers it ridiculous that 45 mil-
lion Arabs surrounding 2% million Israelis 
do not crush the Jews with action and blood 
Instead of mere words and promises as es-
poused by Egypt's Nasser and others. 
Nasser and Shultairy are not quite ready 
for a "peoples' war" against Israel because 
they know that Israel has the power to hit 
back and that the United States might not 
stand idly by. Nasser fears that the Sinai 
zone might become another Danang, poised 
against Arab infiltration if the "masses" ever 
materialized on a Vietcong-type rampage. 
Mao subsequently condemned Arab lack of 
militance as "bourgeois humanitarianism." 
They are "too, preoccupied with survival," he 
charged. But he hopes eventually, inexora-
bly, to enlist the Arabs in a Near Eastern 
escalation in keeping with the insidious and 
subversive Chinese strategies. 
Therefore, when we support our Govern-
ment and its actions in Vietnam we do so not 
only within the narrow confines of that area 
but also in the light of all its worldwide 
Implications.

IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, /965 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, so far 
as the public is concerned, there seems to 
be no attention being paid to Castro and 
his regime in Cuba as constituting a 
threat to the Western Hemisphere. 
I was glad to note the following article 
written by Marguerite Higgins which ap-
peared in the Washington Star:

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WESTON E. VIVIAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 2, 1965 
Mr. VIVIAN. Mr. Speaker, for over 
8,0 years, the Adrian Daily Telegram, a 
newspaper located in my district, has 
been informing the citizens of Lenawee 
County, Mich., on the local, national, 
and international events which daily af-
fect their lives. 
A recent editorial in the Daily Tele-
gram, entitled "How Much Security," 
discusses the history of the social se-
curity program, particularly the role 
which social security income and the 
medicare program play in the lives of the 
elderly of our Nation. The editorial is 
brief but uncommonly sound. I com-
mend it to the attention of my colleagues. 
It follows: 
[From the Adrian Daily Telegram, Aug. 23, 
1965] 
HOW MUCH SECURITY? 
The social security measure adopted 30 
years ago provided retirement income for 25 
million workers. The ultimate goal was to 
provide retirement funds, as a matter of 
right, for all the Nation's aged. The 25 mil-
lion figure seemed a good place to start, and 
at a reasonable scale. 
The program has been expanded greatly 
since those days of the 1930's. Some 76 mil-
lion Americans now are covered including 
professional people, farmers and business-
men. About 20 million already are receiving 
benefits, an average of $80 a month. The 
maximum now is $135.90 a month. 
Next year the average monthly payment 
goes to $149.90 a month. In 1971 the maxi-
mum rises to $167.90 a month. Social secu-
rity sweeteners have been enacted in each of 
the last 7 general election years, all of them 
calling for a greater expenditure of social

security funds and oftentimes also calling for 
higher social security payments. 
Last month President Johnson signed the 
biggeSt sweetener of all, the medical care 
program for all persons over 65 years of age. 
It ended a two-decade struggle to obtain ap-
proval of such legislation. Again, the social 
security cost, both to employee and employer 
Will be increased. 
The social security program has been a 
great boon to the American people. It has 
helped people prepare for old age vtho might 
not be able to meet the demands of this 
Period in life any other way. The medical 
care program, while it will be costly, will 
benefit many older people. A net egg is 
easily wiped away in the twilight years dur-
ing one long seige of illness. 
Cost has a bearing on the operation of the 
social security system, of course. ,But the 
key to success or failure lies in deciding 
where security should end. Social security 
must not stifle ambition. It must not 
smother a willingness to work. It must not 
penalize aggressiveness. It must not under-
mine determination. It must not discourage 
the desire for independence. 
It must not erect roadblocks to initiative. 
It should permit people to retire in dignity 
but it should not convert them into useless 
Vegetables. Thank heavens, we are safe, so 
far. 
Manolo eyes?First President of the 
Cuban Sertoma Club of Miami 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DANTE B. FASCELL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 2, 1965 
Mr. FASCRIT. Mr. Speaker, Manolo 
Reyes, a prominent Cuban newsman now 
living in exile in Miami, Fla., was re-
cently installed as the first president of 
the Cuban Sertoma Club of Miami. 
The programs outlined by Mr. Reyes in 
his installation speech reflects a deep 
love of the country and a profound and 
abiding faith in the. future Of his brave 
land now swept by terror, and tyranny. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Reyes' 
remarks to the attention of my col-
leagues: 
Few have been the occasions in which a 
group of citizens from the United States and 
Cuba have gathered together for an event 
like the one taking place tonight: the offi-
cial Chartering of an association devoted to 
help and serve mankind, supported by Cuban 
exiles living in a land of liberty. 
Consequently, this event of extraordinary 
importance, shows undoubtedly the grati-
tude of the people of a nation that, have 
been treated like real brothers by the people 
and the Government of the United States. 
A brave and nqble people that will not be 
bought, nor surrender, and are fighting to 
break the chains of communism, with the 
conviction that in their freedom they will 
bring also liberty for the entire American 
continent. , 
As president of the Cuban Sertoma Club 
of Miami, elected by the free and democratic 
vote of its members, I express to all and each 
one of the distinguished personalities of 
Latin America and to the Federal, State, and 
local authorities of the United States, the 
testimony of our deep gratitude for your 
presence in this act, whtch will encourage us 
to proceed on the long road ahead of us and 
which ratifies an old friendship, proving, 
now more than ever that we are not alone. 
Why was the Cuban Sertoma Club of Mi-
ami organized? 
First of all, because of God's willingness; 
and second, because a group of Cuban and 
American citizens decided to create another 
way of helping humanity. This is a troubled 
world where although the word love is con-
stantly repeated, we forget most of the time 
that only when serving mankind can we 
truly prove our love for our fellow beings. 
Interpreting the way of thinking of the 
members of the Cuban Sertoma Club of 
Miami, I want to express our gratitude to 
four American citizens without whose co-
operation this institution would not have 
been possible. They are: A. L. Plager, Steve 
Collinson, Charles Nelson and John D. Bar-
field. 
Who should be members of the Cuban Ser-
toma Club of Miami? 
Those who love their country distinguish 
themselves from others because they serve 
the cause of liberty without stopping to 
thank about the cost of sacrifice, while the 
others try to obtain something of personal 
interest with the least sacrifice. 
The Cuban Sertoma Club of Miami will be 
composed of the first kind of people. We 
reject the others. 
A nation has two wrong types of citizens: 
Those who do not belive in their country, 
and those who express belief in their country 
but do not do anything for it. 
The Cuban Sertoma Club of Miami will 
accept those who want to work for the bene-
fit of mankind, and for their own country, 
Cuba, which was not horn to be enslaved. 
For this reason, the Cuban Sertorna Club 
of Miami will be composed of exiles who 
have been forced to abandon Cuba because 
of communism, and who will pledge them-
selves to work in favor of all Cubans, those 
within the martyred island as well as those 
in exile, hoping to receive as their only re-
ward: the right to serve humanity and the 
cause of liberty. 
What are the plans of the Cuban Sertoma 
Club of Miami? 
For approximately 7 years, the Cuban peo-
ple have suffered in their flesh Communist 
oppression. Children growing today in what 
was once called the Pearl of the Antilles, are 
not Cubans; under the pressure of a fright-
ful indoctrination they are being converted 
Into youths without spiritual values; with-
out Pan Americanism; and without true Cu-
ban feelings. It is a Communist-inspired 
youth. 
When Castro-communism is defeated, it 
will be necessary to save this youth, who 
have not seen the light of truth, and we 
have to prepare the ways and means so that 
they can learn a new idea, of which they are 
ignorant, the concept of liberty. 
The future of nations depends on educa-
tion. Liberty is obtained by breaking the 
chains of ignorance. ? 
Therefore, the Cuban Sertoma Club of Mi-
ami, a civic, nonpolitical and nonprofit asso-
ciation, having the basic.understanding that 
education is freedom, proposes to study as 
many concrete plans as possible to help de-
communize the people of Cuba, and especially 
the Cuban youth of today which is under the 
perverse influence of 1VIarxist-Leninism. 
In the meantime, we intend to help in 
every way we can the children of our coun-
try in exile, in order for them to learn the 
advantages pf growing and studying in this 
country?the cradle of democracy?but at 
the same time to help them to maintain our 
traditions; our customs; our history; our 
Cuban way of life, until the moment they 
will be able to return to our country, once it 
Is liberated from communism. 
Many of ,them will be the future leaders 
of the new Cuba and must be prepared for 
that event. 
Moreover, the Cuban Sertoma Club of Mi-
a,rni will spare no work or effort to act as 
one more bridge of friendship, understand-
Ing and help between the people and the 
authorities of the United States or Latin 
America and the Cuban community in exile. 
For all these purposes we invoke, now and 
forever, God's help, and the help of all the 
citizens of the free world, who, fortified by 
good faith and friendship, may wish to share 
the trials that we now suffer and our hap-
piness once Cuba is freed from communism. 
The Cuban Sertoma Club of Miami is one 
more means created to help gain the peace 
in a Cuba liberated from communism and to 
this effect we respectfully request from this 
moment on as many valid promises as pos-
sible to help the creation of a new Cuba, 
the pride of all Cubans and of a continent 
which is being redeemed from communism 
by a nation nailed to a cross of suffering in 
the middle of the Caribbean. 
But, Cuba will never die. Yesterday it 
suffered the aliment of dictatorship. Today 
it suffers the epidemic of communism. But 
rising above the transitory illness that affect 
its health Cuba lives and will live forever. 
And now, let's all get to work. 
State Technical Services Act of 1965 
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. CHARLES McC. MATHIAS, JR. 
' OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 1, 1965 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (HR. 3420) to pro-
mote economic growth by supporting State 
and regional centers to place the findings of 
science usefully in the hands of American 
enterprise. 
Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. Chairman, this 
bill would initiate the first comprehen-
sive effort to make the tremendous ben-
efits of national research activities avail-
able to American business, commerce, 
and industry throughout the country. 
This would be an effort beneficial to 
many localities, to American enterprise 
and to the whole American economy. 
This is in the best sense a cooperative, 
grassroots program. It encourages 
States to mobilize their industries and 
institutions to make full technico-eco-
nomic surveys and to formulate long-
range economic plans. Many agencies 
in my own State of Maryland are already 
-engaged in such planning, and this leg, 
islation would further those efforts and 
help other States to begin similar proj-
ects. The planning aspects of this bill 
could also have many "spin-off" effects 
in promoting increased cooperation 
among industries and institutions on in-
numerable local tasks. 
The programs developed on the basis 
of such preliminary planning will be pin-
pointed to meet the problems of free en-
terprise within each State. The types 
of technical assistance which can be 
utilized are limited only by the percep-
tion and imagination of the committees 
involved. Through technical advice, 
through seminars and discussions, 
through the dissemination of informa-
tion, local industries will be lifted i:nto 
enhanced competitive positions as they 
begin to take full advantage of the tech-
nological advances of recent years.

21936 CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD,? SENATE September 2, 1965 
There is every reason for believing, 
however, that, to the extent that the 
Castro Communists and Peiping Com-
munists have inflUence in the American 
Negro community, their followers are en-
couraged to foment unrest; to take part 
In Negro riots and uprisings, to seek to 
provide them with leadership and direc-
tion, and to seek to extend the area of 
hostilities. 
'So, while the broadcasts of Radio Dixie 
may not reach as far as Chicago and 
Los Angeles, it would be a fair conclusion 
that the contents of these broadcasts 
concide with the, guidelines laid down 
by the Castro agents in this country for 
their followers in the American Negro 
community. There may not be many 
American Negroes who follow the Castro-
Peiping line. I doubt that there are as 
many as 1,000, and I think the number 
would be nearer several hundred. But 
in an inflammatory situation a handful 
of trained agitators, committed to vio-
lence and arson, can do an awful lot of 
, damage. 
It is a matter a record that Com-
munist cadres undergo systematic train-
ing in the techniques of organizing riots 
and breaking through police lines. 
There is even a Coin.munist handbook on 
the subject which has been distributed 
, in many languages. 
It is a matte); of record, too, that, quite 
apart from providing leadership in riot 
situations, a handful of Communists in 
key positions can suffice to Lake over an 
entire country--as they did in Cuba, as 
they did in the 13razzaville, Congo, as 
they did in Zanzibar? and as they recently 
almost succeeded in doing in the Domini-
can Republic. 
So let no one minimize the capacity 
for mischief of a handful of Commu-
nists, And let no one minimize the dan-
ger inherent in the fact that, in every 
major metropolitan center in the United 
States, there exists- at least a handful of 
Communist extrents committed to the 
Castro-Peiping line. 
Patterns of Communist activity are 
difficult to pin down, especially in riot 
situations. But I do read some signifi-
cance into the fact,that apparently some 
of the rioters. made their #rst targets the 
gunshops and pawnshops in the Watts 
area and that not only did they succeed 
In escaping with many hundreds of? 
weapons, but they systematically set the 
torch to all gunshops they had looted so 
that even the owners could not know 
how many guns were stolen anq. how 
many destroyed. The rioters also made 
prime targets of drugstores for the pur-
pose of obtaining narcotics, and of liquor 
stores, 
There is, therefore, some serious rea-
son for believing that Castro had a hand, 
or at least a finger, in the Los Angeles 
riots, and that we nia,, j anticipate more 
trouble from this aource over the coin-
ing period. 
I don't mean to imply that if there 
,were no Castrp-dommunist influence in 
the American Negro community, there 
would have been no Los Angeles riots.' 
'This w9U1c1 be, p, gross oversimplification. 
;n._ order to ..effectively_egminate the 
danger of racial explosions like os An-
geles, we wifl have to eliminate the so: 
cial conditions that breed frustration 
and anger and hatred among our Negro 
citizens. 
? We will have to eliminate the Negro 
ghettos.? . 
We will have to conquer the serious res-
idue of discrimination that still exists 
In our society. 
We will have to achieve the goal that 
the administration has set for our Na-
tion?the goal of a society free from 
every form of religious and racial dis-
crimination, where every citizen not 
only enjoys complete political equality, 
but complete social equality and equality 
of opportunity as well. 
But let us have no illusions. These 
goals are not going to be achieved over-
night, even with the best of intentions 
and the most energetic programs. 
During the period of readjustment to 
the American society of the future, it is 
my hope that our Negro the,
will 
continue to follow the lead of the respon-
sible leaders of the civil, rights move-
ment, who have repeatedly warned them 
against the dangers of violence. 
It is my hope that, with the help of 
these leaders, they will be able to dis-
cipline their more unruly members, and 
expose, and isolate the agents of Castro 
and Mao Tse-tung, who urge the Amer-
ican Negroes to emulate Los Angeles and 
-pursue the fatal path of violence. 
FEEDING THE HUNGRY WITH U.S. 
FARM SURPLUSES 
Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, ever 
since he served as Director of the food-
for-peace program, my distinguished col-
league, GEORGE McGovmax, has been 
America's leader in urging us to under-
take a more comprehensive, worldwide 
"war against want." He has seen, as 
clearly as any man alive, the appalling 
contradiction between a world where 
millions starve and a United States 
where we seek to cut down our food pro-
duction. He has introduced ambitious 
new legislation designed to make possible 
a much larger, more effective American 
program to use our agricultural bounty 
to feed the hungry of the world. 
In the Newark Sunday News of August 
29, there appeared a United Press article 
which highlights the problem of world 
hunger and Senator MCGOVERN'S role in 
opening America's eyes to it. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this article, "Senator Would 
Feed Hungry With U.S. Farm Surpluses," 
be printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
SENATOR WOULD FEED HUNGRY WITH U.S. 
FARM SURPLUSES 
WASHINGTON.?For years, a bountiful 
America has struggled?and spent millions?
to control its farm surpluses. 
Now a farm State Senator wants an about-
face which would let farmers grow more 
food on more land and would distribute 
more of it to the world's hungry millions. 
Led by Senator GEORGE S. MCGOVERN, 
Democrat, of South Dakota, a group of Mid-
western Democrats in Congress contend it 
Is neither sensible nor moral for the United 
States to follow a program of sharply cur-
tailed food production when everyday half 
a billion people go to bed hungry. 
And they warn that strict Federal controls 
have reduced the Nation's food stockpiles to 
such a low point, that there are not enough 
of some of basic commodities to maintain 
a 6-month reserve for'home consumption. 
ADMIT PROBLEMS 
They admit that the problems in their 
plan could be many and complicated, But 
they argue that the results would be good 
for American farmers as well as for interna-
tional relations. They believe President 
Johnson agrees. 
The roots of the food-for-peace (FFP) 
program lie in a 1954 law which provides for 
the distribution of surplus U.S. crops to 
have-not nations. The food may be given, 
bartered, sold for the currency of the receiv-
ing nation, or bought through a 40-year 
American loan plan. 
In 1961 the program was designated food 
for peace, with MCGOVERN as its first direc-
tor. But he found his office carried little 
authority. He resigned in 1962 to run for 
the Senate. But his 18-month exposure to 
FFP left its mark. 
On one side of the world he had seen mass 
graves of those who had starved to death; 
children whose gaunt limbs and distended 
stomachs testified to their hunger, and 
some blind from lack of proper nourishment. 
At home were millions of acres taken out 
of production in a continuing battle against 
too much food, even while farmers declared 
that their private economic depression could 
eventually engulf the cities. 
BILL LACKING 
President Johnson suggested in his farm 
message to Congress establishment of strat-
egic reserves of food but he submitted no 
bill to accomplish this. 
Representative CLAIR A. CALLAN, Democrat, 
of Nebraska, did so June 3 with a measure 
which called for reserves of food equal to 
half a year's requirements. 
Under his proposal, for example, 600 mil-
lion bushels of wheat would be kept on hand. 
That would leave only 41 millions for dis-
tribution abroad. 
Two weeks later MCGOVERN submitted to 
the Senate an International Food and Nutri-
tion Act of 1965. It would authorize an ad-
ditional $500 million of foods of all kinds, 
not merely those now surplus, for distribu-
tion to hungry nations. 
The program would be increased at the 
rate of $500 million a year until it reached 
$3.5 billion in 10 years. 
FULBRIGHT BILL 
His bill went to the Foreign Relations 
Committee whose chairman, Senator J. W. 
FULBRIGHT, Democrat, of Arkansas, has indi-
cated he believes FFP should be stepped up 
from the mere dumping of surplus foods to 
providing the vitamins and proteins which 
hungry children require. 
Support for his plan was forthcoming. 
Vice President HUBERT H. HUMPHREY prom-
ised whatever help he could give. Senator 
WALTER P. MONDALE, Democrat, of Minnesota, 
claimed that MCGOVERN'S plan would work 
for this country's own interests. 
"For every 10 percent the less developed 
countries increase their income level, they 
expand their dollar purchases of our farm 
products by 16 percent," he said. "Italy, 
Japan, and Nationalist China have moved 
from the status of food aid recipients to 
major dollar customers for our farm ex-
ports." 
But some Members of Congress doubt that 
MCGOVERN'S proposal would do the job. 
NO FORMULA 
Senator KARL E. MUNDT, Republican, of 
South Dakota, said attempts have been made 
in the past to feed the world's hungry but 
that no workable formula ever was devised.

HOUSTON POST COMMENDS SENA-
TOR KENNEDY FOR PLACING FOR-
EIGN AID IN PERSPECTIVE 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
out of the sound and fury of political 
propagandizing, it is often difficult for 
one to maintain the proper perspective. 
However, once in a while a speech or edi-
torial cuts through the fog like a sharp 
ray of sunlight. 
Such a service was rendered to the 
Senate a few months ago by the distin-
guished junior Senator from New York 
[Mr. KENNEoyl during debate on the 
foreign aid bill. He pointed out that 
whereas in 1950 the United States was 
spending 10 percent of the Federal budg-
et and almost 2 percent of our gross 
national product on foreign aid, today, 
although we are still spending approxi-
mately the same $3 billion a year, we are 
allocating only 3 percent of the Federal 
budget or one-half of 1 percent of our 
gross national product to foreign aid. 
As Mr. KENNEDY pointed out, in 1965 we 
are putting only approximately one-third 
the effort into foreign aid that we did 
15 years ago. 
? 
As the Houston Post noted in an excel-
lent editorial, this observation really puts 
our present foreign aid program into 
perspective. I commend the Senator 
from New York on his excellent speech, 
and the Houston Post on picking up that 
speech and making it the heart of an 
excellent editorial. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the editorial "Foreign Aid 
Put in Perspective" published in the 
Houston Post of June 20, 1965, printed 
In the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Houston Post, June 20,1965] 
FOREIGN AID PUT IN PERSPECTIVE 
One of the favorite tactics of critics of the 
U.S. foreign aid program is to toss figures 
around without relating them to anything 
meaningful. 
To most people, a billion dollars is a hor-
rendous figure beyond the capacity of their 
imaginations, and they cannot relate it to 
anything concrete in their experience. Tak-
ing advantage of this, foreign aid critics 
like to cite the huge sum that the program 
has cost this country since it was started 
following World War II. While picturing it 
as charity, they try to create the impression 
that it is a tremendous burden that the 
American people cannot afford. 
For that reason Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY 
of New York made a point during Senate 
debate on the pending foreign aid measure 
that deserves more attention than it is 
likely to receive. 
He pointed out that 15 years ago, in 1950, 
the United States was contributing a sum 
equal to 10 percent of the Federal budget 
and almost 2 percent of the Nation's gross 
national product to economic development in 
the rest of the world. 
Today, this spending amounts to only 3 
percent of the Federal budget and one-half 
of 1 percent of the gross national product. 
In other words, the U.S. Government to-
day is making less than one-third the effort 
it was making in this area 15 years ago. 
Because of change in the situations of 
many countries that have received help in 
the past and an increased ability on their 
part to stand on their own feet, it has been 
possible to curtail annual aid expenditures. 
This alone is eloquent testimony to the ef-
fectiveness of the program. 
The approximately $3 billion a year that 
still is being spent on foreign aid may seem 
like a very large sum when it is used as an 
isolated figure, and it is large, of course. 
A billion of anything is quite a lot nu-
merically. But the cost of the program has 
to be related to other relevant figures to be 
meaningful, and when it is, the foreign aid 
expenditure seems very much smaller. 
Senator KENNEDY and some others are ask-
ing whether or not, in light of the great 
needs of the people of the world and this 
country's vastly increased responsibilities, 
we are spending as much on foreign aid 
today as we should. 
Senator JOSEPH CLARK of Pennsylvania 
said in the Senate discussion that the 
United States should be thinking about a 
$10 billion program of economic aid, in addi-
tion to military aid, instead of concentrating 
on how to reduce present appropriations. 
Those who are opposed to any foreign aid 
will dismiss all this as a liberal point of 
view and therefore not worthy of considera-
tion. But, assuming that the program is 
managed intelligently and efficiently and 
conducted in such a way that it truly serves 
the national interest, the question raised 
is one that Americans of conscience should 
not ignore. 
In any event, Senator KENNEDY did some-
thing that badly needed to be done. He 
helped place the present allocation for 
foreign aid in proper perspective. 
CASTRO CITES AMERICAN NE-
GROES TO VIOLENCE 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know 
that all of us were horrified by the un-
speakable savagery and the senseless de-
struction that characterized the recent 
riots in Los Angeles. And I for one 
wholeheartedly endorse the warning 
issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson 
that such violence cannot advance the 
cause of civil rights, but will, on the con-
trary, only retard it. 
I do not mean to minimize the suffer-
ing or injustices or frustration which 
helped to make Los Angeles and Chicago 
riots possible. However, I want to point 
out that such violence runs counter to 
the entire tradition of the American 
Negro and counter to the teachings of 
the legitimate civil rights movement. 
A new element has been added to the 
situation in American Negro communi-
ties which makes them more riot-prone. 
This new element is the existence of or-
ganized extremist groups, preaching 
hatred, and committed to acts of vio-
lence. In addition to the Black Muslims, 
there are some hundreds of Negroes who 
are members of the Communist Party, 
or of the pro-Peiping Progressive Party, 
and there are other groups like the Dea-
cons scattered around the country. 
The broadcasts of the renegade Ameri-
can Negro Robert F. Williams, over Cas-
tro's Radio Dixie, constitute an open, 
crude, and brutal incitation to violence. 
They are now encouraging all American 
Negroes to follow the example of Los 
Angeles and to carry it further. 
To give you an idea of the inflamma-
tory nature of these broadcasts, I want 
to quote a few paragraphs from Robert 
F. Williams' broadcast of August 21 over 
Radio Dixie: 
Yes; Los Angeles, Los Angeles. The glori-
our spirit of our brutally dehumanized 
people of the ghetto has restored our self-
respect, our human dignity. Los Angeles is 
a warning to oppressive racists who said, 
they can no longer enjoy immunity from 
retribution for their brutal crimes of violence 
and oppression of our people. 
My brothers and sisters, times are critical, 
They are going to become ever more critical. 
We are facing a future wherein the streets 
shall become like rivers of blood. Let us be 
prepared to fight to the death, organize, arm, 
learn to shoot and to handle explosives. 
When the impending showdown comes, use 
the match and the torch unsparingly. The 
flame of retribution must not be limited to 
urban buildings and centers, but the country-
side must go up in smoke also. Remember 
the forests, the fields, and the crops. Re-
member the pipelines and oil storage tanks. 
Yes, let it be known to the world that we 
shall meet their sophisticated weapons of 
violence with the crude and simple flame of 
a match. We cannot escape our historical 
mission of destiny any more than our op-
pressors can escape the destiny of retribution. 
I am informed that Radio Dixie broad-
casts over only a limited area of the 
country?as far west as Texas and as far 
north as Virginia. It would be an exag-
geration, therefore, to state that these 
broadcasts were directly responsible for 
the Los Angeles riots.

approximately 10 of the Cubans have already 
had interviews arranged for them with school 
superintendents in Bergen and Hudson 
Counties, Tile others will also be inter-
viewed for teaching positions this summer. 
In addition to the master QS arts in teach-
ing program work, the refugees will receive 
special instruction in the history of Ameri-

guage (all 26 speak English to varying de-
grees of com.petency), and comparative 
clIlture and literature of Cuba and the 
United States.

The refugees will live in dOrmitories on the 
Teaneck campus until September. After 
they obtain full-time teaching jobs, their 
families will join them. 
Dr. Cancio-,Bella, who said he is apersonal 
friend of Batista's, was? at various times dur-
ing a 7-year period, Ambassador to Panama, 
Costa Rica, Peru, Uruguay, and Chile. He 
is as fluent in Franck:1,p Spanish, having 
studied at the University of Lyon in France. 
He may end up teaching French and Spanish 
in some North Jersey high school. 
All the refugees were picked by Dr. Wil-
liams and his staff during interviews in 
Miami this spring. Approximately 150 per-
Slims were considered, 
Raul E. Mencliguita was a civii judge in 
Sancti-Spiritus, Cuba, for 26 years before 
leaving for exile in the United States. When 
he was interviewed in Miami, Mendignita was 
working in a tomato-packing plant. 
Another former, government official among 
the group is Andres Suarez. He was in the 
Ministry of Education during Batista's tenure 
and joined the Castro regime as assistant 
secretary in the Ministry of the Treasury 
from January 1, 1959 to October 1960. He be-
came disillusioned with Castro and fled to 
Miami by plane in the fall of 1960. He said 
he has been doing some freelance writing in 
Miami. 
Mrs. Olga C. Fuentes, who assisted a pro-
fessor of physiology and genetics in the 
Vniversity of Havana, has good reason to 
remember the disastrous 33,ay of Pigs inva-
sion in 1961. Her husband was among those 
Who landed on the beach. He was captured, 
the said, and later exchanged. He works 
now in Miami and will join her when she 
becomes a teacher in September. 
-These four refugees are not optimistic 
about returning to Cuba, and they doubt 
they would go back now if they could. The 
main reason for their reluctance is the 
younger generation. They all have children 
and the children are thoroughly American-
ized. 
Suarez said he was interested in obtain-
ing American citizenship. He said he thinks 
his children would find Cuba a strange 
country if they returned. 
43r. Cancio-Bello has one on studying to 
be a doctor at the University of Miami and 
another son preparing for a career in chem-
ical engineering. He also has a 13-year-old 
daughter. Because his daughter talks only 
English now, Dr. Cando-Bello said, he de-
cided to give her lessons in Spanish gram-
mar. He taught her Spanish 1 hour a day 
for 6 months,

'be arolind awhile. When Castro does topple 
from power ,?there will be violent times in 
Cuba, Dr. Cancio-Bello predicted. 
Tor the first 10 clays of the institute, the 
refugees will meet periodically during the 
day with five recent American, college grad-
uates, some of who are also enrolled in the 
master of arts in teaching program. 
Their job is to help orient the group to 
new surrounding and to correct the refugees' 
English. Also, the refugees will be taking 
some field trips. Tomorrow they will tour 
Englewood Junior High School; later in the 
week they visit the Madison campus of FDU. 
Foreign Aid: Partnership of Industrialized 
Nations 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
- HON. ALEC G. OLSON 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 1965 
Mr. OLSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speak-
er, an article in the March issue of the 
Reader's Digest praises foreign aid ef-
forts to help the "have not" countries 
and points out that foreign aid is no 
longer a U.S. monopoly but a partnership 
of industrialized nations which realize 
that the peoples of the world must be 
responsible for each other if the free 
world is to survive. 
Two-thirds of the world's population 
live in the less-developed countries?
many of which are newly independent 
nations that must span centuries of pol-
itical, social, and industrial development 
in a few short years. Some of us may 
have the impression that only the United 
States is meeting this challenge through 
foreign assistance. But this no longer so. 
Although at one time the United States 
was the only country giving major aid, 
today we are one of many nations who 
feel they have an immense stake in the 
process of development in these coun-
tries. Seventeen other free world na-
tions now contribute substantial foreign 
assistance to the developing nations. 
Total free world aid amounted to $8.1 
billion in 1963, the last year for which 
figures are available. 
As David E. Bell, Administrator of the 
Agency for International Development, 
pointed out before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee recently: 
U.S. bilateral assistance, including Public 
Law 480 arid other economic aid, totals about 
.64 percent of our gross national product. 
The bilateral aid programs of other donors 
total slightly less?.60 percent of combined 
gross national product. But U.S. gross na-
tional product per capita is almost 3 times 
that of other donor countries. From this 
point of view, the relative burden on the citi-
zens of other donor nations is higher. 
The United States has been a major 
force behind the increased foreign as-
sistance efforts of other donor countries 
and we have been pleased with their 
response. Bilateral aid commitments of 
the developed countries increased by 50 
percent from 1960 to 1963 and for the 
-first time U.S. bilateral aid, including 
Public Law 480, was less than half the 
aid to the developing countries. The 
U.S. share of multilateral resources now 
ranges from 30 percent of World Bank 
subscriptions to 43 percent of the ordi-
nary capital of the IDB, while other na-
tions' contributions range from 44 per-
Mit Of World Bank subscriptions to 100 
A3489-
percent of the European Economic Com-
munity aid programs. 
There is every evidence that other 
donor countries will continue to increase 
their share. Canada has begun a new 
$50 million loan program in addition to 
their existing aid programs. The Neth-
erlands recently announced a 20 percent 
increase in aid. Loan terms are begin-
ning to ease in order to hasten develop-
ment without imposing prohibitive debt 
burdens on recipient nations. The Brit-
ish have decreased their average interest 
rates and West Germany has liberalized 
its loan maturities. The new Canadian 
program will include significantly more 
liberal terms than those provided by the 
United States. 
There is no doubt of the commitment 
of other nations to helping to better the 
lot of the masses of people in the world 
who live in poverty and ignorance. The 
magnitude of this human condition, the 
Increasing political responsibilities placed 
upon the developing nations in inter-
national affairs, and the multiplying 
threat of communism to the independ-
ence of their governments makes it man-
datory that the United States and other 
advanced countries continue to restate 
their commitment. 
In this context, I would like to call 
attention to the Reader's Digest article 
which gives an excellent account of what 
other countries are accomplishing by 
their commendable foreign assistance 
programs: 
HANDS ACROSS MANY SEAS 
(By James Daniel) 
(Noiz.?Foreign aid to have-not nations is 
no longer a U.S. monopoly. A progress report 
on nation-to-nation help.) 
In Guinea, a 600-mile-long aqueduct is be-
ing built to bring pure mountain water to the 
crowded capital city of Conakry. In Thai-
land, a dam under construction will provide 
25,000 kilowatts of electricity for homes and 
industries, besides irrigating thousands of 
acres of badly needed farmland. In Pakistan, 
buses are rolling through ancient streets 
where for centuries-the pace has been set by 
bullock carts. In Tanganyika, a recently 
completed railroad line is opening up the fer-
tile Kilombera Valley to new sugar planta-
tions. 
All these represent foreign aid at work?
but not U.S. foreign aid. This may surprise 
many Americans who have come to think 
that the United States is alone in giving 
economic assistance to other countries The 
fact is that many nations are helping other 
countries. More than $6 billion a year is now 
distributed in government grants and loans 
from industrialized nations of the free world 
to less developed countries. Of this, 38 per-
cent is contributed by countries other than 
the United States. 
On a proportional basis, several countries 
have equaled or surpassed the United States 
in economic assistance. France, for example, 
in 1963 extended $1.074 billion in total for-
eign aid (i.e., official governmental aid plus 
private investment). This effort was one-
forth as large as the U.S. performance, 
though France's production is only one-
eighth as great. In the same year Portugal, 
a far poorer country than Prance, devoted a 
record 1.89 percent of her gross national 
product to official aid alone. Even Belgium 
was ahead of the United States, proportion-
ally. 
None of this implies that we ought to enter 
a foreign-aid competition; nor does it mini-
mize the burden the United States has car-
ried and still carries. On the loan side of

CONGRESSIONAL RECOEP ? APPENIMX July 1, 1965 
reign aid, the 'United States is still the 
1 rgest source of easy credit, annually lend-
g more than $1 bition, much of it at 
ken interest rates of less than 1 percent. 
(5 ther countries have usually priced their 
1 ans at 3 to 6 percent, or even 'higher.) 
F rthermore, the United States devotes 9.4 
p rcent of its gross na,-;ional product to the 
ilitary defense of the free world, as com-
p red to 4,7 percent fo:: its allies. 
Many of America's allies, however, have 
t air full share of dramatic projects. Can-
a, for example, has built and helped fi-
ance the $36 million Warsak hydroelectric 
d irrigation development on Pakistan's 
abul River, near the historic Khyber Pass. 
t present, Canadians have 76 major proj-
e ts underway around the world. 
French railroad engineers undertook the 
odemization of India's electrical railways. 
&sides designing the new system, training 
e Indian supervisors, Mechanics, and con-
uctors, France built one-third of the loco-
otives and some of the other equipment. 
rack management teams borrowed from the 
rench railway system saiv the initial proj-
t through to completion in 3 years?half 
e estimated time for a comparable project 
Europe. And the work still continues. 
Just a decade ago, West Germany was on 
e receiving end of economic assistance; 
ow she is giving it, to more than 90 nations. 
few examples of German aid: an improved 
lephone system for South Korea, construe-
on of three irrigatior. dams in Tunisia, ex- - 
ansion of port facilities in Ceylon. 
One of the causes 'behind the upsurge in 
ee-world aid is the economic boom in West-
rn European and North American countries 
nd (J'apan. These nations have discovered 
hat foreign-aid missions often stimulate 
ore sophisticated wants in emerging na-
ions, requiring greater imports from the 
ndustrialized countries. Also, with aid pro-
rams former colonial powers maintain their 
resence in ex-colonier. 
Another cause': late in the 1950's Washing-
on candidly told European allies that the 
ime had come for them to spread some of 
heir Marshall plan-stimulated prosperity 
round among the poorer nations of Asia, 
rice, and South America. Besides genuine 
oncern over the pont :cal and social dangers 
nherent in the widening gap between haves 
nd have-nots, Washington was worried over 
he nagging imbalance in this country's in-
ernational payments. 
To put steel in the U.S. request, Wash-
ngton required that official economic-aid 
ollars henceforth be "tied", to purchases 
n the United States. This curtailed the use, 
y aid-receiving countries, of U.S. gift money 
o purchase commercial products from other 
ndustrialized countries. The latter, then, 
are compelled to increase their own aid 
ubstantially to keep 'alp their trade. 
One healthy upsho; of the U.S. cajoling 
urred in 1961, when Belgium, Britain, 
anada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the 
etheriands, Portugal, and the United States 
ortned the Development Assistance Commit-
ee within the framework of the Organize-
ion for Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ent. Norway joined in 1962, Denmark in 
963.: DAC's goals, besides persuading rich 
ountries to export more capital to poor ones, 
nclucle urging members to avoid wasting aid 
n unproductive proj acts, encouraging pri-
ate investment, and making sure that un-
erdeveloped countries are not loaded with 
ore debt than they can carry: 
DA.C's approach to foreign aid is low 
eyed and levelheaded. DAC officials say 
that aid is useless unless a receiving country 
as trained people, a stable government, and 
social system conchicive to working hard 
and getting ahead. In particular DAC 
bhors prestige projehts designed to flatter 
local rulers, such as .steel mills without ore 
hastoraers, or cold-war ploys based on 
the idea that if the free world doesn't give 
country X's dictator a dam the Colrimdflists 
will. 
The overS11 philosophy is sammed up in 
two state= nts. One was by Thorkil Kris-
tensen, economist and former Finance Min-
ister of benmark, who serves as OECD's Sec-
retary General. "Many of the mistakes in 
foreign aid,' he told me, "have come from 
trying no de the photographable things first 
without the necessary advance preparation." 
The other statement was from Willard 
Thorp, prolessor of economics at Amherst 
College, sersing as chairman of DAC. After 
noting that certain emerging countries' 
rulers wut ;he attainment or enjoyment of 
office or the pursuit of more territory ahead 
of economic betterment, Thorp said, "At 
the outset, for many of these countries, the 
most ufefu, thing you could do was to in-
crease theii total number of college gradu-
ates film 5-to 10." 
In lipe With the emphasis upon people 
ahead ef p ans and money, some of Ameri-
ca's allies are quietly pushing educational 
programs. For example, in addition to 1,000 
scholarship students from former French 
colonieS attending French 'universities, each 
year 3400 f tagiaires, or on-the-job trainees, 
are brohght to study and work in France, in 
sceres ,of occupations ranging from radio 
broadcastir g to lighthouse maintenance. 
An importrnt objective is to inculcate new 
methods. work habits, and attitudes, which 
the trainees, on returning home, can pass 
along as a way of leavening the apathy of 
their propl.t. 
One of these stagiaires is Gerard Jerome 
Nana, a 22-year-old Camerounian, whom I 
intervitwec at the Renault auto works near 
Paris. :With five other articulate young Af-
ricans, ;Gerard was putting ,in a 9-hour day 
of wor* and study at the plant, taking extra 
Saturday (sources, and often devoting his 
holidays to working as a mechanic in ga-
rages around Paris for extra cash. Daily 
contact with a mOdern industrial society 
had given ::lerard an apostle's zeal. 
"Take just the matter of getting to work 
on time," he told me. "In my country if the 
French boss says, 'Everybody be on time to-
morroW so we can get the job done,' the em-
ployece say, `See, our ex-colonial masters are 
still trVing to exploit us.' If they only Un-
derstoqd that one man's being late can cut 
the output of an entire factory, what a differ-
ence is could make." 
Sine tho United States began pushing for 
more ou ders to the wheel, 16 other coun-
tries nave instituted or strengthened aid 
progratns. As a rough guide, the United Na-
tions t(ugeests that every "have" country 
should, devote at least 1 percent of its gross 
nationhl product to economic development 
in the ,"hrr(e not" countries, in whatever mix 
of public r nd private investment it chooses. 
Some Of the latest percentages of government 
aid anion(' DAC members: Portugal, 1.89; 
France, 1f17; Belgium, 0.76; United States, 
0.72.' 
It is clear that equality of effort among 
the induszialized countries is still a far-
off goal. William S. Gaud, Deputy Adminis-
trator of the U.S. Agency for International 
Develcipment, said in teatimony before the 
House ,Foroign Affairs Committee: "The mere 
fact that other industrialized countries are 
contrihuti ag more aid each year does not 
answet the question of whether they are 
doing enough." 
In um the United States, having ex-
pende4i more than $100 billion on foreign 
aid si ce' World War II, 'would like to see 
even inor) participation by its allies. It 
would:like them to share the philosophy typi-
fied by A.bert Bougeant?e, participant in 
Volunteerr for Progress, the French peace 
corps?who is donating 2 years of his life to 
a prhiaithe village in steaming equatorial 
Africa; "::u this world," Bougeant says, "I 
believO thnt we are all a little bit responsible 
for on another." 
Burundi's Independence Day 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
Os, 
HON. ADAM C. POWELL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 1965 
Mr. POWELL. Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the third anniversary of the in-
dependence of the Kingdom of Burundi. 
We wish, therefote, to take this oppor-
tunity to extend warm felicitations to 
His Majesty Mwami Mwarnbutsa IV; 
and the Burundi Ambassador to the 
United States, Leon Ndenzako. 
The Kingdom of Burundi is a small 
country in central Africa which has re-
cently received attention from the 
American press. In view of the impor-
tance of contemporary events, we should 
give attention here to the history and 
political background of this recently 
independent state. 
Burundi was among the last African 
states to come under European influence. 
Its first visitor from Europe was John 
Banning Speke, who in 1858 traveled 
through Burundi in his search for the 
headwaters of the Nile. In 1871, Stan-
ley and Livingstone arrived there and 
explored the region near the present 
port-capital of Usumbura, on Lake 
Tanganyika. In E 1885, the German 
sphere of influence in Africa was ex-
tended to include the territory of 
Burundi. Although the Germans re-
mained there until 1916, the government 
remained in the hands of the traditional 
authorities. 
During the First World War, Burundi 
was occupied by Belgian troops; after 
the war, the territory was awarded to 
the latter as a mandate of the League of 
Nations. This status remained un-
changed until after World War II, when 
Burundi, with its neighbor to the north, 
Rwanda, was made part of a United Na-
tions trust territory under Belgian ad-
ministration. Throughout the period of 
Belgian control, the traditional authori-
ties also retained their positions. Dur-
ing the latter years, however, the Bel-
gians sponsored an extensive economic 
development program. 
By 1961, the people of Burundi had 
demonstrated their political maturity 
and responsibility by holding peaceful 
national elections. 
Plans for independence were com-
pleted; with neither a political revolution 
nor a social upheaval, Burundi became a 
self-governing Si,ate, ruled as of old by 
the King, or Mwami, and his advisers. 
The Government, however, was now pat-
terned on Western constitutional democ-
racies rather than on old tribal organi-
zations. On the 1st of July, 1962, the 
territory of Urundi became the independ-
ent kingdom of Burundi. 
Today Burundi, under the leadership 
of its King, Mwambutsa IV, finds itself 
in a difficult political and economic situ-
ation. Improvements in medicine and 
sanitation have created a serious threat 
of overpopulation in the small country; 
this situation has been made more serious 
by the considerable influx of refugees 
from neighboring countries.

PROMOTING "I'RE .TWO-PARTY _ 
SYSTEM 
(Mr. W,AI4c.F0 of Mississippi asked 
and was given permission to address the 
House far 1. minute and to revise and ex-
tend llis remarks.) , 
Mr. WALKER of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, it is most gratifYing to me to 
see the election of two RePnblican may-
ors and several aldermen and council-
men in Mississippi. I am grateful to 
every candidate who gave his time and 
his eriergiea to promote better local gov-
ernMent in our State through the two-
party system. These candidates have 
Made a great contribution for the bene-
fit of the people of Mississippi by offer-
ing them a distinct ChoiCeIn solving the 
problems of local governMent. 
As a latecomer to the Republican 
Party, I can speak from experience. It 
No.1,01 ; 6 
Is hard to make a complete change in 
your political party after a hundred years 
of family tradition. But, as time goes 
on, and as more and more Republican 
candidates are elected to office, we will 
certainly see a greater number of citi-
zens openly favoring the Republican 
Party and the principle of two-party 
government. 
The entire principle of the two-party 
system is that the party of the minority 
assumes the responsibility of keeping 
elected officials in check. This, to me, is 
the only way we can be assured of hav-
ing an honest and upright government. 
The results of yesterday's elections in 
Mississippi represent further proof that 
the two-party system in my State, as well 
as the entire South, is here to stay. I 
am most happy to extend my heartiest 
congratulations to these successful Re-
publican candidates, and to offer assist-
ance in any way that I can. 
Since 1963, the Republican Party and 
the two-party system have been making 
strong gains. The first Republican 
State representative since Reconstruc-
tion was elected in Meridian, Miss, in 
1963 and the Republican candidate for 
Governor polled nearly 40 percent of the 
vote. , 
. Since that time, our State has elected 
a Republican Congressman, several Re-
publican State legislators, and a Repub-
lican coroner in the State's largest city. 
Now, with the 1965 municipal elections 
the two party system made a historic 
strike at the grassroots level. Elected 
for mayor in Hattiesburg, Miss, was 
Paul E. Grady, a young conservative at-
torney, and in Columbus, Mr. R. D. Har-
mond, a former city councilman and 
Democrat turned Republican was elected 
as mayor. 
Other local officials who won election 
on the Republican ticket were: Mr. H. F. 
McCarty, Jr., of Magee, Mr. M. L. Brown 
and Mr. Pat Millis of D'Lo, Mr. Dorsey 
Hill and Mr. H. T. Miller, Jr., of Drew, 
and Mr. Lloyd Kilpatrick of Hollandale. 
We are particularly pleased with the 
Mayors vote in Hattiesburg and Colum-
bus, two of Mississippi's largest cities. It 
is predicted that these victories will have 
a tremendous impact on our State and 
Pave the way for further victory increases 
In county as well as statewide elections. 
We feel that this is a stepping stone 
toward electing conservative Republi-
cans in all future municipal elections. It 
has been claimed by many liberals over 
the Nation that the conservative Re-
publican mbvement in the South has 
made its gains strictly on the race issue. 
This is not at all the case. I am pleased 
to report that these campaigns in Mis-
sissippi were strictly decided on the issue 
of conservative Republicans versus Dem-
ocrats, and in no incident was the race 
issue used in the campaign. in: j.....t 
COMMUNIST CUBA 'IRIES TO

er, Communist Cuba has applied for 
membership in Intergovernmental Mar-
itime Consultative Organization. This 
group is a technical consulting section 
of the United Nations, and is composed 
of the major shipping nations of the 
world. 
U.N. Secretary General U Thant has 
asked the State Department to consider 
Cuba's application before the IMCO 
meeting to be held in London beginning 
June 15-18. The State Department is 
now considering Cuba's request, and will 
send representatives to London shortly. 
Communist Cuba has no business 
whatsoever in this organization. Cuba 
Is a dictatorship. Cuba has said it will 
abide by IMCO recommendations only 
when it suits her purposes. In short, 
Castro says he will not give IMCO much 
cooperation. 
? We know that Castro is not very co-
operative when it comes to shipping. 
Recall that on February 22, 1963, Cuban 
Migs fired rockets on an unarmed 
shrimp boat out of Fort Myers, Fla., 
when she was drifting in the interna-
tional waters of the Caribbean. Recall 
also that an American-awned Liberian 
ship was fired upon in the international 
waters of the Caribbean on October 22, 
1963, by Cuban craft. 
Castro's record is hardly one of coop-
eration. It is a record of harassment 
and outright aggression. 
I urge that the State Department 
vigorously protest the admission of 
Communist Cuba to the IMCO group. 
BILL TO AMEND TITLE II OF 
THE WATER RESOURCES RE-
SEARCH ACT 
(Mr. ASHLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. ASHLEY. Mr. Speaker, last year 
the Congress passed the Water Resources 
Research Act of 1964 to meet the need 
for widespread research on a variety of 
urgent problems connected with the sup-
ply, conservation, and use of water, ever 
increasing quantities of which are re-
quired by our exploding population to 
meet new industrial, domestic, and rec-
reational demands, as well as for the 
age-old production of food and fibers. 
The Water Resources Research Act of 
1964 established three grant programs. 
The first was to help finance the cost of 
water resources research centers at land-
grant colleges in each State. The sec-
ond program provided matching funds 
to assist States in carrying out specific 
water research projects approved by the 
Department of the Interior. The third 
program authorized grants or contracts 
by the Secretary of the Interior for re-
search problems connected with the De-
partment's responsibilities. 
While an impressive start has already 
been made under the 1964 act, there is 
considerable evidence that the water re-
search program should not be confined 
to institutes which are a part of the land-
grant educational institution system, ex-
cellent as these organizations are. For 
this reason, Mr. Speaker, I am joining

Mr. :KORNEGAY. Mr. Speaker, the 
Preside at has signed into law one of the 
first legislative accomplishments in the 
adminiiltration campaign to advance the 
interest s of the American consumer. 
I refr to the final Enactment of an 
amendment to the Textile Fiber Products 
Identification Act which will permit iden-
tification of fibers present in textile prod-
ucts in quantities of 5 percent or less. 
This amendment will serve to benefit 
not on y those people whose livelihoods 
depend on the strength and growth of the 
textile industry, but the national econ-
omy as a whole. 
Its primary beneficiary will be the 
American consumer and purchaser of 
modern textile products. As formerly 
framed, the Textile Fiber Products Iden-
tification Act prohibited mention of fibers 
when -hey were not present in textile 
producs in quantities of more than 5 per-
cent. Advancing textile technology 
made this section of the law an ana,chro-
nisrn which impeded the consumer's 
right to know regarding the quality a 
textile products purchased. 
lit was clear that this anachronism of 
the law was harmful to -.lie general econ-
omy and to the growth of our modern 
textile industry. Action to remedy this 
defect and to update the law was needed. 
This was recognized by interested admin-
istration spokesmen and agencies?in-
cluding the President's adviser on con-

\TCEIVIIMIT ADIMESS AT STATE 
UNIVERSITY COLLEGE AT CORT-
LAND 
(Ma. STRATTON asked and was given 
permimion to extend his remarks at this 
pdint and include a speech.) 
Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, last 
Sunday the distinguished new Under 
Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, Wilbur J. Cohen, delivered the com-
mencement address at our State Uni-
vessit f College at Cortland, N.Y., in my 
congressional district. It was a most im-
pressive occasion and a very splendid ad-
dress. 
Approved For Releas 
Cortland is one Of the outstanding, 
rapidly growing parts of New York's 
State University, with a magnificent 
campus and a fine, able faculty. It has 
had a great history, and under the lead-
ership of its new president, Dr. Kenneth 
E. Young, it will make even more 
brilliant strides in the future. Surely 
Cortland College is making this area of 
upstate New York a great educational 
center, as well as a great industrial, ag-
ricultural, and tourist center. 
In these circumstances, Secretary 
Cohen's address was most appropriate 
and most favorably received, as it out-
lined the increasingly important em-
phasis being placed on educational 
achievement by our Government. 
In order to bring Secretary Cohen's ad-
dress to the attention of my colleagues, 
I include it at this point as a portion of 
my remarks: 
EDUCATION IN THE GREAT SOCIETY 
(By Wilbur J. Cohen, Under Secretary of 
Health, Education, and Welfare) 
A long time ago, long before the class of 
1966 was even born. I had the good fortune 
to go to college. I was aware that it wits 
good fortune, because those were the days, 
in 1930, when most fortunes in this country 
had crashed P:'ecipitously with the stock 
market, and parents and young people like 
myself were shaken by the great wave of ap-
prehension that swept over the country. 
I new that I was lucky. I was the first 
in my inCinediate family to go to college. 
Many of my high school friends were finan-
cially unable to go. But I must say that I 
didn't have as much trouble getting into 
and out of college as most young people have 
today. There were no college boards, no 
SATS, no really formidable competition. A 
high school graduate just presented him-
self, finances permitting. If his high school 
record was less than impressive, some col-
leges were willing to offer a second chance. 
Often there were more spaces than qualified 
applicants anyway, and many colleges were 
frankly happy to have enough students to 
teach. 
My first 2 years were spent in an institu-
tion which no longer exists?the Experi-
mental College of the University of Wiscon-
sin. Some of the students of education 
have probably read about it. The college 
was the brainchild of Alexander Meikle-
john?the prearient of Amherst College and 
one of the great teachers of this Nation.' 
A philosopher and an ardent advocate of 
freedom, Dr. N:eiklejohn believed that edu-
cation itself aiould be free?literally free. 
It should be -freely sought and freely given. 
He had the idea that young people were so 
hungry and thirsty for knowledge that if 
you set out the feast they would come and 
devour it of their own free will. He believed 
that learning provided its own reward, and 
failure to learn was its own adequate punish-
ment. His ideal was the Greek ideal of ex-
cellence. 
The college was established to test this 
idea in a 2-year undergraduate curriculum. 
I happened to be there at that time, and for 
that I also count myself fortunate. 
Prom my point of view, the experiment 
succeeded. Within 5 years, Dr. Meiklejohn 
proved his contention that students did, in 
fact, learn as well in a free environment as 
in the traditional atmosphere of discipline 
and authority. 
He encountered enormous administrative 
difficulties. 
But the greatest difficulties were not ad-
ministrative. They stemmed from the fact 
that this approach to learning?familiar as 
it was (since it was based on the ancient 
Socratic tradition), and effective as it was 
proved?was nevertheless completely alien

Castro's Subversion in the United

IN THE HOUSE co? REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 1965 
- Mr: HOSIER. Speaker, part II 
of the two part series of the American 
Security Council's Washington Report 
dealing with the subject of Castro's sub-
Version in the United States written by 
DeWitt S. Copp is reproduced below. 
Part I will be found on an earlier page in 
:this Appendix. 
The article follows: 
[From. the American Security Council's 
Washington Report, May 24, 1965] 
ViisraO's SITBVERSION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Ata recent State Department briefing on 
Toatin American affairs, the briefing officer 
concluded his remarks with the observation 
that' the Communists had a chance to make 
a show case out of Cuba but they have failed 
Miserably. This cOnclusion was first Offered 
by President' Kennedy 3 years ago and it re-
mains today as the accepted State Depart-
tent attitude toward Castro and Cuba. 
Such an attitude fails to take into account 
that communism has never been a social or 
economic success anywhere; but as a show 
case from which to spread subversion, it has 
done admirably?and Cuba is an excellent 
example. 
Our Washington report of last week illus-
trated the point by outlining the activities 
of the Cuban General Directorate of Intelli-
fence. However, Castro's greatest success 
against the United States has been fn the` 
area of agitation and propaganda. Almost 
all his fieldworkers here are 17.. citizens. 
They are citizens who follow the 'Moscow, 
Peiping, or Trotskyite line. They range all 
the way from hardline Cominunists to soft-
line dupes. A 2-year investigation by the 
Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security 
into the aotivities and membership of the 
how defunct Pair Play for Cuba Committee, 
organized in April 1960, proved that PPCC 
had been heavily infiltrated by known Com-
munists and fellow travelers. 
Despite state Department's issuance of 
travel restrictions to Cuba on January 16, 
1961, many FPCC members traveled illegally 
to Havana and, upon their return to this 
country, gave lecturers extolling the Castro 
regime. 
One of these was James Jackson, a member 
Of the National Committee of the Commu-
nist Party, U.S.A. Jean Pestana, Rose Ros-
enberg, and Helen Travis?all identified as 
communists in sworn, testimony before the 
I-louse Committee on Un-American Activi-
ties?were indicative pf the Cuban guest list 
Which, riumlaered b vce,ss of /50 U.S. citi-
zens Ova". tf2.-year period. 
The FPCd was, by any fair definition, a 
Commu.nist front. Ito effect on the Ameri-
can public was negligible. But through its 
activities and tile close contacts some of its 
, members fornied with the Castro regime, 
there grew up around it other more militant 
groups. The most important of these was 
the Progressive Labor Movement. 
PLM was organized in January 1962. Its 
president, Milton 'loosen, and vice president, 
Mortimer Scheer, had both been expelled 
from the Communist Party for disruptive 
activities. In December 1962, PLM at-
tempted to send a group of "students" to 
Cuba and failed because the Canadian Gov-
ernment refused. clearance to a Cuban plane 
to pick them up. A year and a half later, 
PLM succeeded. 
On June 25, 1963, 59 so-called students, 
ranging in age from la to 36, left for Cuba in 
defiance of the State Department ban on 
such travel, They traveled to Cuba via Paris, 
Prague, and Havana. All expenses, includ-
ing traniportation and living expenses while 
' in Cuba, were paid for by the Cuban Gov-
ettunent. Each traveler donated to PLM's 
Permanent ` Student Committee for Travel 
to Cuba $110. The air fare alone cost the 
Castro reigme $30,000. 
While in Cuba, a number of the "students" 
made statements attacking U.S. policies, par-
ticularly in the field of civil rights and aid 
to South Vietnam. Some of these state-
ments were beamed around the world and 
reprinted in Communist publications. 
In June 1964, the Student Committee for 
Travel to Cuba arranged air transportation 
to Cuba for 84 "students." Overall direc-
tion appears to have been supplied by Lee 
Coe, west coast editor of PLM publications. 
Prior to his association with PLM, Coe was 
active for over 20 years with the Communist 
Party, U.S.A. This time not only did the 
Castro government pay for the entire trip, 
but it also gave each visitor $10 a week 
spending money. 
The leader of the "student" contingent was 
Edward Lemansky, who has identified him-
self "as a member of the Progressive Labor 
Movement, which is a Communist organiza-
tion, a Communist movement." 
An indication of why Castro has been will-
ing to pay out in excess of $75,000 to bring 
certain U.S. citizens to Cuba may be seen in 
the declaration signed by 61 of the "stu-
dents" while they were in Cuba. The decla-
ration said in part: "We, the undersigned 
young North Americans visiting Cuba, offer 
these statements of support for the people 
of South Vietnam in their just fight for lib-
eration from the imperalist oppression di-
rected by our Government. Today our Gov-
ernment is unleashing one of the most brutal 
and criminal wars in history. All over the 
world?in Spain and Portugal, in South Af-
rica and Latin America?the United States 
supports racist and reactionary regimes which 
oppress the people, and that the intransi-
gence of U.S. imperialism forces the people 
to take up arms in order to gain and defend 
their liberty." The essence of this declara-
tion was widely broadcast throughout the 
world. 
On April 15, 1965, Milton Rosen, PLM pres-
ident, announced the founding convention of 
a new Communist Party paralleling the 
Chinese Communist line; 110 delegates at-
tended the New York meeting. A declaration 
proposed by the PLM national steering com-
mittee said in part: "The most hated govern-
ment in the world today is the Government 
of our country * * * the initials U.S.A., which 
once stood for hope, have replaced the 
crooked cross of Nazi Germany as the symbol 
of tyranny and death." 
One of PLM's vice presidents and its Har-
lem leader is William Epton, arrested last 
August after the Harlem race riots on charges 
of advocating criminal anarchy. 
PI= .4413. three DM= 1,12 New York City 
and boast?of six others scattered across the 
country, one in Berkeley, Calif. PLM pub-
lishes leaflets, booklets, and a quarterly mag-
azine, and it expects to bring out a weekly 
soon, Its plain political thrust is aimed at 
disrupting civil rights progress and stirring 
racial hatred. Its members were active in the 
recent Berkeley campus revolt and they can 
be expected to be active in similar undertak-
ings on other campuses. 
Victor Riese' in a recent column quoted a 
top Government security official as saying: 
"They (PLM) are a very successful and mili-
tant band of young revolutionaries and have 
had ample money since the first day they 
went into business * * *. They don't just 
pass resolutions. They're zealously working 
for a revolution." The question is how much 
of their financial support is coming from 
Cuba? 
The pro-Castro pro-Peiping Communist 
movement in the United States has its man 
in Havana. He is Robert F. Williams. In 
May 1959, Williams was removed from his 
position as head of the Union County, N.C., 
branch of the NAACP for advocating violence 
as a means to gain social justice for his race. 
In August 19,61, he fled the country following 
a racial clash which he instigated in Monroe, 
N.C., and on October 3, 1961, the Castro gov-
ernment granted him political asylum. Since 
then, he has been spouting racial hatred 
while offering instructions in terror tactics 
on his program "Radio Free Dixie" broadcast 
over Radio Havana and beamed into the 
Southern States. Williams also writes a 
monthly pamphlet called the Crusader. 
Every edition is devoted to the hatred of and 
the eventual revolutionary overflow of the 
white man. Publication and distribution 
costs apparently are taken care of by the 
Cuban regime. 
Lest anyone dismiss Williams as just an-
other fanatical rabble rouser, it should be 
noted that when he traveled to Red China in 
August 1963, he was not only greeted by Mao 
Tse-tung and other high-ranking ChiCom 
officials, but Mao also chose that time to 
make his first official policy pronouncement 
in 6 years. As a result of his statement, Mos-
cow charged that Peiping was guilty of racism 
and was "trying to set the colored races 
against the whites." 
In the winter of 1963, followers of Williams 
organized the Revolutionary Action Move-
ment (RAM). Today, they have branches in 
six key cities It is they who distribute the 
Crusader and maintain direct contact with 
Williams. Some of them made the trip to 
Cuba in the summer of 1964. 
When they returned, recruitment was 
stepped up. They are known to have infil-
trated the Black Muslims and the Malcolm X 
group. RAM's fronts include the Afro-
American Youth Council, the Afro-American 
Student Organization, and in Detroit they 
set up UHURU, which means freedom in 
Swahili. 
RAM's manifesto advocates organized vio-
lence and the -formation of guerrilla bands. 
Alined with PLM, it follows the theories 
and tactics of the Chinese Communists. Its 
present membership is small and selective 
and it refers to itself "as a movement com-
posed of hardcore, young, intelligent, mili-
tant Afro-Americans seeking worldwide black 
revolution." 
Until recently, the Communists chains of 
command could be traced directly from the 
Kremlin to the party here. Today, whether 
It be the recently formed W. E. B. DuBois 
Clubs taking their cue from Moscow, or the 
Progressive Labor movement taking its from 
Peiping, the impetus and driving force for 
both is channeled out of Cuba. Politically, 
financially, psychologically, militarily?Ha-
vana is the directing center for a major 
share of the Communist agitation and prop-
aganda in the United States. It is the se-
cured outpost of .h_oth Moscow and Peiping 
in our hemisphere. 
In. the aggregate, we can say the threat to 
our own security from Castro himself is non-
existent. However, he is the agent of a world 
force that does threaten our survival. As 
Its agent, his followers have been at work 
here; they are at work now. Because our 
security agencies are competent to handle

Wednesday, May 12, 1965 
r. MURPHY of New York. Mr. 
Sp ak( r, under leave to extend my re-
marks in the RECORD, I include the f 01-
1oWing 
3peaker, on Monday, May 17, 1965, 
Piesid nit Chung Hee Park of the Repub-
lic of fiouth Korea visited with President 
Johnson. The high esteem in which 
President Park is held not only in this 
count] y, but throughout the free world, 
is graphically illustrated by the New 
York Herald Tribune editorial of May 
19; 1935. Under the leave to extend my 
reinarks in the RECORD, I include the 
editorial: 
A KOREAN REPRESENTATIVE 
President Park, now visiting the United 
States, represents many things. He is, above 
alt, the symbol of a state, South Korea, 
which proved that a massive Communist on-
sittught can be thrown back. The symbol 
staid both as a warning to Red China and 
as a source of encouragement to South Viet-
rilarn, the United States, and their allies. 
And President Park is evidence that, once 
independence is secured, a war-torn Asian 
country is capable of impressive political 
aci economic progress. Though his critics 
are numerous, most must agree that the 
Powe he holds today is derived from free 
(Sections. And though the economic prob-
lems are still great, the support of the 
United States, now being reinforced by Ja-
pan, has opened an encouraging future. 
The cost of answering the Communist at-
tack on South Korea, 15 years ago June 25. 
was great. The fruits of that victory were 
grea ? too. 
Physical accomplishment is often the 
Measure of a man's leadership as well 
as tie country's progress. The following 
arti lie from the New York Times of May 
19, 1965, indicates what hard work and 
hound leadership can do for a people 
who want to live in a free society: 
YEA' t. OF HARD WORK?YOUNG COUNTRY WITH 
0 D HISTORY MARES PROGRESS; KOREA-
UNITED STATES RELATIONS 
On January 16, 1965, President Chung Hee 
Part stated in his new year message to the 
National Assembly that "the accumulated 
, dirt of the past 20 years, which have been 
ape at in confusion and stagnation, should be 
? overcome and scoured, and it is time that we 
, yolk real hard." This year, the fourth year 
of the first 5-year economic development 
, plan; he designated "the year of hard work." 
The political, economic, and social circum-
stances of Korea had been very insecure in 
th( past, as attested to by the two revolu-
tio as of April 19, 1960, and May 16, 1961. 
But with the establishment of the Third 
Re?ublic, stability has been recovered and 
th:ngs are now beginning to move ahead. 
'? The greatest problem encountered in the 
5-;'ear economic development plan was the 
question of capital shortage. But with co-
operation of friendly nations, sufficient for-
eign capital loans have been acquired and 
investment goods have begun to flow in. 
Furthermore, sufficient energy resources 
inch as electricity, coal, and petroleum have 
bE en secured to support industrial develop-
May 25, 1965 
ment. Thus the base for fruitful work has 
been laid. 
For this year of hard work the Republic of 
Korea has established increased production, 
more experts, and greater construction, as 
her goal. 
To support this, many important projects 
are being carried out. The following is a 
summary of these plans: 
? PRODUCTION 
Snair-iieicent 'of the population depends 
on agriculture for living. In order not to 
perpetuate the "intolerable contradiction" 
that food shortages persist despite such cir-
cumstances, the farmland, with an area of 
5,020,000 acres, or about 20.6 percent of the 
area of the country, will be further, ex-
panded. Through farm improvement and 
technical extension programs, self-sufficiency 
in food grain will be achieved. 
To this end, the Government has estab-
lished a 7-year grain production plan, and 
has allocated 3 billion won ($11,700,000) 
to help finance it. Through technical:guid-
ance, the utilization of farmland will be im-
proved, and through improved irrigation and 
other aids the unit yield will be raised. Also 
more upland will be bench-terraced, and 
tidal land will be further reclaimed, thus 
expanding land under cultivation and in-
creasing grain supply. 
In addition, the plan provides for adequate 
domestic production of fertilizer, agricul-
tural pesticides, farm tools, and fishing 
equipment to help increase agricultural and 
fisheries production. In mining and manu-
facturing, coal; output will be 10 million tons, 
about double the 1960 level, electricity will 
quadruple to 770,000 kilowatts, and cement 
will increase fourfold to 2,120,000 metric tons. 
Sheet glass production is scheduled to triple 
to 600,000 boxes, and other major products 
will also be expanded. Also articles of daily 
necessity, including bicycles and sewing ma-
chines, will expand four to six times over 
1960 level. 
EXPORT 
Korea depends highly on imports for con-
sumables, equipment and machinery, and 
industrial raw materials. Compared to the 
great import requirements, exports amounted 
to a neglightle $20 to $30 million a year, the 
principal export having been tungsten and 
a few ether commodities. 
Fortunately, owing to a concerted national 
effort Korea was able to expand exports 
greatly in 1961?to about four times the $32 
million attained in 1960, thus achieving a 
record $120 million. 
This year the target has been raised to $170 
million, and efforts will be made to export 
more and more manufactured articles. Thus 
by 1967 at least $300 million in foreign ex-
change will be earned through exports, and 
the aims at exporting $1 billion worth a year 
within 10 years. 
CONSTRUCTION 
For promoting production and exports, var-
ious new factories to support industrial ac-
tivities will be built. The nation's resources 
will be systematically developed by carrying 
on coordinated programs for construction of 
powerplants, transport and communications 
facilities, housing, and so forth. 
Two powerplants now under construc-
tion will be completed this year and power 
supply will increase to 111,000 kilowatt-
hours. In addition, three new powerplants 
will be built. Also cement production will 
be raised, and the fifth cement factory of the 
country will be completed by the end of the 
year. 
Korea's shird and fourth fertilizer plants 
will be built with the aim of achieving self-
sufficiency in fertilizer. 
Railway transportation, ports and harbors, 
shipping a.nd other transport facilities will 
be expanded and the communications net-
work enla::ged. Thus construction projects 
will progress actively in many directions.

and accelerated if found necessary. 
There is a emal minority in Congress and

an exercise l futility. It might help them 
to remember that we are in a negotiated situ-

settlement a Foal tion government similar to 
the Laos-Troika. This crumbling monument 
to our naiveness is not calculated to serve 
well the inteaest of freedom. The enemy un-

President's declaim to use such power. --

He was justified n doing so. Our failure to 
wipe the scum of communism from our door-

tion. President Johnson, subscribing to the 
theory that Awo .Nrongs never make a right, 
acted with dispatch and restored honor to 
our country in this instance. Let us not

tion should lte futight on an empty stomach 
or a full one. Both agree the revolution must 
continue. The d.vision is not on what com-
munism is. It's how communism can de-
stroy representasive democracy. It is an 
argument of .ne.t: rods, not objectives. World 
domination s the goal of both, Marx is a 
prophet of both. We must understand the 
nature of the prctractive struggle. We must 
have no illusions about the meaning of the 
ideological cOnfliat. 
Our best araatee for peace is to keep our 
country eco omically sound, morally and 
spiritually ri ht, and militarily impregnable. 
Individuals must know when to push the 
button and why. 
Therp is a great stress on education today. 
This is as it should be. The serviceman is 
well ahead on this score. He remains behind 
in dna cial compensation. The Continental 
Army ommand operates 26 schools. It is 
based ight here at Port Monroe. It offers 
a selec ion of 600 courses. Three hundred 
and fif y military occupation specialists are 
aVailala e. One hundred and sixty thousand 
individ ala take advantage of this oppor-
tunity km site. Another 200,300 are enrolled 
in corr spondence courses. 
The ducatIonal attainments of the man 
in unif rm are steadily rising Seventy-three 
percen of the enlisted personnel are high 
school graduates. It was ,:ti percent just 
10 year ago. Only 25 percent of the Ameri-
can m le population over 21, hat graduated 
from igh school. Eight percent of the 
Anaeric n men over 25 are college graduates. 
Sixty-iline percent of the officer corps today 
have college diplomas, 10 ysars ago it was 
only 60 percent. This makes him a better 
soldier It entitles him to more pay. 
The Pr?dent appointed a committee to 
e matter of military pay. The corn-
has reported and recommended an 
adjustment of 4.'7 percent. This is 
Mad squate. 
essman MENDEL RTJERS, ct South 
a, has introduced a military pay bill, 
25, to bring about this objective. I 
u will persuade your Congressman to 
this bill. . 
FOREIGN AFFAILS 
May we direct our attention to the subject 
of for ign affairs. There are some among 
us wh say that the foreign policy of this 
coun should be of no concern to any ex-
cept t e' ones directly responsible for its im-
pleme tation. With this I Co not agree. It 
occurs to roe that the foreign policy of this 
countr should be of vital concern to every 
one w o is interested in the preservation of 
our A erica n way, based upon a fundamental 
belief n God and propelled by our profit-
motiv tel system. 
The purpose of our foreign policy should 
be to, protect and advance 'U.S. interests 
in world affairs. The purpose of our na-
tionallsecurity program shculd be to pro-
vide tie muscle to make that policy effective. 
The winds of slavery blowing out of the 
Sino-Spviet countries are on a collision course 
with tie winds of freedom from the West. 
The f ture of mankind may very well be 
determined by which wind prevails. 
Although men dream of a more fruitful 
use of , life than to spend their creative en-
ergies building the instruments of destruc-
t to 
tion, t ere appears be no safe alternative. 
Here a e some reasons why. On October 15, 
1964, ikita Khrushchev, the recognized 
leader , of the worldwide Communist con-
spiracy` and overlord of the most expansive 
colonial empire in contemporary world his-
tory, was impeached by his own cabinet. 
Why? Because he failed to practice 100-
percen't communism. He was replaced by 
the te4.m cr.! Breznev and Kosygm. In their 
first olicy pronouncements they declared 
a cont nuation of the 20-year cold war upon 
the 'U ited States and her allies. They called 
for an extension of their philosophy of peace-
ful an4 competitive coexistence. Stalin, too,

Capt. Paul Crawley, U.S. Army, Norwich, 
N.Y., Soldier, Displays Gallantry Under 
Fire in Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. SAMUEL S. STRATTON 
or NEW YORK 
N THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 1965 
Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, with 
all the detailed discussion that has gone 
on In recent weeks regarding the fighting 
In Vietnam -I sometimes think we are apt 
to forget that it is individual American 
combat men who are carrying out, with-
out complaint and with very great dis-
tinction, the heavy burden of our com-
mitment there. 
One of the most fascinating and im-
pressive stories of personal valor in Viet-
nam came to my attention the other day 
with regard to the actions of a con-
stituent of mine Army Capt. Paul Craw-
ley, of Norwich, N.Y. The account ap-
peared in the Norwich Evening Sun for 
May 11, 1965, and under unanimous con-
sent, I include it at this point in the 
RECORD. 
The article follows: 
NEWSMAN DESCRIBES NORWICH MAN'S 
GALLANTRY 
A gallant Norwich soldier, Capt. Paul 
Crawley, was featured in a full-color picture 
and story on the front page of the St. Peters-
burg, Fla., Times, May 2, 
The story, written by a Times staffman 
who had just returned from special assign-
ment in Vietnam, told of Captain Crawley's 
gallantry under fire in a combat situation 
as deadly as any which took place in World 
War II or Korea. Here is the story as told 
by George Sweers, of the St. Petersburg 
Times. 
The incident took place on a 5%-hour 
patrol whose purpose was to capture small 
Red hamlets during which Captain Crawley 
acted as an adviser to the actual leader of 
the patrol, Captain Hong of the Vietnamese 
Army. Crawley said "My job is to work with 
and advise my counterpart Captain Hong 
* * * everything goes through him. 
"Hong does not speak English and Crawley, 
who has been in Vietnam only 3 weeks, 
knows little Vietnamese. This makes the 
advising process a complicated one. Craw-
ley has two interpreters to maintain liaison 
with Hong." 
"The patrol started. I (Sweers) went 
with Crawley and Hong who were taking 50 
of the 200 Vietnamese straight toward the 
hamlets." 
"As we started out, I stayed close to Cap-
tain Crawley." When we were halfway up the 
hill, the first Vietcong opened light sniper 
fire at the leadmen in our group which had 
reached the top of the hill. The leadmen 
returned the fire * * * downhill into the 
hamlet and the rest of us hurried up to the 
peak and crouched behind the -concrete 
gravestones that dot Vietnamese hills. 
The firing stopped anti started again but 
this time "it was the steady chatter of a ma-
chitaegun fire raking the cleared area around 
the village." 
"Crawley told his radic-man to inform the 
U.S. helicopter hovering over us that we were 
pinned down. The copter radioed back to 
ask if Crawley wanted rocket machinegun-
suppression fire into the hamlet to get the 
machinegun.

"For this day anyway, our little part of the 
war ,was over. We walked back home." 
Hong told the interpreter he realized the sit-
uation. The interpreter passed the informa-
tion 012.10 Crawley. 
"Crawley told the interpreter he was ad-
vising Hong to ask for some suppression fire 
from the helicopter. The interpreter told 
Hong. Hong answered back through the in-
terpreter that toO many of his men were too 
close tQ the hamlet wall. The helicopter's 
rockets might kill some of the South Viet-
namese troops. 
"They, talked hack and forth, through the 
interpreter and pored over their maps while 
the bullets cracked 'overhead. It was a classic 
example of the language problem that has 
hampered these Milt U.S.-South Vietnamese 
operations since they began. 
Finally Hong convinced Crawley the heli-
copter fire would be too dangerous and the 
armed Chopper was waved off. 
"The,Vietnarneee were pouring the fire in-
to the hamlet now, the bullets chipping the 
bamboo Wall around the hamlet. 
"The fire let sip, a little. The Vietcong 
apparently were slipping out the back door 
and the first Vietnamese were entering the 
hamlet to mop up. 
"The radios started to chatter again. The 
Vietnamese radioman reported to his captain 
that one of their men had been hit. The 
captain told his interpreter who told Craw-
ley. 
"Crawley looked around. The wounded 
man Was a sergeant in a platoon to our right. 
Crawley told his radioman to call for an Air 
Evac--in ambulance helicopter to pick up 
the wounded man. 
"The wounded man was too close to the 
hamlet wall, however, and would have to be 
brought out to an open field where the 
'copter could land. 
"Crawley looked at his interpreter and 
then decided not to go through another 
complicated two-language conversation with 
Hong and the interpreters. 
"'Let's go get him,' he yelled to his medi-
cal aid man and we were off and running. 
We found the wounded man on a grassy 
slope. His leg had been crudely bandaged. 
"Crawley still had to get the Vietnamese 
soldier to where the 'copter could land. 
Without saying a word he picked him up and 
,started to carrying him toward the clearing. 
Spahn and I followed along as the American 
captain carried the Vietnamese sergeant 
through a paddy canal with water up to his 
waist. We reached a safe area several hun-
dred yards from the hamlet and waited. 
"We could look back at the hamlet where 
the Vietnamese were spraying the thatched 
huts with submachinegun fire and looking 
inside for Vietcong. At one point a Vietcong 
guerrilla bolted from the hamlet and ran for 
the trees at the edge of the clearing. A hail 
of fire reached out for him but he made it 
to the trees, and disappeared into the jungle. 
"Wow we could hear the whirring of the 
ambulance 'copter in the Sky and Spahn 
Ignited' a green smoke grenade to indicate 
the wind direction to the pilot. He landed. 
We put the wounded soldier aboard and 
'copter lifted off and headed for the hospital. 
"The:13attle was over. 
"The Vietcong snipers had fled leaving be-
hind senile supplies and ammunition. The 
hamlet was secure-Let least for now. 13ut 
after the troops left, couldn't the Vietcong 
come right back, patch up the fort and start 
snipinl at the railroad repair crews again'? 
I as ed the eaRtain.

some Ways, yes. We got some, of their sup-

Castro's Subversion in the United 
States?Part I 
XTENSION OF REMARKS 
O', 
HON. CRAIG HOSMER 
. OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
. . 
Tuesday, May 25, 1965 
Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, the 
American Security Council is one of the 
Nation's most respected private organiza-
tions dedicated to the preservation of the 
Nation and of freedom everywhere. Its 
weekly Washington Report invariably 
deals authoritatively with national and 
International developments affecting the 
Nation's security. The May 17 and 
24 issues of this report detailed the pat-
tern of Castro's subversion in the United 
States as written by DeWitt S. Copp, its 
able and authoritative managing editor. 
Part I of the two-part series is as follows: 
WASHINGTON REPORT: CASTRO'S SUBVERSION 
IN THE UNITED STATES 
WASHINGTON, May 17, 1965.?British his-
torian and philosopher, Arnold Toynbee, be-
fore giving a lecture at the State Department 
on April 16, 1965, was quoted as saying: "It's 
hard to understand why you make such a 
fuss about Castro," And then comparing 
the United States and Cuba to an elephant 
and its fear of a mouse, he quipped, "It's 
great fun for the mouse." 
Just a week prior to these comments, a 
CIA report on Cuban subversion was sub-
mitted to the House Subcommittee on In-
ter-American Affairs (Selden committee). 
The report stated in part that "the Castro 
regime has in operation (since 1961) a high-
ly professional espionage and subversion 
agency, the General Directorate of Intelli-
gence (DOI) . The DOI is advised by at 
least five Soviet intelligence specialists. 
Moreover, one of the purposes of the highly 
secret meetings of Latin American leaders 
in Havana last November was to give added 
impetus to more militant Communist activ-
ity in the hemisphere." 
Castro's DOI is divided into three units, 
the largest of which masterminds the train-
ing, financing, and promoting of subversion, 
and guerrilla Warfare In Ceneral and South 
American countries. Though the 'CIA re-
port spelled Out M detail the degree of the 
actiVities in these areas, it made no 
mention of its efforts in the United States. 
Our own investigation attempts in some 
measure to fill the gap. 
METHODS OF INFILTRATION 
There are two known major points of entry 
by which covert Castro agents infiltrate the 
United States. One is by fishing boat to 
Puerto Rico, and then by illegally entering 
the United States with falsified documents. 
Congressman WILLIAM CRAMER, Republican, 
of Florida, in testifying before the Senate 
Subcommittee on Internal Security as far 
back as 2 years ago said that "* * * in excess 
of 1,000 people have come through this route 
into the United States as Puerto Rican citi-
zens with falsified passports." 
The other method of infiltration is by boat 
or plane to Mexico. There the Mexican 
Communist Party supplies the proper papers 
and the agent crosses the border at Laredo, 
Juarez, or Tijuana. Infiltrators from Cuba 
who enter the United States using either one 
of these routes, or via Canada, masking their 
identities by whatever manner, are trained 
agents whose assignrnents cover the Marxian 
spectrum of subversive activities. 
INDICATION OF ACTIVITIES 
On the night of November 16, 1962, the 
FBI raided a workshop on West 27th Street 
in New York City. There they seized a se-
cret cache of weapons and explosives which 
included delayed action incendiary bombs. 
They also arrested three Castro agents and 
Roberto Santiesteban Casanova, a newly ar-
rived attach?ith the Cuban mission at the 
U.N. The other members of the Cuban mis-
sion, Jose Gomez Abaci and his wife, Elsa, 
were named as fellow conspirators. 
The purpose of the weapons and the ex-
plosives was for the sabotaging of defense 
installations and the demoralization of the 
civilian population. Attorney General Rob-
ert Kennedy said the plan was aimed at the 
heart of the internal security of the United 
States of America. 
Four days later, immigration officers in 
Brownsville, Tex., reported that Mexican au-
thorities had prevented the blowing up of 
the International Bridge between Browns-
ville and Matamoros, Mexico. In doing so, 
they also nipped in the bud a sabotage plan 
to destroy major buildings in Matamoros. 
Two of those apprehended were Castro 
agents. 
Since 1962, there have been several allied 
cases, one taking place in October 1964, in 
which a bomb was exploded in the Ever-
glades Hotel in Miami, injuring a number of 
Cuban exiles attending a meeting. 
Some months later, a Cuban terrorist 
threat to bomb the Roney Plaza Hotel in 
Miami intimidated the management into 
canceling a meeting of this same exile 
organization. 
This threat came on the same day the 
bomb plot to blow up the Washington Mon-
ument, the Statue of Liberty, and the Lib-
erty Bell was discovered. 
On the surface, this latter episode 
appeared to be the wild act of a quartet of 
misguided idiots. But there is sound rea-
son to believe that, wild as the attempt was, 
the four would-be saboteurs were acting 
under DGI instructions. Leader of the 
bomb plot, Robert S. Collier, had traveled 
illegally to Cuba in the summer of 1964. 
Upon his return, he formed, with a number 
of fellow Cuban travelers, a pro-Castro, pro-
Peiping group which called itself the Black 
Liberation Front. In December 1964 a 
United Nations party was given by the 
Cuban delegation in honor of its visiting 
guerrilla expert, Ernesto Che Guevara. At 
this party, Collier was introduced to Mi-
chelle Duclos, a member of an extremist 
separatist organization in Quebec. Later, 
the plotters bought the dynamite in Can-
ada, and it was Miss Duclos who transported 
the explosives to New York in her car. 
These five incidents fall under the heading 
of terror tactics. That only one of them

met with any real degree of success speaks 
well for the FBI and our law-enforcement 
agencies. However, FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover, pointed out in testimony before the 
House Subcommittee on, Appropriations last 
year year that the efforts of the Castro 
regime to infiltrate intelligence agents into 
the United gtatea "show that we (FBI) must 
maintain abroad coverage in this area of our 
operations." . 
How broad a coverage can be glimpsed by 
these additional incidents. In early 1963, 
a Castro agent was apprehended in a New 
York City apartment possessing a suitcase 
filled with visa applications and other docu-
ments which would aid fellow agents to gain 
illegal entry into the United States. 
From Caracas, Venezuela, in February of 
this year came news of another type of smug-
gling operation, which again pointed toward 
the activities of U,S.-based Castro agents. 
By accident, on board the U.S. ship Santa 
Rosa were found 1,000 mail pouches filled 
with pro-Castro literature. The literature 
had been printed in and shipped from Miami, 
Fla. , 
Just as Puerto Rico has served as an im-
portant way station in Castro agents to 
enter the United States, it has also served as 
a transit point for still another sort of smug-
gling?that of narcotic drugs. 
In December 1964, three Castro agents were 
arrested OA Miami Airport?one of them a 
Cuban, Mari,?argibe_o Nerey. Treasury of-
ficials, in Puerto Rico said Carabeo Nerey was 
engge1 In drug traffic. How large the traffic 
Is an be ingasured by the fact that between 
January and November 1964, narcotics agents 
seized 691 pounds of drugs being smuggled 
into the U.S, froro. Cuba. This was an in-
grease of over, 450 pounds seized during the 
previous year. Included in this amount was 
heroin, shipped to Cuba from Red China. 
In January 1965,a New York police inspec-
tor, Ira Bluth, was quoted as saying: "Mari-
huana Wed to came to New York almost en-
tirely from Mexico, but recently large 
=Mints of 't,A.e, drug have been discovered 
corning from Cuba." 
On January 15, 1965, Oscar H. Reguera 
and Endoro AUrtin6z were taken into custody 
in a, New York motel with $3 million worth 
of cocaine in their luggage. Martinez is be-
lieved to be a Castro agent. 
. Aside frorh. the obvious harmful effects 
addiction to th,ese drugs creates, the major 
purpose behind the smuggling of narcotics 
-into the United, States by Castro agents is 
to raise rnon,ey to finance an insurrection in 
Puerto Rico. , 
Castro's ,DOI is Working in concert with 
Puerto Rican, CoMmUnists and militant 
splinter factions of the Puerto Rican inde-
pendence movement, accelerating their at-
tacks against the social and governmental 
structure of the island. Since 1961, a num-
ber, of Castro-supplied arms caches have been 
uncovered. Gun battles have been fought 
between the police and insurrectionists. 
Clunro agents have infiltrated both exile and 
Student groups, their purpose being to stim-
ulate the kind , of rioting which would re-
quire armed intervention. Should this hap-
pen, the cry for independence, which 97 per-
Cent of the Puerto Rican electorate rejected 
In thg November 1964 elections, would take 
on a more critical meaning. This is so be-
cause the strategy of the movement is tied 
directly to the November 20, 1964, vote of the 
United Nations Committee on Anticolonial-
isna. The. Committee voted 17 to 6, in direct 
violation, of a 1953 General Assembly ruling, 
to,place the denland for Puerto Rican inde-
pendenee on the U.N. agenda. 
This ant ,played directly into the hands of 
Caktro'S 1?gl.ausi Puerto Rican extremists?
ftWn of whom, are presently members of the 
. Cuban 1./N, mission. 
When the general Assembly convenes 
again, there is little doubt that agitation and 
propaganda will be stepped up in New York 
and San Juan, with the possibility of more 
violent actions erupting in Puerto Rico. 
SCOPE OF THE EFFORT 
Recently, the Puerto Rican newspaper "El 
Mundo" estimated that since 1960, 12,000 
Americans and Puerto Ricans have received 
subversive training in Cuba. 
We cannot attest to the accuracy of the 
figures nor can we say how many of that 
number are under the orders of the Cuban 
Directorate of Intelligence. Although we 
do not have Castro-trained guerrillas oper-
ating in our country as a number of the 
Latin American countries presently do, we 
can say that intelligence and law enforce-
ment agencies here and in Puerto Rico take 
the efforts of the DGI most seriously. 
Of course, the publicly known cases out-
lined in this report can only give an indica-
tion of what is afoot. Hoary historians such 
as Toynbee may look down upon the world 
and view it from the vantage point of cen-
turies. Unfortunately, we who have to live 
in the world from day to day and face its 
reality cannot afford cute analogies of mice 
and elephants with regard to Castro and our-
selves. 
In part II of "Castro's Subversion in the 
United States" we will show how Castro's 
American supporters, using the techniques 
of agitation and propaganda; by forming 
front groups; by infiltrating the civil rights 
movement, and by attacking our foreign pol-
icy are winning important victories in what 
can best be termed the psychological hot 
war.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 1965 
Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I submit the following editorial 
by Mrs. Guy Easterly, publisher of the 
La Follette Press. This timely and re-
vealing editorial appeared in the May 20, 
1965, edition of this widely read and re-
spected Tennessee newspaper. 
I concur wholeheartedly with the views 
presented and commend its contents to 
My colleagues. 
CHAMPION HAREBRAINED SCHEME 
Many people have thought the national ad-
ministration in Washington has gone off the 
deep end so many times that there would be 
no more deep ends left * * * but these peo-
ple have underestimated the national ad-
ministration. 
It is with continuing amazement that we 
observe the proposals put forth by the ad-
ministration and one of the latest is definite-
ly a prizewinner?something of a humdinger 
among humdingers. 
The administration is proposing that the 
Federal Government help pay the rent for 
moderate income and needy families. This 
facet of the Great Society is called an "effort 
to Improve the American city." 
Improving the American city is a com-
mendable idea, but the powers that be call 
"moderate" and "needy" families those with 
incomes up to $16,200 per year and who pay 
as high as $200 per month in rent. 
It seems that the time is long past due 
when the American people?those who strive 
to make their own way and who believe 
this striving is a good and wholesome thing?
should inform their representatives in Wash-
ington that they are tired of supporting such 
harebrained schemes as paying other peo-
ple's rent,

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. KEN W. DYAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 24, 1965 
Mr. DYAL. Mr. Speaker, under leave 
to extend my remarks in the RECORD, I 
wish ta include an editorial from the 
Daily Sun, San Bernardino, Calif., under 
date of May 20, 1965. The concern ex-
pressed in the editorial about the pro-
posed military pay increase reflects the 
thoughts and tremendous interest of con-
stituents who have written to me on this 
subject. 
RAISE INSUFFICIENT 
President Johnson's idea of how much 
pay servicemen should receive is disturbing. 
He has grand ideas about many expenditures 
of Government but what he offers servicemen 
is properly described by Congressman L. 
MENDEL RIVERS, chairman of the House 
Armed Services Committee, as "paltry." 
Said the Congressman: "We have been pa-
tient, hoping for something encouraging 
from the executive branch of Government 
and now this?a paltry increase based on a 
false premise?and suggesting an effective 
date of 1966." 
The President's proposal is for an increase 
of 2.7-percent pay and fringe benefits to men 
with less than 2 years' service, and a 4.8-per-
cent increase for the remainder. 
However, It is the total pay and benefits 
that count: Such as $2.40 added to the $85.80 
per month for apprentice seamen and $6.51 
added to the $241.20 base pay for a midship-
man. Pay in other services corresponds. 
Young officers in all the services are drop-
ping out at an alarming rate. They simply 
cannot raise families on the servicemen's 
pay. The dropout embraces all types of 
service; in the U.S. Navy there is an annual 
turnover of 150,000. 
The San Diego Union speaks out strongly 
in criticism of the President's low estimate 
of the pay servicemen should receive: 
"The failure of Congress to provide the 
minimum-level pay necessary for the essen-
tials already is strongly felt in the military 
ranks. All top-echelon officers agree that 
the low rate of recruitment and high rate of 
personnel turnover has reached alarming 
proportions. 
"There is a turnover of half of the per-
sonnel on a U.S. Navy combatant ship at our 
frontlines of defense. Only one-fifth of the 
Navy men reenlist after the first hitch. ' 
"Secretary of Navy Paul H. Nitze already 
has asked officers and men to extend their 
enlistments up to a half year because of the 
manpower problem created by Vietnam and 
the Dominican Republic. Other trouble

N THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
-Tuesday, May 25, 1965 
r, ANNTJNZIO. Mr. Speaker, in the 
C icago Sun-Times 01 May 16, Tom Lit-
ti wood, of the Sun-Times Washington 
b reau, 'describes the aims and obstacles 
01 changing the current immigration pol-
ic es. Mr. Littlewood does an outstand-
i g job in presenting the facts with ref-
e enc? to our present immigration law 
a d the future of our country in connec-
t' n with problems of immigration. 
Tom Littlewood ..s an 'enlightened 
n wspaperman Who came to Washington 
d ring January of 1905. Prior to coming 
the Nation's Can tal, he was for 10 
Y ars the Spririgfielt? correspondent for 
e Sun-Times covering the Illinois State 
pital. Mr. Littlewood is a graduate of 
orthwestern University in Evanston, Ill. 
I take this opportunity to call again 
the attention of mir?colleagues In the 
?use of Representatives the need for 
beralization of our immigration laws 
n this session of the 39th Congress. 
The article by Mr. Littlewood follows: 
AN ARCHAIC STWTE/VI Or QUOTAS 
(Hy Tom LittlewoOd) 
WASHINGTON.?The world is about to be 
ffered a revealing glimpse into the national 
onscienee of a. cour try whiase troops are 
eiSloyed around the globe inspiring devo-
Dna to Its celebrated principles of equality 
and lustice. 
As have the three Presidents before him, 
Lyndon B. Johnson 'las informed Congress 
that the immigration law has long since 
outlived whatever alleged usefulness it 
might have had when the oceans were con-
siderably wider than they are now. 
U.S. immigration policy is an outgrowth 
of the disillusion following World War I 
which gave citizens of the promised land a 
fe,eling of comfort and safety in isolation. 
The myths of that era have been disposed of, 
but the mainspring of our immigration pol-
icy remains that re.ic of isolationism, the 
national origins quota system. 
Tais system can be understood most read-
ily in terms of Peter Petropblous, his maid, 
and his mother. 
Let us assume th rt, Pete is an American 
citizen of some financial attainment who 
wants to (l) hire a domestic servant from 
Ireland or England and (2) bring his wid-
e-Wed tinother from Greece to live with his 
family. 
Not unexpectedly, the United States is 
ehooty about who gets in. As the test for 
admission, the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 
perpetuated limits on the number of immi-
grants based on the white nationality mix 
of this country in 1920. 
, More than two-thirds of the 158,361 quota 
numbers are allocated to Great Britain and 
Irelancl. Neither country consumed any-
where near ifs quota last year. Pete's maid 
ca a be off the boat and on the job in 4 to 6 
eica 
But. Greeeds quota is about 300 and there is 
Waiting list of at out 100,000. 
Even along a close relatives of citizens are 
given preference second only to needed job 
skills, it will 're at least 5 years before Pete's 
mother 1111 ie eligible for a visa. Italy's 
backlog it sti 1 larger, about 250,000. 
Plainly;put the U.S. policy is that the maid 
from Britain .s More desirable than the rela-
tive from: Gr( ece or Italy or Poland or Spain 
or Africa'or the Orient. . 
The lav w is written in a spirit of exclu-
sivity to beaetlt Anglo-Saxons, Scandina-
vians, Garmans, and other noathern Euro-
peans whose - countrymen had the good 
fortune lo be, like Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. 
Dooley, P lgrim father that missed the 
first boats." It was Mr. Dooley who insisted 
he mus "rsise me claryon voice agin' th' 
invasion + iv this fair land be tta paupers an' 
arnychists? re bet I Must?because I'm here 
first." , 
An even more invidious feature of the law 
is what has come to be called the Asian-
Pacific triangle. This restricts aliens of re-
mote Astan stock to the small Asian quotas 
regardless o ' their place of birth. The tri-
angle reaches from India and Pakistan east 
to China, , span and most of the Pacific 
islands, but. excluding Australia and New 
Zealand. 
Attorvey General Nicholas laatzenbach has 
related the use of a young man from Colom-
bia whe is eligible to come here freely on 
nonquota ssatus because he is from an in-
dependent r ation in the Western Hemisphere. 
His wife, tco, is a native and citizen of Co-
lombia. But she is also the daughter of a 
Chinese father. 
She Musa, therefore, be regarded as half-
Chinese and eligible only under the quota for 
Chinese. which happens to be 105 a year. 
She ordinarily could reach the top of the 
list in the sear 2048. 
All alias, President Johnson suggested in 
his inimigration message to Congress, is 
neither good government nor good sense. 
It rulti in prolonged separation of fam-
ilies. Keectd job skills are denied the coun-
try.there is the obvious hypocrisy from 
AF 
d 
those ho spout off far and wide about the 
democ atis principles of fair treatment for 
all an yes insist on measuring potentiality 
for gond c tizenship in relationship to where 
a person happens to have been born. 
Mr. 'Johnson has promised congressional 
charngaona of immigration reform that once 
the decks are Cleared of voting rights legis-
lation:he will push for the immigration bill. 
The amot nt of shove that he supplies will 
be a tirue test not only of his liberalism but 
of this presumably most literal of all Con-
gresses. 
If it cannot be done by this Congress, it is 
hard to conceive how the system can ever be 
changed in a meaningful way. 
This is nevertheless, a highly emotional 
question bringing into play deep-down-in-
side doubts. It's; Who do you want living in 
your "towa? But also: Will he someday be 
completing for your job? 
The pattern of opposition is a familiar 
one?the American Legion and other vet-
erana groups who merge danger of subver-
sion with the idea that ell foreigners are 
suspect; the Daughters of the American 
Revolution and other native-born patriotic 
socilties dedicated to a clean white Anglo-
Saxon Pr otestant America. The Steuben So-
ciety of German-Americans and some like 
gaciu,ps v hose memories are short. And some 
unicins who regard the automation and un-
employment and relief problems as bad 
enotigh already. 
Although the national origins system was 
intended to place specific hmits on immigra-
tion, broad differences aasse developed be-
tween t ieory and practice. 
Ditring the past decade, an average of 63,-
000, of the 158,000 annual quota numbers 
were turned back unused by the desirable 
nations The unused portion could not, 
May 25, 1965 
however, be spread around among the other 
countries with waiting lists. 
Nonquota aliens mer-aged 178,000 a year. 
These included the beneficiaries of special 
laws for refugees, war brides, and skilled per-
sons, a relatively smal: number by private bill 
and 11,400 quota-free immigrants from this 
hemisphere. The last figure haa alarmed 
some Congressmen who have noticed the 
dark skins and relief incidence of many Latin 
American aliens. (The Government already 
has cut off the unrestrained flow of low-cost 
migratory farm- workers, the original purpose 
of the quota-free provision for Latin Ameri-
can countries.) Total immigration has been 
running nearly 300,000 a year; from 1931 un-
til the end of World War II, by contrast, im-
migration never exceeded 100,000 a year. 
Although Japan's quota is only 185, almost 
5,000 visas have been issued annually to 
Japanese. The Indonesian quota is 100, but 
visas 1,657. Italy's quota .is 5,666; visas 
15,685 
The first half of each country's quota goes 
to persons with urgently needed skills. Last 
year, for instance, 568 tailors were admitted, 
$28 engineers, 200 teachers, 198 doctors. Be-
fore he arrives the immigrant must secure 
a specific job pledge from an employer. 
The next 30 percent go to parents and un-
married adult children of U.S. citizens. The 
remaining 20 percent of the quota numbers 
are for spouses or unmarried children of 
permanent resident aliens awaiting citizen-
ship. 
A history of certain types of illness, includ-
ing epilepsy, tuberculosis, and mental re-
tardation, is a permanent bar to immigra-
tion. There have been cases in which a 
family has been prevented from, immigrating 
because one of the children was a mild epi-
leptic, modern treatment drugs notwith-
standing. 
Hearings have been partially completed by 
the immigration subcommittees of both 
Houses on the administration proposal for 
changing the law. 
The overall maximum increase in immi-
grations would be only about 60,000 a year. 
Quotas would be reduced by one-fifth in each 
of the next 5 years, thus phasing out the na-
tional origins, system over the period, and 
placing the retired. numbers in a pool to be 
allotted on a first-come, first served basis. 
The Asian-Pacific triangle concept, which 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk has labeled 
"overt statutory discrimination against more 
than half the world's population," would be 
abolished. No more than 10 percent of the 
total could come from any one country, 
though. 
Order of preference would remain about 
the same: the first half to those with skills 
or education "especially advantageous" to the 
United States; the next 30 percent to the un-
married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; 
and the remaining 20 percent to spouses and 
children of reside:at aliens. 
Parents of U.S.. citizens Could enter freely. 
It would no longer be necessary for skilled 
immigrants to nail down a specific job be-
fore coming here. ' 
Epilepsy would be removed as a ban, and 
mental illness would not be an automatic 
prohibition for persons having close relatives 
already in this country. 
. A joint congressional-executive immigra-
tion board would be created as an advisory 
body to decide which job skills are especially 
advantageous to the country. 
Among new seed imigrants, the President 
would be authorized to reserve up to 10 
percent for refugees fleeing oppression or 
catastrophe. 
This year the immigration subcommittee 
Of the House Judiciary Committee was pur-
posely increased from five to nine members 
so as to cope with its chairman. He is Rep-

spit of land in Peconic Bay, at which 
they landed, Conscierice Point. 
Notably, the first structure these set-
tlers built, according to surviving his-
torical records, was a church. 
Their idea's the people of Long Island 
and New York States in general have 
harvested, to the lasting benefit of all, 
We owe them our gratitude. ' 
When these settlers landed to Con-
science Point, it was not their first con-
tact with the soil of the New World. 
They had crossed the Atlantic Ocean to 
live in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 
the vicinity of what is now Lynn. How-
ever, they did not find there the freedom 
best suited to their lives. They then 
formed a company Which received the 
King's grant carrying with it permission 
to settle on the far side of Long Island 
Sound, east of New Amsterdam. 
On first landing they were rebuffed by 
the Dutch at Manhasset. It was at this 
point they moved eastward by boat to 
the Southampton area. Where they 
landed, Conscience Point in the hamlet 
of North Sea, is now a historical park. 
The New York Times, in a recent arti-
cle on Southampton's founding, quoted 
records of the landing's aftermath. 
? With gifts and greetings, these Puritans 
Made friends_ with the Indians and were led 
by them along a trail through the woods, to 
What came to be known as Old Towne. 
Friendly Indians helped the settlers 
to live on the land. The first houses 
were built on what is now the site of 
Southampton Hospital. 
Today, the house built by an early 
settler, Thomas Halsey, has been re-
stored through the efforts of the South-
ampton Colonial Society. It stands as 
the oldest _colonial style house in the 
State, I am told. 
Other sites of interest include the 
Shinnecock Indian Reservation, the one-
room schoolhouse at Red Creek, the Pel-
letreau Silvershop, restored by the 
Southampton Village Improvement So-
ciety, the country store, the Captain Rog-
ers homestead, the 'Parrish Museum on 
Jobs Lane, the Whaling Museum, the 
Customs House in Sag Harbor, the 
Quoque Wildlife Refuge, and the Auto-
motive Museum. 
I am certain that tourists from what-
ever State will be interested in attend-
ing the observance in which the com-
munities that make up Southampton 
will take part: Bridgeharnpton, East-
port, Hampton Bays, North Sea, Noyack, 
Quoque, Remsenberg, Sag Harbor, Saga-
Ponack, Shinnecock, Flanders, Water 
Mill, and Westhampton. The programs, 
Including a reenactment of the Con-
science Point landing, will begin in June 
and extend into September. 
Southampton's citizens, including its 
historian, Arthur B. Hull, Jr., are to be 
congratulated for planning a summer in 
appreciation of our splendid heritage 
and the makers of that heritage. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO HAROLD 
BEAtON 
Mr. BOGGS. Mf. President, on Friday 
the Senate confirmed the nomination of 
No. 95--?0 
Harold D. Beaton, of Michigan, to be 
U.S. attorney for the western district 
of Michigan for a term of 4 years. 
It has been my pleasure to know Hal 
Beaton for many years and I want to 
join his legion of friends in congratulat-
ing him on this well-deserved appoint-
ment. I am sure he will do an outstand-
ing job. My best wishes to him and his 
family. 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE AN 
REPUBLIC 
Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, 63 
years- ago?on May 20, 1902?the Re-
public of Cuba was established. Seven 
years earlier, the great Cuban patriot, 
Jose Marti, was killed in Oriente Pro-
vince, in the battle for freedom. 
History thus reflects that the people 
of Cuba have long been committed to 
the principles of freedom and liberty. 
Suffering long under the yoke of Span-
ish rule, they strove to carve their own 
destiny. But the people of Cuba have 
been too often betrayed by men who in-
voked the name of liberty?only to seize 
power, to their own selfish ends. 
Now, in Fidel Castro, Cuba has suffered 
the worst betrayal of all, for Castro not 
only concealed his own motivations but 
also delivered his countrymen into the 
hands of Soviet communism, and now 
conspires to subvert the other nations 
of the Caribbean and Latin America. 
The recent events in the Dominican Re-
public attest to the extent of the menace 
which the ascendancy of Castro has 
posed. 
Jose Marti said to his people many 
years ago, in warning them against 
tyrants: 
Re who intends to govern should be 
worthy of government. 
Marti saw the truth; but Castro, the 
false leader, has thrust down upon his 
own people a regime of oppression re-
pugnant to the dream of Jose Marti 
and to all loyal Cubans. 
I am hopeful that when the Organiza-
tion of American States meets, to discuss 
the new crisis in the Dominican Repub-
lic, it will remember the tragic lesson of 
Cuba. 
I know that the United States will 
never accept Castro and communism in 
this hemisphere. 
The Cuban people will not be aban-
doned. I know that President Johnson 
is resolute against the exportation of 
Castroism to the hemisphere, and 'will 
do all that is morally and legally proper 
to assure the speedy dethroning of that 
despot. 
The Cuban national anthem contains 
lines that describe the anguish of that 
nation today: ' 
To live in chains is to live submitted to 
opprobium and affront. 
The Cuban refugees who streamed to 
Florida shores and the brave souls who 
today fight from the mountains give evi-
dence thit the fires of liberty still burn 
among Cubans. 
Every effort must be made by the al-
lies of this hemisphere to contain, and 
then erase, the Castro infamy. 
10987 
Our other friends in the free world 
must now realize that Castro is not a 
comic-opera tyrant, a Lilliputian kicking 
the shins of the giant to the north, for 
the forces behind Castro are a threat, 
not only to the people of Cuba, but also 
to all in this hemisphere. 
We must, of course, restore the path 
to peace in the Dominican Republic. 
But we must also stick to our resolve to 
see that Cuba is Made free of its newest 
and most vicious tyranny. 
PROPOSED REVISION OF SKIP-ROW 
COTrON-PLANTING REGULATIONS 
Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, the 
board of directors of the Littlefield, Tex., 
Chan ber of Commerce recently directed 
a most important and well chosen letter 
to the Agricultural Stabilization and 
Conservation Office. 
The directors point out their concern 
about a proposed revision of regulations 
pertaining to skip-row planting of cot-
ton. This is a matter which will be of 
interest to other Senators; and I ask 
that the letter be printed at this point 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 
LITTLEFIELD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
Littlefield, Tex., May 13, 1965. 
DIRECTOR OF FARMER PROGRAMS DIVISION, 
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation 
Office, Washington, D.C. 
DEAR Sm: The board of directors of the 
Littlefield Chamber of Commerce has made 
a thorough study of your proposed changes 
in the rules for measuring cotton when 
planted in a skip-raw pattern for compliance 
with acreage allotment. We have also made 
a survey of the feelings of the farmers and 
businessmen in this area. 
It is our conclusion that your proposed 
change in the ruling would be very harmful 
to the farmers and the entire economy of 
the south plains of Texas. The practice of 
skip-row planting has been recommended 
by various Government agencies such as the 
Extension Service and Soil Conservation 
Service. It has also been accepted by the 
farmers as a sound agricultural practice. 
The farmers tell us that the practice reduces 
their cost of production, conserves moisture 
and fertility, and increases the grade of 
cotton. 
Your proposed ruling would make it im-
possible for economic reasons for farmers to 
continue this sound practice recommended 
by other Government agencies. 
Since the farmers are already caught in 
a price squeeze, your proposed change in the 
rules would bankrupt many of them and 
vitally affect our entire economy. 
The Littlefield Chamber of Commerce has 
voted unanimously to ask you to please con-
sider not changing the rules on skip-row 
planting. We leave this vital decision in 
your hands. 
Sincerely, 
C. W. CONWAY, President.

I" to the need for consideration of the 
p oblems of the handicapped. 
The architectural barriers project has 
p blished a printed gaide to Washington 
fir the handicapped. I bring this guide 
the attention of Senators, in the hope 
at it may assist them in giving infor-

INTRODUCTION 
The architectural barriers project for the 
Metropolitan Washington area is truly a 
communits? undertaking. It Ls sponsored by 
the Distrist of Columbia Commissioners 
Committee on Employment of the Handi-
capped and by the District of :Columbia, 
Maryland, and Northern Virginia Societies 
for Crippled Children and Adults. 
Many organizations, both public and pri-
vate, and nany individual volunteers have 
devoted hours of their time to the produc-
tion of this guide. We wish to thank each 
and every cne of them. This directory would 
not have ben possible without the assistance 
of these gr nips and individuals. 
Fornis provided by the National Society for 
Crippled Children and Adults were used for 
surveying ss number of the facilities listed 
here arid ws wish to thank the society for its 
valuable st. pport. We also wish to express 
our ap reciation to the owners, managers, or 
employ es of the various places surveyed. 
Their coop tration made the task a much 
more please nt one for our volunteers. 
EADING THIS DIRECTORY 
This dire otory lists only a cross section of 
the facilitics in the area. There are many 
not listed that have level entrances; i.e., most 
stores, Service facilities, and movie theaters. 
Realizing that a step or curb is as great a 
barrier as a flight of stairs for many an 
otherwise cc mpletely independent operator of 
wheelchair and car, we have noted these 
whenever known. Curbs in the District vary 
in heights up to 8 inches. The average 
height ifs 7 nches. 
Thosq facilities marked with a "W" have 
been fonnd accessible and usable by a person 
in a wheelchair, restroom facilities always 
excepted. In all other listings the front 
entrance is level unless another entrance is 
mentioned, n which case it is the one to be 
used. f th !re is an attendant to park your 
car, if leader dogs are allowed, or chairs have 
arms, it will be mentioned if we have the 
information When restroom is on level 
this will be noted as accessible, meaning no 
steps bUt stall doors less than 28 inches. 
Most reetaumnt chairs are sturdy, without 
arms. ,

American In?titute of Architects reiter-
ated its long-standing support for the 
establishment of a Cabinet-level Depart-
ment of lousing and Urban Develop-
ment, stating: 
The problems of urban America are so 
complex and mup,erons that they have 
aareuly exceeded the abilities of many corn-

other environinental scars of our Nation, 
I ask unanimous consent to include at 
this point in the RECORD a copy the

serve intelligently and creatively while 
buildtng intelligently, whereas the failure 
to preserve natural areas is virtually irre-
trievable, and Whereas the architect believes 
to the cityscape: 
Therefore this resolution Moves to estab-
lish a standing committee of the chapter, 
to be called the committee on the natural 
environment and further sets forth the pur-
poses of this committee would be?
To reassert and amplify the position that 
the informed soncern of the architect is 
for. the total environment of man, and for 
all elements of the scene and of the natural 
environment?of air, water, and land as well 
as for the urban scene; 
To seek to make policymakers fully con-
scious of the need to consider the esthetics 
of the natural environment and to be 
aware of the contribution which the design 
profession can make in this regard; 
To foster studies of programs and tech-
niques for identifying and preserving the 
remnants of the national inheritance and of 
restoring natural environments, particu-
larly those in or near urban areas; 
To raise the collective voice and to use 
the influence of the architect in support of 
those forces working toward eradication of 
air and water pollution and toward esthe-
tically acceptable solutions to solid waste, 
disposal; 
o establish permanent personal liaison 
with the guiding minds of all organizations 
concerned with the natural environment so 
as to engender an exchange of ideas, to foster 
working relationships and to develop action 
programs for the consideration of this chap-
ter; 
To seek to join with other chapters and 
with the other design professions?land-
scape architects, planners, industrial design-
ers, and engineers?in initiating a full scale 
program of research to creatively deal with 
the outrages of signscape, junkscape, wire-
scape, wastescape, dozerscape, siltscape, and 
all other visual desecrations of the natural 
environment; 
To actively seek philanthropic funds for 
the establishment of staffed programs con-
cerned with the matters herein set forth?
either on a permanent or task force basis; 
and it is further 
Resolved, That these matters be brought 
before the forthcoming convention of the 
institute for consideration by the national 
body; and it is also resolved ,that the insti-
tute be urged to expand the war on urban 
ugliness program to include suburbia, ex-
urbia, nd rural and wild America. 
THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE CUBAN REPUBLIC 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, 
May 20, we celebrate the 63d anniversary 
of the establishment of the Cuban Re-
public. 
It is a day that is celebrated by all 
People and by all the freedom loving cit-
izens of the Americas. 
It is one of the great tragedies of his-
tory that the Cuban people, who fought 
so heroically and sacrificed so much to 
win their freedom from Spanish imperial 
rule, should now be oppressed by an in-
finitely more ruthless and inhuman form 
of colonialism. 
There are those who say that it is 
wrong for America to intervene in Cuba, 
even to the limited extent of granting 
tolerance to the thousands of Cuban 
freedom fighters who are working for 
the liberation of their country from 
abroad. They say that if the Cuban 
people want communism, that is their 
business. 
I find it difficult to understand the 
blindness and the total lack of humani-
- 
Approved For Release 2003/09/26 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000500080005-4 
May 20, 1965 
tarian feeling or morality suggested by 
this attitude. 
The Castro regime did not come into 
existence because the Cuban people 
wanted communism. The fact is that 
the Cuban people were never given this 
option?and if they had been given this 
option I am certain that they would have 
rejected communism overwhelmingly. 
The Cuban people wanted more 
liberty, they wanted an end to the abuses 
that had characterized the Batista re-
gime, they wanted a return to constitu-
tional democratic government. 
It was these things and not commu-
nism that Castro promised the Cuban 
people. 
And if Castro enjoyed a brief period of 
popularity after he came to power, it 
was because the Cuban people truly be-
lieved that he was going to give them 
freedom and democracy. 
But it soon became apparent, even to 
those who had doubted, that the Castro 
movement was neither nationalist nor 
democratic, that it was controlled by a 
small number of hard core Communists, 
bent on converting Cuba into a totali-
tarian satellite of world communism. 
The Cuban people soon came to 
realize, too, that the Castro regime was 
not a reform movement, but a quisling 
tyranny created by the Kremlin as a 
base for the subversion of Latin America. 
The 200,000 Cuban refugees who 
abandoned everything they possessed to 
escape from Castro's paradise, attest to 
the intense hatred of the Cuban people 
for this regime of oppression and misery 
and national treason. 
The thousands of Cuban patriots who 
are fighting in the mountains, in open 
defiance of Castro's firing squads, also 
attest to this. 
Every day witnesses new acts of re-
sistance by the Cuban people, while new 
guerrilla bands and new resistance lead-
ers continue to spring up to take the 
place of those who have fallen in the 
struggle. 
The recent events in the Dominican 
Republic should be an adequate answer 
to those who, while they do not like 
Castro, tell us that Castro should be re-
garded as a nuisance rather than a dag-
ger at our throats. 
Only the courageous and resolute ac-
tion of President Johnson prevented the 
emergence of a second Castro regime in 
the Carribbean. I believe this is now 
realized by the great majority of the 
Latin American diplomats stationed in 
Santo Domingo and by the great major-
ity of the governments of the Americas. 
But, even though the Communists have 
been frustrated in the Dominican Re-
public, the danger to the security and 
independence of the Latin American 
countries will remain serious so long as 
the Castro regime is permitted to exist. 
Communists never give up unless they 
are decisively defeated. The setback in 
Santo Domingo will not discourage Cas-
tro. On the contrary, there is every 
reason to believe that his apparatus of 
trained agents and guerrilla fighters is 
even now planning more uprisings in 
other Latin American countries. 
As I have stated on previous occasions, 
I believe we have been too passive in our

Practice and Procedure, headed by Senator 
EDWARD V. LONG, 13 taking a close look at 
that question In a series of hearings, which 
started this week.

tion as supetfluc us and unneeded, even 
though Government studies indicate that 
many familes o rot have diets considered 
best for the maintenance of good health and 
physical well-being. They objected to FDA's 
use of listening devices, concealed. radio 
transmitter and waat they- called discrimi-
natory enforcemert methods against food 
supplement sellers. K. W. Dilling, an attor-
ney and geneial counsel for the National 
Association of Ford Supplement Manufac-
turers and Dietributors also scored FDA's 
efforts to brat*" dietary supplementation as 
"quackery" or "food faddism." "Notably 
absent has been ay FDA publicity deplor-
ing extensive lase af cigarettes, soft drinks, 
alcoholic bevetagez , candy, and other items 
which make n contribution to the national 
Approved For Releas 
health, and which in fact are often harmful," 
Dilling said. 
Ellis Arnall, former Governor of Georgia 
and chief witness during the first day of 
hearings, submitted documents to support 
a charge that "The Food atd Drug Admin-
istration is corrupt; they contaminate and 
they have lied in court." He introduced 
documents to support his contention. The 
charge of perjury was made primarily against 
Glenn E. Schreiber, an FDA inspector who 
Arnall claims lied 28 times 'ander oath dur-
ing proceedings brought against PI esto 
Foods, Ine., of Kansas City, 
Five officials of FDA are appearing before 
the committee this week. ;Senator Lona re-
quested the hearing because FDA's Kansas 
City office employed concealed electronic 
recording devices in an at;empt to secure 
evidence of mislabeling of Presto Foods' Al-
lerjoy, a product sold as a milk substitute 
for children and adults allergic to milk". 
FDA Commissioner George P. Larrick told. 
the committee that his agency uses electronic 
transmitting and recording equipment to en-
force laws against sales of amphetamines and 
barbiturates. "Radio transmitters are used 
also to enable us to follow the progress of 
our own undercover man and determine 
when his life is in danger because of the 
character of the individuals he must contact 
to detect law violations," "Airsick told LONG. 
The Kansas City case required that FDA 
inspector Schreiber seize a pamphlet about 
Allerjoy from two lady schoolteachers who 
allegedly were demonstrating it in a super-
market at Shawnee Village, Kans. "In view 
of the simplicity of this case, I can't see the 
need for use of electronic equipment and 
Gestapo tactics," Loam comnented. 
The electronic gear in question?that used 
in the Kansas City seizure?is known as a 
Kel-Kit unit. It consists of a wireless trans-
mitter about the size of a package of cigar-
ettes, which broadcasts monitored conversa-
tions to a receiver and taoe recorder con-
cealed in a briefcase. In his appearance 
before the subcommittee, Dining gave this 
opinion of the use of recording devices by 
FDA: "This is trampling upon traditional 
American rights. The planting of these de-
vices is thoroughly un-American and thor-
oughly reprehensible." In answer to a ques-
tion by Senator LONG, Dilling said that "the 
use of 'snooping devices' is a very common 
practice of this agency ? * I* sometimes they 
'bug' a whole house. ? * ? It's been my 
experience in dealing with FDA cases that 
the use of these devices is extensive, general, 
and accepted by this agency." Dilling's 
testimony came in the face of A. E. Rayfield's 
contention that FDA uses electronic record-
ing equipment only in eirUeme situations. 
Raylleld is Director of the Bureau of Regu-
latory Compliance. 
During the 3 days of hearings, Loam's 
committee also heard testimony from Oscar 
H. Brinkman, attorney for Washington's 
Church of Scientology and from Wayne 
Rohrer, the church's minister. Brinlcman 
attacked the FDA for seizing a religious ma-
chine which he said merely measured emo-
tional reactions. At the same time FDA 
condoned dangerous use of electric shock de-
vices by psychiatrists, Brin_kman said, even 
though they had led to some people being 
electrocuted. Brinkman told LONG that 
Federal officials accompanied by 6 to 10 or 
more armed U.S. marshals swarmed the 
church, grabbed books from the hands of 
students and ministers, broke into confes-
sional rooms, and invaded the privacy of 
ministers. Be said that FDA had not pre-
viously requested that use of the machine 
be halted. 
On Thursday Senator LONG and nutrition-
ist Carlton Fredericks said that FDA con-
centrates on small companies and persons 
with unusual approaches to disease and goes 
easier on big companies. Fredericks told the 
Senate Judiciary Suboominittee studying in-
vasion of private rights that he had been

BANK MERGER ACT 
Mr. ROBERTSON. Mr, President, 
this morning Reno Odlin, president of 
the American Bankers Association, and 
chairman of the board of the Puget 
Sound National Bank, of Tacoma, Wash., 
appeared and spoke in support of Senate 
bill 1698, before the Subcommittee on 
Financial Institutions, of the Senate 
Committee on Banking and Currency. 
His complete and illuminating statement 
shbws the confusion and controversy 
which now exist in the field of bank 
mergers, and explains the reason why en-
actment of my bill, S. 1698, to amend the 
Bank Merger Act, is needed in order to 
clear up the situation. 
I ask unanimous consent to have his 
statement printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT OF RENO ODLIN 
My name is Reno Odlin. I am president of 
the kmeri,Call Bankers Association and chair-
man,ot tbe board of the Puget Sound Na-
tional Bank, Tacoma, Wash. I am appearing 
here today on behalf of the association in 
support of S. 1698, a bill designed to eliminate 
the confusion and chaos surrounding the 
whole question of bank mergers. 
Before making specific comments on the 
bill under consideration, it might be well to 
take a brief look at some of the economic 
factors that have prompted mergers in all 
lines of business and commerce since World 
War II. 
One of the prime reasons for mergers is 
the lack of qualified successor management. 
Many industries were not hiring new em-
ployees during the 1930's because they didn't 
need them. They didn't hire them during 
the war years because they couldn't get them. 
As a result some companies lacked depth in 
management and when it came time for top 
executives to retire there were not enough 
capable and experienced men coming along 
behind them. Many smaller companies solved 
this problem through mergers with larger 
firms that had larger pools of talent. This 
same pattern held true in banking and 
prompted many mergers. 
The second major reason for bank mergers 
was directly related to the dynamic perform-
ance of the economy. In the past two dec-
ades, the economy, measured in terms of out-
put of goods and services, generally referred 
to as the gross national product, has grown 
by 192 percent, reaching an annual rate of 
$623 billion at the end of 1964. But while 
GNP was rising by 192 percent, commercial 
and industsial loans were increasing by 480 
percent, rising to more than $55 billion in 
mid-1964. Domestic private investment dur-
ing the same 20-year period rose by '750 per-
cent to nearly $88 billion at the end of 1964. 
Over the two decades, expenditures for plant 
and equipment jumped by 470 percent, 
The rapid increase in economic activity 
caused a quickened rate of growth in the 
size of many corporations which in turn put 
presure on banks for more diversified serv-
ices. As credit demands of corporations 
grew, some smaller banks began to feel the 
restrictions on their lending limits and de-
cided that mergers would enable them to in-
crease their lending capacities. 
The third element encouraging mergers 
has been the efforts of commercial banks to 
meet the financial needs of the American 
public during a period of expansion and 
rapidly changing economic and population 
patterns. These developments have resulted 
in a huge demand for a growing variety of 
bank services, particularly those oriented 
toward consumers which involve high-vol-
ume operations. For example, some merg-
ers have occurred Baa result of two small 
or medium-sized banks desiring to obtain 
the modern and expensive electronic data-
processing equipment that has spread so 
rapidly in banking in the past decade. 
Finally, some bank mergers have occurred 
In recent years as a result of the efforts of 
the bank regulatory agencies to prevent a 
bank suspension. These so-called "shotgun 
mergers" can do much to preserve the sta-
bility and strength of the banking system. 
But it should be obvious that the manage-
ment of any bank approached by the regula-
tory authorities with a request that it ab-
sorb a weak bank in the community would 
be very reluctant to do so if the merger 
might be subsequently challenged in the 
courts on the grounds of competition alone. 
Those of us who make our living in bank-
ing, as well as experienced observers of the 
banking scene, know full well that competi-
tion in banking?and between banks and 
other financial institutions?is stronger 
today than at any time in the past. 
It is my own judgment that on balance 
the many bank mergers in the postwar pe-
riod, rather than diminishing competition, 
have in fact led to increased competition, 
both among banks and between banks and 
other types of financial institutions. 
BACKGROUND OF THE BANK MERGER ACT 
In 1950, section '7 of the Clayton Act was 
amended to prohibit mergers through asset 
acquisition as well as stock acquisition in 
10663 
any line of commerce in any section of the 
country where the result could tend to 
reduce competition substantially. The 
amendment, however, covered only corpora-
tions under the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Trade Commission. Banks have never been 
under the jurisdiction of the Fro. 
During the 1950's, as the number of bank 
mergers increased, the Justice Department 
sought legislation to subject banks to the 
new section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Jus-
tice Department wanted the change because 
It recognized that it lacked authority under 
section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended. 
Moreover, until recently, it was almost uni-
versally believed that bank mergers would 
not be subject to section 1 of the Sherman 
Act. 
Congress flatly rejected these proposals of 
the Justice Department to make section '7 
of the Clayton Act applicable to bank merg-
ers. But, at the same time, Congress saw 
the need for legislation to establish clear 
and uniform standards governing bank 
mergers, and it saw the need to specify 
which agency of Government should have 
the final authority over bank mergers?the 
Justice Department or the three Federal 
bank supervisory authorities. 
The Bank Merger Act of 1960 was intended 
to answer both requirements. The act gave 
the final authority over bank mergers to the 
three bank Supervisory agencies?the Fed-
eral Reserve System for State member banks, 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
for insured nonmember banks, and the 
Comptroller of the Currency for national 
banks. Under the legislation the banking 
agency having jurisdiction is required to 
request a report on the competitive aspects 
of a merger under consideration from the 
Justice Department. The agency having ju-
risdiction is also required to request reports 
on competitive factors from the other two 
banking agencies. 
The competitive factor is then weighed 
along with such factors as the financial his-
tory and condition of the banks involved, 
the adequacy of their capital structures, the 
general character of the banks' management, 
and the convenience and needs of the com-
munity to be served. The agencies are re-
quired to reject any merger application if, 
after giving full consideration to all such 
factors, they do not find the transaction to 
be in the public interest. 
In passing the Bank Merger Act, Congress 
decided that the public interest is best served 
by subjecting bank mergers to a balanced 
test of cempetition and protection of sound 
banking rather than to the single test of 
competition under the antitrust standards. 
I don't think the intent of Congress could 
have been stated more clearly than it was at 
the time the Bank Merger Act was passed. 
Senator FULBRIGHT, Democrat, of Arkansas, 
who was chairman of the Senate Banking 
and Currency Co.mmittee when the bill was 
brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate, 
said, "As it passed the Senate, S. 1062 (the 
Bank Merger Act) expressed the view of the 
Senate, for the third time, that bank mergers 
should be regulated by the Federal banking 
agencies on the basis of banking factors and 
the competitive factors, with no single factor 
being controlling. S. 1062 was a clear state-
ment, for the third time, of the Senate's 
view that the provisions of section 7 of the 
Clayton Act should not apply to bank 
mergers." 
The Senator went on to point out that "the 
amendments to S. 1062 made by the House do 
not change this aspect of the bill. The House 
has agreed with the Senate that bank merg-
ers should be controlled by the Federal bank-
ing agencies on the basis of both banking 
factors and competitive factors, and that sec-
tion 7 of the Clayton Act should continue to 
be inapplicable to bank mergers." 
The intent of the bill was also stated by 
tl;)e majority leafier of the Spate, Lyndon B.

e intent of Congress in passing the 
uk Merger Act was very clear. Yet, in 
ne of 1965, following 2 years of litigation,

two banks in Philadephia which had been 
proved by the Comptroller of the Currency, 
Id the merger violated section 7 of the 
a3rton Act. 
Justice Harlan, who disagreed with the 
ajority, said, "I suspect that no one will

nd that the Clayton Act carried the day for 
case in court. Th 3 result is, of course, 
at the Bank Merger Act is almost corn-
letely nullified; its enactment turns out to 
eve been an exorbitant waste of eongres-
ena![ time and energy. This frustration of 
Manifest congressic nal design is, in my 
law, a most unesarranted Intrusion upon the 
egishative domain." 
subsequently, the Supreme Court ruled 
bat two banks in Lexington, Hy., which had 
? erged in accordance with the provisions of 
the Bank Merger Act Were in violation of the 
Sherman Act. 'Then in March 1965, a Fed-
eral district cdurt in New York ruled that 
the Manufacturers Trast Co. and the Hanover 
Bank- violated both toe Clayton Act and the 
Sherman Act when they merged in 1961, after 
they had received the approval of the Federal 
Reserve Board. 
. On the baste of these enlings the Depart-
ment Of Justiee could now challenge all of 
the More than 2,000 bank mergers which 
have been emesurtunated since the Clayton 
Act was amended in 1950. 
TUE PlIAPOSE OF S. 1698 
Obvithisly, there is a clear need for the 
legislation that is now before this com-
mittee. The ground rules governing bank 
Mergers must be reaffirmed and the dark 
clouds of cotifusior must be removed from 
the numerouS bank mergers that have been 
consummated in good faith under the law of

congressional investigation, with which, in-

eration. in short, a single bank failure is 
cause for benorn because of the 'human and 
economic pro! lams it creates for the com-
munity. 'That is why entry into the banking

Once a 'cheater is granted to a bank, the

tions whibh prescribe the amount a bank 
may lend to :al individual or a corporation, 
how much it can pay in interest to attract

reserves, and 3, host of other limitations. In 
fact, regullations pervade the whole spectrum 
of bank ,opel ations. Through periodic ex-
aminations, lank supervisory agencies make 
sure that th regulations are observed. 
By using these tools?regulation and ex-
amination?bank supervisory authorities can 
control Competition in banking on a con-
tinuing basis to make sure the system is 
sound and the public interest is protected. 
Mr. Chairman, the American. Bankers As-
sociatiod en 'tends that the intimate work-
ing knOwlectge of banking gained by the 
supervisors In their daily association with 
banks ie essential In regulating competition 
In banking. It is also our centention that 
this know-how is basic in considering the 
merits Or bank mergers. Therefore, we are 
in full Cups ort of S. 1698 which would place 
bank Mergers under the jurisdiction of the 
three Feclei al bank supervisory agencies. 
The austice Department would still play 
an advisory role in that the banking agency 
having jurisdiction would have to request 
a repott on the competitive aspects of any 
merger" miler consideration. The banking 
agency woald also have to request reports 
on conmentive factors from the other two 
banking agencies. 
But :the first provision of S. 1698 would 
give the Federal bank supervisory agencies 
the ft al authority over bank mergers, which 
was What Congress intended when it passed 
the Hank Merger Act in 1900. It would 
exemPt b tnk mergers from the provisions 
of thp Sherman Act and section 7 of the

Tku: ovzsriox OE trNMERCING BANKS 
The second provision of S. 1698 is designed 
to preveet the courts from ' breaking up 
mergers that were consummated under ap-
propriate regulatory authority. Five merg-
ers ate now in the courts. Over 2,000 others 
coul4 be challenged by the Department of 
Justice under the Supreme Court's Inter-
pretation of the antitrust laws. 
"tImnerging" a bank after the two banks 
have operated as a single unit is night-
marish c Yen in the abstract. The relation-
ship, between a depositor or borrower said 
his tank is based on mutual confidence and 
trust. In many cases, corporations and in-
dividuals select a particular bank because 
the : bark offers the exact combination of 
services needed. This is particularly true 
when trust services are involved. 
14 a beak were to unmerge, internal work-
ing; efficiency would he shattered. The CUB-
tOTDST, who has not been given much con-
sideration In this whole question, would then 
be race i with the decision of which one of 
the teen "u_nmerged" banks he would pa-
tronize If the relationship is broken, the 
cuetorner may decide that he does not want 
to ;get his business mixed up in the un-
screarntling process and select neither of 
th ten unmerged banks but a different 
bamk, and in all probability, a larger one. 
Zr this pattern of shifting to a larger bank 
in' lien of the unmerged banks prevailed, 
witat effect would this have on competition? 
Inateai of increasing competition, it is likely 
that nnraerging of banks would lead to an 
Inpreate in concentration In banking. This 
cannot be in the public interest. 
Few observers believe the Justice Depart-
Ment would attempt to break up the 2,000-
odd bank mergers that have taken place 
since 1950. It would certainly create chaos 
in the financial system. But here again the 
question is one of equity and fair play. 
Should the Justice Department question 
some mergers and not others when they were 
approved by the same Federal authorities 
under the same law? After all we boast loud 
and long about being a government of laws 
and not of men. 
The American Bankers Association strongly 
urges that all bank mergers which have been 
consummated, after receiving the approval 
of appropriate regulatory authorities, in-
cluding those now being challenged in courts, 
be permitted to Starlit. 
CONCLUSION 
The executive council of the American 
Bankers Association, the ruling body of the 
association with members representing all 
divisions, sections, and committees of the 
ABA and all States in the Union, unani-
mously supports S. 1698. I request per-
mission to insert the resolution in the record 
of these hearings. Many State bankers as-
sociations have taken similar action and 
indications are that others will do the same. 
Mr. Chairman, these actions by the ABA, 
which represents 98 percent of the Nation's 
commercial banks, plus the support coming 
from :State bankers associations, demonstrate 
without doubt that the banking industry 
favors this legislation.. 
In our judgment, the present state of con-
fusion in the field of bank mergers must be 
eliminated so that bankers can get back 
to their main task?meeting fully and ef-
ficiently the financial needs of the American 
economy. S. 1698 can clarify the whole sit-
uation and I urge its prompt passage. 
Thank you very much. 
SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT JOHN-
SON'S POLICIES ON SOUTHEAST 
ASIA 
Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, it is en-
couraging to see large segments of the 
American press underscore the wide ac-
ceptance and approval of our President's 
Policies in southeast Asia. It is encour-
aging to see many newspapers spread 
the message which is so essential; name-
ly, that the United States of America 
seeks peace, and is anxious to help the 
people of South Vietnam and all other 
peoples of southeast Asia, to raise their 
heads and their standard.sof living. 
Last Thursday, America's policies were 
again effectively enunciated by Presi-
dent Johnson, who, in speaking to a na-
tional television audience, gave the mes-
sage that we will meet force with force, 
as we must, in order to restore peace and 
order, though we remain ever willing to 
take part in unconditional talks aimed 
at settlement of the war in southeast 
Asia. 
I - ask unanimous consent that edi-

son's speech, from the Cincinnati En-

and the Washington Daily News, be

sistea with an intensified effort to provide 
more assiStarree fer farmers, regardless of 
whether they happen to be Negro or white. 
In checking out the technical assistance 
effort, AFA's directors determined that about 
one-third of agricultural land in need Of 
treatment has received assistance, In many 
cases lands so ,assisted have been owned by 
knowledgeable educated people. The really 
big job with farmers less knowledgeable still 
lies ahead. With the better farmlands 
owned by the most knowledgeable farmers 
now able to serve as models for other less 
efortuna,te, now is obviously the time to move 
Ibrvicgd, not backward. 
- Contrary to prevailing thought in some 
areas?and this is partly due to an excess of 
zeal on the part of conservationists in over-
selling their product?the soil, water, and 
foresVy job on millions of farm and other 
acres Will never be ended and it is time we 
started facing up to that fact. Changing 
ownership patterns are partly responsible. 
For instance, when a farmer with 300 acres 
buys the adjoining farm of 200 acres, a new 
management program and many adjust-
ments are frequently required: Thus the 
? best farmers require continuing assistance 
as wet as those less fortunate. But the big 
job ahead is with the less fortunate. 
AFA agrees with the views expressed by 
Marion S. Monk in his article, "The $20 Mil-
lion Footnote," starting on page 24 of this 
issue. Mr. Monk lists five basic, reasons why 
the bureau of Budget proposal is a "bomb-
shell" to con..servation: (1) It undermines 
confidence in ,the Government's conserva-
tion purpose; (2) it would weaken loCal 
leadership; (3) it would break faith with 
State and local governments; (4) the re-
volving fund proposed would treat land-
owners unfairy by penalizing those least 
capable financially to move ahead; and (5) 
the proposal Would blunt and seriously slow 
down existing programs in which individual 
landowners are already paying the lion's 
share of the cost. 
AFA agrees with Mr. Monk. The Bureau 
of the Budget has been ill-advised in this 
case. At the same time conservation, in 
shoutdering part of the blame for this pro-
posal, should start tempering its claims. The 
art ,of understatement as best exemplified 
by the late John F. Kennedy may yet prove 
to have been his greatest bequest to the 
American people. We all brag too much. 
We are all guilty of "Madisonavenuizing" our 
Conservation Sfforts. Without necessarily 
meaning to, we not infrequently give the 
Impression of having achieved total success 
when our efforts, in reality, are only well 
started. 
A case in point is forest growth. One 
questions the wisdom of headlining the fact 
that forest growth now exceeds forest drain 
without giving the same emphasis to the 
fact that our supply of larger trees and qual-
ity timber is rapidly declining and that we 
may have to iinport wood in years to come. 
In a country this size with its immense 
geographical growth range there is no ex-
cuse for the declining, quality of our trees 
or the fact that some species, such as quality 
walnut, may even face extinction unless we 
double our present efforts. 
Keeping the Kennedy gift for understate-
ment in mind, it would seem this Nation is 
now mature enough to face reality without 
everlasting gilding the lily. We have not 
licked our forestry problems. We have not 
licked our soil erosion problems. We have 
not licked our wildlife problems. In all 
probability we will never completely lick 
the4 and we 'would be well advised to say 
W 
go e frequently. Too much success Must 
never be permitted to dull the cutting edge 
. of gradual arid never-ending conservation 
advance nor should people and particularly 
Government efficiais be lulled by success 
stories that should more appropriately be 
labeled "limited advance" at best. 
. , 
In our opinion, the "Bennett success story" 
in checking soil erosion and similar buildings 
were clearcut examples of too much glorifi-
cation and too much mythma.king at the 
expense of too many acres yet to be saved. 
The proposal by a responsible agency of Gov-
ernment to lop $20 million: off the technical 
aid effort bears out our point. 
Let conservationists always remember that 
the real glory of the conservation effort in 
America is not the unusual men who lead 
its programs or the banner headlines in the 
press but the application of conservation 
measures to the land by thousands of unsung 
professionals and technicians. Let us al-
ways look to the land itself for the story of 
our modest successes and bitter failures. 
There we will 'find the stark truth, the real 
chronicle of conservation. 
At' 
CUNINDEPENDENCE DAY 
Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, it was 
just 63 years ago on this day that the flag 
of independent Cuba first waved over a 
free land and a proud people. Today, 
that land and that people are no longer 
free, independent, or proud. Instead, 
the descendants of the patriots who 
cheered when their flag was first raised 
in 1902, now find themselves wallowing 
in the morass of Communist domination. 
It is paradoxical, I think, that our Na-
tion played such a significant role in 
paving the way for the free flag of Cuba 
to first fly and, at the same time, must 
assume a sizable share of the respon-
sibility for the fact that that flag no 
longer flies over the homeland. Tragi-
cally, by our failure at the Bay of Pigs, 
the people of this brave land must now 
suffer the heavy hand of a psychotic dic-
tator who has dedicated himself to wip-
ing out the concept of freedom, not only 
in Cuba, but also in the rest of Latin 
America. 
I can only commend President Johnson 
for the speed and decisiveness of his re-
cent action in the Dominican Republic, 
for, without that kind of action, our Na-
tion would undoubtedly by now be faced 
with another Communist regime in this 
hemisphere. It has been documented 
that 58 known Communists were origi-
nally and openly associated with the re-
bellion; and the program and policies 
projected by the original leadership fol-
low a line dangerously similar to that 
used by Castro in 1959. In addition, the 
forces under the domination of this 
group were equipped to a large extent 
with Cuban arms. 
We can expect, I also believe, that 
other areas will become pawns in this ef-
fort by the Communist bloc to try to 
dilute the effectiveness of our progres-
sive escalation tactics in Vietnam. Al-
ready it is reported that trouble spots are 
brewing in other Latin American coun-
tries, again with Cuba as the immediate 
source of inspiration and arms, and with 
Moscow and Peiping in the background. 
There is every indication that our Na-
tion has no intention of withdrawing any 
significant number of our troops from the 
Dominican Republic until we are assured 
that a democratic government is actually 
established there?a government of the 
people, as dedicated as we are to the idea 
that there will be no more Cubas in this 
hemisphere. On this policy, I also com-
mend the President, for our purpose in 
this regard must not be diluted. While 
May 20, 1965 
there May still be some immediate prob-
lem among our Latin American friends 
about our action in the Dominican Re-
public, I am still convinced that in the 
long nm such quick and positive action 
will reinstill in those neighbors the con-
fidence they lost in our Nation when, by 
our indecisiveness in 1960, we allowed 
Cuba to become the invidious threat that 
it is today. 
In closing, I must repeat what I have 
said many times before: Simply wish-
ing for it will not make Communist 
Cuba go away. Any attempt to sweep it 
under the rug will never succeed. It will 
continue to be a thorn in our side until 
we are prepared to take the necessary 
steps to stop it, because only we can sup-
ply the leadership which is so necessary 
in order to coalesce the determination to 
sweep communism out of this hemi-
sphere. 
In this connection, and for purposes 
of debate, I made suggestions, last year, 
on two different occasions, as to how we 
could go about this. Because the prob-
lem of Cuba is now increasingly real, I 
challenge other Senators to pick up the 
banner with other suggestions and pro-
posals. Only in this way can we hope to 
see Cuba returned to those who cherish 
freedom and who take pride in the flag 
that the United States placed in the 
hands of the people of Cuba in 1902. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I 
wish to join several other Senators on 
this particular day in commemorating 
the anniversary of Cuban independence. 
The Cuban people, who were granted 
their independence by the United States 
in 1902, continue in their struggle to 
overcome the many hardships that have 
been forced upon them in recent years. 
Since the duly elected Government, 
headed by Dr. Carlos Prios, gave way to 
the regime of Major General Batista, in 
the military coup of March 10, 1952, the 
Cuban people have suffered one series of 
heartaches and hardships after another. 
One year ago today, I stated that 
Cuba was an island of horror and a mere 
shell of what had existed prior to the 
Castro takeover. Today, that situation 
remains the same. Cuba is an island 
fortress whose communistic government 
has no interest in the welfare of its 
people, but is, instead, concerned only 
with increasing its authority over them 
and with subverting the governments of 
her sister nations in the Western Hemi-
sphere. 
It is no longer necessary to document 
in detail the charges of Communist sub-
version in Latin America emanating 
from Cuba. Those facts have been doc-
umented time and time again by a num-
ber of unimpeachable sources, such as 
the Organization of American States, 
the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
Preparedness Investigating Subcommit-
tee of the Senate Committee on Armed 
Services, and many others. In fact, ac-
cording to the May 24, 1965, edition of 
U.S. News & World Report, Communist 
terrorist activity is now being conducted 
in 12 of the 20 independent governments 
of Latin America. These nations are 
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, 
the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, 
Paraguay, and Venezuela. The fact that

nemy ower. In that context it is in the 
"gray t light," to use the first President 
Rooseve t's words.

AR EFFECTIVE AFFIAL 
There are those who -Mina , and perhaps 
rightly 0, that the President is making too 
many s ? eeches in his attempt to explain, de-
fend, a ? justify his policies in Vietnam. To 
some, t e personality image which emerges 
from t television screen is not appealing. 
In our opinion, however, his televised ad-
dress to1 the editorial cartooniats, in terms of 
content was effective. 
Mr. J hnsch began by saying again, with-
out any qualification, that we will not aban-
don ourl commitment to Sout.a Vietnam. It 
is desir ble to plant this firmly in the minds 
of the e emy. He also restated his readiness 
to enter into unconditional diecussions for a 
No. 91 3 
settlement of Le war. This, too, needs to be 
stamped inde bly upon the consciousness of 
friend and fo alike. 
Most 1mpre4sIvs, however, was the Presi-
dent's enume teal of the material Improve-
ments which avc been made since 1954 in 
South Vietnaaa under what he correctly de-
scribed as "c cur 'stances of staggering ad-
versity." 
Mr. Johnsoxi spelled them out in this fash-
ion: In South, Vietnam, always the rice bowl 
of Asia, rice pioduation has been doubled. A 
new variety ot sweetpotato has been intro-
duced, promis ng .e sixfold yield. Corn out-
put should ri e from 25,000 tons in 1962 to 
100,000 tons y :966. Pig production has 
more than doiblezt since 1955. 
6 million 
In South Viill are 200 doctors for 1tnarn, where life expectancy is 
35 years, the  
people. In the United States there are 5,000 
doctors for an eouivalent number. So we 
are helping tea build a medical school which 
will graduate 200 South Vietnamese doctors 
each year. 'tree than 12,000 hamlet health 
stations have ere built and stocked. More 
than 7 million peaple have been vaccinated 
against cha and millions more against 
other disease.There has also been much 
public education. To 
cite but one llustration, elementary school 
progress in thr area of  
enrollment haf risen from 300,000 in 1955 to 
more than 1,500,000 today. And, on the 
business front a cauntry which was virtually 
without indusitry :2 years ago now has more 
than 700 new pr rehabilitated factories. And 
all of this wo k has gone on and will go on 
despite the costly, cruel war and the :-..erroris-
tic tactics of the Vietcong. 
This may not le especially impressive in 
rich, overfed lamer:lea. But as the message 
gets through, its import will not be lost 
upon millions of Psalms who are reared in ig-
norance, rack d by disease and whose lives 
1. 
are apent on he razor's edge of starvation. 
To them, the efeience to corn and pigs will 
not be a jok g .natter. 
The President aoncluded by saying that 
when peace final) y comes we are ready to. 
share this effort and this progress "with all 
the people of Viatnam?North and. South 
alike." This was an appropriate note to 
strike. One niust hope it is a note that will 
be heard in and.

L.B.J. Moms His CASE ELOQUENTLY 
President JOhnsan never has done a more 
persuasive jola on an issue than he did 
Thursday in his TV appearance to detail 
again the wilts a ad hows of United States 
policy in Viet am 
Some seem to think the President is mak-
ing these repented enunications of our pur-
pose in Vieti am because a few vociferous 
i 
professors an others keep ragging him on 
the subject. .B.J, isn't going to reverse this 
particular brand of nonthInking?but ad-
dresses such eis Taursday's can do a lot to 
solidify national understanding. 
Moreover, this r uts it up to the Commu-
nists once m e. They show no more sign 
of relenting than the college hecklers. But 
there are othar people in the world who do 
have open miricis. 
Our policy, the ray Mr. Johnson stated it 
Thursday, is positive, not merely defensive. 
Our preferrtd rriority is on helping the 
South Vietnamese (and others in southeast 
Asia) to imprOve their lot. Since 1954, for 
Instance, rice procuction has been doubled, 
new crops intacdu fed, industrial production 
developed. Tilts ill would be much more 
meaningful, arSd ferther along, except for the 
Communists isho murder and pillage and 
force the Vietleamese and the United States 
to concentrate on military defense. 
Americans wouid much rather devote 
some of their resources to helping others 
with their economy and their standard of 
living. Our heavy expenditures on weapons 
are not by choice, but through necessity. 
All the same, the President is still willing 
to sit down and talk it out. 
The North Vietnamese obviously are hard 
to convince. Probably bemuse for so many 
of the years this war has been going on they 
have been getting off easy, giving them the 
idea the United States was merely a "paper 
tiger" and that eventually they could over-
whelm the South Vietnamese. 
The President's purpose is to disabuse them 
of both notions?meanwhile being ready to 
negotiate and even readier to get on with 
peaceful ways to better life in southeast 
Asia, a program which would be far more 
useful to us and to the Asians than fighting. 
There is nothing new or strange in this 
double-edged policy. This is what we did 
during and after World War II. We Went all 
out to win and when the military job was 
finished we turned an enormous share of 
our effort and resources toward peaceful 
development around the world. 
PROPOSED CUT IN SOIL CONSERVA-
.TION SERVICE APPROPRIATIONS 
UNWISE 
Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, in the 
April issue of American Forests maga-
zine there is an editorial which I wish to 
bring to the attention of the Senate. 
The editorial, entitled "Budget's `Bomb-
shell,' "is in opposition to the $20 million 
proposed cut in the appropriations for 
the Soil Conservation Service. 
I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
torial be printed in the RECORD. 
There being. no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
BUDGET'S "BOMBSHELL" 
The Bureau of the Budget has not shown 
good judgment in cutting the technical as-
sistance program of the Soil Conservation 
Service by $20 million. Hearings should be 
calledto give the conservation public an op-
portunity to be heard on a proposal that 
would impede the forward advance of an old 
line and fundamental conservation program 
If allowed to stand. The proposal should 
be defeated and, in the not of recent devel-
opments, more technical assistance provided 
for. At a time when new conservatio:n pro-
posals are being heard retarding beautifica-
tion of America great care must be taken to 
see to it that basic programs are not dam-
aged in the process. 
There are reasons galore: why this cut is 
unwise at this particular time. With new 
dust storms billowing up in the West this 
is obviously no time to cut back on the 
never-ending task of anchoring soil in place. 
As this magazine has pointed out on more 
than one occasion many western acres are 
in a deplorable condition and need help. 
While recent efforts by a variety of hard-hit-
ting agencies are hopeful signs, this task of 
land stabilization has to be an across-the-
board effort and the Soil Conservation Serv-
ice program is a basic part of that effort. 
A consistent conservation posture on the 
part of the administratio:a is most i.mpor-
tant. When an impartial study group re-
cently informed the administration that 
Negro farmers are getting the short end of 
the stick on agricultural aid efforts and that 
something should be done about it, the ad-
ministration immediately concurred. Some-
thing certainly should be done, but a pro-
posal to lop off $20 million from the techni-
cal aid program would not appear to be con-

much of the suppbrt, for that Communist 
-terrorist activity ConieS directly from 
Cuba has been proven time and again. 
As recently as 2 days ago, Fidel Castro 
was bragging of Cuba's power in this 
regard. Tn a broadcast address at the 
graduation ceremonies at Cuba's military 
academy, Castro said: 
Cuba is now a bogey Mal for the United 
States. They don't despise Cuba any more; 
on the contrary, Cuba now inspires in them 
'respect and fear. 
These remarks were directed specifi-
cally at the recent U.S. involvement in 
the Dominican- Republic situation, and 
clearly indicate the Castro attitude to-
ward the achievement of peace and sta-
bility in this hemisphere. 
In the past, we have been told, that 
communism in Cuba does not present a 
real danger to the United States, but is, 
rather, a distasteful nuisance which we 
must simply accept. The history of sub-
version and unrest created in other 
Latin American countries by Castro-
trained agents has repeated refuted this 
argument. Little has been said, how-
ever, of subversive activitieson the part 
of the same agents within the United 
States itself. Now the veil on this topic 
seems to be lifted: The American Se-
curity Council has just published the first 
part of a two-part Series on Castro's sub-
version in the United States. This study 
- discusses the methods of infiltration, the 
activities,' the scope of the Communist 
effort, and the successes and failures of 
the operation to 'date. In order that this 
excellent report may be read by all Sen-
ators, I request unanimous consent that 
it be printed in the RECORD at this point 
in my reMarks. 
There being no objection, the report 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
ciAsrRo's SUBVERSION IN THE UNITED STATES?
PART I 
British historian and philosopher, Arnold 
rroynbee, before giving a lecture at the State 
Department on April 16, 1965, was quoted as 
saying: "It's hard to understand why you 
make such a fuss about Castro." And then 
comparing the United States and Cuba to 
an elephant and a Mouse, he quipped, "Ws 
great fun for the mouse." 
Just a week previous to these comments, 
a CIA report on Cuban subversion was sub-
mitted to the House Subcommittee on Inter-
American Affairs (Selden committee). The 
report stated in part that "the Castro regime 
lute in operation (since 1961) a highly pro-
fessional espionage and subversion agencY, 
the General Directorate of Intelligence 
(DGI). The DGI is advised by at least five 
Soviet intelligence specialists. Moreover, one 
of the purposes of the highly secret meetings 
of Latin American leaders in Havana last 
November was to give added impetus to more 
militant Communist activity in the hemi-
sphere" (WR 65-9). 
Castro's DOI is divided into three units, 
the largest of which masterminds the train-
ing, financing and promoting of subversion, 
and, guerrilla warfare in Central and South 
American countries', Though the CIA report 
spelled out in detail the degree of the DGI's 
activities in these areas, it made no mention 
efforts in tbeUnited States. Our own 
irkvestigation attempts in some measure to 
all the ga'p. 
Dd*Lrn-xops OF INFTLkrTRATION 
There are tWo known major points of en-
try by which covert Castro agents Infiltrate 
into the 'United States, One is by fishing 
boat to l'inerto Rico, and then by illegally 
entering the United States with falsified 
documents. Congressman WILLIAM CRAMER, 
Republican, of Florida, in testifying before 
the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Se-
curity as far back as 2 years ago, said that 
"in excess of 1,000 people have come through 
this route into the United States as Puerto 
Rican citizens with falsified passports." 
The other method of infiltration is by boat 
or plane to Mexico. There the Mexican Com-
munist Party supplies the proper papers and 
the agent crosses the border at Laredo, 
Juarez, or Tijuana. Infiltrators from Cuba 
who enter the United States using either 
one of these routes, or via Canada, masking 
their identities by whatever manner, are 
trained agents whose assignments cover the 
Marxian spectrum of subversive activities. 
INDICATION OF ACTIVITIES 
On the night of November 16, 1962, the 
FBI raided a workshop on West 27th Street 
in New York City. There they seized a 
secret cache of weapons and explosives which 
included delayed action incendiary bombs. 
They also arrested three Castro agents and 
Roberto Santiesteban Casanova, a newly ar-
rived attache to the Cuban Mission at the 
U.N. Two other members of the Cuban 
Mission, Jose Gomez Abad and his wife, Elsa, 
were named as fellow conspirators. 
The purpose of the weapons and the ex-
plosives was "for the sabotaging of defense 
Installations and the demoralization of the 
civilian population." Attorney General 
Robert Kennedy said the plan was "aimed 
at the heart of the internal security of the 
United States of America." 
Four days later, immigration officers in 
Brownsville, Tex., reported that Mexican 
authorities had prevented the blowing up 
of the International Bridge between Browns-
ville and Matamoros, Mexico. In doing so, 
they also nipped in the bud a sabotage plan 
to destroy major buildings in Matamoros. 
Two of these apprehended were Castro 
agents. 
Since 1962, there have been several allied 
cases, one taking place in October, 1964, in 
which a . bomb was exploded in the Ever-
glades Hotel in Miami injuring a number of 
Cuban exiles attending a meeting. 
Some . months later, a Cuban-terrorist 
threat to bomb the Roney Plaza Hotel in 
Miami intimidated the management into 
cancelling a meeting of this same exile 
organization. 
This threat came on the same day the 
the bomb plot to blow up the Washing-
ton Monument, the Statue of Liberty and 
the Liberty Bell was discovered. 
On the surface, this latter episode ap-
peared to be the wild act of a quartet of 
misguided idiots. But there is sound reason 
to believe that wild as the attempt was, the 
four would-be saboteurs were acting under 
DGI instructions. Leader of the bomb plot, 
Robert S. Collier, had traveled illegally to 
Cuba in the summer of 1964. Upon his 
return, he formed with a number of fellow 
Cuban travelers a pro-Castro, pro-Peking 
group which called itself the Black Libera-
tion Front. In December, 1964, a United 
Nations party was given by the Cuban dele-
gation in honor of its visiting guerrilla ex-
pert, Ernesto Che Guevara. At this party, 
Collier was introduced to Michelle Duclos, 
member of an extremist separatist organ-
ization in Quebec. Later, the plotters bought 
the dynamite in Canada and it was Miss 
Duclos who transported the explosives to 
New York in her car. 
These five incidents fall under the head-
-Mg of terror tactics. That only one of ,them 
met with any real degree of success speaks 
well for the FBI and our law enforcement 
agencies. However, FBI Director J. Edgar 
?Hoover, pointed out in testimony before the 
House Subcommittee on Appropriations last 
year that the efforts of the Castro regime to 
infiltrate intelligence agents into the United 
States' "show' that we (FSI) must maintain 
a broad coverage in this area of our opera-
tions." 
How broad a coverage can be glimpsed by 
these additional incidents. In early 1963, a 
Castro agent was apprehended in a New York 
City apartment possessing a suitcase filled 
with visa applications and other documents 
which would aid fellow agents to gain illegal 
entry into the United States. 
From Caracas, Venezuela, in February of 
this year came news of another type of 
smuggling operation which again pointed to-
ward the activities of U.S.-based Castro 
agents. By accident, on board the U.S.S. 
Santa Rosa were found 1,000 mail pouches 
filled with pro-Castro literature. The litera-
ture had been printed in and shipped from 
Miami, Fla. 
Just as Puerto Rico has served as an im-
portant way station for Castro agents to en-
ter the United States, it has also served as a 
transit point for still another sort of smug-
gling?that of narcotic drugs. 
In December 1964 three Castro agents were 
arrested at Miami Airport?one of them a 
Cuban, Mario Carabeo Nerey. Treasury offi-
cials in Puerto Rico said Ce,rabeo Nerey was 
engaged in drug traffic. How large the traffic 
is can be measured by the fact that between 
January and November 1964, narcotics agents 
seized 697 pounds of drugs being smuggled 
into the United States from Cuba. This was 
an increase of over 450 pounds seized during 
the previous year. Included in this amount 
was heroin, shipped to Cuba from Red China. 
In January 1965, a New York police in-
spector, Ira Bluth, was quoted as saying: 
"Marihuana used to come to New York almost 
entirely from Mexico, but recently large 
amounts of the drug have been discOvered 
coming from Cuba." 
On January 15, 1965, Oscar H. Reguera and 
Elidoro Martinez were taken into custody in 
a New York motel with $3 million worth of 
cocaine in their luggage. Martinez is be-
lieved to be a Castro agent. 
Aside from the obvious harmful effects 
addiction to these drugs creates, the major 
purpose behind the smuggling of narcotics 
into the United States by Castro agents is to 
raise money to finance an insurrection in 
Puerto Rico. 
Castro's DGI is working in concert with 
Puerto Rican Communists and miliant 
splinter factions of the Puerto Rican in-
dependence movement, accelerating their at-
tacks against the social and governmental 
structure of the island. Since 1961, a num-
ber of Castro-supplied arms caches have been 
uncovered. Gun battles have been fought 
between the police and insurrectionists, and 
Castro agents have infiltrated both exile and 
student groups, their purpose to stimulate 
the kind of rioting which would require 
armed intervention. Should this happen, 
the cry for independence, which 97 percent 
of the Puerto Rican electorate rejected in the 
November 1964 elections, would take on a 
more critical meaning. This is so because 
the strategy of the movement is tied di-
rectly to the November 20, 1964 vote of the 
United Nations Committee on Anticolonial-
ism. The Committee voted 17-6, in direct 
violation of a 1963 General Assembly ruling, 
to place the demand for Puerto Rican inde-
pendence on the U.N. agenda (WR 65-4). 
This act played directly into the hands of 
Castro's DGI and Puerto Rican extremists?. 
two of whom are presently members of the 
Cuban U.N. mission. 
When the General Assembly convenes 
again, there is little doubt that agitation 
and propaganda will be stepped up in New 
York and San Juan, with the possibility of 
more violent actions erupting in Puerto Rico. 
SCOPE OF THE EFFORT 
Recently, the Puerto Rican newspaper El 
Mundo estimated that since 1960, 12,000 
Americans and Puerto Ricans have received 
subversive training in Cuba.

ch sen to ignore them completely. This 
Is i ost unfortunate, ,for the simple fact 
Is that the longer WE procrastinate in

pe i ple and their elected Representatives. 
T s action is, at best, only a stopgap

of reedom in the Dominican Republic, 
an in itself will have little effect upon

he need still exists and grows more

we have shown a willingness to prevent 
the establishment of a second revolu-
tioary Communist government in Latin 
Am rico,. These are positive steps. Now

the United States. I ask unanimous

There: benig no objection, the article

Wuxi MG ST THE TAXPAYER SUBSIDIZE 
IMMORALITY? 
; (Br Juanita Kidd Stout) 
During the years I have been a. judge in the 
Philadelphia County Court, I have learned 
a great deal a bout people on relief and about 
the people who hand out their checks. Fre-
quently ! have been outraged by both. 
Last y ar there appeared before our court 
a child oi 13 years who shortly was to be de-
livered o(f a baby fathered by her uncle. 
For at least 13 years her family had been on 
relief?wIth f succession of men fathering a 
successiori of children. The gul's 14-year-
old sister; hac produced an illegitimate baby 
at ?13; anothcr older sister had borne an il-
legitima4 ch: Id at 14. 
But ndthing had been done by welfare 
workers to t sire these girls, their brothers 
and sisters farm their depraved home. In 
fact, oneicastworker had filed a written re-
port with: the court stating that the mother 
was providing a "fairly adequate home" for 
her sevenchildren. 
On En:lithe' occasion, a young man was 
brought before me on a charge of not sup-
porting the child he had sired iout of wed-
lock?nor' was he contributing anything to 
the support cf his own wife's five children. 
He had not aeld a steady job in 10 years 
and had bees on and off the relief rolls._ I 
asked hisicasoworker if anyone had insisted 
that this ,hea thy man find work. The an-
swer was, !It 13 not our Job to inast." 
I said, "This man has completed 11th 
grade. lie s neither stupid nor inca-
pacitated In the last 10 years a great deal 
of grass has grown, a good many snows have 
fallen. Has r.o one directed him to a lawn 
mower, a 'now shovel?" 
The caseworker said no. 
I then told the young man that if he failed 
to get a jnb in 2 weeks, or to prove that he 
had tried ;to gst work by visiting 25 places of 
potential employment, he was going to jail. 
Four days later he reported back. He had a 
Job. 
In anotper -:ase, a man brought before my 
court on the charge of falling to support 
three illegitimate children told me he had 
been "pertnitt rd" by a relief worker to set up 
a househdld with another woman. I didn't 
believe hiln, but investigation proved he was 
telling thd tru.th. 
The map wiz a part-time chauffeur and a 
partial relief recipient. Both women in-
volved wive receiving grants. When I called 
on the caeewc rkers of the man's two para-
mours for testimony, I learned that they in-
deed had knowledge of the situation. Not 
only that, buil a supplementary grant had 
been approved for paramour No. 2, reimburs-
ing her f In "household money" she 
Approved For Releas 
had used as bail to retrieve her lover from 
behind bars. 
This shocks my conscience?moral as well 
as financial. 
The tragedy of relief is that it takes away 
from people the drive to work. When a per-
son is capable of earning only $45 a week, he 
may be all too willing to accept $45 from 
public assistance for doing nothing. I have 
the deepest sympathy for the good mother 
struggling to bring up her children on a wel-
fare grant, and for the father who wants but 
cannot rand work. 13ut I deplore a system 
that regards the handling out of checks as 
its prime function, that subsidizes the lazy 
and immoral home with the taxpayer's 
dollar. 
Teenage boys have appeared before me on 
charges of delinquency, and I have asked 
them what their fathers did for a living. 
Their answer: "We get a check from -the 
State." 
I get a check from the Government, too. 
But there is one big difference; I work for 
mine. Too many youngsters in welfare-sup-
ported families never learn the value, the 
joy, the necessity of work?seeing, as they 
do, their fathers lying in bed until 10 in the 
morning, and hearttg the family finances 
discussed only in terms of "waiting until the 
check comes in." 
Many social workers contend that the pur-
pose of welfare is to keep families together. 
In my opinion, a good institutional home 
would be far better for the growth and de-
velopment of children than an u:nfit private 
home where a child sees promiscuity, crime 
and vice, where the welfare check is used 
lor everything but the child's support. 
It is my suggestion that we provide dormi-
tory facilities for these pitiful children, espe-
cially in the urban areas where the need is 
most, acute, and that the public-assistance 
law be amended to :provide grants for the 
children's support during the period of 
dormitory living. ? There our deprived 
youngsters would get. the benefit of the tax-
payer's dollar. They could be supervised in 
their studies and recreation. From there 
they could attend local schools. Each would 
have a clean bed, a warm meal and a light 
to read by?things niany of them have never 
known. In the end, such a plan probably 
would be less expensive than our present 
system--or lack of system. 
Social workers object to institutional care 
"because youngsters need mother love." 
They should sit in court with me and hear, 
day after day, the stories of some of that 
_ love: no genuine affection, no supervision, 
no conversation?nothing but a succession 
of "boarder" men. 
There might be less need for special facili-
ties if more of those involved in administer-
ing relief programs were concerned with 
seeing that a child has a decent upbringing. 
Certainly, welfare workers have heavy case-
loads. But no achievement of substance 
comes easily, and the result of the extra 
effort can be inspiring, especially when you 
are dealing with human lives. 
A few years ago five young girls involved 
in the slashing of another youngster in 
school were brought before me on a charge 
Of delinquency. Some were from homes-sup-
ported by welfare grants. None had had 
any previous contacts with the court. I 
decided on an experiment: I made each write 
an essay on the meaning of being a lady; 
each was told that she must volunteer 100 
hours of work in a hospital, a library or a 
home for the aged. And each must make a 
proper skirt, not tight and short like those 
they had worn in court. 
These girls did not only everything the 
court assigned--but more. They learned the 
Joy of work and of doing for others. They 
kept corning back even after I had released 
them from probation, and continually asked 
me: "What can we do next, Judge Stout?" 
None has been in trouble since. Two are now

Of California Agricultural Employment, re-

iraraetllately in the Stockton, Salinas, and

Meeting' of Mendocino Pomona Grange it was 
reported that at Oxnard they had rounded 
Up 500 fellows to pick lemons starting on a 
Monday, and by Saturday they had? only 17

ladders to pick lei/Ions, so the lemons will be

dled by loving hands, since a machine does 
not know if a pea pod has anything inside, 
or if strawberries are red or green. 
"Under such conditions of having no man-
ual workers to do our planting and harvest-
ing of agricultural products, the farmers 
will have no choice but to go into other 
fields, such as raising cows or sheep or cot-
ton. Then the fruit and vegetable stands 
and canned goods shelves will have a very 
sickly appearance, and prices will be two 
or three times higher, and our incomes or 
social security checks won't be any bigger. 
In a couple of months or less the strawberries 
will be nice and ripe, and with no one to 
pick them and bring them to our stores 
strawberry shortcake will be, past history. 
"We know that Mexico permits big Ameri-
can capital and many, many thousands of 
Americans to work and do big business in 
Mexico, especially in the line of gas and oil 
for our cars, so if Mexico permits Americans 
to do busines and work there why cannot 
America permit temporary Mexican workers 
to come over and harvest our products 
(which we won't do for ourselves), in order 
to keep our bay windows up in good shape? 
Suppose the Mexican Government retaliated 
by saying: 'If you don't want us in your 
country, we don't want you in ours; pack up 
and go home.' Mexico is not going to say 
'Pack up and go home.' On the contrary, at 
present as in the past, Mexico encourages 
with open arms foreign industries to come 
in, and they accord any privileges and facili-
ties possible, as we already know quite well. 
We have read that in 1963 we imported 242 
million pounds of tomatoes from Mexico, and 
this year our farmers are having difficulty 
borrowing any money from banks for tomato' 
planting, because of the uncertainty of har-
vesting. 
"It is interesting to notice that our Secre-
tary of Agriculture does not seem to have 
made a peep concerning the situation. Does 
he not have jurisdiction? 
"We should all write to our Representa-
tives in Washington and the Secretaries of 
Labor and Agriculture." 
We earnestly urge that you do all possible 
to help California avoid the disaster which 
may result from failure to plant and har-
vest the crops which her people, and in-
deed the peoples of the Nation and of the 
world, have come to expect.

Today, more than 20,000 crates of straw-
berries will be added to those already rotting 
on the plants in our fields. Continual 
daily losses building to 40,000 crates per day 
this time next week are anticipated if we 
are uhable to pick. Translated to market 
value using combination fresh and freezer 
prices on last year's market prices at least 
$50,000 per day loss. It is clearly and abun-
dantly evident insufficient numbers of do-
mestic workers available for strawberry har-
vest and cultural practices. Today, our needs 
are for an additional 2,000 workers and by the 
middle of next week an additional 1,500 re-
quired. This company has met all items of 
criteria for becoming eligible for supple-
mental foreign labor and certified for 
workers, however no help other than 200 
plus Japanese and Filipino nationals yet. 
Further documentation of losses to be devel-
oped by Agricultural Extension Service, Uni-

Shadow of Cuba 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN M. MURPHY 
OF NEW YORIC 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 1965 
Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, under leave to extend my 
remarks in the RECORD, I want to call to 
the attention of my colleagues the out-
standing editorial on American action in 
the Dominican Republic by the renowned 
writer, Max Lerner. This article ap-
peared in the New York Post of May 3, 
1965. I concur completely in Mr. 
Lerner's remarks and hope that other 
editorialists speak out as forthrightly as 
he has. 
[From the New York Post, May 3, 1965] 
SHADOW or CUBA 
(By Max Lehner) 
A friend of mine, who knows Latin America 
better than I do, says it will be a long, hot 
summer in the Caribbean. Certainly what 
has happened in Santo Domingo, turning a 
lovely city into a charnel house, suggests 
that there are volcanic political passions in 
the area. The bloodshed wears the aspect not 
only of a rebellion but of a civil war, with 
longstanding hatreds coming into play and 
old accounts being settled. 
In this jungle of passions, anti-American 
hatreds emerged very early in the rebellion. 
President Johnson had to act swiftly to get 
American civilians out. But most political 
decisions have plural, not single, motives. 
Having entered the Dominican Republic to 
save lives, the American troops have stayed 
to prevent anarchy, seal off the chances of a 
Communist takeover, and await the begin-
nings of a new frame of political order. 
One's first impulse is to say that this was 
a monstrous blunder, awakening long muted 
memories of marine landings and gunboat 
diplomacy, and feeding the Castro image of 
American imperialism. Yet one cannot stop 
there, without raising a haunting question: 
What was the alternative for President John-
son? Was it to appeal to the OAS? There 
would be days and days before any practical 
action; and if the revolt did indeed contain, 
as a second-stage effect, the design for a 
Communist takeover, the OAS action would 
have come far too late. Or was the alterna-
tive simply to stay out, or to get out again 
immediately after the first evacuation of 
Americans, and let events take their course? 
It isn't enough to point out in a holier-
than-they way what must have been obvious 
enough to Johnson, Rusk, Bundy and Tom 
Mann?that the decision was a dangerous 
one. But was there any alternative that 
would have been any less dangerous? Run-
ning a country isn't a question of making 
choices between the beautiful decisions and 
the damned ones. It is often an impossible 
choice between a blind alley and a somewhat 
less blind one, and a President is lucky, even 
as he enters a dark tunnel, that he can see 
a thin shaft of light at the far end. 
The whole decision in the Dominican oper-
ation, as it transpired in the minds of the 
President and his advisers, was made in the 
shadow of Cuba. It is easy to say that the 
shadow shouldn't have been there?but it 
was. Too much blood has been spilt in Cuba, 
too many lives have been blasted there, too 
much heartbreak and frustration and re-
morse have been felt in Washington to leave 
the slate blank. 
The pro-Bosch leaders now say that the 
Communist elements in the revolt are not 
many, and that the irresponsible ones got

Reinstatement of the Bracer? Program 
? Urged 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DON H. CLAUSEN 
OP CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 1965 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
much has been said lately about the 
bracer() program---proponents of its 
abolishment have ? advanced beautiful 
arguments that we have a plentiful do-
mestic labor force to do the work cif the 
bracero; that the fresh fruit and vege-
table growers would be well served; that 
the Nation's welfare would be enhanced 
by the utilization of this domestic labor. 
We are now confronted with not the 
fine-sounding logic?but with the grim 
reality. I hope every Member of Congress 
will read the following communications, 
describing In real terms the already dev-
astating effects of the ill-advised action 
to abolish the bracer() program. I think 
it is incumbent upon all Members of Con-
gress to seriously consider the reinstate-
ment of the bracer? program?vital not 
only to the grower, the canner, and the 
trucker, but to the economy of our entire 
Nation. 
The communications follow:

Washington, D.C. 
. DEAR ME. CLAUSEN: At .their regular meet-
ing on April 25, 1965, members of Mendo-
dno County Pomona Orange No. 10 heard 
the reading of the following, which M based 
on a report originally presented at a meeting 
of Little Lake Grange No. 670, Willits, Calif., 
by a member of its committee on agriculture. 
The members voted to send the report to 
several persons, and this copy is for you. 
"Pertaining to agriculture in the State of 
California, it appears that we have a, major 
problem, the seriousness of which a good 
proportion of our population does not fully 
realize. This problem exists because of the 
abolishment of Public Law 78, preventing 
Mexican nationals from coming into Califor-
nia to work at harvesting our farm products, 
as most Americans are unwilling to go to 
the fields and work under the scorching sun 
for $1.25 an hour. 
"According to the Santa Rosa Press Demo-
crat for March 28, our honorable Secretary

out of control. Maybe so. Certainly Bosch 
himself is a decent committed democrat with 
a small d, even if he is an ineffectual political 
leader. Bit after ,the Castro eXperience 
should one have expected President Johnson 
to take a course of ,action?or nonaction?
that might well haveled to a second Cuba off 
American 'calor& 'For hiro,,tO have 42rie so 
would not only have been out of character 
and out of philosophy: it would also have 
run counter to the land of President most of , 
the American people think he is, and the 
kind of belief they have in him. 
Well then, once the American troops came 
in, why has President Johnson piled up more 
and more thousandS of them? Isn't each 
detachment' he sends 4 further slap at the 
'Latin American Self-hnage? Here again one 
must go back to Cuban-American history, 
this time to the-Bay of Pigs. The shadow of 
the Bay of Pigs fiasco hangs even more 
heavily over Washington than the shadow of 
Castro's persistence in power. If the Bay of 
Pigs invasion was a mistake then?as every-
one now 6.grees?the failure to carry it 
through in full force compounded the mis-
take many times over. That was in Ken-
nedy's mind when he had to make a decision 
on the Russian missiles in Cuba. It will be 
in the mind of every President for some years 
to come. If history is lights and shadows, 
It is mostly shadows. 
Of course, there has been an outcry from 
the Latin neighbors and partners of the 
United States. If I Were a Brazilian, a 
Mexican, a Chilean, I should probably be 
joining in the outcry. Vet if I asked myself 
What alternative there was, I should have no 
answer._ I suspect strongly that, however 
great the outcry has been, it would have been 
dim and pale alongside the withering con-
tempt of the Latin American leaders if the 
United States had done nothing, if its citi-
zens had been killed, and if the revolt had 
led to another Castro regime?or a Castro-
oriented one?in Santo Domingo. 
? The satisfying 'fact is that the OAS politi-
cal presence has been enabled to estanlish 
Itself alongside the U.S. military presence. 
There are dead to be 'buried, wounds to be 
bound up, food to be distributed, the routines 
of life to be restored. A new leadership will 
in time be found, and with heavy economic 
aid it will be able to make a new beginning 
of order. Whatever may be said against the 
Americans, they will not stay any longer 
than the minimal nerd fi.:tr them. They will 
get out. That would not have been true of 
the Castroites, if they had been given a 
chance to turn the rebellion into a class 
dictatorship.

Mr. pErax. Mr. Speaker, it was 17 
Years ago that the Union Jack was low-
ered over Palestine, marking the end of 
British rule over that area. 
May 14, 1948, saw the emergence of a 
new Ilati(V, the State of Israel. This is 
a nation vhic:ti has created an example, 
of what a _people can do when given the 
right of self-determination; she is a 
model of democracy in action. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago this 
dream of almost 1,900 years became a 
reality as the blue and white flag ,with 
the Star of David took its rightful place 
among the banners of the free world. 
It has not been easy for the people of 
Israel these last 17 years, as it has not 
been for the last 1,900 years, because 
hostile neighbors have attempted to 
drive the Jewish people out of Israel. 
Eut this gallant nation has stood stead-
fast and grown strong and self-reliant. 
I join with my colleagues and say

Chicago Sun-Times Editor Retires 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DONALD RUMSFELD 
OF mirrors 
IN Tlig HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 1965 
Mr. RTJMSFELD. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to pay particular honor and recognition 
today to a distinguished and truly out-
standing Chicago newspaperman, Mr. 
Milburn P. Akers, who is retiring after 
a quarter century of service with the 
Chicago Sun-Times. Throughout his 
career, Mr. Akers has made extraordi-
nary contributions to his community, 
State, and the Nation. 
Readers of his columns and editorials 
will long remember his discerning re-
porting on national and world affairs, as 
-well as his public spirit and dedication to 
the causes of good government and edu-
cation. A Chicago Sun-Times article, 
which follows, highlights Mr. Akers' ca-
reer and pays due respect to his leader-
ship: 
AKERS To RETIRE AS SUN-TIMES EDITOR 
, (By Donald M. Schwartz) 
Milburn P. Akers announced his retirement 
Saturday as editor of the Chicago Sun-Times 
after a quarter of century of service with 
this newspaper. 
Akers, who reached the retirement age of 
65 earlier this month, will step down as edi-
tor on Monday, June 7. 
In accepting Akers' resignation, Marshall 
Field, publisher of the ,Sun-Times, praised 
Akers' many contributions to the paper. 
"All the years of my working newspaper 
life have been spent in close and pleasant 
association with Pete Akers," Field said. 
"His vigor,, professional knowledge, and 
journalistic integrity have been invaluable 
to me. 
."Much of what the Sun-Times has become 
Is a reflection of his leadership." And, as 
Akers discussed his retirement with a re-
porter, it was typical that he was at his type-
writer composing one of his columns on cur-
rent affairs. 
(The column will continue to appear once 
a week in the Sunday Sun-Times even after 
Akers' retirement.) 
LIKE A MUSICIAN 
'Now and again he would dash off a few 
sentences or perhaps only a few words, then 
pause and ponder, taking a drag on a cig-
arette hardly noticing it in his fingers 'or at 
his lips. 
Then he would start up again at the ma-
chine with only a few of his fingers doing 
the work?they skipped about' easily a 
bouncy, jaunty fashion that may oldtime 
newspapermen use. It was more like a 
musician playing an instrument than a 
skilled typist operating a machine. 
"Best one-fingered typist in the country," 
42375 
Akers threw out in an aside that disturbed 
his attention to the growing column as little 
as the drag on the cigarette. 
Pete Akers had been doing that for a long 
time-42 years?in a career that began as a 
cub reporter on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
in 1923. From there, he went to the Illinois 
State Register in Sprinfleld; the Associated 
Press, for which he worked in Springfield, 
Chicago, and Washington, and finally to the 
old Sun and the Sun-Times, where he be-
came successively managing editor, executive 
editor, and editor. , 
Pete Akers had pounded on typewriters in 
countless newspaper offices and Western 
Union offices, in the Senate Press Gallery in 
Washington, in the statehouse in Spring-
fiejd, in small towns in southern Illinois, 
during the bloody days there when he worked 
for the P-D. He had roamed the broad cir-
cuit of a big-time newspaperman and writ-
ten of what he saw just as his great-grand-
father, Peter Akers, a Virginia planter's son 
who. became a Methodist minister, roamed 
the country from his birthplace to Kentucky, 
to Illinois, to Minnesota, telling of what he 
saw, and. how it could be improved. 
That was in the back of Pete Akers' mind 
too?how things could be improved?and it 
came out especially when he moved into posi-
tions of command in the newspaper business. 
It also is a major theme of the work he 
has done in government, education, and 
religion, much of it closely related to his 
newspaper career. 
Asked why he went to work for Illinois 
Got. Henry Horner as his publicity man in 
1936 (a job he held 3 years), Akers replied: 
"I just thought he was a high-grade, first-
class Governor who shouldn't be displaced." 
The Chicago Democratic machine had 
turned against the Democratic Governor and 
he faced a tough primary contest. 
A TOTAL COMMITMENT 
Perhaps Akers' commitment to improving 
things can be shown, as well as anywhere, 
in the job he did on the Sun-Times. Al-
though he himself balks at comparisons 
between his ministerial forebears and the 
moral, crusading tone of his newspaper 
career, a colleague on the Sun-Times notes 
that as boss of the paper he "operated almost 
as though it were a total commitment"?
like a dedicated preacher answering a call 
to a pulpit. 
Akers became managing editor of the 
Sun-Times and started converting it as fast 
as he could into a paper of stature, serious-
ness, and substance. "That was Mr. Field's 
desire," he observed. 
The new managing editor faced serious 
practical problems, some of which stemmed 
from the fact that he was trying to meld 
Into a single paper, with its own identity, 
two vastly different papers?the serious-
minded Sun and the tabloid Times, which 
had been merged shortly before he took over. 
"If you went either way," he recalled, 
"if you went to the old Sun or the old Times, 
you had the problem of losing part of your 
audience. So you had the problem of making 
the change very slowly so you didn't lose 
your audience." 
As it was, Akers later had the nerve-
wracking experience of losing large parts of 
his audience when the Sun-Times, a 24-
hour-a-day paper up to the mid-1950's 
started lopping off afternoon editions to be-
come solely a morning paper. 
"That was the toughest thing I ever had," 
he said. "I'd come down to work and find 
I'd lost 50,000 circulation and I was supposed 
to make it up the next day." 
, 
The changes came slowly and were many. 
In January 1950, the headline type was 
changed from Karnak to Vogue, a purely 
technical point it may seem, but it was 
movement from blocky, jarring, rather crude 
looking headlines, to a more modern and 
streamlined typeface. Moreover, said Akers

ers also 'introduced longer stories on 
seri us subjects, inchiding education and 
reli on, and permitted more interpretive re-
port rig in the paper, a technique which 
new paper editors often praise but frequently 
hay been reluctant to use, and this was 
espe tally true 15 years ago. 
A LINK TO HIS OIEMCAREER 
Trup with Akers' own career and his 
d 
turn toward interpretive reporting was 
link 
own style as a writer ar.d reporter. As a 
repo ter for the Associated Press, during a 
tim when it stressed a raechanIcal, almost 
in.hi4man objectivity, he had suffered under 
sucl restraints, which he later described in a 
spee h as "a rather sterile formtila known 
as Objective reporting." At the Sun-Times 
he sought out intelligent reporters and gave 
them a little more elbowroom to tell what 
-was going on instead of merely serving as 
consleyor belts for disparate facts. 
E en the stylebook issaed during Akers' 
ten re as executive editor speaks of the 
cha ges he was bringing about. 
M :aewspaper stylebooks are dry, me-
cha ical things which deal mainly with con-
tractions of State names and what words 
to c pitalize. But the Akels stylebook, issued 
in 155, had a style of its own?a philosophy 
of riting?and a careful y articulated out-
look on such matters as good taste and 
fair ess. 
S1nultaneous rebuttal, for example, was 
one f the earmarks of the book and became 
so ir the newspaper. 
It was the time of McCarthyism and the 
exec tive editor, as he had then become, in-
sisted that those who were attacked, perhaps 
unf irly and inaccurately, should have a 
cha ce to reply, simultaneously, in the same 
story. 
IMPROVEMENT ON CON MIINITT LEVEL 
ere were many other changes large and 
snaalll, such as a special Sunday section to 
dea comprehensively with important topics, 
and in time these added np to a new reputa-
tioI for the tabloid that acted like a quality 
pa pr, a reputation that apread beyond Chi-
oag and caused a Saturday Review writer to 
dee are 11; the best paper in town. 
Btrt while Akers was improving the paper 
insi e he was also pursuing improvement 
out4lde, in the community. 
A close 'colleague on the paper in those 
day describes him as a 'crusading, Investi-
gatIve newspaperman." Gardon F,. Michelson, 
pr iden; of MacMurray College, Jacksonville, 
Ill.? with whom Akers has had much asso-
cia on, Said, "His whole journalistic career 
has beer. tinged with social justice." 
A ers at the Sun-Times instituted and pre-
sid d over many crusades, many investiga-
tio s?the disclosure that an alderman was 
sha Mg in legal fees paid on zoning varla-
tiosts obtained through the city council, 
stoi1les that forced a Democratic guberna-
torijal candidate to withdraw from the race, 
rev lations about the high coats of hauling 
surlus foods to schools in the State. 
Iot all the stories were major crusades or 
inv stigstions. There was also the time, in 
195), when Akers sent a reporter up to Wis-
con in to get the background on the late 
Se tor Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican, of 
Wi. oonsin, who was just beginning his rise 
as s Communist hunter. 
kers, the editor, from having known Mc-
Carithy when he was lacers, the reporter, 
th ght the Senator was far from being the 
ad 'rabbi, figure that some thought him to 
be nd he instructed a reporter to get the 
rest of the stoi y, which he printed in a series 
of articles; 
i IYIiSSIVE KNOWLEDGE 
The reporter recalls that, in addition to the 
importance of the subject matter and how 
much it preceded most assessments of Mc-
Carthy, the assignment also illustrated two 
facets of Alters as a newsman, 
First, he had encountered McCarthy on 
one of hisimany political reporting journeys 
and had ;forraed a firsthand impression, 
something,inci; spensable to a good journalist. 
The reporter noted that this was part of 
Akers' "mtissivs knowledge of things"?from 
books, experience, from having been around 
a long tit 1:1 a lot of places and having 
his eyes op n? a characteristic emphasized by 
many who' hale known him. A writer who 
has sat in on c ditorial conferences with him 
has spoken of .titers' far-ranging mind. 
The seccind ioint about the McCarthy as-
signment, said the reporter, was that Akers 
did it with? at fooling around, without 
worrying dbou:, the paper's image. 
One of the most revealing of the Alters 
stories, for what it shows about the man, 
was the Mdretti case. 
i MO CETT/ CASE RECALLED 
Michael:Moretti was a 33-year-old police.. 
man assig ed to the State's attorney's office 
Who shot wo youths to death and wounded 
a third, br was not indicted when his case 
was first sought before the county grand 
jury. He , pleaded self-defense, but the 
wounded inan claimed that he killed in an 
unprovoked rage. 
Akers eltploied and the Sun-Times de-
manded a? reopening of the case, claiming 
a whitew4h by the States' attorney's office 
to protect ,one of its own. Moretti was sub-
sequently indiited and convicted of murder. 
Why wa;s Alters so Outraged by the case, 
into which he threw all his energy and ex-
pertise, all aviiilable resources on the paper 
and the peper's name itself? When he was 
asked that, he s aid: 
"That murder could be covered up; that 
murder colald le whitewashed. 
? "Here were a couple of human beings 
with no stetus in our society. 
"That they could be shot, killed, murdered, 
and whiteWashed by the people who did it." 
That was his answer, but under question-
ing he toot it i urther. 
"I have, saic; to young people in speeches 
many times tiat I believe in the American 
capitalistiS syatem and the American demo-
cratic sysem, and I am utterly opposed to 
corruption of either. 
"The only way we can retain these systems 
is to be ccintirmally on the alert to eradicate 
the abuse q of either, and there are abuses. 
"So whdn as snething like the Moretti case 
came along-- and the democratic system 
which is iupposed to dispense equal justice 
wasn't doing 1;o?this violated a basic belief 
of mine. If I didn't believe so much in the 
systems, 11 wouldn't get so violent about the 
abuses." , 
A colleague who worked closely with Akers 
on the Moretti story suggesed another, 
simpler elemeat?"the fact that young men 
were involved." One of the slain was only 15. 
"Pete ii sol about kids," the colleague 
remarked, an i the point linked up with 
something Air us himself sdid about another, 
current story that has moved him?South 
Vietnam. ' 
In 1964 he visited that war-brutalized 
country and since his return he has written 
about it ofter, in his Sun-Times column. 
Sometimes the column, on Vietnam, has 
not been Cool and analytical but outraged, as 
when he Wrote on February 22 that the Viet-
namese people were being "grour.d to pieces" 
while the United States held back from 
negotiations. 
DASCRISES VIETNAM INCIDENTS 
Akers described the other day what lay 
behind those i eelings. 
Approved For Release 
"I was down in the delta country in South 
Vietnam. Somewhere they'd killed a nest of 
Vietcong the night before. 
"Here was a bunch of little people heaped 
on the ground, in the position they had 
fallen, and died in. You turned them over 
and looked at them and most of them were 
little kids 16 or 17." 
Akers, of course, Las not always been 
struggling with such heartrending subjects 
as youths foully murdered in Chicago or 
youths heaped up dead. in South Vietnam. 
A familiar scene in his office at the Sun-
Times VMS to find hira chatting with staff 
members?really passing the time of day in 
smantown style while editors drifted in and 
out to consult with him. 
Akers, although he happened to :have been 
born in Cook County, was really from Jack-
sonville, where his father was a Methodist 
minister, the third in a line of Methodist 
ministers. 
He grew up amid a rural Illinois where his 
family had been for three generations before 
him; where he absorbed the atmosphere of 
the Lincoln country, the habit of thinking 
for himself, and a prejudice against being 
high flown. He also .Started an unending 
study of the State, in books and in person, 
and is known in his profession for an en-
cyclopedic knowledge of Illinois, down to 
little bits and pieces, obscure rivers and out 
of the way highway routes. . 
He is not a slick, modern man,. He is a 
bulky figure, often in rumpled clothes, with 
a massive head and small, pudgy hands. He 
looks like a man who might have been found 
in a small county cons thouse a generation or 
two ago. But he is deceptive; he can be very 
ranch up to date as he proved in transform-
ing the Sun-Times. 
He is a reader?not just one who reads 
books, occasionally or often, but one who is 
at home with books, relishes the books, re-
laxes with books. Reading is his hobby?
chiefly biography, history, politics. His 
mother and father, he says, were readers, his 
mother?Massachusetts born?having been 
among the first women graduates of Syracuse 
University and later a schoolteacher. 
EDUCATION A MAJOR INTEREST 
His interests outsid.e newspapering have 
run to education, and he is credited by one 
qualified source with having saved his alma 
meter, McKendree College, from extinction. 
Some Methodist Church officials thought it 
too costly to continue supporting. But Akers 
waged a successful battle to preserve it, and 
one small college official observed that now, 
what with the great air turn in enrollments, a 
college like McKendres, only 20 miles from 
populous St. Louis, can't fail. 
Michelson, president of MacMurray, said 
that Akers, at a trustee, and chairman of the 
school's development committee, has played 
a commanding role in MacMurray's recent 
expansion. 
. He is chiefly respOnsible, for one thing, for 
the founding of a men's college at the Mac-
Murray campus where there was previously 
only a girl's school. 
At both places, MacMurray and McKen-
dree, he was tending the deep roots put 
down in Illinois by his great-grandfather. 
Peter Akers was the principal founder of 
MacMurray and the first president of Mc-
Kendree. 
SCHOLARSHIPS SET UP 
After his retirement Akers will continue as 
the head of a statewide committee attempt-
ing to make the job of State superintendent 
of public instruction an appointive office?
an effort to take the Important position out 
of politics. 
The Sun-Times recognized this deep in-
volvement with education in an announce-
ment last week by Executive Editor Emmett 
Dedmon that three annual Chicago Sun-
Times college scholarships in honor of Mil-
burn P. Akers had been established.

than the tenants, and promote slums rather 
than decent housing. 
If the Commissioners can agree there's an 
"emergency"?and there is?perhaps they 
might try promoting some one- or two-block 
urban renewal projects?for public housing. 
It might not work, but it seems worth the at-
tempt. It'll take a while to get to the 
suburbs.

NEW GROU' TO PUSH Low Lwcoms Housum 
(By Benjamin Forgey) 
An informal District organization calling 
itself the Ad Hoc Committee on the Housing 
Crisis was formed last night to seek an in-
crease in low-income housing. 
Representatives of about 20 housing, civil 
rights, labor, political, welfare and church 
organizations endorsed the program, but left 
the exact nature of the new group in doubt 
as they returned to report to their own 
organizations. 
Harris Weinstein, chairman of the housing 
corntalttee of the Washington Planning and 
Housing Association, said he hoped action on 
some of the proposals would begin this week. 
The most "immediate and substantial 
need," Weinstein told the group, was to lobby 
Lor, be4Weclrcsitlential. We Of. the Anacostia-
!dolling and National Training School sites. 
Competing proposals for use of these tracts, 
the last large, available publicly owned sites 
In the District, are being discussed in 
Congress. 
The group also voted to urge the District 
Commissionerat to Use "whatever powers they 
now have" to nae repairs on slum prop-
erties and charge the repairs to landlords. 
According to the resolution, the Commis-
sioners. will also be asked to seek legislation 
preventing "retaliatory" evictions and rent 
increases. 
Also proposed was a "housing crisis week-
end" during which clergymen will focus their 
sermons on the need for low-income housing 
and a tour of the District's slums for inter-
ested Public officials. 
The meeting was the result of a vvPHA 
effort to "bring the housing needs of the 
District before the public," and was a follow-
up an initial session held last Thursday. 
k'OREIGN POLICY MISMANAGEMENT 
(Jr. DERWINSIa (at the request of 
Mr. DON H. CLauseN) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
pOint in the Rgcosn and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. pErmaNsKa. Mr. Speaker, the 
Oontinliecl deterioration of our conduct 
Of foreign affairs is seen in many parts 
of the werkl. However, the spineless 
handling of the Na,sser administration in 
Egypt certainly is fully indicative of for-
eign policy mismanagement. 
When are we going to wake up and 
realize that we are being taken for a 
ride? Egypt is doing a good job of mak-
ing a fool out of the United States. Less 
than a Month ago, Egypt's Nasser took a 
full advantage of American willingness 
to hand out free wheat. Now, we find 
out that the Agency for International 
Development gave Egypt over 23 million 
elellarS' worth of corn in 1961 on the 
basis of an out and out misrepresenta-
ly diStinguished colleague, the gen-
tleman from Minnesota [Mr. LANGEN], 
has called attention to the report of the 
Genera; Accounting Office that a ship-
ment of 186,000 metric tons of corn to 
Egypt under the auspices of AID was ob-
tained under false pretenses. The grant 
was made on the basis of reports from 
the Communist-sympathizing country of 
a potential famine because of a serious 
crop failure. It was later disclosed that 
no crop failure occurred and much of 
the corn had been sold by Egypt. 
The gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. 
Louigarr] further disclosed that AM of-
ficials found out Egypt was selling some 
of the corn even before the whole grant 
was shipped. With over $11 million 
worth still in the hands of U.S. officials, 
AID apparently made no attempt to hold 
the shipments until the matter could be 
Investigated. The GAO report charged 
that AID did not check on distribution of 
over 85 percent of the corn, and it has 
been substantiated that at least 80,000 
tons have been sold by the Egyptian 
Government. 
This report confirms what I have been 
saying for years. The administration 
will spend taxpayers' dollars to give aid 
to any country which stretches out its 
hand. I want to commend the General 
Accounting Office on its alertness. I hope 
this report opens some eyes in Washing-
ton. If it does not, it seems we will con-
tinue to help a country that openly de-
grades the United States and is critical 
of our policy. 
What is needed is action by the Con-
gress to insure that any future grants 
would be made only when It is assured 
that all the aid goes for the purpose for 
which it was intended. Apparently, the 
Agency for International Development 
does not do this now. 
As a member of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee which has been duti-
fully rubberstamping administration 
measures for years, I would hope that 
the committee would recognize its legis-
lative responsibilities and concentrate on 
Implementation of a foreign policy 
whereby we would reject the blackmail 
pressures from rulers such as Nasser. 
Nasser is using anti-Israel statements 
as a smokescreen for bis domestic fail-
ures, and there is no reason why we 
should prop up his administration, which 
Is carrying on an aggressive military ac-
tion against the legitimate government 
and people of Yemen.

MPL1ANCE ON SEPAIRE IS OFTEN 
LONG DELATR) 
landlord and tenant complain about 
k of a clear standard for enforcement. 
ndlord says different inspectors use 
t criteria for spotting violations, and 
ante; complain that the lack of qual-
trol permits landlords to use cheap 
mater als in repairs. The code specified only 
that "workmanlike" job be done. 
Nei hborhood workers attempting to help 
alum dwellers with their housing problems 
have been annoyed by the housing division's 
policy of allowing only landlords and tenants 
to se violations records. Mallon said he 
was caking an exception to his rule when 
repor -rs, after filling out detailed fOrms re-
quiri ? g both Mallon's and the Corporation 
COLA Ri'S signatures, were permitted to see 
the r cords. 
All he division's records are filed by street 
addre There is no central file listing vio-
lator by name. The inspectors become fa-
milia with habitual offenders, but there is 
no ea y way' to determine any owner's entire 
histo y of code violations. 
Bu mostly it is the long delays and the 
cons rat threat of retaliating evictions that 
frustf ate sit* dwellers seeking to get re-
pairs in their homes. And perhaps it is the 
dela s that have led to the suspicion by the 
teoa4its that inspectors can be bought off by 
land ords. 
One real estaie Iran said that yearn ago, 
owners and agents always provided the in-
spectors with generc us Christmas gifts. 
"We all used to d3 it," he said, "but, then 
one time an inspector came by to get his 
gift, and I saw' his car was packed full of 
whisky so I cut it out." 
The agent said le now occasionally will 
ask an inspector to .3ortie by one of his prop-
erties to advise 'Mir about repairs that will 
be necessary to meat the code. "I usually 
give them $5 or $10 for the favor," he said, 
"but I've only Clone this a couple of dozen 
times in the past 25 years." 
S. Tudor Strang deputy superintendent 
of the housing, div slon, said: "If we knew 
the point where slum landlords will leave 
the market and be replaced by people not 
interested in eXplo ting tenants. But step-
ped-up enforcner t as Mallon points out, 
would require bomIderably more inspectors. 
Several week a ago, District Commissioner 
Walter N. Tobriner suggested what he calls 
a "reformulation" of the code. He agrees 
with many slugn landlords?that the minor 
aspects of the code should not be empha-
sized. 
Tobriner fears that with strict enforce-
ment and lower pi ofits "the landlord, either 
evicts the tenants, rehabilitates the prop-
erty and rent* to high income groups, or 
evicts the tenants, razes the building and 
converts the land to some other use." 
"There is a dilemma," Tobriner said. 
Tough enforcement could have the unin-
tended effect Of reducing the housing supply 
rather than *proving housing conditions. 
Still other cpmpiaints about slum housing 
center on the Landlord and Tenant Court. 
Cases handled the re last year amounted to 
more than HMO and Chief Judge John Lewis 
Smith, Jr., estimates the figure will exceed 
100,060 this year. 
The proceedings in the court are summary, 
usually withotat extensive argument. More 
than 95 percent 31 the eases in the court 
deal with nonpe.yrnent of rent while most of 
the others ineolve housing code violations. 
In the nonpayment cases, Smith said, if 
the tenant a4nits having not paid the rent, 
the only judgmer t possible will be in favor 
of the landlord. The law does not give the 
tenant the right to withhold his rent be-
cause his landlon, has failed to make repairs 
or improvemants, Smith said. 
The wording of the law and the role of 
the judges in enforcing the law have led 
slum dweller, to complain that the court is 
merely a collection agency for landlords. 
Civil rights organizations and antipoverty 
officials in Was aington are now seeking 
changes in the la T, but Smith said that what-
ever reforms, are made must come through 
legislation or appelate court decisions, not 
from the Landlord and Tenant Court.

THE TARG4T, tivosTRATTON THE THEME AT 
Discussiorir 
(l8y George Lardner Jr.) 
Frustration was the theme. 
The city's Shot tage of low-cost housing was 
the target. ' The audience sounded aroused. 
But the meMbe :s of more than 23 housing 
organizations, civil rights groups, and pub-
lic agencies who gathered to try to "do some-
thing" about the housing crisis seemed to 
realize they'. we 'e punching futilely at the 
same old paper I3ag?full of exorbitant rents, 
dilapidated !homes, slumlords, and the bu-
reaucratic delays facing almost any attempt 
at improveMent 
"We seenci to be moving backwards," said 
Stephen J. Poilak, president-elect of the 
Washington Planning and Housing Associa-
tion which Called the meeting. . 
"A tent on the Mall would be an enor-
mous improvement for more people than I 
care to think of," said Barrie Weinstein, the. 
associatien's housing committee chairman. 
The District of Columna Coalition of 
Conscience has been trying to put up 
a tent for a family of 13?with two 
working mothers--who were evicted last 
month, but can't find new quarters. The 
emergency housing program the city loudly 
promised in May for predicaments like this 
may take another 3 months to get started, ac-
cording to city officials Who are not accus-
tomed to rushing. 
Forty-five real estate agents and nine pub-
lic and private agencies had been called, said 
Coalition Co-Chairman Walter E. Fauntroy, 
but none could come up with a single unit 
that the family could afford. 
The tent, of course, is a gimmick?but an 
appropriate one. As Mr. Fauntroy said, "we 
have to create pressure to effect the cures." 
One WPHA worker who helps families in 
the Cardozo area told of an eight-room house 
worth $17,600 that produces gross rentals of 
$600 a month for its owner. 
The worker, Torn Firor, also told of an-
other landlord who "for the 40th time in the 
last 6 months has evicted or threatened to 
evict families because they called the city's 
Housing Division" to get needed repairs 
ordered. 
Another WPHA worker, Belvie Rooks, 
broke into tears when she described how her 
organization had to pay 6300 a month in back 
rent to "one of the worst slumlords in the 
city" to save a mother of seven from evic-
tion from a house with broken-down plumb-
ing and inadequate beating. The family, 
Miss Rooks said, had been living there for 
3 years when the old ownee died. Suddenly, 
she said, the rent went up from $50 a month 
with utilities to $100 a month--without 
The audience had plenty of suggestions?
ranging from rent controls, to tougher en-
forcement of the housing code to easing the 
housing code's restrictions against over-
crowding. 
Mr. Fauntroy Suggested that citizens' or-
gailleations start scouring the suburbs for 
sites?a suggestion that should we well worth 
pursuing under the administration's rent 
subsidy program before Congress. He pro-
posed that "we move into the surrounding 
area and, if necessary, purchase land to re-
lieve the (city's housing) need." 
But no one followed through with the 
thought. Despite the suggestions, the meet-
ing reflected, primarily, a feeling of exas-
peration at all the years gone by without any 
substantial progress. 
"What we called victories really just 
switched people around the slums," said 
Lillian Secundy of the Washington Urban 
League. 
The WPM. had drafted a statement calling 
for more low-income housing in the city 
and action on several lcng-stalled projects, 
but the audience didn't bother to endorse it. 
"Pious paragraphs," said one speaker. 
."Too wishy-washy," said another. 
Pollak agreed, but added: "I'm wonder-
ing what we can do." He suggested develop-
ment of a "plan of actio:a" backed by a fed-
eration of all interested organizations. But 
no one could do anything right away. 
They've got their boards of directors to 
check with. 
Everyone, it seems, is saddled with his own 
bureaucracy?which brings us back to the 
District Building. 
District Commissioner Walter N. 'Tobriner 
has suggested "an emergency in low-cost 
housing" might be declared?so the Com-
missioners could temporarily lift relatively 
minor housing code requirements in run-
down neighborhoods. 
The suggestion was sincerely made, but It 
hardly seems an adequate response to an 
emergency. If it had any noticeable effect, 
it would probably benefit the landlords more

Two years ego 1Vienibers on both sides 
of this aisle 101/led in presenting to the 
House a series oraddresses about a plan 
? "to fight the cbld *at and to win back 
Cuba for derhocracY.' 
Today, 2 years later, here we are on 
dead center. We face the same prob-
lem: "What to do about Cuba?" 
For the redord, let us review the situa-
tion in that beleaguered island only 90 
miles from the eastern coastline of the 
United States. 
Cuba, once a prosperOus country; with 
one of the highest standards of living in 
Latin America, has been reduced to a 
primitive society. There is no freedom 
of the individual, no free press or radio. 
Letters received by Free Cuba Radio 
from Cuba tell of hunger, insufficient 
clothing, few dairy necessities?the 
paralysis of much industry. Marxism 
dominates school curriculum from the 
ntirsery up through university level. 
The army is goviet trained and the peo-
ple are terrorized by informers in the 
sO-called defense committees. Even 
the children- are foreed to spy on their 
parents. Conservatively, 80,000 Cuban 
Men and women are now in Jail, forced 
to live under indescribable conditions. 
Daily executions are' cOmmonplace. 
Despite a good sugar harvest this year, 
the economy is at rock bottom. Castro 
has few dolars for exchange. Diseases 
have reached epfdemic proportions 
04nong both people and livestock. Medi-
Cines ,and qualified doctors are scarce, 
health measures deplorable. Child mor-
tality continues to mount. Out of a 
population of apprdxlinately 7 million, 
500,000 have left the country. It is es-
timated that 230,000 Cubans hold pass-
ports and visas and are eager to leave. 
More than 400,000 others have filled out 
request forms. It IS' reported that from 
85 to 90 percent of the people in Cuba 
are against the Conimunist regime. 
How and why then do the Communists 
stay in power? The answer is that with 
500,000 men and women under arms and 
with a highly trained secret police, the 
G-2, the Cuban people live in constant 
terror and under suppression of these 
spies and guns._ 
Castro's aim was not to free the Cuban 
people from Batista's dictatorship. His 
whole design was to create an arsenal 
and launching ped -for Communist sub-
version to carry on their "wars of libera-
tion' in Latin America. The New York 
Times in a recent editorial, put it this 
way: 
The wars of liberation are aimed primarily 
against the United Slates. Anywhere in the 
non-Communist world, a gain for the East 
is a loss for the West' and the United States 
is the major power in the free world. 
,t49 .past 2 years there has been 
o parativeTy little talk about Cuba. 
Vietnain tias crowded Havana from the 
front pages. Man y% well-meaning Amer-
icans have been lulled to complacency by 
the coexistence line and that Cuba is no 
threat to the United States. In the 
meantime Communist propaganda and 
Not. 135-4 
subversion emanating from the Cuban 
launching pad are defeating our foreign 
policy. On March 10 Hewson A. Ryan, 
associate director for policy and plans of 
the U.S. Information Service, before a 
Senate Committee, pointed out the direc-
tion the propaganda of the Communist 
nations is taking: 
Communist propaganda strategy for Latin 
America is directed toward the destruction 
of U.S. power and influence in the area and 
ultimately to the imposition of Marxist-
Leninist regimes throughout the hemisphere. 
In a Pravda editorial of January 14, 1965, and 
in the subsequent communique on the 
Havana Meeting of Latin American Commu-
nist Parties, Moscow has made it clear that 
in Latin America it will use "all forms of 
struggle, both peaceful and nonpeaceful" to 
further the goals of international commu-
nism. While the U.S.S.R,, Red China, and 
Cuba differ little on their ultimate aims in 
Latin America, their short-term propaganda 
strategy and tactics do vary somewhat. 
The major themes in Cuban propaganda 
are "independence from Yankee imperialism" 
and the "advantages of a Socialist economy." 
To carry on their propaganda activities in 
Latin America the Communists utilize in 
varying degrees all the modern communica-
tions media. Radio Havana is broadcasting 
125 hours weekly in Spanish, 14 hours in 
Creole for Haiti, 7 hours each in Portuguese 
and English, an hour and 20 minutes in 
Guarani for Paraguay, and 30 minutes in 
Aymara. Cuba's Spanish service includes a 
regular program for Venezuela, which has 
been used by members of the Venezuelan 
Armed Forces of National Liberation exiled 
in Cuba to broadcast direct appeals for in-
surrection against the Venezuelan Govern-
ment. Turncoats from Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Guatemala, Peru, and Dominican Republic 
broadcast frequently to their respective home 
countries from Cuba, also. The Cuban serv-
ice even includes a weekly half hour program 
entitled "The Voice of Free Dixie" and is 
directed to the American Negro population. 
Although not generally known until 
Pravda reported it on January 14 of this 
year, Central and South American Com-
munist Party leaders, together with 
Moscow agents and Castro, and his aides, 
met in Havana in late November 1964, to 
plan their combined strategy for further 
subverting Latin America. 
The report of the Special Consultative 
Committee on Security of the Pan 
American Union?April 12-May 7, 1965?
derived the following conclusions from 
the conference of the Communists: 
That, for the present, Cuba agrees to con-
tinue to follow Moscow's lead. 
That the Castro regime will continue to 
serve as the principle tool of communism 
for the subversion of the Americas. 
That an increase of Communist subversive 
activities in the Americas is to be expected. 
? At that meeting, they selected as their 
prime target for subversion, in a virtual 
declaration of war, Venezuela, Colombia, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, and 
Haiti. They omitted the Dominican Re-
public, their pilot project, for which 
battle plans already had been drawn. 
Also, in the early part of March 1965, 
a world conference of representatives of 
Communist Parties was held in Moscow. 
Representatives of 19 countries partici-
pated, including those of old Communist 
Parties of Argentina and Brazil and the 
new United Socialist Revolutionary Party 
?d ig the sole representative of 
Latin America. ?This shows the impor-
tafit.e that Moscow attributes to the 
Cuban party in world conference. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, let us look at the 
implementation of these principles. 
% First, we all know what took place in 
Santo Domingo. On June 13 Jeremiah 
O'Leary, Latin American writer for the 
Washington Star capsuled a report from 
an official U.S. paper compiled by intelli-
gence sources, expert in--ellinifftiffsrriL 
tivities. 
The report, chronologically and in 
narrative form, describes the day-by-day 
activities in Santo Domingo between 
April 24 and May 5 of 77 known Commu-
nists. Many of the 77 were previously 
identified as participants in the revolt by 
U.S. Government sources on May 6, but 
the new document gives intimate details 
of their particination before and after 
the American intervention. 
The document discloses that at least 
45 of the extremists had been deported 
from the Dominican Republic a year 
before and that most of them had re-
ceived guerrilla warfare training in 
Cuba before they began drifting back 
into the Dominican Republic last Octo-
ber. Cuba's principal agency for pro-
moting revolutionary activities in Latin 
America, the General Directorate of 
Intelligence--DGI?had for some time 
been providing financial support to two 
of the three Dominican Communist 
parties?the 14th of June Political 
Group?APCJ--and the Dominican Pop-
ular Movement?MPD. The other 
Dominican Communist group which co-
operated in the rebellion is the Domini-
can Popular Socialist?PSPD?party 
which follows the Moscow line. 
The revolt may have been started by 
some dissident army officers, but the 
Communist leaders of all three parties 
issued orders to their members to incite 
the civilian crowds gathering in the 
streets, and to stage rallies and demon-
strations. We all have read of the vio-
lence, wanton damage and loss of life 
that ensued. 
It is interesting that the Cuban DGI 
officer who handles revolutionary opera-
tions for the _Dominican Republic is 
Roberto Santiesteban Casanova, de-
ported by the United States for engaging 
in espionage in 1962 while serving with 
the Cuban delegation to the United 
Nations. 
Time is too short to present further 
evidence but let us review what has been 
happening in Latin America since the 
November meeting of the Latin Ameri-
can Communists. 
Venezuela: According to a report 
issued by the Special Consultative Com-
mittee on Security of the Pan American 
Union on May 7: 
Communist activities, which have been on 
the wane at the end of 1964, have broken 
out again and may be expected to increase 
with the assistance that Cuba has promised 
to continue to provide to the Armed Forces 
of National Liberation. 
Cuba is also continuing to provide 
considerable amounts of money to sup-
port subversion in Venezuela.

Mr. PUCINSKI. They are the very 
Starr4 tactics. Thai, is why I think this 
anniveraany is of more than pass-

There has been too ittle said about what 
has been happening in Cuba. There are 
hose who, for instance, criticized our 
wn Government for taking strong ae-
on in Santo Domingo in the Dominican 
epublic. The fact of the matter is we 
ave now recorded indisputable proof of 
ommunist exploitation of subversion 
hich Castro has been engaging in was

We can all, as Americans, regardless

his coup in Santo Domingo. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. I would agree 
ompletely with the ;entleman, and I am

ould the gentleman have any sugges-

one by the administration in Cuba, 
owever? 
Mr. PUCINpKI. (will as I continue 
Y analysis here, because actually it is 
o longer enough to look at Cuba alone. 
ur problem of Communist subversion is 
ernispheric. I think, as I relate here, 
e serious subversion and exploitation 
f terrorism from Cuba, we can then see 
ow vastly importa nit is this problem 
ad how large the p ?oblem is. 
Colombia: With Cuban support, the 
uerrIllas, terrorist groups, and bandits, 
alliance with professional Commu-
ists, continue thei pattern of mur-
ers and depredations. In January 1965 
t e President of the Republic disclosed 
t e existence of a large-scale subversive 
ommunist plot against the government, 
hich was to be launahed under cover of 
a nationwide labor strike. The Com-
unist Youth League of Colombia, a 
'vie-oriented group, was implicated 
the plan. At the present time Corn-
unlit leaders, taking advantage of Co-, 
mbia's political, economic, and social 
isis, are formulating terrorist plans and 
emoting violence in the hinterlands. 
Also, the Communist slate won easily

Brazil: The establishment of the new 
governinent in Brazil put a halt to the 
spread and infiltration of communism. 
However, Efforts are still being made to 
create a state of guerrilla warfare and 
to unleash a campaign of terrorism. 
Chile: Early in 1965 the Minister of 
the Intericr described acts of terrorism 
there as very grave and attributed them 
to groups f nanced with foreign funds.

Nicaragua: Last year authorities dis-
covered a large-scale subversive plot, di-
rected from Havana, designed to estab-
lish a Communist government. 
Panama: In December 1964, the Gov-
ernor of Colon declared that: 
Personnel trained in Communist China, 
Cuba and Russic, have attempted a coup 
against our democratic system and the Com-
munists are tryin3 to deceive the masses in 
the hope of seeing Panama converted into 
the second American Republic under the heel 
of a foreign army. 
Peru: Toward the end of January, a 
typical Communist attack was launched 
against the U.S. military mission. And 
in the July 17 Latin American Times, 
Jay Mallin reported: 
Communist guerrillas in Peru, rampaging 
and ambushing, have served to spotlight a 
growing Castro-Communist threat through-
out the hemisphers which for several months 
had been obscured by the Dominican crisis. 
In a dispatch to the New York Times 
from Lima on July 21, Juan de Onis re-
ports that: 
President Fernando Belaunde Terry said 
today that Cuba and the Soviet Union were 
helping Communist "gangsters" bring unrest 
to his country. 
Mr. Belaunde said that in Peru, as in Vene-
zuela, the Communists had adopted extrem-
ist tactics of guerrilla action and terrorism 
"because we are making real social and eco-
nomic gains, in obvious contrast to Cuba's 
situation." 
In other Latin American countries where 
"there is inflation and so many other prob-
lems" the Communists use less drastic tac-
tics, Mr. Belaunde suggested. 
These are some of the terrorist inci-
dents which have erupted in almost every 
Latin American country with varying in-
tensity. Many of the uprisings are fo-
mented by students, always a fertile field 
for agitators. As one American diplomat 
described the current wave of leftist, 
Communist-inspired disorders, assas-
sinations and terrorism. 
"Somebody is giving the whole place a 
shake." 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman. yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Yes. I yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. What the 
gentleman is saying is that our funda-
mental problem in the Western Hemis-
phere is one of developing tactics to 
counter the political warfare that is 
actually taking place. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. That is correct. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. In years past, 
of course, we had the Monroe Doctrine 
that was availabae as our reason for 
keeping this particular hemisphere 
secure. It seems to me, if something is 
going to be recommended, we need to 
have a similar concept to that which 
was available for military purposes 
adopted so as to amend the Monroe Doc-
trine in order to counter this political 
warfare problem we have. Would the 
gentleman agree w.ith that? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I think the gentle-
man is correct. I think President John-
son's decisive action in Santo Domingo 
in the Dominican Republic certainly has 
brought our country and the free nations

-in the Western Hemisphere back into the 
orbit of thinking along the lines of the 
Monroe Doctrine. 
Although the OAS agreed in 1964 to 
defend the rights of individual member 
nations against aggression through sub-
version, there has been no action. Yet 
Many of these OAS members, as I said 
Previously, whose countries have been 
Victims of Communist subversion debate 
the right of the United States to stop 
Communists from making the Dominican 
Republic another Cuba. A year ago to-
day the members-of the OAS, with the 
exception of Mexico, voted to break diplo-
matic and trade relations with Cuba 
When it was discovered and proved that 
the Venezuelan charges were substan-
tiated. Because of the Dominican Re-
public crisis an inter-American peace 
force is being formed. It is hoped plans 
for establishing a permanent peace force 
from the American nations will be form-
alized and voted on at the foreign min-
isters meeting in Rio de Janeiro. I think 
this is one of the high points of our de-
cisive action in the Dominican Republic. 
I think that that action has given the 
OAS new courage, new meaning, new 
direction, and new strategy. If nothing 
More came out of that action than the 
creation of a pan-American or inter-
American military peacekeeping force, 
we would have gone a long way toward 
turning back to the security of the 
Monroe Doctrine. 
Mr. DON H. CLA1:7SEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield further? 
Mr. PUCINSKI, Yes. I yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Does the 
gentleman feel that the OAS is reacting 
rapidly enough in -order to permit this 
same concept in any future uprisings? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. They are not acting 
rapidly enough, but I think that the 
problems I have enumerated here should 
give you a clue to their own problems. 
Our problem here is understanding that 
many of these South American govern-
ments are not very stable because of the 
extent of subversion that exists in those 
countries. Many 61 those governments 
can be toppled overnight. So it is not 
enough for us to say that they ought to 
move faster. I think we Americans, first 
of all, have to recognize that there is a 
Problem. Let us stop kidding ourselves. 
There is a real serious problem in South 
America. The analysis I have presented 
? here today indicates the extent of sub-
version that is now going on in prac-
tically every nation in South America. 
So what we have to do, it seems to me, 
is to firm up the political governments 
Of these South American countries and 
then firm up the OAS; and I think we 
ought to try and develop this inter-
? American peacekeeping force as quickly 
as possible so that these nations that 
want to stand with us will know that if 
itbere is a plot of subversion from Cuba 
against any one of these countries they 
will be able to fall back quickly on an 
inter-American peacekeeping force with-
out suffering the possibility of losing the 
? cohesiveness and continuity of their 
respective governments. 
?This is, one of tbe problems ahead of, 
11S. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. The gentle-
man is suggesting then that through this 
beefing-up process we in effect are going 
to have to sponsor political organiza-
tional information and in effect develop 
a political offensive where the Federal 
system of government, that has worked 
successfully in this country, can be im-
plemented in those areas. But it is going 
to require people who understand the 
Federal system of government to assist 
In implementing this concept in those 
areas where the problem exists. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I think the gentle-
man is correct. Some of these points are 
covered in my statement. 
At the bresent time, according to the 
State Department, the major instrument 
of U.S. policy toward Cuba is a sys-
tematic program of "economic denial," 
although this process is not likely to 
bring down the present regime. Infor-
mation from Cuba indicates?and this 
is extremely important?that this eco-
nomic boycott is relatively successful but 
cannot be completely effective unless 
other free world countries cease trading 
with Cuba,. 
For example, from 1963 to 1964 
Japan's trade with Cuba increased 240 
percent; Spain's by 300 percent. Eng-
land?one of our most notable and loyal 
allies--has increased her exports to Cuba 
by 130 percent. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUtINSK/. I yield. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It could be 
said that with friends like this who needs 
enemies? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. The gentleman is 
quite correct. 
Cuba is a bad economic risk for any 
trading nation. 
As early as 1963 Cuba's trade balance 
with bloc nations started to deteriorate 
with their deficit of $625 million. It was 
estimated that she owed the Soviet bloc 
more than $900 million in trade alone. 
In addition her debt for technical aid, 
arms, and so forth, is $1.5 billion to Rus-
sia; $430 million to Czechoslovakia; $250 
million to Poland; $85 million to Hun-
gary; $70 million to Rumania, and to 
several countries in the Western Hemi-
sphere another $165 million. 
In 1963 the trade balance of Cuba with 
Western countries was favorable in the 
amount of $65 million. However, this 
had to be used for other necessities, so 
Cuba is now almost with no dollar re-
serve. Last year she had only $20 mil-
lion in reserve and this year her finan-
cial situation will be much worse. 
The U.S.S.R. made two loans to her of 
$50 million and $16 million each at the 
end of 1064 to cover her letters of credit 
with Western countries and to buy basic 
materials necessary to the sugar and 
nickel industries. At the end of 1964 
Cuba had exceeded her budget for im-
ports by $300 million, and the outlook 
for 1965 Is far worse in spite of a nor-
mal sugar harvest. 
The biggest job ,we have ahead of us 
is to convince our free world allies that 
by trading with Cubathey are helping 
_ 
17505 
perpetuate the Communist regime of Fi-
del Castro and holding the people of 
Cuba in a state of slavery and despera-
tion. Not only that, they are financing 
and support Communist Propaganda and 
subversive activities originating in Cuba. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Could the 
gentleman tell me what the State De-
partment thinks of this comment? Are 
they doing something about this to fol-
low what the gentleman is now suggest-
ing? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I should like to lay 
these facts before the coordinate branch 
of the Government, the legislative branch 
of the Government here, this body. 
I should Ince to lay these facts before 
this body, as I am doing today on this 
12th anniversary, in order to show my 
colleagues and the American people the 
full toll of letting the Communists re-
main in Cuba. 
It is my hope we will then be able to 
explore the reactions from the State De-
partment and the other interested 
agencies. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield further? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Yes, I yield to the 
gentleman from California. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Well, the 
gentleman has certainly provided Mem-
bers of Congress with an excellent rec-
ord. My only regret is that there are 
not more Members on the floor to hear 
the gentleman. We have less than six 
Members on the floor, in my judgment. 
It is very regrettable, because I believe 
every Member of Congress should have 
heard this fine special order that the 
gentleman has taken the time to prepare. 
Could the gentleman tell me if it is 
possible to reveal the sources of the gen-
tleman's information? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Much of this infor-
mation is obtained from, as I have said 
before, newspaper reports, reports of re-
liable newspapers, published both in the 
United States and in South American 
countries. Much of this information is 
available from Publicly documented 
sources that have come to our attention 
In the Cuban Freedom Committee, and 
much of this information is made avail-
able through the sources and the people 
who write to us, not only from Cuba but 
people who hear our broadcasts in other 
parts of South America and who have to 
rely in many instances upon these broad-
casts sponsored by the Cuban Freedom 
Committee which, incidentally, is a 
committee made up exclusively of Amer-
ican citizens, people, many of whom 
have never been to Cuba, although the 
executive director had been a teacher 
In Cuba before the Communists took 
over, as well as from informed letters 
which we receive from other countries in 
South America written by people who 
hear our broadcasts. 
MI stated earlier, our broadcasts may 
serve in many instances as the only 
source of straight reliable world news, 
because this is primarily all we broad-
cast. We broadcast news from the world 
and the people of Cuba and the people of 
other South American countries who

ea,r these broadcasts which emanate 
oin Miami, from Florida, and from 
ew Orleans, these people have learned 
rely on our broadcasts, because we do 
ot engage in propaganda, and we give 
t em the truth. We give them news

t at Americans and the people of all the 
f ee world are receiving. And these peo-
e have learned to respect us for our 
tegrity,, and as a i esult they write in 
nd niost of the information that we get 
from these very reliable sources. 
I wonder, if I may, just touch on this 
oint because it may be of interest to 
e gentleman from California? The 
oint I was going to make was this?
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It is of inter-
t to me because I have met the worthy 
rgarization which the gentleman is dis-
ssing and, furthermore, I have had 
me personal contacts with people in 
ese various countries of the world 
rough a missionary program with 
hich I worked for a number of years. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. .And, of course, the 
ssionaries very often are excellent in 
t eir analyses. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It seems to 
e that the people should know more 
bout what is going on in these areas 
an the State Department. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. :: think the gentle-

On July 21, Ramiro Puertas, Director

ounced over ClVIQ Havana, that this 
ar the Institute will install a 150,000-

Also, they are installing French TV

aguey, Guaimaro; and Victoria de 
s Tunas. It is important to know that 
s :is French equ.:pment--equipment 
lug supplied to Communist Cuba by 
r supposed ally, France. 
To show Cuba's importance to the 
mrnunists' dream of world domina-
n, I will read you another news dis-
tch : 
The French Press Agency reported from 
iro on July 16 that the Cuban Ambassador 
Egypt, before leavini; for home, had an-
uncod that a conference of popular move-
ents of three continents will be held in 
H. vans on January 6, 1466. It had been de-
ci?ed at the Fourth Afro-Asian Solidarity 
C nference in Accra in May '5o extend the 
vereent to Latin America. Representa-
es of popular movements of six Latin 
American ountries will participate in the 
prelimihary planning meetings which will 
begin ih Csiro on September 1. The coun-
tries are: Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay, 
Chile, and Guatemala. The planning com-
mittees als3 will includes delegates of Jive 
African ccsmtries: Egypt, Algiers, Morocco, 
Guinea. Sodtb Africa, and six Asian coun-
tries?he 3eople's Republic of China, the 
U.S.S.R., India, Indonesia, Jaren, and South 
Vietnaih. 
There s ou have it, Mr. Speaker, in 
the bold, broad strokes of Communist 
takeover mder our very noses. Two 
years ago ihe United States seemed to be 
at least it some measure awake to the 
Cuban danger. Today, I fear we are let-
ing the immediate and close-to-home 
problem tike a secondary position in our 
planning and our defense. Mr. Speaker, 
I affirm t) this House that in such a 
course lies hemispheric disaster. 
FREENVHEIELING DISARMAMENT 
BIN(IE :0-DANGER8 NATIONAL SE-
CURITY 
The SP:LAKER pro tempore. Under 
previoUs oder of the House, the gentle-
man from California [Mr. Hosamil is 
recognized for 40 minutes. 
Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, disarma-
ment fervar runs high in Washington 
today. Tie Arms Control and Disarma-
ment Ager cy's?ACDA?budget has bal-
looned several hundred percent since its 
inception n 1961. Friends of Disarma-
ment Iron intellectual and academic 
circles! in large numbers have enlisted 
voluntariliy in the cause. Prof. Jerome 
Wiesner, the former White House sci-
ence advis er, recommends developing "a 
cadre of people whose full-time occupa-
tion" is to reorient public attitudes. He 
wants them "to create a vested interest 
in amp ontrol"?whatever that may 
mean. ; 
Unles forces in the United States who 
recognize the danger of unrestrained dis-
armament quickly organize and articu-
late their position, the administration's 
cadre of c.edicated disarmers soon will 
take the Nation Past the point of no re-
turn on its flight from the proven strat-
egy of arming to avoid trouble to the yet 
unproven :,trategy of disarming to avoid 
it. . 
DISARMERS worm QUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY 
The disarmers carry on their work un-
obtrusiyely. . As yet the public is not 
conditipned to disarmament. The ma-
jority of Americans still believes world 
peace as well as national survival de-
pends on s rength coupled with negotia-
tion rather than negotiation alone. The 
average person is scared half out of his 
wits when some enterprising writer digs 
out and Publicizes facts on various 
ACDA-sponsored disarmament studies. 
This alas the case when things came 
to light as lhe study on togetherness with 
Russia and its study suggesting self -un-
posed limitations on intelligence gather-
ing efforts. 
The Wor c of Washington's disarmers 
is being' made easier by the seemingly cal-
culated elimination of top military 
spokesmen capable of comunicating au-
thoritatively with the American public. 
Such popular figures as Admiral Arleigh 
1965 
"31 Knot" Burke and cigar-chomping 
Gen. Curtis LeMay are on the retired 
rolls. No successors have been permitted 
to develop public prominence. Probably 
not one person in a thousand can even 
name our present Chief of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
A tribute to the steady progress of the 
disarmers came recently in the form of a 
lack of outcry when a U.S. Ambassador 
to the U.N., the late Adlai Stevenson, 
promised a further softening of the 
American position on test ban treaty 
safeguards. When negotiations for a 
comprehensive treaty broke off in 1963. 
U.S. demands for annual inspections in 
Soviet territory had been whittled from 
20 to 7. Khrushchey still adamantly 
maintained "three or four" would be 
ample. Stevenson promised that the 
Johnson administration now "is willing 
to explore" further what constitutes "an 
adequate inspection system." 
Public apathy toward the possible con-
sequences of the promise has encouraged 
and accelerated preparation of many 
other advanced disarmament positions, 
some of which President Johnson is ex-
pected to offer the Soviets when the 18-
nation Disarmament Conference recon-
venes in Geneva tc morrow. 
These include: 
NIMAILATER9L NUCLEAR UMBRELLA 
This proposal calls for pledges by 
nuclear have-not nations to refrain from 
seeking nuclear capabilities in exchange 
for pledges from the U.N.'s nuclear 
"haves" to aid them if they fall victim to 
atomic aggression. Whether the occur-
rence, of "aggression" is to be determined 
by the U.N.'s frequently paralyzed Gen-
eral Assembly, its veto-ridden Security 
Council, the nonnuclear victim or the 
nuclear pledgegiver is uncertain. 
TOTAL TEST BAN TREATY 
This proposal to enlarge the present 
limited test ban treaty to include a bar 
against tests underground as well as in 
other environments would be based on 
"splitting the difference" between United 
States and U.S.S.R. inspection demands 
and fixing the number at five annually. 
Professor Wiesner and ACDA believe 
"five inspections per year will provide 
adequate security against clandestine 
nuclear testing." However, hearings of 
the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy 
cast considerable doubt on this optimistic 
assessment. Additionally, they raised 
monumental doubts whether even un-
limited opporturities for inspection 
could penetrate the precautions of a 
determined cheater. This is because the 
Soviets insist on severe limitations on 
factors affecting the quality as well as 
the quantity of inspections. These in-
clude tight restrictions on size and com-
position of inspection teams, allowable 
Inspection techniques, permissible equip-
ment, mode and freedom of travel and 
communications, length of the inspection 
period and the like. 
DESTRUCTION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
Several years ago the disarmament 
concept of "we'll burn our bombers and 
you burn yours" was seriously con-
sidered. Its current adaptation is ex-
pected to take the form of a proposal that 
the United States and U.S.S.R, junk

Co PLIANCE ON REPAIRS IS OFTEN 
Loam DELAYED 
Both andlord and tenant complain about 
the lack of a clear standard for enforcement. 
The la dlord. says different inspectors use 
differertl criteria for spotting 'violations, and 
the ten nts complain that the lack of qual-
lty control permits landlords to use cheap 
rnateria in repairs. The code specified only 
- that a  'workmanlike" job be done. 
! Neigh orhood workers attempting to help 
SIUM d elm with their housing problems 
ave be n annoyed by the housing division's 
licy o allowing only landlords and tenants 
o see iolations records. - Mallon said he 
as ma ing an exception to his rule when 
reporter , after filling out detailed forms re-
quiring both Mallon's and the Corporation 
Counsel's signatures, were permitted to see 
the reco. ds. 
i All the division's records are filed by street 
address. There is no-central :Me_ listing vio-
Iators by name. The inspectors become fa-
n-tiller with habitual offender., but there is 
no easy itvay to determine any owner's entire 
history 4f code violations. 
But nostly it ft the long delays and the 
onstan threat- of retaliating evictions that 
rustrat slum dwellers seeking to get re-
airs in their homes. And perhaps it is the 
elays that have led to the suspicion by the 
'tenants that inspectors can be bought off by

spectors with generous Christmas gifts. 
"We all used to lo it," he said, "but then 
one time an 'nape ctor came by to get his 
gift, and I sivar his car was packed full of

The agent lid he now occasionally will 
ask an Inspect dr to come by one of his prop-
erties to advise him about repairs that will 
be necessary ta maet the code. "I' usually 
give them $5 Or $10 for the favor," he said, 
"but I've only dor e this a couple of dozen 
times in the peat 25 years." 
S. Tudor Sta-anf , deputy superintendent 
of the housing dit ision, said: "If we knew 
the point where slum landlords will leave 
the market and ba replaced by people not 
interested in explciting tenants. But step-
ped-up enforcement as Mallon points out, 
would require conaiderably more inspectors.

Walter N. Tobrinet suggested what he calls 
a "reformulation" of the code. He agrees

aspects of the: code should not be empha-

evicts the tenants, rehabilitates the prop-
erty and rentii to high income groups, or 
evicts the tenants razes the building and 
converts the land ao some other use."' 
"There is a dilemma," Tobriner said. 
Tough enforceanen t could have the unin-
tended effect of rec.ucing the housing supply 
rather than iraprcving housing conditions. 
Still other cdnaplaints about slum housing 
center on the Landlord and Tenant Court. 
Cases handled athe a last year ardounted to 
more than 96,000 and Chief Judge John Lewis 
Smith, Jr., estImaies the figure will exceed 
100,000 this year. 
The proceedings in the court are summary, 
usually withoUt eaterisive argument. More 
than 95 percent of the cases in the court 
deal with nonpayir ant of rent while most of 
the others involve dousing code violations. 
In the nonpaym ant cases, Smith said, if 
the tenant admits having not paid the rent, 
the only judgrnent possible will be in favor 
of the landlord. The law does not give the 
tenant the right .* withhold his rent be-
cause his landlord has failed to make repairs 
or improvements, Smith said. 
The wording of the law and the role of 
the judges in, eniorcing the law have led 
slum dwellers to complain that the court is 
merely a Collection agency for landlords. 
Civil rights erga aizations and antipoverty 
officials in Washington are now seeking 
changes in the law, but Smith said that what-
ever reforms are made must come through 
legislation or appolate court decisions, net 
from the Landlord and Tenant Court.

POTOMAC WATOH--..75ITY'S HOUSING SHORTAGE 
THE TARGET? FRUSTRATION THE THEME AT 
DISCUSSION 
(By George Lardner Jr.) 
Frustration area the theme. 
The city's shOrta le of low-cost housing was 
the target. The audience sounded aroused. 
But the members of more than 25 housing 
organizations, Civil rights groups, and pub-
lic agencies who gathered to try to "do some-
thing" about he housing crisis seemed to 
realize they Were punching futilely at the 
same old paper bra of exorbitant rents, 
dilapidated homes slumlords, and the bu-
reaucratic delays facing almost any attempt 
at improvement. 
"We seem ta be moving backwards," said 
Stephen J. P011ala president-elect of the 
Washington Planning and Housing Associa-
tion which called tae meeting. 
"A tent on the Mall would be an enor-
mous tmprove1nent for more people than I 
care to think of," said Harris Weinstein, the 
association's housing committee chairman. 
The District of Columbia Coalition of 
Conscience has been trying to put up 
a tent for a family of 13?with two 
working mothers?who were evicted last 
month, but can't find new quarters. The 
emergency housing program the city loudly 
promised in May for predicaments like this 
may take another 3 months to get started, ac-
cording to city officials Who are not accus-
tomed to rushing. 
Forty-five real estate agents and nine pub-
lic and private agencies had been called, said 
Coalition Co-Chairman Walter E. Fauntroy, 
but none could come up with a single unit 
that the family could afford 
The tent, of course, ft a gimmick?but an 
appropriate one. As Mr. Fauntroy said, "we 
have to create pressure to affect the cures." 
One WPHA worker who helps families in 
the Cardozo area told of an eight-room house 
worth $17,600 that produces gross rentals of 
$600 a month for its owner. 
The worker, Tom Firor, also told of an-
other landlord who "for the 40th time in the 
last 6 months has evicted or threatened to 
evict families because they called the city's 
Housing Division" to get. needed repairs 
ordered. 
Another WPHA worker, Belvie Rooks, 
broke into tears when she described how her 
organization had to pay $300 a month in back 
rent to "one of the worst slumlords in the 
city" to save a mother of seven from evic-
tion from a house with broken-down plumb-
ing and inadequate heating. The family, 
Miss Rooks said, had beer. living there for 
3 years when the old owner died. Suddenly, 
she said, the rent went up from $50 a month 
with utilities to $100 a month?without utili-
ties. 
The audience had plenty of suggestions?
ranging from rent controls, to tougher en-
forcement of the housing code to easing the 
housing code's restrictions against over-
crowding. 
Mr. Fauntroy suggested that citizens' or-
ganizations start scouring the suburbs for 
sites?a suggestion that should we well 'worth 
pursuing under the administration's rent 
subsidy program before Congress. He pro-
posed that "we move into the surrounding 
area and, if necessary, purchase land to re-
lieve the (city's housing) need." 
But no one followed through with the 
thought. Despite the suggestions, the meet-
ing reflected, primarily, a feeling of exas-
peration at all the years gone by without any 
substantial progress. 
"What we called victories really just 
switched people around the slums," said 
Lillian Secundy of the Washington Urban 
League. 
The WPHA had drafted a statement calling 
for more low-income housing in the city 
and action on several long-stalled projects, 
but the audience didn't bather to endorse it. 
"Pious paragraphs," said one speaker. 
"Too wishy-washy," said another. 
Pollak agreed, but added: "I'm wonder-
ing what we can do." He suggested develop-
ment of a "plan of action" backed by a fed-
eration of all interested organizations. But 
no one could do anything right away. 
They've got their boards of directors to 
check with. 
Everyone, it seems, is saddled with his own 
bureaucracy--which brings us back to the 
District Building. 
District Commissioner Walter N. Toloriner 
has suggested "an emergency in low-cost 
housing" might be declared?so the Com-
missioners could temporarily lift relatively 
minor housing code requirements in run-
down neighborhoods. 
The suggestion was sincerely made, but it 
hardly seems an adequate response 'to an 
emergency. If it had any noticeable effect, 
It would probably benefit the landlords more

than the tenants; and promote slums rather 
than decent housing. 
If the Commissioners can agree there's an 
"emergency"--and there is?perhaps they 
might fry promoting some one- or two-block 
urban renewal projects?for public housing. 
It migh.t not work-, but ft seems worth the at-
tempt. It'll take a while to get to the 
anburbs.

NEW GROUP TO PUSH LOW INCOME Irons'No 
(By Benjamin Forgey) 
An informal District organization calling 
itself the Ad HoC, Committee on the Housing 
Crisis was formed last night to seek an in-
crease in low-income housing. 
Representatives of about 20 housing, civil 
rights, labor, political, welfare and church 
organizations endorsed the program, but left 
the exact nature of the new group in doubt 
as they returned to report to their own 
organizations. 
Harris Weinstein, chairman of the housing 
committee of the Washington Planning and 
Housing Association, said he hoped action on 
some Of the proposals would begin this week. 
The most "immediate and substantial 
need." Weinstein told the group, was to lobby 
for bairced residential use of the Ana,costia-
Bolling an Earional Vali:ring School sites. 
Competing proposals for use of these tracts, 
the last large, aVailable publicly owned sites 
in the District, are being discussed in 
Congress. 
The group also voted to urge the District 
C ,ornmtssioners, to use "whatever powers they 
now have" to make repairs on Slum prop-
erties and charge the repairs to landlords. 
According to the resolution, the Commis-
sioners will also be asked to seek legislation 
Preventing "retaliatory" evictions and rent 
increases. ? 
Also proposed was a "housing crisis week-
end.", during which clergymen will focus their 
sermons on the 4eecl, for,low-income housing 
and a tour of the District's slums for inter-
ested Public officials. 
? The meeting was the result of a WPHA 
effort to "bring, the housing, needs of the 
District before, te public," and was a follow-
up an Initial session held last Thursday. 
P2GVEIGN POCICY MISMANAGEMENT 
(Mx. DERVTINSKI (at the request of 
Mr. DoN H. CLAUSEN) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the ECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr, DERWIIIIKSHI. Mr. Speaker, the 
continued detArioration of our conduct 
of foreign affairs is seen in many parts 
of the world. liowever, the spineless 
handling of the Nasser administration in 
Egypt certainly is fully indicative of for-
eign policy mismanagement. 
When are we going to wake up and 
realize that we are being taken for a 
ride? Egypt is doing a good job of mak-
ing a fool out of the United States. Less 
than a month ago, Egypt's Nasser took a 
full advantage of American willingness 
to hand out free wheat, Now, we find 
out that the Agency for International 
Development gave Egypt over 23 million 
Clollarp' worth: of corn, in 1961 on the 
- basis Of an Out and, out misrepresenta-
tion. 
My distinguished colleague, the gen-
tleman from Minnesota [Mr. LANcErth 
qiIed atteption to the report of the 
Cleneral Accounting Office ;that a ship-
ment of 186,060 metric tons of corn to 
Egypt under the auspices of AID was ob-
tained under false pretenses. The grant 
was made on the basis of reports from. 
the Cromrnunist-sympathizing country of 
a potential famine because of a serious 
crop failure. It was later disclosed that 
no crop failure occurred and much of 
the corn had been sold by Egypt. 
The gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. 
LANGEN] further disclosed that AID of-
ficials found out Egypt was selling some 
of the corn even before the whole grant 
was shipped. With over $11 million 
worth still in the hands of U.S. officials, 
AID apparently made no attempt to hold 
the shipments until the matter could be 
investigated. The GAO report charged 
that AID did not check on distribution of 
over 85 percent of the corn, and it has 
been substantiated that at least 80,000 
tons have been sold by the Egyptian 
Government. 
This report confirms what I have been 
saying for years. The administration 
will spend taxpayers' dollars to give aid 
to any country which stretches out its 
hand. I want to commend the General 
Accounting Office on its alertness. I hope 
this report opens some eyes in Washing-
ton. If it does not, it seems we will con-
tinue to help a country that openly de-
grades the United States and is critical 
of our policy. 
What is needed is action by the Con-
gress to insure that any future grants 
would be made only when it is assured 
that all the aid goes for the purpose for 
which it was intended. Apparently, the 
Agency for International Development 
does not do this now. 
As a member of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee which has been duti-
fully rubberstamping administration 
measures for years, I would hope that 
the committee would recognize its legis-
lative responsibilities and concentrate on 
implementation of a foreign policy 
whereby we would reject the blackmail 
pressures from rulers such as Nasser. 
Na:sser is -using anti-Israel statements 
as a'` smokescreen for his domestic fail-
ures, and there is no reason why we 
should prop up his administration, which 
is carrying on an aggressive military ac-
tion against the legitimate government 
and people of Yemen.

now celebrated by the Communists as 
the 26th of July movement. 
Two 'Years itgo Metn15ers on both sides 
Of this aisle loIned in -presenting to the 
House a serieS'olf addresses eibout a plan 
"to fight the cold Waf and to win back 
Cuba for democracy:" 
Today, 2 years later, here we are on 
dead center. We face the same prob-
lem: "What to do about Cuba?" 
For the record, let us review the situa-
tion in that beledguered Island only 90 
miles from the eastern coastline of the 
United States. 
Cuba, once a prosperous country; with 
one of the highest standards of living in 
Latin America, has been reduced to a 
primitive society. There is no freedom 
of the individual, no free press or radio. 
Letters received by Free Cuba Radio 
from Cuba tell of hunger, insufficient 
clothing, few daily necessities?the 
paralysis of much industry. Marxism 
dominates school curriculum from the 
nursery up 'through university level. 
The army is soviet trained and the peo-
ple are terrorized by informers in the 
so-called defense committees. Even 
the children are forced to spy on their 
parents. Conservatively, 80,000 Cuban 
men and women are now in jail, forced 
to live under indescribable conditions. 
Daily executions are Comrhonplace. 
Despite a good sugar harvest this year, 
the economy is at roCk bottom. Castro 
has few dolars for exchange. Diseases 
have reached epidemic proportions 
among both people and livestock. Medi-
cines and qualified doctors are scarce, 
health measures deplorable. Child mor-
? tality continues to mount. Out of a 
population of approximately 7 million, 
500,000 have left the country. It is es-
timated that 230,000 Cubans hold pass-
pelts and visas and are eager to leave. 
!ore than 400,000 others have filled out 
request forms. It is reported that from 
85 to 90 percent of the people in Cuba 
are against the ComMunist regime. 
How and why then do the Communists 
stay in power? The answer is that with 
500,008 men and women under arms and 
with a highly trained secret police, the 
G-2, the Cuban people live in constant 
terror and under suppression of these 
spies and guns. 
Castro's aim was not to free the Cuban 
people from Batista's dictatorship. His 
whole design was to create an arsenal 
and launching pad for Communist sub-
version to carry on their "wars of libera-
tion" in Latin America. The New York 
Times in a, recent editorial, put it this 
way: 
The wars of liberation are aimed primarily 
against the United States. Anywhere in the 
non-Communist world, a gain for the East 
is a loss for the West and the United States 
is the major power in the free world. 
:,VoT the past 2 years there has been 
OmPartitiVely little' talk about Cuba. 
Vietnam has crowded Havana from the 
Vont pages. Many well-meaning Amer-
icans have been lulled to complacency by 
the coexistence line and that Cuba is no 
threat to the United States. In the 
Tnear4ime, egramurilst propaganda and 
0.1061-0 
subversion emanating from the Cuban 
launching pad are defeating our foreign 
Policy. On March 10 Hewson A. Ryan, 
associate director for policy and plans of 
the U.S. Information Service, before a 
Senate Committee, pointed out the direc-
tion the propaganda of the Communist 
nations is taking: 
Communist propaganda strategy for Latin 
America is directed toward the destruction 
of U.S. power and influence in the area and 
ultimately to the imposition of Marxist-
Leninist regimes throughout the hemisphere. 
In a Pravda editorial of January 14, 1965, and 
in the subsequent communique on the 
Havana meeting of Latin American Commu-
nist Parties, Moscow has made it clear that 
in Latin America it will use "all forms of 
struggle, both peaceful and nonpeaceful" to 
further the goals of international commu-
nism. While the U.S.S.R., Red China, and 
Cuba differ little on their ultimate aims in 
Latin America, their short-term propaganda 
strategy and tactics do vary somewhat. 
The major themes in Cuban propaganda 
are "independence from Yankee imperialism" 
and the "advantages of a Socialist economy." 
To carry on their propaganda activities in 
Latin America the Communists utilize in 
varying degrees all the modern communica-
tions media. Radio Havana is broadcasting 
125 hours weekly in Spanish, 14 hours in 
Creole for Haiti, '7 hours each in Portuguese 
and English, an hour and 20 minutes in 
Guarani for Paraguay, and 30 minutes in 
Aymara. Cuba's Spanish service includes a 
regular program for Venezuela, which has 
been used by members of the Venezuelan 
Armed Forces of National Liberation exiled 
In Cuba to broadcast direct appeals for in-
surrection against the Venezuelan Govern-
ment. Turncoats from Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Guatemala, Peru, and Dominican Republic 
broadcast frequently to their respective home 
countries from Cuba, also. The Cuban serv-
ice even includes a weekly half hour program 
entitled "The Voice of Free Dixie" and is 
directed to the American Negro population. 
Although not generally known until 
Pravda reported it on January 14 of this 
year, Central and South American Com-
munist Party leaders, together with 
Moscow agents and Castro, and his aides, 
met in Havana in late November 1964, to 
plan their combined strategy for further 
subverting Latin America. 
The report of the Special Consultative 
Committee on Security of the Pan 
American Union?April 12-May 7, 1965?
derived the following conclusions from 
the conference of the Communists: 
That, for the present, Cuba agrees to con-
tinue to follow Moscow's lead. 
That the Castro regime will continue to 
serve as the principle tool of communism 
for the subversion of the Americas. 
That an increase of Communist subversive 
activities in the Americas is to be expected. 
At that meeting, they selected as their 
prime target for subversion, in a virtual 
declaration of war, Venezuela, Colombia, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, and 
Haiti. They omitted the Dominican Re-
public, their pilot project, for which 
battle plans already had been drawn. 
Arso, in the early part of March 1965, 
a world conference of representatives of 
Communist Parties was held in Moscow. 
Representatives of 19 countries partici-
pated, including those of old Communist 
Parties of Argentina and Brazil and the 
new United Socialist Revolutionary Party 
17503 
of Cuba, as the sole representative of 
Latin America. This shows the impor-
tance that Moscow attributes to the 
Cuban party in world conference. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, let us look at the 
Implementation of these principles. 
First, we all know what took place in 
Santo Domingo. On June 13 Jeremiah 
O'Leary, Latin American writer for the 
Washington Star capsuled a report from 
an official U.S. paw compiled b intern-
g_ence sources, expert in Commun 
The report, chronologically and in 
narrative form, describes the day-by-day 
activities in Santo Domingo between 
April 24 and May 5 of 77 known Commu-
nists. Many of the 77 were previously 
identified as participants in the revolt by 
U.S. Government sources on May 6, but 
the new document gives intimate details 
of their participation before and after 
the American intervention. 
The document discloses that at least 
45 of the extremists had been deported 
from the Dominican Republic a year 
before and that most of them had re-
ceived guerrilla warfare training in 
Cuba before they began drifting back 
into the Dominican Republic last Octo-
ber. Cuba's principal agency for pro-
moting revolutionary activities in Latin 
America, the General Directorate of 
Intelligence?DGI?had for some time 
been providing financial support to two 
of the three Dominican Communist 
parties?the 14th of June Political 
Group?APCJI---and the Dominican Pop-
ular Movement?MPD. The other 
Dominican Communist group which co-
operated in the rebellion is the Domini-
can Popular Socialist?PSPD?party 
which follows the Moscow line. 
The revolt may have been started by 
some dissident army officers, but the 
Communist leaders of all three parties 
issued orders to their members to incite 
the civilian crowds gathering in the 
streets, and to stage rallies and demon-
strations. We all have read of the vio-
lence, wanton damage and loss of life 
that ensued. 
It is interesting that the Cuban DGI 
officer who handles revolutionary opera-
tions for the Dominican Republic is 
Roberto Santiesteban Casanova, de-
ported by the United States for engaging 
in espionage in 1962 while serving with 
the Cuban delegation to the United 
Nations. 
Time is too short to present further 
evidence but let us review what has been 
happening in Latin America since the 
November meeting of the Latin Ameri-
can Communists. 
Venezuela: According to a report 
issued by the Special Consultative Com-
mittee on Security of the Pan American 
Union on May 7: 
Communist activities, which have been on 
the wane at the end of 1964, have broken 
out again and may be expected to increase 
with the assistance that Cuba has promised 
to continue to provide to the Armed Forces 
of National Liberation. 
Cuba is also continuing to provide 
considerable amounts of money to sup-
port subversion in Venezuela.

Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
'will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield to the gen-

110. DON izt. CLAUSEN. I compliment 
the gentleman on his very provocative 
statement. I would also ask the gentle-
man if the very tactics that are now 
being used in Latin America are not es-
sentially the same as have been carried 
out by the Vietcong in Vietnam. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. They are the very 
same tactics. That is why I think this 
12th anniversary is of more than pass-
ing interest to the American people. 
There has beeratoo little said about what 
has been happening in Cuba. There are 
those who, for instance, criticized our 
own Government :!or taking strong ac-
tion in Santo Domingo in the Dominican 
Republic. The fact of the matter is we 
have now recorded indisputable proof of 
Communist exploitation of subversion 
which Castro has been engaging in was 
te be tried in Santo Domingo. 
We can all, as Americans, regardless 
of what our party affiliations may be, 
thank the good Lord that we have a 
President who moved decisively to stop 
this coup in Santo Domingo. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. I would agree 
completely with the gentleman, and I am 
not a member of either the gentleman's 
party or the Pres:ideat's party. I am 
convinced in my own mind that had we 
net taken this quick and decisive action, 
We certainly would have had another 
Cuba in this Western Hemisphere. 
Would the gentleman have any sugges-
tions as to what he believes should be 
done by the administration in Cuba, 
however? 
PUCINSKI. I will as I continue 
my analysis here, because actually it is 
no longer enough to look at Cuba alone. 
Our problem of Conununist subversion is 
hemispheric. I think, as I relate here, 
the serious subversion and exploitation 
of terrorism from Cuba, we can then see 
? how vastly important is this problem 
and how large the problem is. 
Colombia: With Cuban support, the 
guerrillas, terrorist groups, and bandits, 
in alliance with rrofessional Commu-
nists, continue their pattern of mur-
ders and depredaticns. In January 1965 
the President of the Republic disclosed 
the existence of a large-scale subversive 
Commuaist plot against the government, 
which was to be launched under cover of 
nationwide labor strike. The Corn-
Unist Youth League of Colombia, a 
Soviet-oriented group, was implicated 
n the plan. At the present time Corn-
unist leaders, taking advantage of Co-
ombia's political, economic, and social 
risis, are formulating terrorist plans and 
romoting violence in the hinterlands. 
Also, the Communist slate won easily 
n elections 2 months ago for members 
f the Executive Council of the National 
ederation of Univeasity students known 
FUN, the first national organization 
f students in this country. FUN now 
laints to represent the students in the 
5 Government-supported universities 
hroughout the country. Although the 
ajcalty of the students are not Corn-
unist-oriented, FUN is in control of 
tudent political a,cavities.

areas, have recently moved their opera-

strategy designed to generate chaos and 
disoccier there and to force Col. Enrique

renewed terror and violence which began 
a few weeks ago with the fatal machine-
gunaing of the Under Secretary of De-

said tbe Communists had set up guerrilla 
training i amps on Argentine and Brazil-

Peru: Toward the end of January, a 
typical Communist attack was launched 
against the U.S. military mission. And 
in the July 17 Latin American Times,

Communist guerrillas in Peru, rampaging 
and ambushing, have served to spotlight a 
growing Castro-C'ornmunist threat through-
out the hemisphere which for several months 
had been obscured by the Dominican crisis. 
In a dispatch to the New York Times 
from Lima on July 21, Juan de Onis re-
ports that: 
President Fernando Belaunde Terry said 
today that Cuba and the Soviet Union were 
helping Communist "gangsters" bring unrest 
to his country. . 
Mr. Belaunde said that in Peru, as in Vene-
zuela, the Communists had adopted extrem-
ist tactics of guerrilla action and terrorism 
"because we are making real social and eco-
nomic gains, in obvious contrast to Cuba's 
situation." 
In other Latin American countries where 
"there is inflation and so many other prob-
lems," the Communists use less drastic tac-
tics, Mr. Belaunde suggested. 
These are some of the terrorist inci-
dents which have erupted in almost every 
Latin American country with varying in-
tensity. Many of the uprisings are fo-
mented by students, always a fertile field 
for agitators. As one American diplomat 
described the current wave of leftist, 
Communist-inspired disorders, assas-
sinations and terrorism. 
"Somebody is giving the whole place a 
shake." 
Mr. 'DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Yes. I yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. DON H. 'CLAUSEN., What the 
gentleman is sa?ying is that our funda-
mental problem in the Western Hemis-
phere is one of developing tactics to 
counter the political warfare that is 
actually taking place. 
Mr. PUCINSK:C. That is correct. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. In years past, 
of course, we had the Monroe Doctrine 
that was available as our reason for 
keeping this particular hemisphere 
secure. It seems to me, if something is 
going to be recommended, we need to 
have a similar aoncept to that which 
was available for military purposes 
adopted so as to amend the Monroe Doc-
trine in order to counter this political 
warfare problem we have. Would the 
gentleman agree with that? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I think the gentle-
man is correct. :[ think President John-
son's decisive action in Santo Domingo 
in the Dominican Republic certainly has 
brought our country and the free nations

in the Western Hemisphere back into the 
orbit of thinking along the lines of the 
Monroe Doctrine. 
Although the OAS agreed in 1964 to 
defend the rights of individual member 
nations against aggression through sub-
version, there has been no action. Yet 
many of these OAS Members, as I said 
previously, whose countries have been 
victims of Communist subversion debate 
the right of the United States to stop 
Communists from making the Dominican 
Republic another Cuba. A year ago to-
day the members of the OAS, with the 
exception of Mexico, voted to break d:plo-
matte and trade relations with Cuba 
when it was discovered and proved that 
the Venezuelan charges were substan-
tiated. Because of the Dominican Re-
public crisis an inter-American peace 
force is being formed. It is hoped plans 
for establishing a permanent peace force 
from the American nations will be form-
&Ind and yoted on at the foreign min-
isters meeting in Rio de Janeiro. I think 
this is one of the high points of our de-
cisive action in the Dominican Republic. 
I think that that action has given the 
OAS new courage, new meaning, new 
direction, and new strategy. If nothing 
more came Out of that action than the 
creation of a pan-American or inter-
American military peacekeeping force, 
we would have gone a long way toward 
turning back to the security of the 
Monroe Doctrine. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
Will the gentleman yield further? 
Mr. PUCE1/41SKI. Yes. I yield to the 
gentleman.-
- Mr, DON H. CLAUSEN. Does the 
gentleman feel that the OAS is reacting 
rapidly enough in order to permit this 
same concent in any future uprisings? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. They are not acting 
rapidly enough, but I think that the 
problems I have enumerated here should 
give you a clue to their own problems. 
Our problem here is understanding that 
many of these South American govern-
ments are not very stable because of the 
extent of subversion that exists in those 
countries. Many of those governments 
can be toppled overnight. So it is not 
enough for us to say that they ought to 
move faster. I think we Americans, first 
of all, have to recognize that there is a 
problem. Let us stop kidding ourselves. 
There is S, real serious problem in South 
America. The analysis I have presented 
here today indicates the extent, of sub-
version that is now going on in prac-
tically every nation in South America. 
So what we have to do, it seems to me, 
Is to firm up the no:laical governments 
of these South American countries and 
then firm up the OAS; and I think we 
Ought to try and develop this inter-
American peacekeeping force as quickly 
as possible so that these nations that 
want to stand with us will know that If 
ere is a plot of subversion from Cuba 
against any one of these countries they 
Will be able, to fall back quickly on an 
inter-Amerloan peacekeeping force with-
out suffering the possibility of losing the 
eOliesiveness and coritinuity of their 
respective governments. 
i. is one of the problems ahead of 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield. 
Mr. DON' H. CLAUSEN. The gentle-
man is suggesting then that through this 
beefing-up process we in effect are going 
to have to sponsor political organiza-
tional information and in effect develop 
a political offensive where the Federal 
system of government, that has worked 
successfully in this country, can be im-
plemented in those areas. But it is going 
to require people who understand the 
Federal system of government to assist 
in implementing this concept in those 
areas where the problem exists. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I think the gentle-
man is correct. Some of these points are 
covered in my statement. 
At the present time, according to the 
State Department, the major instrument 
of U.S. policy toward Cuba is a sys-
tematic program of "economic denial," 
although this process is not likely to 
bring down the present regime. Infor-
mation train Cuba indicates?and this 
Is extremely important?that this eco-
nomic boycott is relatively successful but 
cannot be completely effective unless 
other free world countries cease trading 
with Cuba. 
For example, from 1963 to 1964 
Japan's trade with Cuba increased 240 
percent; Spain's by 300 percent. Eng-
land?one a our most notable and loyal 
allies?has increased her exports to Cuba 
by 130 percent. 
M. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
111r. PUCINSKI. I yield. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It could be 
said that with friends like this who needs 
enemies? 
Mr. PUCINSEL The gentleman is 
quite correct. 
Cuba is a bad economic risk for any 
trading nation. 
As early as 1963 Cuba's trade balance 
with bloc nations started to deteriorate 
with their deficit of $625 million. It was 
estimated that she owed the Soviet bloc 
more than $900 million in trade alone. 
In addition her debt for technical aid, 
arms, and so forth, is $1.5 billion to Rus-
sia; $430 million to Czechoslovakia; $250 
million to Poland; $85 million to Hun-
gary; $70 million to Rumania, and to 
several countries in the Western Hemi-
sphere another $165 million. 
In 1963 the tra,de balance of Cuba with 
Western cquntries was favorable in the 
amount of $65 million. However, this 
had to be used for other necessities, so 
Cuba is now almost with no dollar re-
serve. Last year she had only $20 mil-
lion in reserve and this year her finan-
cial situation will be much worse. 
The U.S.S.R. made two loans to her of 
$50 million and $16 million each at the 
end of 1964 to cover her letters of credit 
with Western countries and to buy basic 
materials pecessary to the sugar and 
nickel industries. At the end of 1964 
Cuba had exceeded her budget for im-
ports by $300 million, and the outlook 
for 1965 is far worse in spite of a nor-
mal sugar harvest. 
The biggest job we have ahead of us 
i$ to convince our free world allies Plat 
:by -trading with Cuba they are helping 
Perpetuate the Communist regime of Fi-
del Castro and helding the people of 
Cuba in a state of s'avery and despera-
tion.' Not only that, they are financing 
and support Communist propaganda and 
subversive activities originating in Cuba. 
Mr. DON H, CLATJ$EN. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I yield. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Could the 
gentleman tell me what the State De-
partment thinks of this comment? Are 
they doing something about this to fol-
low what the gentleman is now suggest-
ing? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I should like to lay 
these facts before the coordinate branch 
of the Government, the legislative branch 
of the Government here, this body. 
I should like to lay these facts before 
this body, as I am doing today on this 
12th anniversary, in order to show MY 
colleagues and the American people the 
full toll of letting the Communists re-
main in Cuba. 
It is my hope we will then be able to 
explore the reactions from the State De-
partment and the other interested 
agencies. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
'will the gentleman yield further? 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Yes, I yield to the 
gentleman from California. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Well, the 
gentleman has certainly provided Mem-
bers of Congress with an excellent rec-
ord. My only regret is that there are 
not more Members on the floor to hear 
the gentleman. We have less than six 
Members on the floor, in my judgment. 
It is very regrettable, because I believe 
every Member of Congress should have 
heard this fine special order that the 
gentleman has taken the time to prepare. 
Could the gentleman tell ,me if it Is 
possible to reveal the sources of the gen-
tleman's information? 
Mr, PUCINSKI. Much of this infor-
mation is Obtained from, as I have said 
before, newspaper reports, reports of re-
liable newspapers, published both in the 
United States and in South American 
countries. Much of this information is 
available from publicly documented 
sources that have come to our attention 
In the Cuban Freedom Committee, and 
much of this information is made avail-
able through the sources and the people 
who write to us, not only from Cuba but 
people who hear our broadcasts in other 
parts of South America and who have to 
rely in many instances upon these broad-
casts sponsored by the Cuban Freedom 
Committee which, incidentally, is a 
committee made up exclusively of Amer-
ican citizens, people, many of whom 
have never been to Cuba, although the 
executive director had been a teacher 
In Cuba before the Communists took 
over, as well as from informed letters 
which we receive from other countries in 
South America written by" peoplewho 
hear our broadcasts. 
As I stated earlier, our broadcasts may 
Serve in many instances as the only 
source of straight reliable world news, 
because this is primarily all we broad-
cast. We broadcast news from the world 
and the people of Cuba and the people of 
other South American countries who

ear these broadcasts which emanate

ot engage in propaganda, and we give 
them the truth. We give them news

le have learned to respect us for our 
integrity, and as a result they write in 
and most of the information that we get 
is from there very reliable sources. 
I wonder, if I may, just touch on this 
point because it may be of interest to 
the gentleman from California? The 
point I was going to make was this?
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It is of inter-
est to me because I have met the worthy 
organization which the gentleman is dis-
cussing and, furthermore, I have had 
some personal con;acts with people in 
these various countries of the world 
through a missionary program with 
which I worked for a number of years. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. And, of course, the 
missionaries very often are excellent in 
their analyses. 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. It seems to 
me that the people should know more 
about what is goir g on in these areas 
than the State Department. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. I think the gentle-
man would be interested to know that 
just a week ago radio Havana in a broad-
cast to Latin America--the gentleman 
asked me how we get this information?
said: 
We wish to inform you that starting July 
26 we will increase the number of frequencies 
through which we b?oadcast in Spanish to 
Latin America, Hortt America, and Central 
America. Besides the norMal frequencies 
you will be able to hear us on 25, 16, and '7 
megacycles." 
On July 21, Ramiro Puertas, Director 
of the Cuban Institute of Radio, an-
nounced over CMQ Havana, that this 
year the Institute will install a 150,000-
watt station tn Ha Jana and another of 
the same power in F. an German, Oriente; 
two other 60,000-watt stations in Cam-
aguey and Oriente Provinces for radio 
Rebelde network. On July 26, another 
10,000-watt station will be inaugurated 
in Guantanamo; still another 60,000-
watt station will be built in Cacocum, 
Oriente, for radio Progreso network, 
which will have an additional 5,000-watt 
stat ton in Baracoa. 
Also, they are installing French TV 
equipment to imprcve reception between 
Carnaguey, Guaimaro; and Victoria de 
las Tunas. It is important to know that 
this is French equipment?equipment 
being supplied to Communist Cuba by 
our supposed ally, F -ance. 
To show Cuba's importance to the 
Communists' dream of world domina-
tion, I will read you another news dis-
patch: 
The French Press Agency reported from 
Cairo on July 16 that the Cuban Ambassador 
to Egypt, before leav ng for home, had an-
nounced that a conference of popular move-
ments of three continents will be held in 
Havana on January 6, 1966. It had been de-
cided at the Pourth Afro-Asian Solidarity 
Conference in Accra in May to extend the 
movement to Latin America. Representa-
tives of popular Movements of six Latin 
Ameri an countries will participate in the 
prelinitnai y planning meetings which will 
begin in Cairo on September 1. The coun-
tries are: Juba, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay, 
Chile,: rine Guatemala. The planning corn-
znittees also will includes delegates of five 
Africati cpuntries: Egypt, Algiers, Morocco, 
Guinea, South Africa, and six Asian coun-
thes?sthe People's Republic: of China, the 
U.S.S.1., India, Indonesia, Japan, and South 
Vietnam. 
i 
There you have it, Mx. Speaker, in 
the hold broad strokes of Communist 
takeover under our very noses. Two 
years ago the United States seemed to be 
at least in some measure awake to the 
Cuban danger. Today, I fear we are let-
ing the immediate and close-to-home 
problem .;ake a secondary position in our 
planning and our defense. Mr. Speaker, 
I affirm to this House that in such a 
course lies hemispheric disaster. 
FRE4WE1EELING DISARMAMENT 
BINGE ENDANGERS NATIONAL SE-
CUM.] 'If 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previus order of the House, the gentle-
man from California [Mr. Hosmsa] is 
recognized for 40 minutes. 
Mr HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, disarma-
ment fei vor runs high in Washington 
todaY. The Arms Control and Disarma-
ment Agency's?ACDA?buclget has bal-
looned several hundred percent since its 
inception in 1961. Friends of Disarma-
ment from intellectual' and academic 
circles in large numbers have enlisted 
voluntariliy in the cause. Prof. Jerome 
Wiesner, the former White House sci-
ence lady .ser, recommends developing "a 
cadrq of people whose full-time occupa-
tion" is to reorient public attitudes. He 
want f them "to create a vested interest 
in arms control"?whatever that may 
meariitin ess forces in the United States who 
recognize the danger of unrestrained dis-
arm 
ent quickly organize and articu-
late hei , position, the administration's 
cad, of dedicated disarmers soon will 
take he Nation_past the point of no re-
turn Fn its flight from the proven strat-
egy o ar ning to avoid trouble to the yet 
unprever, strategy of disarming to avoid 
it. 
DISARMEI S WORK QUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY 
The dimrmers carry on their work un-
obtruisively. As yet the public is not 
conditior ed to disarmament. The ma-
jority, of Americans still believes world 
peacq as well as national survival de-
pends on strength coupled with negotia-
tion rather than negotiation alone. The 
average person is scared half out of his 
wits rhea some enterprising writer digs 
- 
out rad publicizes facts on various 
ACDsr onsored disarmament studies. 
This watt the case when things came 
to ligiat as the study on togetherness with 
Russia and its study suggesting self-im-
posellinitations on intelligence gather-
ing e orts. 
The work of Washington's disarmers 
is being made easier by the seemingly cal-
culated elimination of top military 
spokasmen capable of comunicating au-
thoritatively with the American public. 
Such popular figures as Admiral Arleigh 
"31 Knot" Burke and cigar-chomping 
Gen. Curtis LeMay are on the retired 
rolls. No successors have been permitted 
to develop public prominence. Probably 
not one person in a thousand can even 
name our present Chief of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
A tribute to the steady progress of the 
disarmers came recently in the form of a 
lack of outcry when a U.S. Ambassador 
to the U.N., the late Adled Stevenson, 
promised a further softening of the 
American position on test ban treaty 
safeguards. When negotiations for a 
comprehensive treaty broke off in 1963, 
U.S. demands for annual inspections in 
Soviet territory had been whittled from 
20 to 7. Khrushchev still adamantly 
maintained "three or four" would be 
ample. Stevenson promised that the 
Johnson administration now "is willing 
to explore" further what constitutes "an 
adequate inspection system." 
Public apathy toward the possible con-
sequences of the promise has encouraged 
and accelerated preparation of many 
other advanced disarmament positions, 
some of which President Johnson is ex-
pected to offer the Soviets when the 18-
nation Disarmament Conference recon-
venes in Geneva tomorrow. 
These include: 
MULTILATERAL NUCLEAR UMBRELLA 
This proposal calls for pledges by 
nuclear have-nu; nations to refrain from 
seeking nuclear capabilities in exchange 
for pledges from the U.N.'s nuclear 
"haves" to aid them if they fall victim to 
atomic aggression. Whether the occur-
rence of "aggression" is to be determined 
by the U.N.'s frequently paralyzed Gen-
eral Assembly, its veto-ridden Security 
Council, the nonnuclear victim or the 
nuclear pledgegiver is uncertain. 
TOTAL TEST BAN TREATY 
This proposal to enlarge the present 
limited test ban treaty to include a bar 
against tests underground as well as in 
other environments Would be based on 
"splitting the difference" between United 
States and U.S.S.R. inspection demands 
and fixing the number at five annually. 
Professor Wiesner and ACDA believe 
"five inspections per year will provide 
adequate security against clandestine 
nuclear testing." However, hearings of 
the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy 
cast considerable doubt on this optimistic 
assessment. Additionally, they raised 
monumental doubts whether even un-
limited opportunities for inspection 
could penetrate the precautions of a 
determined cheater. This is because the 
Soviets insist on severe limitations on 
factors affecting the quality as well as 
the quantity of inspections. These in-
clude tight restrictions on size and com-
position of inspection teams, allowable 
inspection techniques, permissible equip-
ment, mode and freedom of travel and 
communications, length of the inspection 
period and the like. 
DESTRUCTION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
Several years ago the disarmament 
concept of "we'll burn our bombers and 
you burn yours" was seriously con-
sidered. Its cu::Tent adaptation is ex-
pected to take the form of a proposal that 
the United States and 'U.S.S.R. junk

tion Subcommittee, in which the airlines 
were severely criticized for neglecting- the 
less_ profitable service to smaller cities. 
Additional economy services on highly 
traveled routes. 
Free stopover privileges. With such privi-
leges, a man flying from New York to Los 
Angeles might stop in Chicago for a few clays 
at no extra cost. The Board, which abolished 
these privileges in 1958 when the airlines 
were having financial problems, said that 
now that the airlines' finances had improved, 
they should be revived as a method of stimu-
lating vacation travel in the United States 
and from abroad. 
NO REACTION YET 
There has been no official reaction from 
the airline yet, but one industry source pri-
vately predicted "a very strong" one. 
, Addressing itself to air fares, the Board vir-
tually told the airlines to forget about any 
Increases and concentrate on reductions. 
After first noting that the rate of return 
Of the 11 domestic trunk carriers had risen 
to 10.6 percent in the 12 months ended 
March 31, 1965, the Board said: 
"In this setting, the Board believes it is 
difficutt ,to find justification for fare in-
? creases. }tall er, the CAB feels, the pres-
ent favorable earnings position of the airlines 
?offers an excellent opportunity for carriers 
therriselves to consider reductions in faxes or 
improvements in service without fare 
increases." 
The Board rejected two fare increase pro-
posals by American Airlines and United Air 
Lines, and ordered investigations of the 
proposals. 
Its remarks, which developed into a major 
policy statement, were attached to an order 
issued yestera,dy allowing certain airlines to 
put liberalized baggage allowances into effect 
$unday. 
FOREIGN FLIGIITS UNAFFECTED 
The Board's orders apply only to domestic 
airlines and have no effect on fares or services 
on overseas flights, which are negotiated 
among the world's airlines and then ap-
proved by the various governments. Its re-
marks were aimed primarily at the Nation's 
11 trunk carriers and do not apply to local-
service airlines. 
The new policy apparently grew out of the 
trunk carriers' relatively recent prosperity. 
, "Current earnings of the domestic trunk 
line carriers," the Board said, "are well above 
the 10.5 percent rate a return considered 
to be fair and reasonable in the Board's de-
cision of Novenkber ,25, 1960, in the general 
passenger fare Iuvestigation. 
"The 10.5 percent rate of return lias been 
reached in the 12 Months ended March 31, 
1965, and reports of current earnings show 
the trend continues strongly upward." 
In the year ended December 31, the airlines 
averaged an even 10 percent return, accord-
ing to a CAB spokesman. The percentage 
breakdown was as follows: 
American, 9.7; Eastern 2.7; TWA, 11.0;

Trans World reported yesterday that its 
revenues and earnings had set a second-
quarter record. It said its net earnings for 
the 3 months ended June rose 30.4 percent 
to $15,875,000 from $12,172,000 earned in the 
second, quarter a year ago. 
FOUR YEARS WERE LEAN 
The airlines, however, were not always so 
profitable. From 1960 to 1964 the four larg-
est trunks averaged a 3.9-percent return 
ivhile the others managed 7 percent. 
And in the 10-year period after 1955 the 
four giants?American, Eastern, TWA, and 
United?averaged 5.3 percent. The seven 
Others averaged 6.5 percent in the same 
period. 
A9.19080005-4 July 29, 1965 
The new prosperity is generally attributed 
to two major factors?the general business 
boom, now in its fifth year, and the advent 
of civilian jet passenger transports. 
Jets are faster, more comfortable, more 
reliable, and generally superior to the old 
piston-engined aircraft in use before 1958. 
They are cheaper to run and maintain and 
can be more effectively utilized. 
All these factors have led to higher profits. 
More and more passengers have been climb-
ing into the big jets. And in the airline 
business, every passenger after the break-
even point is 80-percent profit. 
However, a number of Government officials 
and agencies have been watching those 
profits. 
Earlier this year there was talk of a jet 
fuel tax. One Senator suggested the air-
lines take over the subsidies to the strug-
gling helicopter lines, which, indeed, the air-
lines have, to a certain extent. 
POST OFFICE ASKS REDUCTION 
And the Post Office Department, for whom 
the airlines have been carrying mail, has 
asked for a reduction in its payments to the 
airlines. Under the present rates, estab-
lished on June 7, 1955, the Post Office pays 
the major trunks $58.8 million a year. 
The Post Office made its proposal on 
December 2; 1964, and United Air Lines 
quickly proposed that the industry offer an 
8-percent reduction. This now appears 
likely to be accepted, according to Selig Alt-
schul, a consultant to the industry. 
If the new rate is accepted, the Post Office 
will pay about $54 million, or $5 million less. 
The reduction would affect the trunks plus 
the local-service airlines and cargo lines, but 
it represents a loss of only $132,000 for each 
local-service line and $27,000 for each cargo 
carrier. 
A spokesman for the Air Transport Asso-
ciation said the industry had only recently 
become very profitable and needed "adequate 
earnings" for a "protracted period." Pro-
tracted period means about 5 years to most 
airline men. 
The spokesman also said the industry had 
$2.4 billion worth of new airplanes on order, 
which will have to be paid for, in addition 
to the supersonic transports expected in the 
mid-1970's.

COMM 
ACE IN CUBA 4 
Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the 
current conflict in Vietnam is so serious 
that all Americans must be on their 
guard lest they forget the Communist 
menace in our own backyard?namely, 
the Communist bastion on the island of 
Cuba. In the current issue of Reader's 
Digest, there is a very pertinent reminder 
of the dangers we face, and indeed all 
the American nations face, from Com-
munist Cuba. This reminder takes the 
form of an article by Kenneth 0. Gil-
more entitled, "Cuba's Brazen Blueprint 
for Subversion." 
I ask unanimous consent that this 
article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CUBA'S BRAZEN BLUEPRINT FOR SUBVERSION 
(By Kenneth 0, Gilmore) 
Here is the inside story of Castro's most 
audacious attempt to establish communism 
on the mainland of Latin America. 
On the northern coast of Venezuela's 
Paraguana Peninsula, there is a lonely 
stretch of beach in a small inlet known as 
Macarna. Half a mile from this beach, in a 
two-room stucco hut, lives 24-year-old Lino 
Gerardo Amaya, a wiry, quiet campesino. On 
the morning of November 1, 1963, Lino and 
his 18-year-old brother, Pedro, set out along 
the beach in search of a lost goat. They came 
upon two men in bathing suits, standing on 
the shore looking out to sea. Beside them 
Was a shiny 16-foot aluminum boat with a 
handsome outboard motor. The taller of the 
two calmly waved his hand. "Hello, Prank, 
how are you? Don't you work for the Creole 
company?" 
"I'm not Frank," replied Lino, "and I never 
worked for Creole." 
Lino didn't find his goat that day. But 
shortly before 5 p.m. he and his brother head-
ed back to the beach, fishing poles in hand. 
All that day a thundercloud of suspicion had 
been building up in his mind. What were 
those two strangers up to? 
At the beach the brothers found the boat 
and outboard motor. And more. The coarse 
dark sand was scuffed with footprints?lots 
of footprints now etched by the lengthening 
shadows. And something else. A rope mark, 
its coils clearly imprinted in the sand, led 
from the water toward a tree. 
Lino followed the mark, Pedro behind him. 
At its end they spotted the corner of a piece 
of canvas. They pulled it up. Underneath 
lay a large dark bag. They dragged it out 
and loosened a thick drawstring. Four auto-
matic rifles. And layers of bulging cartridge 
belts. 
On hands and knees they pawed away more 
sand and found more sacks of rifles, more 
cartridge belts. And now that they looked 
harder, it was apparent that a large section 
of sand was loose and soft ahead of them. 
Lino sprang up. "We've got to tell the 
police," he said. 
BURIED TREASURE 
Shortly before 10 p.m. Lino arrived 
at the Jadacaquiva police station. He told 
his story to the prefect, Antonio Lug-5, Whd 
immediately relayed the news to Police Corn-
mandant Eusebio Olivares Navarrate, at 
Punto Fijo, the largest town on the penin-
sula. Olivares roared off for the lonely beach 
with five jeeploads of policemen. 
Soon the police were digging into the sand 
like pirates seeking lost treasure, grunting, 
heaving, hauling. In 15 minutes, Olivares 
had seen enough. He switched on the radio 
in his patrol car, gave the stunning news to 
the State Governor, Pablo Saher. 
It took 4 hours to hoist the entire deposit 
from its temporary grave. The hole in the 
g rund was 8 feet deep, 6, feet wide and 
90 feet long. The cache?automatic rifles, 
machineguns, antitank guns, Mortars, ba-
zookas, demolition charges and thousands 
of rounds of ammunition?weighed 3 tons. 
In Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, Presi-
dent ROmulo Betancourt was awakened at 
home and briefed by phone. He ordered a 
naval patrol of the peninsula and sent a 
special alert to every security and military 
agency in the, country. For 2-years Fidel Cas-
tro had boasted that he would export his 
Cuban revolution to the mainland of South 
America. Oil-rich Venezuela was his prime 
target. "With victory in Venezuela," cried 
Cuba's old-line Communist boss Blas Roca, 
"we shall no longer be a solitary island in 
the Caribbean confronting the Yankee im-
perialists." Castro-trained guerrillas or 
Venezuela's Communist Armed Forces of Na-
tional Liberation (FALN) had terrorized the 
countryside in an attempt to paralyze the 
nation. They had dynamited oil pipelines 
and bridges, burned stores and warehouses, 
robbed banks, raided police stations, kid-
naped and murdered offilals and blasted 
the streets with sniper and machinegun 
fire. More than 50 policemen had been cut 
down in the streets of Caracas alone, and 
twice as many civilians. 
But never before had the FALN been 
equipped with mortars and bazookas. Obvi-
ously something special was afoot.

I recently 4ove 1 back to the East Coast

$18. In addition the west coast service was 
on Lockheed Elea ea and Boeing 707 while

I support yuLa urging a CAB investiga-

BROOKLYN, N.Y., 
July 21, 1965. 
DEAR SENATOR KENNEDY: Congratulations 
on your suggestion that an investigation is 
needed in ccinne ation with the air service 
between Bohton and Washington. I've 
stopped flying this route. It's just= too ex-
pensive. I drive nstead. 
But don't stop with Boston-New York 
service. The Ne e York-Washington routes 
likewise have become too expensl.ve. We 
don't need frills cr jets on these short routes. 
Low fares and frequency of service will bring 
In. the custOmers. You rightly c:ompared 
these serviceP w th the very excellent Los 
Angeles-San Francisco service which is also 
a real travel laarg sin. Perhaps those western 
airlines should be invited to come east and 
set up shop here, 
Frankly, I think our airlanes in the Bos-
ton-New York-Washington area are danger-
ously overcrowd( d. More attentio:a should 
be given toviard improving the rad service 
on these short-haul runs so that there will 
be enough air space for the longer domestic 
air routes. 
Why, fortemple, do we have to wait for 
more rail s clies and surveys? With the 
existing rail eqt ipment and road beds we 
could speed 'up ? the service from New York 
to either Boston or Washington by simply 
eliminating all tee stops between New York 
and Boston and Washington. The planes 
fly nonstop. WLy can't we have one non-
stop train letving New York in the morning 
and one in the evening bound for Boston 
and Washington. The Merchants Limited 
presently mikes five stops between Grand 
Central and South Statin. Allowing 10 
minutes loss for each stop, I would guess that 
the schedule could be speeded up by 50 min-
utes if these five stops were eliminated. The 
train speed would not haee to be increased. 
It could be advertised as "Downtown to 
Downtown" express service 
I realize that solutions o our transporta-
tion problems are not an. easy, thing and 
that there are many problems involved about 
which the average person such as myself are 
not aware. However, I am heartened that 
you are at least trying to get something done 
about the poor transportation in this area. 
Sincerely, 
LEO M. SCHARIO, Jr.

Ase FARE MYSTERY 
Senator EDWARD KENNEDY'S demand for an 
investigation of the Washington-New York-
Boston air shuttle service has let in some 
much-needed light on a mystifying subject. 
When Eastern Air Lines began this highly 
popular service in 1961, the rate was $14 for 
a trip between here and New York. A seat 
was guaranteed to each passenger, with no 
reservation needed, even if a second plane 
had to be ordered. Such a cheap com-
muter run carried an understandable appeal. 
The effect was to lure business away frons 
competitors and give Easeern an 80 percent 
monopoly, according to Senator KENNEDY. 
But since then Eastera has successively 
raised the fare to the point where, at $18, it 
exceeds the price for some conventional 
flights. An airline spokesman cites costs 
of standby planes and crews among the rea-
sons for this. 
Without condemning Eastern out of hand, 
it remains a curious fact that airlines are 
now flying, passengers between Los Angeles 
and San Francisco?a 340-mile trip?for 
$13.50 plus tax, using jets. Is the shorter 
Washington-New York piston-plane run so 
much more costly to operate? 
Two rival airlines, United and TWA, have 
applications now pending before the Civil 
Aeronautics Board to hegin unrestricted 
Washington-New York-Boston flights. A 
United spokesman adds that jets would be 
used, and that a fare not exceeding the Los 
Angeles-San Francisco rate is contemplated 
for Washington to New 'Fork. 
The decision on jets must await results of 
a study by the Federal Aviation Agency of 
National Airport, due by December. But it 
seems obvious that a little more competition 
on this lucrative, heavily traveled route 
would benefit the public.

AIRLINES TOLD To PUT PROSPERITY INTO 
LOWER FARES?CAB ALSO TELLS CARRIERS 
To ADD COACH SEATS AND ALLOW FREE STOP-
OVERS 
(By Frederic C. Appel) 
The Civil Aeronautics Board told the Na-
tion's airlines yesterday that they were mak-
ing too much money and, should start pass-
ing some of It on to the consumer in the 
form of lower fares and better service. 
The Board said It thought the following 
improvements could be made: 
Lower fares on short trips. The Board 
noted that the new short-range jets now 
coming into use had lower operating costs 
that could make possib:e lower fares over 
routes such as that between New York and 
Washington. 
More coach seats. The Board suggested a 
higher ratio of coach seats to first-class seats 
to reflect the public's desire. Last year 76 
percent of domestic air passengers flew coach, 
according to the Air Transportation Associa-
tion. The Board also ca:.led for more coach 
service into more communities. 
More service to smaller cities, This sug-
gestion was apparently a reaction to a hear-

July 29, 1965 CQNORESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
(Digepol), Chief of investigation Orlando 
Garcia Vazquez studied a surveillance report 
that had just come to his desk. It was late 
Monday afternoon November 3, exactly 48 
hours after Lino had looked under the can-
vas. The report disclosed that at 10: 30 
a.m, that day a young woman known to have 
Communist connectians was seen near the 
home of Eduardo Machado, a Venezuelan 
Communist Party boss. She was followed 
to a cafe op Negrin Street, where she sat 
chatting with three men. Fifty minutes 
later all four drove to a complex of four 
housing units known as "UrbanizaciOn 
Simon Rodriguez." 
The woman strolled to building No. 1 and 
took the outside elevator to a fourth-floor 
apartment, No. 49. Her campanions loitered 
In the area, making sure she was not being 
followed. Two hours later she came back to 
the car and sped to the old section of the 
city, where she was observed talking with 
several leaders of Central University's Com-
munist-Controlled student federation, some 
of whom had recently returned from Cuba. 
Inspector Garcia was sure apartment No. 
49 was "hot." Too many precautions had 
been. taken, "I :think we had better hit this 
place as soon as possible," he told his boss. 
Shortly after midnight five Digepol agents 
? in two groups sauntered toward building 
No. 1, chatting and laughing as if returning 
from a party. Garcia and two agents took 
the elevator to the fourth floor, while the 
others climbed the stairs, the only other exit. 
, Garcia knocked gently at apartment 49. 
There was a shuffling of slippers. The door 
opened a crack, revealing a middle-aged 
woman in a nightgown. 
"We've come with a search warrant," said 
Garcia shouldering his way in. "Is anyone 
else here?" , 
"No," she replied. 
In a bedroom they found a young man in 
bed. "Stay very still," warned Garcia. "Who 
are you?' 
"German LOpez Mendez," the man replied, 
and handed over his identification card. No. 
618945--GermAn Lapez Mendez?born No-
vember 27, 1941-5 feet, 6 inches?hair, 
brown?eyes, brown. On the left-hand 
corner was pasted a small mug shot: a slim 
face, placid eyes, thin mustache, wavy hair. 
It matched the man. 
"What's your occupation?" Garcia asked. 
"I'm a teacher. Just visiting here for a 
Conple of days." 
"Okay, don't move while we search," Garcia 
said, 
' =LE ow Vaaoa 
The men began to hunt, opening closets, 
pulling out drawers, looking under beds and 
in toilet tanks. Under one corner of the 
suspect's bed two objects were extracted: 
the first, a small light-blue airline traveling 
bag full of drawing equipment and mate-
rials?ink pens, tracing paper, rulers, com-
passes, crayons. 
"What are you doing with these?" Garcia 
asked LOpez. 
"I've never seen them before," Lopez an-
swered, as if bored. 
At first, Garcia thought the second item 
was a Bible. Book-size, it was enclosed in a 
dark, brown leather case with a zipper on 
three sides, the kind of covering often used 
for a Bible. Inside was a looseleaf notebook. 
Garcia flipped through some '70 pages. He 
found that he was holding an instructor's 
manual on the handling of arms and explo-
sives?an PAIR "bible." 
Garcia glanced at the man on the bed. 
"This belong to you?" 
"No." 
About 6 am, Garcia returned to headquar-
ters With hia two suspects. "Keep search-
ing," Pe told tWo, agents left behind. "Mat-
tresses, pillows, everything. When you're fin-
ished, start all over again. There's bound 
to be more than we've founsi." 
No. 138-20 
Digepol's files indicated that the woman, 
who claimed to be a nurse, was a contact for a 
fugitive FALN leader. The man who called 
himself Lopez was fingerprinted, and a search 
through the flies disclosed his real identity: 
Luis Eduardo Sanchez Madero, age 24. On 
the margins of the FALN sabotage manual 
were notes jotted down in his handwriting, 
among them a precise schedule of his last 
day of instruction on October 21: 6 a.m.?
rise; 8 to 12?courses in artillery and mortar; 
2 to 6 p.m.?training in recoilless rifle, ba-
zooka and maohinegun and cryptography; 
8 to 10?study; 11?bedtime. 
PUZZLE BECOMES PICTURE 
Meanwhile, at apartment 49, an agent had 
found, taped to the bottom of a desk drawer, 
a 2-inch-thick stack of papers. Included 
in the material were lengthy descriptions 
of arms and explosives plus an intricate 
checklist for pulling off a successful sabotage 
or kidnaping operation: escape routes, floor 
plans, guards, alarm systems, cover stories, 
hiding places. There was also a large map 
of Caracas showing every street and major 
building in the city, and four pieces of 
transparent paper?overlays for the map?
dotted by rectangles, circles, arrows, asterisks, 
crosses, parallel bars and triangles. 
What did it all mean? Garcia and his 
men studied these and other items, zeroing 
in on several papers crisscrossed with neat-
ly ruled lines. At the top of each perpen-
dicular column were large letters: "F," the 
symbol for fusil, Spanish for rifle; "PERS" 
for persons; "M" for mortar; "Car" for 
cafione sin retroceso?recoilless rifle; and 
"B" for bazooka. The same type of arms 
found at Macama. 
More notes were studied, such as a list of 
apartment buildings, offices and streets with 
specific designations of weapons. These 
numbers were compared. The map was 
pulled out, and the overlays with their sym-
bols were arranged and rearranged. At last 
the puzzle became a picture. The rectangu-
lar figure meant "artillery," the triangle 
"fixed group," the open circle "troop posi-
tions," the slanted parallel lines "barricade," 
the cross "emergency station," the five-sided 
figure surrounded by arrows "object of at-
tack." Sanchez Madero had drawn up a 
detailed plan for attack upon Caracas using 
the weapons delivered at Macama. 
The Urdaneta barracks was the prime ob-
jective. A walled fort perched on the city's 
highest ground, it held a concentration of 
troops. Here also were tanks, near a jail 
holding top FALN terrorists. The scheme: 
isolate the troops and free the prisoners 
to join in the attack. This 1 phase of the 
operation called for 3 artillery units, 6 fixed 
groups of 3 to 4 men, 3 mobile groups plus 
positioning of 12 FALN troop units in care-
fully chosen locations. Assigned to do the 
job were 374 men, 195 rifles, 8 mortrars, 12 
bazookas, 4 recoilless rifles, 75 machineguns. 
Apartment houses near the barracks were 
selected, from which snipers and machine 
gunners could pick off soldiers trying to reach 
jeeps and armored cars. Mortars would 
knock out key exits, sabotage units would 
cut telephone lines, seize power stations and 
blow up vital streets; bazookas and recoilless 
rifles would be waiting for tanks?if they 
made it through the carnage. 
FANTASTIC? 
At Miraflores Palace the attack plan was 
laid before President Betancourt. "To those 
of us who have witnessed "FALN's murder 
and arson for 3 years, it doesn't seem so 
shocking," he confided to a colleague. "But 
this is going to look fantastic to the outside 
world," 
Indeed, the question was: Would the "out-
side world" believe it? Could they prove 
conclusively where the plan had originated, 
where the arms had come from? 
The first point hinged on Sanchez Madero. 
18143 
An exhaustive check of all airline listings was 
undertaken. It was a long shot but it paid 
off. Sanchez Madero had fled from Venezuela 
to Jamaica on March 5, 1962, listed as "Luis 
E. Sanchez M.," after an armored-car robbery 
in which his fingerprints were found. In 
Jamaica he had boarded a KLM special flight, 
No. 977 from Kingston to Havana, Cuba. He 
had cockily given the airline his destination 
address: House of Americas (headquarters 
in Havana for the infamous Institute of 
People's Friendship, the processing agency for 
Cuba's Latin American terrorist trainees). 
Tracing of the arms was turned over to the 
Venezuelan Army. An elaborate effort had 
been made to disguise the weapons. All 
serial numbers had been ground off. Near 
the trigger of each rifle, a hole had been cut, 
obviously to remove the insignia. But whose 
insignia? 
Several of the weapons were rushed to 
Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre at 
Herstal-lez-Liege, Belgium, whose trade-
mark had been left on. Fabrique Nationale, 
the largest private arms manufacturer in the 
Weatern World, had flied on order by the 
Cuban Army for 22,500 automatic rifles on 
March 23, 1959. Now company experts 
examined the rifles dug up at Macama and 
reported that "the coat of arms of Cuba was 
stamped in the place where a cut has been 
made." Moreover, the Cuban weapons had 
their serial numbers uniquely located on the 
left side of the trigger guard, as these had 
been before they were ground off. Rifles with 
these characteristics had never been delivered 
to any country but Cuba. 
As for the 31 "UZI" 9-mm. machineguns, 
the Belgian company also confirmed that they 
had been bought by Cuba. But the Vene-
zuelans went a step further. Where a qeal  
had obviously been ground away, an etching 
solution was applied. Slowly the chemical 
made decipherable the outlines of a legend. 
Under a magnifying glass an ornate crest 
could be distinguished?the crest of the 
Cuban Army. 
The case was airtight. At was time to bring 
charges. 
IRREFUTABLE PROOF 
The wood-paneled main council room of 
the Pan American Union Building, 4 blocks 
from the White House in Washington, D.C., 
was packed on December 3, 1963. Venezuela 
had called the Organization of American 
States into emergency session to charge Cuba 
with aggression. Ambassador Enrique Te-
jera-Paris of Venezuela was speaking: "The 
people of Venezuela have been the constant 
victims of the insults and attacks of Cuba's 
Castro regime, Now in the face of the new 
act of aggression by Cuba, for which there is 
definite and irrefutable proof, Venezuela is 
forced to take this action." 
An investigating commission was immedi-
ately set up, composed of representatives of 
Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay 
and the United States. On December 8, the 
commission flew to Caracas, along with a 
team of military advisers. There they heard 
detailed accounts from a score of witnesses 
ranging from Minister of National Defense 
Gen. Antonio Bricerio to Juan DeDios Marin, 
a young Venezuelan who had been in Cuba 
for several months receiving military training 
in the handling of arms and guerrilla 
tactical 
Venezuelan Army officials picked out weap-
ons at random, and before the eyes of the in-
vestigators demonstrated how the Cuban in-
signia could be raised chemically. Ward P. 
Allen, chief U.S. representative, was espcially 
curious about the aluminum skiff and out-
board motor that had been left behind on 
the beach that first morning by the two

La Tribune, a major newspaper in Lima,

ext step: that is, what kind of action will

tined intervention?" 
Incredibly, the answer to that question 
as in grave doubt. Several Latin corm-
ries balked at imposing firm measures

ept of nonintervention which had originated 
ears before Soviet ccnununism moved into 
he hemisphere. Principal backsliders were 
exico, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil, 
all of whom at the tune maintained diplo-
matic relations with Cuba. 
BANCTIONS--OR NOT? 
Venezuela would not be put off, and pressed 
for s foreign ministers' conference of the 
20 American Republics to punish Castro. It 
called for mandatory steps such as cutting 
off all trade, air travel and diplomatic rela-
tions with Cuba. "If the OAS does not apply 
sanctions to Castro's Cuba, it means the 
bankruptcy of dem ecracy and the inter-
American system," warned Venezuela's For-
eign Minister Marcos Falcen Briceno.

Tee THEENT REMAINS 
Whether this provision will be used for 
direct retaliation against the Cuban sanc-
tuary is , quite another matter. Just last 
November representatives of Latin American 
Communtst 2arties slipped into Havana to 
map out a beta new strategy with the Soviets 
to accelerate Red-revolutions. A secret dec-
laration treleased In Moscow 2 months later) 
was signed prcanising "active aid" to "free-
dom fighters' in Colombia, Guatemala, Hon-
duras, Mraguay, Panama, Haiti, and Vene-
zuela. 
Operatione center for this guerrilla warfare 
Is Cuba's subversion and espionage agency, 
the DGe (whose biggest unit promotes Latin 
revolutions), advised by at least five Soviet 
Intelligence specialists. Squads of Latin 
Americans ere trained by the DGI's Depart-
ment of Special Schools. This department 
and other Cuban organizations have turned 
out at least 5,000 graduates. "This training 
today represent the most serious threat to 
democracy in Latin America," says Assist-
ant Seeretery of State for inter-American 
Affairs Jac. H. Vaughn. "We know of cases 
where 'the individuals of a given country 
trained; in Cuba return by the hundreds. 
Theszhteople form a cadre of guerrilla units, 
and , larger the number, the greater the 
threat ultmately that they will make a 
move.'?' 
' AS APPALLING SCOREBOARD 
The seoleboard of riots, bombings, asses-
sinatiqns, violence and espionage emanating 
from pubs is appalling. In Guatemala a 
band Of terrorists with a hard-core strength 
of abhut 300 men roams the mountains with 
headqparters in the Lake Izabal region. Five 
Of them eecently burned the U.S.-aid-pro-
gram !garege in Guatemala City, gutting 23 
vehicles. Last February during a festive pa-
rade in ti e capital, ten Guatemalan soldiers 
were ;killed by a grenade lobbed into the 
back ef their truck. Chief of these guerrillas 
is stocky, tough :Marco Antonio Yon Sousa 
who 4as secretly received $200,000 from the 
DGI. 
A eontngent of Panamanian communists 
recently went bank to Cuba for a second 
round ce guerrilla instruotion, while even 
mord are preparing to journey to Havana. 
Next door in Colombia, banditry and kid-
nappings, once confined to remote rural re-
gion*, are closing in on the cities. Former 
Cabinet Minister Harold eider was grabbed 
by 4idm,ppers and a $250,000 price put on 
his ittead even though he had been murdered 
before tie =son' demand. A newly orga-
nized Iluban-backed Army of National 
Liberation (ELN) directs much of this vio-
lende. in Moscow, Pravda propagandizes that 
events in Colombia are "very little different 
Iron t thi dirty war being fought in Vietnam." 
Finally, look at the grim tragedy in the 
Do inloan. Republic. In classic style a band 
of killed communists swifty exploited an 
exptoeit e chaotic revolution. At least 77 
knOwn communists were 'pinpointed and, as 
Pride at Johnson has disclosed, "two of the 
priMe : eaders In the rebel forces were men 
with. a ,ong history of communist association 
and insurrections." He noted that many 
of She 'conspirators" were "trained in Cuba" 
anti., "seeing a chance to increase disorder, 
to lgair, a Mothold, joined the revolution."

WHERE NEXT 
Where will the graduates of the Soviet-
Cuban Communist combine strike next? 
Where within our hemisphere will U.S. 
soldiers have to be sent next to avert a Com-
munist coup while Havana and Moscow have 
a propaganda field day? And will we and our 
friends be able to discover and act against 
the next blueprint for subversion before it 
is too late? 
No one can say?so long as an operations 
center for "wars of liberation" functions 
with impunity in Cuba. Time and time 
again our officials haee said this subversion 
"must stop," yet it continues. Our words 
and warnings are scorned, and we go on 
merely reacting to one Cuban-fomented 
foray after another. 
One long-overdue solution is for the OAS 
to modernize its rules and machinery so that 
it can act swiftly against Communist "inter-
ventions." Otherwise' Latin countries must 
accept United States fast action when lives 
and liberties of nations are In the balance, as 
In the Dominican Republic. 
Another solution lies in tightening the 
economic noose around Cuba. Considering 
the mess communism has made of the Cuban 
economy, experts say it would collapse within 
weeks if most outsits assistance was cut off. 
Why, for example, should we permit a pro-
cession of Soviet oil tankers to steam into 
the Caribbean to fuel Cuba's industries and 
utilities so that this springboard for sub-
version can survive? And why should we 
allow non-Communist nations to furnish 
vital items-867 shiploads since 1963? 
When Secretary of State Dean Rusk called 
for sanctions against Cuba last summer, he 
pointed out that "subversion supported by 
terror, sabotage, and guerrilla action is as 
dangerous a form of aggression as an armed 
attack." And he added these signiiicant 
words: "Today it is Venezuela which is under 
attack. Is there any one of us who can say 
with assurance, '1; cannot be my country 
tomorrow'?" 
THE ORDEAL OF OTTO O'iEPICA 
Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in 
the current issue of Readers' Digest, 
there appears an article entitled "The 
Ordeal of Otto Otepka." This article 
relates in summary form the outrageous 
case of the treatment of a dedicated se-
curity officer in the State Department 
whose honesty, loyalty, and perseverance 
in his job were rewarded with abuse in 
the form of police-state tactics and ul-
timately, in an order of discharge. The 
appeal from the order of discharge is still 
pending. The :Injustices recited by this 
article, which are substantiated in great 
detail by the series of hearings currently 
being released by the Senate Internal 
Security Subcommittee, constitute a 
blight on our Government and the bu-
reaucratic, cliquish factionalism into 
which we have permitted it to degen-
erate. Both the Congress and the Amer-
ican people have an obligation to Mr. 
Otepka to see that this injustice is 
righted, but they have an even greater 
obligation to themselves and their pos-
terity to eradicate the defects in the 
system which j3ermit our Government to 
be so perverted. 
I ask unanimous consent that this 
article be printed in the RECORD at the 
conclusion of my remarks. 
There being; no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

flow periods on the river. 
Warner pointed out that conditions change 
with the times. He said if the Tuscaloosa 
plant were to be built today it would be con-
structed below the city, not at its present 
location. He also said. the Warrior Lock and 
Dam should have been located farther down 
stream below the industrial plants. 
Yoder pointed out that the new system at 
the Demopolis plant was constructed in spite 
of the fact that no immediate expansion is 
planned and that the mill was under no pres-
sure to improve its waste disposal system. 
The system involved an investment of over 
a million dollars. Operating it and monitor-
ing the river require an annual expense of 
$48,000. 
Dr. Myers said it was gratifying to see such 
a major step taken on .pollution. 
The mill, located about 8 miles south 
Of Demopolis, is surrounded by elaborate 
pohding and clarifying facilities each dedi-
cated to the treatment' of a specific type of 
Waste water from the various stages ?of 
manufacture. Into one lagoon goes water 
that contains no harmful materials but 
Which needs to be cooled before returning 
to the river. 
In a secon?facility, a huge clarifier, 266 
feet in diameter, removes solids such as wood 
fibers that. would otherwise "flow into the 
river. 
The third oPeration involves a 56-acre 
lagoon which impounds waste water contain-
ing non-fibrous material from the wood that 
could be harmful to the stream. This effluent 
can be retained for periods up to two weeks, 
during which time its harmful properties are 
dissipated It is then metered back into the 
river at a rate determined by the flow of the 
stream. 
Even before water needed by the mill is 
' sent to the waste treatment plants, it has 
been used over and over throughout the mill. 
The mill, uses 16 million Eallons of water 
daily, but if it were not for this recycling at 
various Stages of production, the demand 
would be 25 million gallons a day. 
Although no mill expansion is planned at 
Demopolis, the new waste treatment system 
is designed to take care of a greater future 
load. 
To the east of the mill a small lake allows 
the cooling of water that has become heated 
In condensing stearn produced in the 
chemical recovery section of the mill. This 
lagoon also serves as a safety check to guard 
against any mishaps that might endanger the 
condition of the river, Should such upset 
Conditions occur, a sensing system automati-
cally sounds an alarms and shuts off the dis-
charge valve at the lagOon. 
Tour million gallons of water can be 
processed daily here. Now covering nine 
acres with a 20-million-gallon capacity, the 
pond can readily be enlarged to 25 acres with 
105-million-gallon capacity. 
On the opposite side of the mill is the 
clarifier which handles 10 million gallons 
of water a day. Water fed into this system-
' contains solid materials such as fibers, lime, 
and clays that have slipped through in the 
Washing, bleaching, and forming processes. 
Such materials, if allowed to flow into the 
river, would use up vital dissolved oxygen 
and create sludge beds. 
The clarifier is a huge, dish-shaped instal-
lation, 266 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep 
at the center. Mill water is Pumped to the 
center surface, from which point it flows out-
ward,tp the rim, spilling over the edges. In 
the Meanwhile, 99 percent of the solids have

arms concentrate the sludge in the deepest 
part. Heavy-duty puinps then remove the 
sludge. 
These concentrated ,Solids are pumped to a 
nearby filter house where more water is 
removed, leaving a wet cake of solid material 
to be clumped in a nearby impoundment. 
At present there is no 'practical use for these 
solids, but experiments are being coriducted 
to see if they can be transformed into a 
useful byproduct. 
Behind the clarifier stretches the 59-acre 
Surface of the strong waste lagoon. Here is 
collected effluent that has a stronger con-
centration of oxygen-absorbing materials. 
The wastes are held for a period up to 2 
weeks, during which time areation and bac-
terial action reduce the oxygen demand. 
At the end of the treatment period the 
water is released to the river at a carefully 
controlled rate. The strong waste system 
is designed to be modified as technical ad-
vances are made in the field of effluent 
control. 
In addition to the three-way treatment 
system and the constant checking and 
double-checking that goes on at the plant, 
Gulf States technicians keep a close watch 
on the river itself. Daily checks are made 
on the river's flow and of the dissolved oxygen 
content of the water. 
In periods of low water this monitoring 
process becomes almost constant and the lab 
boat travels 50 miles downstream from the 
plant and 5 miles upstream. Samples of 
water are taken at 16 different points and 
5 tests are made on each sample.

produces up to 400 tons of gleaming white 
board daily, chiefly for the folding carton

DEAR MR. BURTON: Please vote against re-
peal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
This is the recommendation of the West-
ern States Meat Packers Association. 
It is an American tradition not to force 
citizens to join any organization?lodge, 
club, church, association, or labor union. 
Freedom to choose for oneself is a prin-
ciple which has been instrumental in making 
the United States the richest Nation on 
earth. Let's not give up this great freedom. 
Responsible labor unions win their mem-
bership by constructive leadership. It is not 
esSential to the success of labor unions to 
have mandatory membership. 
Labor unions have continued to grow pow-
erful under the Taft-Hartley Act. As you 
know, labor organizations are not subject 
to antitrust laws. Repeal of section 14(b) 
wohld give them an added monopoly to the 
detriment of the public welfare. 
Your vote against repeal of section 14(b) 
will be greatly appreciated.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 1965 
Mr. BOB WILSON. Mr. Speaker, un-
der leave to extend my remarks in the 
RECORD, I include the following article 
from the San Diego Union of July 24, 
1965: 
CUBA'S ROAD TO RUIN?CASTRO PROMISES 
BRING ENSLAVEMENT 
(EDrroa's NOTE.?The Very Reverend John 
J. Kelly, of St. Augustine's high school, San 
Diego, lived in Cuba from 1943 to 1959. For 
9 years, until he was forced out by Prime 
Minister Fidel Castro in April 1959, Father 
Kelly was president of the Catholic university 
there.) 
(By the Very Reverend John J. Kelly) 
Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro cele-
brates his 12th anniversary of his revolt on 
Monday. 
On 'July 26, 1953, about 100 idealistic young 
Cubans attacked a military barracks in Mon-
cada, Santiago de Cuba, in an unsuccessful 
and apparently scatterbrained attempt to 
open armed hostility against the government 
of Fulgencio Batista. A small hard-core 
group escaped, including Fidel and his 
brother, Paul. They surrendered and their 
lives were saved through the intercession of 
the archbishop of Santiago, the Most Rev-
erend Enrique Perez Serantes, 
The Batista government pardoned and ex-
iled these conspirators in 1955, only to have 
the pardoned exiles return 18 months later 
from. Mexico for a new armed invasion, De-
cember 2, 1956. The group of about 90 was 
detected and almost annihilated by the 
Cuban armed forces, but again, Fidel, Paul 
and the hard-core group escaped into the hills 
of the Sierra Maestra in eastern Cuba. 
There they managed to hold out for 2 
years, while the Cuban people became in-
creasingly dissatisfied with the Batista ad-
ministration. 
Although Cuba was never so prosperous 
economically as in 1957-58, Cubans looked 
for someone to lead them in a political revo-
lution to overthrow Batista. In spite of his 
known criminal record, Fidel Castro became 
accepted as the ideal leader for that revolu-
tion, and he sat defiantly on his mountain 
top, very inacessible to the armed forces of 
Cuba, but readily accessible to that sector 
of the world press which wittingly or un-
wittingly favors leftist causes. 
The vast majority of Cuban people sup-
ported Castro then because he promised free 
elections, honesty in government and a re-
turn to the constitution of 1940. These 
promises were deliberate, calculated lies, such 
as his shortwave clandestine broadcast: 
EVIDENCE LACKING 
"We are not a Communist group. The 
government accuses us of that to get your 
support; we are Cubans who hate Batista 
more than you do and want to get him out 
and restore free elections, honesty and the 
constitution to our nation." 
Much of the propaganda of. the Castro 
military victories was of like nature. There 
is no evidence that Castro won any decisive, 
large-scale military victory; there is much 
evidence to the contrary that the Cuban 
armed forces, by and large, were demoralized, 
corrupt and unwilling to fight. 
The victory over Batista was not Castro's 
so much as it was that of the Cuban people. 
Professionals, students, middle class and 
upper class were conned Into helping Castro. 
He had no proletariat, no union help. The

*XTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
IN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
E :SOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Yuesday, July 27, 1965 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. ?Speaker, on 
Wednesday, July 7th, Mr. Thomas 
J. Foley of the Los Angeles Times 
wrote an article which was published 
In the Washington Post setting forth his 
views Fn the disagreement by Congress-
man ATuunq with Chairman William 
McChesney Martin, Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
The, article follows: 
PATiviiirst JABS AT MARTIN CARRY LITTLE 
WEIGHT 
(By Thomas J. Foley) 
When_ W lliam McChesney Martin, Chair-
man oi the Federal Reserve Board, was asked 
to conimer t the other day on Representa-
tive WRIGHT PATMAN'S demand that he re-
sign, a Smila broke across his face. 
Despite c ifferences, Martin said in all good 
humor i "I'm always able to maintain friend-
ly relaidorn with Mr. PATMAN and I hope to 
continue to do so." 
"I'm alw Iys pleased," Martin said, "when 
Mr. PA.MA C shows interest in the Federal 
Reserve." 
4 AL WAYS SHOWING INTEREST 
Marin. Cf course, was being a gentleman. 
But to hoss acquainted with him and his re-
lations 'wit; Mr. PATMAN, the comment had 
a barb, bleause PATMAN, the 71-year-old 
Texas Democrat, who heads the House Bank-
ing and Cu Tency Committee is always show-
ing interes , in the Federal Reserve. 
Mart n's tone, and his smile, moreover, 
were sOmel hing more than condescending. 
And wdll tney might have been. 
For 4artin knew, and his immediate listen-
ers knew, that despite PATMAN'S seniority?
only three Congressmen in the 435-Member 
House have served longer than his 36 years?
and deSpite PATMAN'S position as chairman 
of the , Banking Committee, the Congress-
man's xlemind for Martin to resign carries 
about vs rr uch weight as the pages of the 
CONGRESSIO CAL RECORD on whioh it was 
printed. 
The incic ant serves as an example of how 
potentild power can be diluted, as PATMAN'S 
has ovek th3 years. 
KNOWS HIS STRENGTH 
It is d.out tful, of course, whether a demand 
from any Member of Congress right now 
would prompt Martin to resign. He knows 
his strength, which is considerable, and his 
standing in President Johnson's eyes, which 
is also donsiderabIe. 
This ls no reflection on PATMAN'S integrity, 
which ,is high, nor does it bear on the 
merits pf tis case against Martin. 
,,ITTLE ATTENTION PAID ? 
What, it does mean is that PATMAN has re-
buked rind berated big bankers in general 
and th Federal Reserve Board in particular 
Approved For Release 
pays much attention to him any more. 
Seldom a week goes by, it often seems, 
that PATMAN does not inveigh at length 
against them. 
The main thrust of his arguments is al-
ways the same?that these groups want high 
interest rates and that these rates are the 
ruination of everything that is good. 
'Again, whether this is true is beside the 
point. The repetition of the argument, and 
usually in strong uncompromising terms, has 
cost PATMAN his audience. 
RECOGNIZES PROBLEM 
PaTaxeux himself--to his credit?recognizes 
to some degree wbot the problem is. In the 
speech, he also said "think hard, think long, 
my colleagues. I am not making a plea 
for a pet peeve Of WRIGHT PATMAN'S." 
At another point, he said, "well, you will 
say, this is another one of PATMAN'S diatribes 
against William McChesney Martin?we have 
been hearing the same for many years." 
But his pleas went largely unheeded for 
that very reason--his audience has been 
hearing the same thing for many years.

' OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday.. July 27, 1965 
Mr. O'HARA of Michigan. Mr. 
Speaker, the Michigan Democratic State 
Central Committee has officially gone on 
record in opposition to current legis-
lative efforts to upset the Supreme 
Court's historic one-man, one-vote de-
cision on apportionment of State legisla-
tures. 
I thoroughly agree with the position 
taken by the State central committee 
and consider it a privilege to call to the 
attention of my colleagues the resolu-
tion adopted by the committee on July 
18. 
The resolution follows: 
RESOLUTION OPPOSING DIRKSEN AMENDMENT 
Whereas the Congress of the United States 
is presently considering Senate joint Resolu-
tion 2, commonly known as the Dirksen 
amendment, propos:.ng an amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution to reverse the U.S. Supreme 
Court's one-man, one-vote decision, so as to 
authorize legislative apportionment on any 
basis in the second house of a bicameral 
legislature; and 
Whereas such proposal is contrary to all 
precepts of democracy assuring majority rule 
and equal voice in their Government to all 
citizens, without discrimination on account 
of race, sex, or residence; and 
Whereas such proposal is transparently but 
a smoke-screen to perpetuate malappor-
tioned legislatures, which are not only un-
constitutional and 'unfair, but also indiffer-
ent and unresponsive to the needs of our 
citizens, particularly urban and suburban 
dwellers; and 
Whereas fair and affective people represen-
tation has now been secured to Michigan by 
the courts; and our equitably apportioned 
one-man, one-vote legislature has demon-
strated that people representation is respon-
sive and responsible to the needs of all citi-
zens, and such legislature has made dramatic 
progress in meeting the social needs of our 
citizens; and

cent of the world's wealth and 7 percent 
of its people. We're lucky to be Americans, 
.-Agen't wey seenai we were born into a 
nee col.org-w.orld, 1r,tight now we're, proud

?.1.0. this ehanging world, not advancing is,

and vitality of America, these qualities

shut 'up behind social whims,, cyni-
14 , and selfishness, 
ou_knew,,people who are talented and 
incluStrions, but if they do anything at 
all wit/ Piej.e attributes, it's only to gain 
,power, or self-enjoyment. 
rppare,nt iI recent_political scandals 
d campaign rnudsllnging. 
Adult America has a sense of values brain-
washed by the corruption and greed of a few. 
If there is a chance to save the freshness of 
AMerica, it lies with her youth. Herein is 
the challenge of citizenship. America's 
youth cannot-4e carbon copies of her adults. 
America's youth are willing and wanting 
right now to give and to create for some-
thing they can call their own, and what bet-
ter to sail your own than your country. But 
U their willingness is stifled, they turn de-
linquent or withdraw into themselves or 
set up false senses of values. Just by using 
all his resources, without slighting ingenuity 
and imagination, an American can advance 
the welfare_ and prestige of his country most. 
The highly developed minds and bodies of 
American youth deteriorate in waiting for a 
chance to exploit their talents for a worth-
while goal. Give youth a chance; give them 
freedom; challenge them with something 
worthwhile and they'll make America a hun-
dred times greater than she already is. 
Perhaps you my that they have chances to 
work off exuberance for their country. 
Maybe they do. but it is not the accepted 
thing in their society because it is not the 
accepted thing in adult society. When you 
_hear a siren on the, streets, h,ow ma,ny cars 
aetually pull to the side of the road, much 
less come to a halt? What percentage of 
your adult friends really know the issues of 
politics and have formulated their own an-
swers? II-Ow many times have you heard 
adults co lain about taxes? Moreover, how 
'pitch are he letters "U.S.A." a part of your 
everyday Vocabalaryl? 
. Take stpck, friend. 7..op$ at Vag problem. 
Behold AmeriCa, she really ,progressing 
in spirit as she is in automation, economy, 
? and population? Her youth can and shall 
carry on the spirit of America. 
then, is the challenge of citizenship 
for all Americans: for adults it is to set an 
example by laying cynicism aside and picking 
up the banner of vitality and plain, honest 
drive; for youth it Is to follow the example 
and exploit their natural freshness and naive 
courage. 
, There is a_bonsl betWeenMell which Emer-
son called "the nimble air benign.' A is the 
universality of man, his need for love, for 
self-pride, for identity, maybe it's just con-
science; but whatever it is, we can use it 
as a connecting agent to help us all know 
how to use our talents. But talent is noth-
ing without courage and imagination to put 
these natural qualities to work?to work for 
America. 
The Symphony Comes to Middletown, N.Y. 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
HON. JACOB K. JAVITS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, March 15, 1965 
Mr. JAVITS, Mr. President, a prime 
objective of my bill, Senate bill 310, the 
National Arts Foundation Act of 1965, is 
to encourage the living arts in communi-
'ties which otherwise would not have op-
portunities to benefit from them. The 
_bill seeks to do this through State art 
councils and other nonprofit means. 
New York has had such a council since 
1960; and it has succeeded admirably in 
working with such communities within 
the State. One such effort came to real-
ization recently when the Minneapolis 
Symphony Orchestra came to Middle-
town, N.Y., and presented a concert, 
sponsored by the Greater Middletown 
Arts Council, in cooperation with other 
community agencies and the New York 
State Council on the Arts. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the Appendix of the RECORD 
an article?from the February 23 issue of 
A1147 
the Middletown Times-Herald Record?
describing this achievement. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE SYMPHONY COMES To TOWN 
(By Marian Feman) 
Manarrowx.?"Let's book a symphony this 
season. Let's bring a topflight symphony 
orchestra to Middletown. There's nothing 
quite like the big, full, thrilling sound of live 
music." 
? One enthusiastic member of the Greater 
Middletown Arts Council convinced the other 
directors that a symphoni concert would add 
to the life of the area. 
The concert by the Minneapolis Symphony 
which Will take place at Middletown High 
School this Sunday afternoon at 2:30 was 
planned almost a year ago. 
But the price was high for a small city. 
Art, like other commodities in demand, costs 
money. 
The State arts council came to the rescue 
with a sizable grant. The local arts council 
paid its share of more than half the guar-
antee, which was several thousand dollars. 
One hundred and 50 patrons gave additional 
support. Finally the contract was signed. 
Next came the job of filling those 1,600 
seats at Middletown High School. 
The three arts council sponsors?the Mid-
dletown school system, Orange County Com-
=inlay College, and the Times:-Heralci Rec-
ord went to work. ' 
Schools in three counties were contacted 
and students invited to attend for only $1.50. 
Music teachers talked up the value of hear-
ing a live symphony orchestra. Four hun-
dred student tickets, the maximum at this 
price, were reserved almost immediately. 
The press, radio stations, bill boards, or-
ganizations, supermarkets, the libraries, and 
even city buses carried the musical mes-
sage?"the symphony is coming to town." 
Adult tickets were scaled at $3 and $4.50. 
Soon the arts council's box office head-
quarters, at the Record's switchboard, began 
to buzz with activity. Mail orders were re-
ceived within a 40-mile radius. 
The program was chosen?Brahms' "First 
Symphony," Prokofiev's "Classical Sym-
phony," and a contemporary work by Gun-
ther Schuller "Seven Studies on Themes of 
Paul Klee:" 
Another artistic cover for Sunday's pro-
gram was created by the arts council's artist, 
Dr. Fritz Blumenthal. His graphic designs 
are frequently offbeat and provocative. 
Ushers were recruited from the high school 
and from Orange County Community College. 
Those lucky enough to be selected will at-
tend the concert free of charge. 
The time is drawing near for Sunday's 
concert. Last Minute details must still be 
taken care of. Dressing rooms for the con-
ductor and the performers must be arranged 
for. One hundred chairs must be set up. 
The piano must be tuned. Lighting must be 
just right, with no glare to disturb the 
musicians. 
Early Sunday morning a truck will pull 
up to the high school, carrying 70 trunks 
of valuable instruments. These will be care-
fully unloaded by professional stagehands. 
At 12:30 the orchestra members will arrive, 
and 2 hours later young Polish director, 
Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, will raise his 
baton and give the cue opening the pro-
gram. 
The artistic success of Sunday's concert, 
of course, depends upon the Minneapolis 
Symphony's performance. Behind the per-
formance is months of diligent preparation 
by a large number of people?in the school 
system, in business, on the arta council?
who have volunteered their services to bring 
more life, more culture, and more spark 
to the place where they live.

OF 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOME OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 15, .1965 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, for 
me time I have be .?.n Concerned about 
0 lack of inforrnati an on Cuba. I have 
ade inquiry of the State IDepartinent 
nty to be assured by the ASsistant Sec-
tary of State that Cuba is in a mess 
nd that communism has been proven 
ndesirable for the American States. 
nly yesterday I her,rd the chairman of 
e P'oreign Relatiors Committee of the 
enate state that Castro- had been cut 
own to size, so it is really with great 
terest that I read .:ratnes Ilittle's ar-

EW CASTRO FORTIFICATIONS RING U.S. 
NAVAL 
BASE AT GUANTANAMO 
(By James D. little) 
(Norz.?James 35. Hittle, a retired Marine 
&pa 'brigadier general, Who is director of 
atitnial security and foreign affairs for the 
, recently visited the Naval Base at 
tanamo.) ' 
TM spite a the wishful thinking that Cas-
re-land is too expensive for Moscow's bud-
et, the Kremlin is not pullitig out of Cuba. 
In:stead, communism is digging in for what 
ooks like a long and troublesome stay. That 
what I concluded Coming a recent tour of 
tratSgically plEiced Citantarairno Bay Naval 
ase on the southern tip of Cuba. 
'Since last August, the Reds have been for-
tifying the high ground surrounding the 
at base boundary. And this is not any 
amateur pick-and-shovel trench digging. It 
is a highly professional job, reflecting an un-
Utual degree' of skill in the military organi-
zation of critical ground. 
As a result of a tremendous engineering 
effort the Reds have cleared and smoothed a 
300-, to 500--yard wide belt iabout 15 miles 
long.?coMpletely around the iand boundary 
Of the base. Jungle, rocks, and cactus have 
been "cleared. This provides 'a typical coni-
rifunist-style death strip like those with 
Which the Reds hays scarred the dividing 
line 'between freedcin and Oppression in 
Europe. One of its purpose's is to prevent 
freedom-loving Cubans from seeking sanc-
tuary in the naval base. To make the flight 
to freedom more difficult, the Reds have 
erected a wall of barbed wire down the middle 
Of the strip. It is about 7 feet high and three 
rows. wide. In itself it represents a heavy 
investment of money, material, and labor. 
But this is only part of the Red effort to seal 
off Guantanamo Bay. Behind the wire are 
the fortifications: Taese, in turn, consist of 
a genes of deeply ,embedded tiring positions. 
Each pillbox is caretilly located, taking full 
advantage of terrain, most of which is higher 
than the base area. 
TRENCHES SKILLFULLY LOCATED 
One' highly organized strongpoint consists 
of more than 20 separate firing positions. All 
the positions are placed to support each other 
with shields of fire that Cover approaches to 
adjacent positions. Connecting these firing 
positions am skillfully located trenches. 
These not only run along the front, generally 
parallel to he base boundary, but also ex-
tend frc/m the rear of the line, thus giving 
covered rou tes of approach for troops and 
supplied. - - 
-Probtibly the most surprising and sig-
nificant asp sot of these fortifications is their 
heavy enstruction. Each firing point (pill-
box) is constructed with prefabricated con-
crete, eptimated to vary from 3 to 6 inches 
thick. 'When embedded in the ground, only 
the gull port and low rounded roof pro-
trude above the surface. 
With4glatses I could clearly see the pre-
fabricated floncreta roof slabs being put in 
place. 'These are then covered by layers of 
poured 'con mete and earth, in a short time 
fast-grOwing vegetation will give hard-to-
discern camouflage. 
Far Do ti e 'rear of the fortified line, land 
is being cl3ared for barracks. construction. 
Cost or Mit hostile fortification around our 
base is estimated at close to $15 million. 
When eomplete it will be one of the most 
intensiVely fortified positions in the world. 
I doubt that there is anyone in Castro's forces 
capable of planning and building such a 
skillful/ and massive network. The type 
of fortification, use of terrain-covered 
trenches and emphasis on fields of fire con-
form t4 Soviet military doctrine. 
IMF/EMBER MISSILE CRISIS 
Why, this vast and surprising Red buildup? 
There 'is no one pat answer. Communist 
strategy is based on flexibility, the choice of 
Meth s--averything from propaganda to 
raw m Mary power. It appears that the fol-
lowing, fac m's are involved In the Moscow-
Havana decision to ring our, base with for-
tifications. 
Mosciow srants Guantanamo Bay. The Rus-
sian general staff knows full well, even if 
some lime/ loans do not, that our base is the 
strategic k( y to the Caribbean, the approaches 
to Panams and the protection of sea lanes 
essential to economic and military integrity 
of South America. Let us nont forget that 
one of the most consistent themes of Kremlin 
propaganci I is "kick the United States out 
of Guantmiarno." 
Neither Cuban Premier Fidel Castro nor 
Moscow las s forgotten their scare during the 
1962 missile crisis when they were so vul-
nerable to U.S. military action. An attack 
from Guantanamo Bay combined with air 
and sea assault from the Florida area, would 
have brokon the Red grip on Cuba. Russian 
military thought always has been extremely 
sensitive to an exposed tank. 
orrEnsury ROLE POSSIBLE 
If another threat of U.S. retaliation should 
develdp, Castro and his Kremlin overlords 
want to prevent the possibility that U.S. units 
from rtuaatanamo Bay might link up with 
other fore as and Cuban freedom fighters. 
Alsq, the new fortifications could perform 
a dual offensive-defensive role. If the Reds 
ever decic ed to attack the base, their best 
corridor cf attack would be down the long 
and broac plain of the 'Guantanamo River, 
which rime in the mountains in the north-
west end flows in a southeasterly direction 
into the b ty. 
In Such tactical situation, Red gunfire 
from the fortifications, supplemented by ar-
tillers) in the hills to the northwest, would 
try to/ immobilize our forces in the base in 
order to E ssist the armored attack down the 
plain, Tais would be in accord with the 
tactical doctrine for holding forces and ma-
neuver fo ?ce. 
But tho Soviet tacticians must realize it 
mould no-; be a walk-in for ?shem. Navy and 
Marine u aits at the base, backed by carrier 
aviation had naval gunfire, would be doing 
somethin ;, too. 
SERVE PROPAGANDA PURPOSE 
It is m obabie, though, that the fortifica-
tions are intended to serve a more immedi-
ate piopa,gaxida role. 
Approved For Releas 
15, 1965 
'Taking advantage of our well-known de-
sire for peace, the Reds could deliberately 
create a war-threate aing crisis. Then, to the 
tune of worldwide propaganda, they could 
offer to negotiate. When the timing is right 
from their standpoint they can increase ten-
sion by firing a few shots and publicly re-
enforcing troops in the fortifications. Their 
investment in these new fortifications will 
pay dividends in military credibility. This, 
in turn, they expect, will give added leverage 
in negotiations. 
Tribute to John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman 
of the Civil Service Commission 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. RALPH YARBOROUGH 
OW TEXAS 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, March 15, 1965 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
an excellent tribute to the new Chairman 
of the Civil Service Commission, Mr. John 
W. Macy, Jr, appeared in the March 10, 
1965, issue of the Government Employees' 
Exchange. 
Because of Mr. Macy's most remark-
able accomplishments, ability, and vigor-
ous talent, I request that the article be 
printed in the Appendix of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
MACY'S REAPPOINTMENT AS CSC CHIEF AP-
PLAUDED BY 'FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 
Federal employees everywhere in the world 
are commending President Johnson' for reap-
pointing John W. Macy, Jr., to the chairman-
ship of the Civil Service Commission for a 
6-year term. Merabers of the Senate Post 
Office and Civil Service Committee, in con-
firming him for the post on March 4, made 
audible the expressions of pleasure felt by 
Federal careerists, male and female alike, 
physically able and partially disabled alike, 
by majority and minority groups alike. 
Readers of this newspaper if they haven't, 
by this time, become intimately acquainted 
with Mr. Macy, his personality, and his re-
markable work history, with the inspiration 
he inculcated in every Federal department 
and agency in the Government, with the 
vigor he has supplied every one of the 
talented careerists in the Federal service, to-
gether with his tireless energy to attract the 
talented into the Federal service, then this 
newspaper has not done a good job. At 47, 
his career has just begun. 'When this re-
markable man sleeps no one will ever know. 
Those who know him never cease to wonder 
where he unearths his drive, how he amasses 
his wisdom for fair play, when he gets the 
time not only to perform his responsibilities 
but to express himself in the many profes-
sional personnel 'ournals, which this news-
paper has been fortunate to accumulate. He 
arrives at his office in the wee hours of the 
morning and leaves it with a bulging brief-
case at night. Members of the Civil Service 
Commission staff' having business with him 
one day not so long ago said "you have to 
catch him on the run. He's on the move 
practically all of the time." The Exchange, 
in 1961, recorded for its readers just prior to

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN ..TIU I-I01.T8 OF ItEPRESENTATIvEs 
Thursday, March 4, 1965 
Mr. 1V1OORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, in the 
last 5 months I have addressed a num-
ber of gatherings of professional prac-
titioners of the arts and humanities in 
various parts of the country. To each 
of these gatherings I have stressed my 
belief that there is a fundamental 
change"developing in the attitude toward 
intellectual and cultural life in the 
United States and that the time is right 
for the Federal Government to take 
steps to encourage this changing atti-
tude. This has been one of my argu-
ments for establishment of a National 
Foundation for the Arts and Humani-
ties, as proposed in the modified Moor-
head bill, H.R. 6051, introduced in the 
House last week. In a 'recent editorial, 
the Christian Science Monitor made the 
point that the artist needs to be honored 
in his own land. This is true, of course, 
for the humanist too, and for all teach-
ers. I think the National Foundation 
for the Arts and Huinanities would point 
us in that direction. I include the 
Monitor editorial of March 2, 1965, at 
this point in the Appendix: 
- ART AND Am 
While the 13ritish Government is raising 
its support of the arts by 30 percent, the 
American Government remains virtually at 
the beginning of doing anything for them 
at all. 
We welcome the burst of activity bespeak-
ing Congress belated concern for the arts 
and the whole field of humanities. 
Government patronage in the realm of hu-
mane values may have more pitfalls than its 
already substantial patronage of the sciences. 
But, in a society changing under the minis-
trations of the scientist, the insights of the 
artist and the scholar have become more 
necessary than ever. The time is overdue 
for the American Government to define its 
role in developing a climate for excellence 
in artistic as well as technological fields. 
In legislation for education and research, 
the humanities should not be penalized be-
cause their benefits may be less tangible than 
the visible achievements of science. Among 
nonprofit institutions such as museums, the-
aters, and symphony orchestras, there could 
Well be Government support as expenses rise 
in proportion to what the public can be ex-
pected to pay. The splendid achievements 
of private initiative must not be allowed to 
dwindle for lack of the necessary boost as 
economic conditions change. 
The problems of administration would be 
difficult. How to separate the worthy from 
the unworthy on artistic rather than political 
grounds? How to keep the scholar or insti-
tution from tempering the work to what it 
Imagines to be acceptable at a given moment 
instead of striking out in directions that may 
be more important in the future? 
The United States would certainly not go 
the way of the Soviet Union where Govern-
ment support and control go together. It 
would go in the direction of those European 
nations that have managed, to a large degree, 
to keep support and control separate. In 
Britain, for example, the newly allocated 
funds will go to the Arts Council, which pro-
vides a kind of buffer between the arts and 
political influence. 
Some such body would presumably be cre-
ated in the United States if Federal aid to 
the arts goes ahead. Indeed, President John-
son has already appointed an Advisory Coun-
cil on the Arts. It is an estimable group, but 
stronger on what might be called estab-
lishment names than those further out, 
where 'nevi- ideas, good and bad, often arise. 
It hints at the problem of creating an ad-
ministering body that would not inhibit the 
very creativity it was set up to foster. And, 
with constituents' money involved, does any-
one doubt that Congressmen would be look-
ing over the shoulders of an avant-garde 
that might seem to be involved in things even 
less probable than going to the moon? 
Such questions would become more urgent 
if Federal aid should extend to individual 
artists. The great ones will survive in spite 
of Government as well as because of it. 
Others might forgo the potential break-
through in favor of the project thought more 
likely to get a grant. 
Indeed, if Government patronage is added 
to that of the foundations and the universi-
ties, some artists might be cut off from the 
human experience that gives substance to 
art. 
Against such considerations must be placed 
the possibilities of enriching the public with 
more ,works and performances freed of com-
mercial limitations. Ironically, as Congress 
awakes to the arts, the country is in the 
midst of a "cultural explosion" without con-
gressional patronage. 
Judiciously administered aid is necessary. 
But its effect will be diminished if the Gov-
ernment fails to show a sensitivity toward 
the differences between the arts and other 
things. More than money, what the Govern-
ment needs to give the artist is a sense of be-
ing honored in his own land.

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 1965 
Mr. ULLMAN. Mr. SPeaker, one of the 
major concerns throughout the flood-
damaged regions of the Pacific North-
west is for the immediate repair or re-
construction of forest access roads. Tim-
ber processing is the leading provider of 
Industrial payrolls in the region, and it 
is of the utmost urgency that authority 
and funds be granted to complete the 
job on federally managed forest areas. 
The following resolution by the Ore-
gon Logging Conference emphasizes the 
importance of this problem:

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE M. RHODES 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE 111:1?USE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thurisclair, Febriary 18, 1965 
Mr. RI-10DES of Pennsylvania. Iktn 
Speaker, last Friday I suggested that 
American flags be flown at half-mast to 
express th l ation's sorrow over the 
death of the reverend John J. Reeb in 
Alabama,'ho gave his life in the cause 
of humah 4ghls, dignity, and freedom. 
Lowerin the flag would also be an 
expression ,of shanie for the events in 
Alabama, tirheie the courageous clergy-
man was a vic;im of ignorance, bigotry, 
and hate, a natural reaction to the 
breakdown of civilized government in 
that State, Where the murder of innocent 
men and the killing and crippling of 
little girls goes unpunished. 
The GoVernar of Alabama and his 
police-state tactics have seriously dam-
aged the iniag3 of the United States in 
the free wcirld and have given the Com-
munists a jpowerful propaganda weapon. 
Our Nation mourns today with a 
widowed miather and her four fatherless 
children. et us hope that the recent 
brutal killing will encourage the good 
citizens of Alabama to cleanse their 
State of (Oficial lawlessness, brutality, 
and national shame. 
Over the years, Mr. Speaker, Alabama 
has been represented in both Eouses of 
Congress by dedicated Representatives, 
of whom thle people of that State and the 
Nation are mighty proud. 
Let us give Encouragement to the de-
cent white eiti2ens of that State who last 
week marched to the courthouse in Sel-
ma to exprss i sense of outrage at offi-
cial miseonduct, police 'brutality, and 
suppression of the rights of citizens. 
The leader of the group of 72 white 
citizens which made the courageous 
march was Joseph Ell wanger, chairman 
of the Concerned White Citizens of Ala-
bama. 
As white citizens of Alabama?Ell-
wanger said: 
We have come to tel the Nation that 
there are white people in Alabama who will 
speak out against the events which have 
recently occurred. By our presence we affirm 
our faith in the abiding principles upon 
which our Nation is founded?a nation un-
der God with liberty and justice for all. 
Mr. Speaker, if the recent tragic event 
In Selma will awaken the consciences of 
Alabama citizens, Reverend Reeb will not 
have died in vain. 
ust Not Forget Red Cuba While 
We Worry About Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. PAUL G. ROGERS 
' OF FLORIDA 
-IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, Mar:* 11, 1965 
Mr: ROGERS of s Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, while the American people have 
their attentions focused on the conflicts 
building up in Vietnam, and pressure 
builds as international news dispatches 
carry developments as they occur by the 
hour, the problem of communism in 
Cuba continues to plague the stability 
and security of this hemisphere. 
We cannot allow our national atten-
tions to be diverted from one Communist-
initiated crisis to another, to be drawn 
into the position of constantly reacting, 
In Cuba, for example, while authorities 
ponder solutions to Vietnam, Fidel Cas-
tro has been readying a new wave of 
subversion and terrorism in Latin Amer-
ica. This is typical of the tactics which 
the Communists employ as they attempt 
to further their purposes throughout the 
world. 
Americans must not relent in their ef-
forts to replace liberty where it has been 
deprived through communism. Ameri-
cans must dedicate themselves to the 
constant effort of effecting the downfall 
of Communist Castro and the denial of 
rights he has placed on the island of 
Cuba. The risks are too great to over-
look the fact that Cuba is of vital stra-
tegic importance to communism. We 
need only to recall the events of October 
1962, when the world looked on while 
the United States held to demands that 
missiles be removed from this hemi-
sphere, to know the treachery of com-
munism. 
One of Florida's leading newspapers, 
the Miami Herald, which certainly ranks 
as a distinguished authority on events in 
the Caribbean and Latin America, artic-
ulated the problem of overlooking Cuba 
In the face of Red-inspired pressures 
elsewhere in a very succinct manner on .

of that day in the Appendix of the REC-

construction in connection with the housing 
project built under title VIII of the National 
Housing Act at Selfridge 'Air Force Base,

day Americans of all races stand

Th :y died side by side in Korea. Surely

e must also lift by legislation the 
bar of discrimination against those who 
see entry into our country, particularly 
tho e with much-needed skills and those 
joi ing their families. In establishing 
pre erences, a nation that was built by 
the 'mmigrants of all aiads can ask those 
whc now seek admission: "What can 
you do for our country?" But we should 
not be asking: "In what country were 
you born?" 
For our ultimate goal is a Ix orld with-
out war, a world made safe for diversity, 
In hich all men, goods, and ideas can 
free y move across every border and every 
bou4adary. 
e must advance toward this goal in 
196 in at least 10 different ways, not as 
partisans but as patriots. 
First, we must ma ntain--and our 
- red ced defense budget will maintain?
that margin of military safety and su-
periority obtained through 3 years of 
steadily increasing both the quality and 
? the 'quantity of our strategic, our con-
venfional and our antiguerilla forces. 
In 1964 we will be better prepared than 
ever before to defend the cause of free-
don?whether it is threatened by out-
.eigl aggression or by the infiltration 
practiced by those in Hanoi arid Havana 
i  
wh ship arms and mer across interna-
ton 1 borders to foment insurrection. 
An we must continue to use that 
stre gth, as John Kennedy used it in the 
Cub n crisis and for the test ban treaty, 
to emonstrate both the futility of nu-
clea war and the possibilities of lasting 
pea e. 
S collet, we must take new steps?
and we shall make new proposals at 
Bro. 2-13 
de-neva?tm aid the contra, and the 
eventual aboltion of arms. Mlven in the 
abience of agreement we must- not 
stockpile arum beyond our needs or seek 
an excel of military power that could 
be Provo atiee as well as wasteful. And 
it is in this spirit that in this fiscal year 
we are cittiag back our production of 
enriched uranium by 25 percent. We 
el 
are shutt ng down four plutoniumepiles. 
We are cising many nonessential mili-
tary ins ails tons. And it is in this 
spirit that we today call on our adver-
saries to do ,he same. 
Third, we must make increased use of 
our fooll as an instrument of peace, 
making 0 aeailable?by sale, or trade, 
or loan oil donation?to hungry people in 
all nations which tell us of their needs 
and accept proper conditions of dis-
tribution, 
Fourth, wo must assure our preem-
inence in the peaceful exploration of 
outer space, focusing on an expedition 
to the meon in this decade?in coopera-
tion with, ott er powers if possible, alone 
If necessary. 
Fifth, we must expand world trade. 
Having rqcog nized in the act of 1962 that 
we must puy as well as sell, we now ex-
pect our tra ling partners to recognize 
that we Must sell as well as buy. We are 
willing to give them competitive access 
to our market?asking only that they do 
the same for us. 
Sixth, we must continue, through such 
measures' as the interest equalization tax 
as well as the cooperation of other na-
tions, our reel nt progress toward balanc-
ing our inter rational accounts. 
This admit istration must arid will pre-
serve the pretent gold value of the dollar. 
Seventh, we must become better 
neighbors with the free states of the 
Americas?w irking with the councils of 
the OAS, wi h a stronger Alliance for 
Progress, ani with all the men and 
Women a this hemisphere who really 
believe in liberty and justice for all. 
Eighth, we must strengthen the ability 
of free nations everywhere to develop 
their indepen lence and raise their stand-
ard of tivin g?and thereby frustrate 
those who prey on poverty and chaos. 
To do this, the rich must help the poor?
and we must do our part. We must 
achieve a mc re rigorous administration 
of our development assistance, with 
larger roles for private investors, for 
other industrialized nations, and for in-
ternational agencies and for the recipi-
ent nations themselves. 
Ninth, we must strengthen our At-
lantic and Pat ;Mc partnerships, maintain 
our alliances and make the Vnited Na-
tions a more effective instrument for na-
tional independence and international 
order. 
Tenth, and finally, we must develop 
with our allies new means of bridging 
the gap between the East and1 the West, 
facing danger boldly wherever danger 
exists, but being equally bold in our 
search for now agreements which can 
enlarge the t opes of all while violating 
the interests )1* none. 
In short, I would say to the Congress 
that we must be constantly prepared for 
the worst am1 constantly acting for the 
best. 
105 
We must be strong enough to win any 
war, and we must be wise enough to pre-
vent one. 
We snail neither act as aggressors nor 
tolerate acts of aggression. 
We intend to bury no one?and we do 
not intend to be buried. 
We can fight, if we must, as we have 
fought before?but we pray that we will 
never have to fight again. 
My good friends and my fellow Ameri-
cans, in these last '7 sorrowful weeks we 
have learned anew that nothing is so 
enduring as' faith and nothing is so de-
grading as hate. 
John Kennedy was a victim of hate, 
but he was also a great builder of faith, 
faith in our fellow Americans, whatever 
their creed or their color or their sta-
tion in life; and fa:th in the future of 
man, whatever his divisions and differ-
ences. 
This faith was echoed in all parts of 
the world. On every continent and in 
every land to which Mrs. Johnson and I 
traveled, we found faith and hope and 
love toward this la:ad of America and 
toward our people. 
So I ask you now, in the Congress and 
in the country, to join with me in ex-
pressing and fulfilling that faith?in 
working for a nation?a nation that is 
free from want and a world that is free 
from hate?a world of peace and justice, 
and freedom and abundance, for our 
time and for all time to come.

140 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
munist country? This is especially dis-
tressing in view of Secretary preeman's ad-
mission to the wheat subcommittee that he 
had denied preferential treatment to at least 
one free-world customer a few days before 
he granted the bargain to Russia. 
The best price friendly countries have re-
ceived recently was 59 cents on December 19. 
In his testimony Secretary Freeman 'also 
admitted the bargain to Continental was 
not on a competitive bid basis, and indeed, 
so far as he knew, was the only bid for 
durum wheat that day. What is the au-
thority for granting preferential treatment 
to Continental? 
I respectfully repeat my request that the 
export license be suspended until question-
able legal aspects are clarified and until 
conflicts in statements by your two Cabinet 
officers are resolved. 
PAUL FINDLEY, 
Member of Congress., 
I challenged the legality of the trans-
action in a letter Monday to the Comp-
troller General, Joseph Campbell. The 
text of my letter follows: 
DEAR MR. CAMPBELL: I would appreciate 
a report at the earliest possible date on ques-
tionable legal aspects of the export transac-
tion announced Friday by the Department 
of Agriculture, involving the sale of about 
13 million bushels of Durum wheat to Con-
tinental Grain,Co. for resale to Russia. 
1. It appears-to me that the Department 
of Agriculture exceeded its authority in 
granting an abnormally high export sub-
sidy in this transaction.. The rate paid was 
721/2 cents a bushel, 141/2 cents a bushel 
higher than that granted for recent exports 
of the same wheat variety. 
In fact, the Wall Street Journal today re-
ports as follows: "Underlining the abnor-
mally big subsidy on the Durum destined for 
Russia is the fact that on December 30 the 
Department refused to pay a 59-cent sub-
sidy on 110,000 bushels, and on Friday re-
fused to pay 73 cents on 37,333 bushels. 
These smaller export deals were for Durum 
to be exported to free world destinations." 
Most news reports explain the abnormal 
export subsidy as an indirect subsidy to 
cover part of the cost of ocean shipping. 
The Associated Press on January 5, report-
ing the Continental Grain transaction said, 
"One Department official questioned about 
the possibility that the Durum subsidy in-
cludea both an export and a transportation 
subsidy denied flatly that there was a trans-
portation subsidy. But another said the 
Department does not contend that no in-
direct transportation subsidy is involved." 
These questions arise: 
Does the Department of Agriculture have 
the legal authority to grant preferential 
treatment in establishing export subsidy 
rates on durum wheat? It is quite clear that 
Continental Grain Co. was singled out for 
this special rate. This preferential rate was 
not announced publicly to the trade in ad-
vance, and since the announcement of the 
Continental transaction, the preferential rate 
has been withdrawn. 
Did the Department of Agriculture seek 
competitive bids before granting the abnor-
mal subsidy? If not, why not? Does the 
Department of Agriculture have the author-
ity to grant subsidies on commercial ship-
ping beyond U.S. ports? 
If so, does the Department of Agriculture 
have authority to include an indire,q trans-
portation subsidy in establishing_ an export 
subsidy rate? It is my understanding that 
the authority for establishing export subsi-
dies can,not Inc l4cle the cost of transporta:-
tion beyond U.S. ports. 
If the hidden reight subsidY is construed 
to be legal, is the Government guaranteed 
a refund if the freight subsidy is not needed 
In its entirety? 
2. It appears that the Department of Com-
merce violated its own published regula-
tions in issuing the export License for this 
transaction. 
I call your attention to Export Bulletin 
883 of the Commerce Department, issued 
November 13, 1963, which requires each ex-
port license application must be accompa-
nied by form PC 842. This form must list 
the quantity, value of commodities involved, 
and numerous other details. Was it prop-
erly filled out in advance of the issuance of 
the license to Continental? From what I 
have learned, it appears impossible that this 
requirement could have been met. 
This question arises: 
Did the Commerce Department have the 
legal authority to waive regulations in issu-
ing the export license to Continental? 
Prompt attention to this request is in the 
public interest, as this bizarre transaction, 
if not challenged, may be cited as the prece-
dent for future deals. 
Sincerely yours, 
PAUL FINDLEY. 
Text of my telegram on Monday to the 
President: 
Respectfully urge that you suspend the ex-
port license to Continental Grain Co., which 
Friday received an abnormally high export 
subsidy for shipment of durum wheat to 
Russia, until questionable legal aspects of 
the deal are clarified by the Comptroller 
General.

THE OTTO OTEPKA CASE UP TO 
DATE 
(Mr. HOSMER (at the request of Mr. 
REERMANN) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, on De-
cember 30, last, the respected American 
Security Council issued a paper prepared 
by its Washington bureau chief, Frank 
J. Johnson, bringing up to date the facts 
on the Otto Otepka case. Because of 
its important relevance to the national 
security, I have asked the paper be here 
reproduced in full as follows: 
THE CASE OF OTTO OTEPKA 
On September 23, 1963, a long-smolder-
ing issue broke into public view when the 
State Department served notice on the Chief 
of the Evaluation Division of the Office of 
Security, Otto Otepka that is proposed to 
fire him for actions unbecoming to an of-
ficer of the Department of State. On No-
vember 5, 1963, Otepka's answer to the 
charges was disregarded and the action was 
carried out subject to appeal and review by 
Secretary Rusk. 
The reasons given for firing Otepka are 
based mainly on charges that he cooperated 
with the Senate Internal Security Subcom-
mittee (SISS) in the course of its still 
continuing investigation into State Depart-
ment security procedures. The real reason, 
however, apparently lies in Otepka's obsti-
nate and conscientious effort to do his job 
too well. In trying to keep persons of ques-
tionable character or affiliation out of sen-
sitive Government positions, he made a nui-
sance of himself in the eyes of his superiors. 
In placing loyalty to country, as he saw it, 
above institutional loyalty to the State De-
partment, he violated the latter's code. In 
the eyes of State Department officials, he is 
out of step with the times. 
Mr. Otepka is a professional security of-
ficer and a good one. He came to the State 
Department in 1953 as a personnel security 
evaluator under the late Scott McLeod. In 
January 8 
1960 his State Department efficiency report 
noted his long experience with and extreme-
ly broad knowledge of laws, regulations, rules, 
criteria, and procedures in the field of per-
sonnel security. He is knowledgeable of 
communism and its subversive efforts in the 
United States. To this he adds perspective, 
balance and good judgment. This was the 
last efficiency report he received. His 
knowledge for correct procedures and insist-
ence that they be carried out was to lead to 
his undoing. 
On January 20, 1962, Otepka was down-
graded froin Deputy Director of the Office of 
Security to Chief of the Evaluation Division. 
This Division has authority to clear persons 
who do not, in the judgment of its Chief, 
warrant an adverse ruling. Where there is 
derogatory information, the case is required 
to proceed through higher channels; any 
higher official may overrule the Evaluation 
Division and grant a clearance, but only the 
Deputy Under Secretary for Administration 
may concur and suspend the individual. 
After hearings are held only the Secretary 
of State may actually separate the man. 
This procedure has particular application 
to Otepka, because it concerns a security 
case in which he was importantly involved?
that of William Arthur Wieland. In part, 
this case is responsible for Otepka's troubles. 
These difficulties really began in 1959 when 
the new Director of the Office of Security, 
William Boswell, a Foreign Service officer who 
was not a security expert, announced that 
he was going to eliminate the "McLeod 
image." Scott McLeod had been the first 
Administrator of the Bureau of Security and 
Consular Affairs until 1957. McLeod's strict 
procedures succeeded in eliminating many 
security risks from the State Department, 
though apparently at some cost to the "mo-
rale" of a number of Foreign Service officers. 
Boswell proposed to place Foreign Service of-
ficers in a position to check on other Foreign 
Service officers?an arrangement to which 
Otepka objected in principle. 
Otepka personally worked on two major 
personnel security cases?John Stewart 
Service and William Wieland. Service had 
been separated from the State Department 
in 1950 for turning over documents to Philip 
Jaffe, publisher of Amerasia magazine (a 
definitely pro-Communist publication) . He 
was ordered reinstated by the Supreme Court 
in 1956. In readjudicating his case, Otepka 
found that he was not a loyalty risk, but 
raised questions as to his judgment and con-
duct. Service was subsequently cleared on 
all counts and sent as consul general to 
Liverpool. He retired in 1961. Wieland was 
a State Department desk officer who had a 
hand in shaping U.S. policy toward Cuba, 
both before and after Castro's takeover. To 
his superiors, he was an apologist for Castro, 
although he told friends privately as early 
as 1958 that Castro "is a Communist." A 
full security check was done on Wieland in 
response to an allegation that he, himself, 
was a Communist. Otepka's conclusions did 
not support this charge, but did raise ques-
tions as to Wieland's integrity, based in part 
on falsehoods in his testimony before the 
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. 
Nevertheless, Wieland was "cleared" by Roger 
Jones, Deputy Under Secretary for Adminis-
tration. He did so in September 1961 on the 
basis of only the "digest" of the Wieland 
findings, without first obtaining the recom-
mendation of the intervening head of the 
Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, and 
without notifying the Office of Security of 
his decision. Not until January 25, 1962-
1 day after the Wieland case was raised at 
a Presidential news conference, was Otepka 
notified in writing by Boswell that Jones had, 
in fact, closed out the Wieland case. Otepka 
objected to these irregular procedures. In 
the Service case the procedure in clearing 
him had at least been correct; not so in the 
case of Wieland.

[From the Roanoke Times] 
A PUBLIC SERVICE W:YI,L DONE 
OTIG of this Nation's most important assets 
Is its liational park system which comprises 
some 00 areas, including 3:. parks, and cov-
ers 26 million acres. Each year the system 
draws 100 million Americans to enjoy its 
benefits. 
On of the men chiefly responsible for all 
this i Conrad L. Wirth, who has just retired 
after 2 years as Director of the National Park 
Servic . Mr. Wirth literally grew up with the 
Park erviee, having been with it in all but 
the SSt 15 of its 47 years of existence, and 
he de erves a great deal cf credit for the 
Servic 's popularity both :.n Congress and 
amon Americans generally. 
The familiar Mission 66 program designed 
to gre tly strengthen the national park sys-
tem uas conceived by Mr. Wirth, who then 
dilige tly worked for its approval and saw it 
well ola its way to fruition when be stepped 
down. In this section of Virginia, with its 
great national forests and popular Blue 
Ridge Parkway, Mr. Wirth is widely known 
and h s work appreciated. 
Prai e for the Park Service comes from 
Sena r BYRD, who said, in commenting on 
Wirth s retirement, "I regent the national 
park ystera as one of the most worthwhile 
of all ederal programs." And Senator BYRD 
paid t is tribute to Mr. Wirth in remarks on 
the Sc ate floor: "I suspect there is no other 
single man in the United States who has 
done o much for the healthful recreation 
and p ease:ire of so many people, along with 
prom ing conservation of our natural re-
source and preservation of our historic 
areas.' In retirement as well as during his 
more ctive years, Mr. Wirth has earned the 
gratit de of millions of Americans. 
[From the Conservation News, published by 
he National Wildlife I'ederat.on] 
Mrs lox 66 A TESTIMONY TO VISION OF 
"TOWNIE" WIRTH 
As r ported in the November 1, 1963, issue 
of Co servation News, Conrad L. Wirth, Di-
rector of the National Park Sercice since 
1951, i retiring from office :n January 1964. 
torn n 1899, "Connie" Wirth had already 
logged many accomplishments and many 
years .f park experience when he became 
Direct r. He has been a dedicated crusader, 
puttin his whole heart inco the preserva-
tion o the parks, at the same time maintain-
ing th t "parks are for people." 
Wirt directed the Civilian Conservation 
Corps, first the State and c3unty work and 
then t e Department of the Interior's entire 
CCC p :ogram. This, it has been said, ad-
vance the Nation's park program by at 
least 0 years. In 1936, 1.e initiated the 
move ent which resulted in passage by Con-
gress ? the Park, Parkway and Recreational 
Area S udy Act. But the crowning achieve-
ment f his career is Missian 66, the dra-
matic and hnaginative Nat onal Park Sys-
tem development program which caught the 
attent n of the public and won the support 
of Co ress by the magnitude of its design. 
In the 1 years following World War H, a 
deep concer a for the National Parks plagued 
Conrad Wir h. The parks were deteriorating. 
They had suffer ed through the lean war and 
postwar yeaks. Appropriations had been cut 
to the bone, all but absolutely essential 
work had stopped, and staffs had been 
trimmed fci mere skeleton forces. Yet, in 
the postwa yee re, droves of visitors flocked 
to the parts. Their impact hastened the 
deterioratio . , Mearly, something had to be 
done to cal' [Iteration to the plight of the 
parks. It as then that Wirth conceived a 
fresh and oi4jective idea of park development, 
and he gave it the name of Mission 66, to 
o 
commemorate
l 'ark Service. 11 1966 the 50th anniversary 
of the Nati  
Wirth nained a special task force which 
enunciated ;the following guidelines: Preser-
vation of park esources is Et basic require-
ment; substential and appropriate use of the 
National Perk Eiystem is the best means of 
assuring the per aetuation of the System; and 
adequate and aapropriate developments are 
required for pu3lic use and appreciation of 
any area, and for prevention of overuse. 
From this beE inning, the goals of Mission 
66 evolved ap: Better public accommodations 
and serviceS; campgrounds, roads and other 
improvements provided by the government; 
a more adequate, better-trained staff; effec-

BRITISH BUS. DEAL WI U-
NIST CUBA PROVES "BUST" OF AD-
MINISTRAITON'S ANTI-CASTRO 
TRADE POLICIES 
, 
(Mr. CR.O.MliiR (at the request of Mr. 
BEERMANN): WES granted permission to 
extend his ,renr.arks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) I 
Mr. CRAMM. Mr. Speaker, the 
British bus de 11 with the Cuban Com-
munist Government proves what a com-
plete "bust!' the administration's efforts 
to isolate, . through trade restrictions, 
Castro's islitnd fortress have been. 
Our lack of real determination to pro-
vide needeid nadership to accomplish 
trade restrirtio as is best evidenced by the 
administra ion's failure to protest this 
deal. This, deal could be accomplished 
only with the 3ritish Government's ac-
quiescence.; The opening of an office in 
Havana by the British firm, Leyland 
Motor, Ltd., rpecifically required ap-
proval by dash o and the British. 
Such a sale, with an operating office 
in Havana, am mnts to tacit recognition 
of the Captro government by Great 
Britain and leads to the logical question, 
"Is this the first step toward normaliz-
ing trade rela ,ions with Cuba, toward 
eventual recognition?" 
This is an example of the natural after-
math of the administration's push for 
trade of wheat with Russia on credit be-
cause Greait Britain can logically ask, 
139 
"what is wrong with our trading buses 
with the Communists when the U.S. Gov-
ernment is trading wheat on credit with 
the Communists?" 
It is obvious that the wheat on credit 
deal has undercut the strength of our 
moral position calling for trade restric-
tions against Communist Cuba in the 
eyes of the world. We are reaping the 
harvest of this clandestine compromise 
already. 
The press report covering this bus deal, 
from the Washington Post of Wednesday, 
January 8, follows: 
CASTRO MAKES BIG BLS DEAL IN BRITAIN 
MIAMI, January 7.?The Fidel Castro gov-
ernment announced today a $10 million deal 
with a British firm in an effort to rehabili-
tate Cuba's broken-down bus system. 
Havana Radio said the agreement calls for 
early delivery by Leyland Motor, Ltd., of 400 
buses with 45-passenger capacity each and 
$1.1 million in spare parts. 
The broadcast, monitored here, said the 
British firm announced it will establish an 
office in Havana with commercial and tech-
nical personnel. 
In Washington, officials said the adminis-
tration has told Britain it is unhappy with 
the sale but has filed no formal protest. 
They said the administration was aware of 
negotiations between the British firm and 
Cubans, and had been in touch with the 
British Governfnent on this and other sales 
to Cuba for a long time. 
ARE TAXPAYERS FINANCING WHEAT 
SHIPMENTS TO RUSSIA? 
(Mr. FINDLEY (at the request of Mr. 
I3EERMANN ) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks a.: this point in the 
EC RD and to include extraneous mat-
Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, to what 
extent are the U.S. taxpayers financing 
bargain rate shipments of wheat to Rus-
sia? The strange secretly concluded 
deal with Continental Grain Co. for ship-
ment of Durum wheat to Russia, just an-
nounced last week, leave many questions 
unanswered. 
Today I sent this telegram to-'resi-
dent Johnson: 
On Monday I requested that you suspend 
the export license to Continental Grain Co. 
for shipment of durum wheat to Russia 
until questionable legal aspects are clarified. 
My request is even more urgent and per-
tinent in light of conflicting statements 
yesterday by two members of your Cabinet. 
The American people are deeply concerned 
about this strange new policy of using U.S. 
tax dollars to finance trade with the Com-
munists and are entitled to know which 
Cabinet officer has the facts straight. 
Agriculture Secretary Freeman stated yes-
terday to the House wheat subcommittee 
that the 72-cent subsidy approved for Con-
tinental did not include a subsidy for ship-
ping. Mr. Freeman described my ques-
tioning on this point as spurious. 
The sam.e day Commerce Secretary Hodges 
told a press conference it was his under-
standing that the shipping subsidy was in-
cluded and was the reason why Continental 
got the abnormally high subsidy. As the 
officer responsible for issuing export licenses 
to Communist countries, Secretary Hodges 
certainly should know what he is talking 
about. 
If the shipping subsidy was included, what 
is the legal authority for this? 
If no shipping subsidy was included, what 
authority and justification can be given for 
granting preferential treatment to a Com-

sfon for which it is more valuable. At 
the same time the owner would be able 
to sell his rice acreage allotment and put 
other land into the production of this 
commodity. I just wonder if by the 
great expansion of the Space Program 
in the State of Texas we have not twice 
enriched the rice producers. Does this 
Mean mounting surpluses at the expense 
of the taxpayers when the sale of land 
for nonfarm purposes could otherwise 
curtail production? 
Mr. Chairman, I have very serious 
Questions about the whole philosophy of 
this program. 
The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the 
Committee rises. 
Accordingly the Committee rose, and 
the Speaker having resumed the chair, 
Mr. DAvis of Tennessee, Chairman of the

to the transfer of producer rice acreage 
allotments, pursuant to House Resolu-

EMERGENCY COMMITTEE FOR D 
ASTER RELIEF TO CUBA 
(Mr. WILLIS asked and was given 
Permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. WILLIS. Mr. Speaker, on Decem-
ber 16, 1963, shortly before the first ses-
sion of the Congress adjourned, a two-
column, page-length ad in the Washing-
ton post appealed, "in the spirit of 
Christmas," for contributions to the 
Emergency Committee for Disaster Re-
lief to Cuba, with offices at 41 Union 
Square West, New York City. 
The ad revealed that the chairman of 
the organization was Sidney J. Gluck 
and the medical director, Dr. Louis 
Miller. The contribution coupon in the 
ad stated that checks should be made 
payable to Elizabeth Sutherland, treas-
urer of the group. The ad further re-
vealed that the three initiating sponsors 
of the appeal were Mrs. Ava Helen Paul-
ing, Carleton Beals, and Waldo Frank. 
The names of 80 cosponsors of the Emer-
gency Committee for Disaster Relief to 
Cuba were listed in the ad. Among them 
were 20 clergymen, 7 professors, a judge, 
10 doctors?medical or Ph. D.'s?a paint-
er, a sculptor, and some attorneys and 
writers. 
It was quite an impressive display. 
And this display, coupled with the state-
ment in the ad that the Emergency Com-
mittee for Disaster Relief to Cuba "is a 
nonprofit organization formed by a group 
of U.S. citizens for the purpose of carry-
ing out a humanitarian, nonpolitical mis-
sion," probably succeeded in eliciting 
large contributions from readers of the 
Washington Post who thought they were 
helping a worthy cause. 
I wish that the full facts about this 
organization and its appeal could have 
been made public the very day the ad 
appeared in the Post, or within a day or 
so after its appearance. Unfortunately 
that could not be done, but it is still im-
portant that the facts be given, that the 
public knows who is behind this organi-
zation, how and for what purpose it was 
formed. 
The tact of first importance is that the 
appeal in the ad was a hoax, a phony. It 
was completely unnecessary. It was 
made to serve not the suffering Cuban 
People, but the evil designs of their op-
pressors, the enemies of freedom and 
humanity in this hemisphere and the en-
tire world. 
Before I spell out the hoax in. this ad, 
however, I would like to state for the rec-
ord some of the facts about the people 
who are the initiators and leaders of the 
committee and thus responsible for plac-
ing this Communist-serving ad in the 
Washington Post. 
Sidney J. Gluck, chairman of the or-
ganization, was identified as a member 
of the Communist Party by Mrs. Mil-
January 14 
dred Blauvelt, an undercover informant 
for the New York City Police Depart-
ment, when she testified before the Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities on 
May 3, 1955. She stated that he was a 
member of the Flatbush Club of the 
Communist Party and, in 1944, was cred-
ited with recruiting 54 new members 
for the party. Gluck has served as an 
Instructor in the Communist Party's 
major training institution in the United 
States, the now defunct Jefferson School 
of Social Science. As treasurer of the 
Medical Aid to Cuba Committee, he was 
subpenaed to testify before the Com-
mittee on Un-American Acivities on No-
vember 14, 1962, in the course of the 
committee's investigation of that group. 
During his appearance, he invoked the 
fifth amendment when questioned about 
present as well as past Communist Party 
membership. 
Dr. Louis Miller, medical director of 
the Emergency Committee for Disaster 
Relief to Cuba, was also medical director 
of the Medical Aid to Cuba Committee. 
The Committee on Un-American Activi-
ties was unsuccessful in its attempts, 
made over a period of many weeks, to 
locate Dr. Miller so he could be sub-
penaed to testify in its hearing on the 
Medical Aid to Cuba Committee. 
Testifying before the Committee on 
Un-American Activities in executive ses-
sion in 1951, Louis Budenz, former mem-
ber of the Communist Party's national 
committee and managing editor of the 
Daily Worker, stated that he had met 
Dr. Miller during the 1940's at enlarged 
meetings of the Communist Party's na-
tional committee. A 1948 report of the 
Committee on Un-American Activities 
stated that during the 1940's Dr. Miller 
was one of the "principal New York con-
tacts" of Soviet espionage agent, Arthur 
Alexandrovich Adams, who is known to 
have had information about the atom 
bomb in his possession when he escaped 
from the United States. 
Dr. Miller began his "medical aid" role 
In the Communist movement during the 
1930's when he served as chairman of 
the Medical Aid Bureau of the American 
Friends of Spanish Democracy, a cited 
Communist front. 
Elizabeth Sutherland, a senior editor 
for the publishing firm of Simon & 
Schuster and treasurer of the Emer-
gency Committee for Disaster Relief to 
Cuba, was also treasurer of the Medical 
Aid to Cuba Committee. Miss Suther-
land was subpenaed to testify before the 
Committee' on Un-American Activities 
last year in the course of its investiga-
tion of illegal travel to Cuba. She ad-
mitted in the course of her appearance 
that she had been a member of, and had 
made a number of speeches at meetings 
of, the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. 
She also admitted having signed an ap-
peal to Great Britain to grant asylum to 
the late Dr. Robert A. Soblen, who had 
jumped bail and fled the United States 
after being convicted of spying for the 
Soviet Union and sentenced to life in 
prison. 
Miss Sutherland, who had been 
granted validation by the State Depart-
ment for travel to Cuba, testified that

arte4 support to H.R. 3/42. This bill

p lie to the ii.efd of rice production. It 
ould pe nitproducers nd longer in-
rested in raising -rice Co- tran.sfer their 
laments to perhor s who deL wish to 
Ise rice, but would no longer require 
em to also sell the land involved with 
ese allotments. In effect, the land and 
e allotment -would no longer be indel-
ly attached to each other. 
This bill is of great significance to the 
uth Carolina low country. At one 
t ue, Charleston was the rice center of 
t e /lotion. Indeed, rice production be-
n in Charleston. The first field of rice 
America was planted there and, for 
arty years, rice planting was an enif-
eritly succestful has ness in that area. 
In later years, other businesses re-
laced rice in the low cOuntrY. But the 
tential remains. There are those in

which tle owners do not wish to sell and 
the pro ecttve producers do not wish to 
buy. H. It. 3742 would remedy this situa-
tion to the E atisf action of all concerned. 
I am sire the problem I have just out-
lined is tot ,:onflned to the Carolina low 
country alone; it is found wherever rice 
is?or vviis--raised. H.R. 3742 is the an-
swer. 1 urg?. all Members to support its 
Passage.' 
Mr. LEG(1ETT. Mr. Chairman, the 
bill before you authored by the distin-
gtiished , gentleman from Texas [Mr. 
CLARK THO vison] , should generate no 
debate because it is a measure that helps 
the little man and costs the Government 
and taxPayers nothing. 
If you, are going to assume the unreal-
isticticle 
atti u that you disfavor all supply-
manage er t programs and you do not 
want aty program improved to give 
growers more freedom at no taxpayers' 
expense thm close your ears and vote 
against this bill. 
On the other hand if you think it was 
right back in 1938 that rather than give 
an allotiment to a feudal r.,ce landlord 
that the allotment in fact be given to 
the tenant, then you should support this 
bill. ' 
As yclu recall we are currently sup-
porting, six crops: Feed grains, wheat, 
cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and rice. 
CCC losses for the period 1.954 to date: 
Corn,' $2.1. billion, CCC losses, 10 years. 
Wheat, $4.4 billion, CCC losses, 10 
years. ' 
Grain serghum, $604 million, CCC 
losses, TO years. 
Cotton, 31.3` billion, CCC losses, 10 
years. 
Rice--rough, $964,000, CCC losses, 
1962-6T. 
Frojebtec losses on all commodities 
for the cur: ent year are $995 million. 
In rite Ye determined in 1938 that it 
Was to the tdvantage of the entire coun-
try that we not overplant this commod-
ity.' 
Rice 'represents a potentially surplus 
comincidity when supply management 
has bean successful. 
First; Costs have been minimal. 
Secotd. We are planting 98 percent of 
the allOtmilnts. 
Third. We have protected the little 
tenants. 
The cur .ent bill would further pro-
tect thp te nant because it would allow 
him to biKT an allotment without being 
saddled with an expensive land pur-
chase. (Rice land is extremely expen-
sive.) Ty enty-five years of operation 
has seth no precedent for other commod-
ities. 
* Tod 
y, as a result of the 87th Congress 
legisla ion if a landowner-producer 
watts to get out of rice production he 
can fit'st, lie and his allotment is sev-
ered from the land and goes to his fam-
ily; seeone, he can sever a portion of his 
allotment and give it to members of his 
family' third, he can break up a part-
nershik; fourth, he can sell his whole 
allotment, his equipment, and land. 
If he his no family he cannot retire 
from rite unless he dies or gets rid of 
his farm. A tenant has this flexibility 
and so should the landlord. Many land-
lords have two kinds of allotments?
some affixed to the land and some not 
so. The rules should be made uniform. 
As a practical matter it is better many 
times to rotate rice land, and this is 
another reason to support this bill. 
At the present time in my State the 
only way for anew farmer to get into 
rice is to: first, buy a whole farm; sec-
ond, buy a tenant allotment and lease; 
and, third, obtain a. new farmer 30-acre 
allotment. I believe farmers in the last 
two categories should be encouraged and 
thus I would ask your support for this

Over the years, he has been active in

Years ago he admitted to an investigator 
for the Committee on Un-American Ac-

Young Communist League while a stu-

that he was actually a member of the 
group. 
Mrs. Ava Helen Pauling, like her hus-

of the Communist Party's candidates for 
President and Vice President of the 
United States. At one time, he served as 
special correspondent for the Communist

In 1955 he was invited to Red China. 
The State Department denied him a

? nist-serving relief organization? In 
other words, what was the validity of the 
appeal? Was it an honest one or a 
fraud? 
Hurricane Flora struck eastern Cuba 
on October 4 and lashed large parts of 
the island for 4 days. It did tremendous 
damage to crops, cities and towns, and 
took hundreds of lives. Immediate offers 
of relief came from all over the world?
from non-Communist nations as well as 
those under Red control. 
The United States did not hold back 
despite the fact that it had severed dip-
lomatic relations with Cuba, the island 
is serving as an oversea center for So-
viet subversion of all of Latin America 
and an advance Red military base for fu-
ture use against this country. The 
American Red Cross and other welfare 
agencies, with the knowledge and con-
sent of our Government, offered to send 
medical supplies, food, emergency equip-
ment, and relief and disaster specialists 
to Cuba?just as they did to Haiti, To-
bago, and other Caribbean areas dev-
astated by Hurricane Flora. 
What happened? 
Castro's Communist regime accepted 
the relief offered by all Communist coun-
tries and organizations and also the re-
lief offered by non-Communist sources?
except for the United States. The Amer-
ican Red Cross offer, of assistance was 
turned down. 
Castro had decided that he would deny 
to his suffering people the benefit of the 
funds, equipment, and know-how of the 
American Red Cross which, over a period 
of many years, has chalked up an out-
standing record of speedy, effective, and 
massive relief to victims of disasters in all 
parts of the world. Castro had a Com-
munist card up his sleeve, and he was 
going to play it no matter how much it 
hurt the Cuban people. 
He was going to use the disaster as a 
vehicle for anti-U.S. propaganda in Cuba 
and throughout the world. 
He was going to use the disaster in an 
attempt to divide the American people 
from their Government. 
He was going to use it?and this was 
his primary objective?to break the U.S. 
economic blockade of Cuba and bring 
about a reversal of our Cuban policy. 
Worldwide, this is a major Communist 
objective today because the blockade has 
hurt not only the Communist regime in 
Cuba but all Communist nations. All 
are economically hard pressed, yet they 
must keep Cuba going?the Cuba whose 
economy was wrecked by the bungling, 
waste, and mismanagement of Castro's 
Red regime even before Hurricane Flora 
struck. Cuba is a drain on the inter-
national Communist economy. The U.S. 
economic blockade intensifies the drain. 
Castro's first step, following his re-
jection of U.S. aid, was an attempt to 
399 
justify his action in the eyes of the Cu-
ban people, the American people, and 
the world. In typical Communist fash-
ion, he claimed that his decision was 
based on his concern for world peace. 
On October 11, a Havana broadcast in 
English made the following statement: 
The Cuban representatives in the United 
Nations in rejecting the offer of help used 
harsh words not just for the sake of calling 
names, but in order to alert the world to 
the dangerous role that the U.S. Govern-
ment is playing, for it is an admitted fact 
that the warmakers are trying to do exact-
ly what the hurricane did. * * * Is it not 
hypocrisy and a fake gesture of generosity 
to offer help under such conditions? What 
is behind this deception? Is it not to blind 
the peace forces to the real nature of the 
warmaker's intentionsrto dress up the beast 
of imperialism and make it look like -a sweet 
kitten? 
In refusing to cooperate with a lie, Cuba 
may be passing up some food and clothing 
and medicines that might have come 
through the Red Cross, but it is also pre-
venting the warmakers from putting over a 
bluff. In that sense Cuba's rejection of the 
hypocritical or demagogic offer is a sacri-
fice that it is making in order to safeguard 
the peace of the world, and of course that 
is for the benefit of the people of the United 
States also. 
Another English language broadcast to 
the United States on October 14 quoted 
from an editorial in the Cuban Commu-
nist newspaper Hoy of October 11, in ex-
planation of why the U.S. offer had been 
rejected. This editorial claimed that the 
U.S. aid offer was "nothing more than a 
cheap way to confuse international public 
opinion about the policy of the United 
States toward Cuba" and a "trick to 
throw the world off guard, through which 
the imperialists hope to be able to carry 
out their war plan even more effectively." 
Castro wanted to do more, however, 
than simply brand the United States as a 
hypocritical, warmaking imperialist na-
tion. He wanted to use as many Ameri-
cans as he could against their Govern-
ment. He wanted, if possible, to split 
American opinion on the question of U.S. 
Cuban policy. For this reason, the Oc-
tober 11 broadcast, from which I have al-
ready qucted, directed an appeal for as-
sistance to the American people, as 
distinguished from the U.S. Government. 
The broadcast reviewed aid that had 
been given to foreign Communist causes 
in the past through Communist fronts 
operating in the United States. It men-
tioned, as examples, the work of the 
North American Committee To Aid 
Spanish Democracy during the thirties 
and the World War II operations of Rus-
sian War Relief. The broadcast stated: 
The common people in the United States 
have proved by their past action * * " that 
they will respond to calls for help just as 
generously as the people of Prance, Israel, the 
Soviet Union, or any other country, provided 
that an organization is present to help them 
channel their sentiments. 
The last part of that quotation is 
most significant and bears repetition: 
"Provided that an organization is present 
to help them channel their sentiments." 
Then the appeal for help was made to 
the American people. The Cuban broad-
cast said:

also said; "However, we will accept any 
offer of help from the North American peo-
pl S, from any U.S. citizen who wishes at this 
time to express solidarity with us in any way 
he sees fit." Those are the wards of an offi-
cial spokesman of the Cuban Government. 
In another English language broadcast 
on October ,14, Havana radio stated that 
though Cuba had rejected American Red 
ClaaSS assistanee'

have not tiumed their backs on an offer of

fer of assistance:

from any U.S. citizen who wishes at this

Way he sees fit. 
The Havana radio broadcasts did not 
fall on deaf ea -s. On October 18, a 
"1)ear Friend" letter was mailed from the 
post office box of Dr. Louis Miller in 
New York to persons who had been on 
the znailing list of the Medical Aid to

Mr. Speaker, the Fair Play for Cuba 
Comm .ttee has been the major pro-
Castro front in the United States since 
its organization in the spring of 1960, 
a few months after the bearded dictator 
sated control of Cuba. Lee Harvey Os-
wald, Excused assassin of President Ken-
nedy, tias head of the New Orleans chap-
ter of his group. 
The U.S. Communist Party, of course, 
dicl not remain idle. It did just what 
we would expect it to do. Within a few 
days it, too, had issued an official state-
ment on the Cuban disaster. Havana 
Radio played up the statement in an 
October 23 broadcast. The full text of 
it Was published in the party's news-
paper, the Worker, of October 27. The 
statement read in part as follows: 
Ike c ll upon the members and friends to 
be in toe forefront of this activity [the col-
lection of relief for Cuba] and to spur their 
organizations for the collection of urgently 
neelded aid. 
It ended with these words: 
We call upon each and every Communist 
to look upon the mobilization for immediate 
dislister aid to Cuba as a sacred duty in the 
care cf common humanity as well as an act 
of solider* binding all those sharing a 
coin= a ideal. 
Sigr iflcantly, this official Communist 
Party statement pointed out that "a 
nu,mbe r of people's organizations are al-
ready moving to collect funds, food, 
clothing, and urgently needed medi-
cines.' 
l'People's organizations," in Commu-
niat parlance, means Communist front 
or fellow traveling groups. 
The issue of the Worker which carried 
the full text of the above statement also 
featured an article about the formation 
of the Emergency Committee for Dis-
aster Relief to Cuba--and noted that 
contributions were to be made payable 
tci Dr. Miller at his New York City post 
office box. 
No "Jommunist or fellow traveler who 
reads the Worker could fail to get the 
message. Havana radio summarized the 
Ctanntunist Party statement in these 
words: 
the communique also asks all members 
and Communist Party sympathizers to head 
movements of aid for Cuba. * * * The corn-
milnique concludes by asking each North 
Amertfan Communist to consider an im-
media a mobilization to help the people af-
fected by the disaster * * as an act of 
solidai ity which is binding on all those who 
share ,t common ideal. 
the Communist Party fully understood 
the political move Castro was making in 
rejecting the American Red Cross offer 
of help. It knew that Communist front 
aid to Cuba was only a secondary aim 
and that breaking the blockade was the 
major one. The statement therefore 
nmde this point: 
Tod ty when the heroic people of Cuba, 
uider the leadership of Fremier Fidel Castro, 
a uidergoint such untold hardships, it 
Approved For Releas 
must become the immediate duty-41 every 
decent American to demand that the prim' 
nal blockade be lifted forthwith In order to 
allow the full st expression of solidarity 
and humanity 'Oy the people of our country 
to the people of Cuba. 
There must be renewed and concerted effort 
on the part of all peaceloving and demo-
cratic-minded Americans to demand that 
the Kennedy administration put an end to 
the present Cuba policy and embark upon 
a new policy of peace and friendship and 
normal trade and diplomatic relations. This 
IS essential in the interests of our own peo-
ple as well as Cuban people and for world 
peace. 
The Worker followed this up with an 
editorial in the issue of October 29 de-
manding an end to the embargo and 
calling on its readers to write letters to 
the President and the State Depart-
ment urging such action. 
Meanwhile what was the Emergency 
Committee for Disaster Relief to Cuba 
doing? By November 1, it had an office 
and printed stationery on which, under 
that date, it mailed out a second appeal 
for contributions. This letter was signed 
by Gluck as chairman of the new organi-
zation, Elizateth Sutherland as treas-
trer, and Dr. Miller as medical director, 
checks to be made payable to him. 
Various Communist groups in the 
United States which, despite their ideo-
logical differences, have been united in 
their support of 'Castro, went to work on 
behalf of the Emergency Committee for 
Disaster Relief to Cuba. Favorable items 
about the formation of the group and its 
activities appeared not only in the 
Worker, its west coast counterpart, the 
People's World., and the National Guard-
ian, but also in the Militant, official 
organ of the Trotskyists? and the Work-
ers World, the publication of another 
Communist splinter group. 
The Communist Party's monthly mag-
azine, New World Review, in its issue of 
December 1963, told its readers that they 
should support the Emergency Commit-
tee for Disaster Relief to Cuba and called 
for an end to the "inhuman embargo 
whereby our Government seeks to stran-
gle Socialist Cuba." 
The committee was also helping it-
self. It had sufficient funds to place a 
half-page ad in the National Guardian 
of November '7 and to pay for a full-page, 
back cover ad in the November 30 issue 
of the Nation magazine. The Washing-
ton Post ad of December 16, which cost 
approximately $800. was apparently the 
high point in its advertising campaign. 
I believe the facts make it incontest-
ably clear that the Emergency Commit-
tee for Disaster Relief to Cuba is a Com-
munist agency?Commupist in its inspi-
ration, Communist in its operation, Com-
munist in its aims. 
Contrary to its claim in the Washing-
ton Post ad, it is not carrying out "a 
humanitarian, nonpolitical mission." 
The ad was a fraud and a hoax. The 
committee is designed to exploit the 
suffering of the Cuban people in order to 
play on the generosity and gullibility of 
non-Communist Americans to aid Castro 
and Ithrushchev in their efforts to break 
the U.S. embargo on Cuba, to undermine 
this country's overall policy toward Cuba, 
to strengthen Castro, and thus to aid

?CommUnist subversion throughout Latin 
America. Its purposes, to put it bluntly, 
are primarily anti-United States. 
Even as this committee and other 
Communist organizations throughout the 
world are pleading for funds to help the 
Cuban people, Castro is attempting to 
round up 500 Americans who will defy 
their Government by visiting Cuba this 
summer?with all expenses paid by his 
Red regime. This will cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars?a sum which would 
pay for extensive relief for the Cuban 
people if Castro were at all interested in 
their welfare. 
But, no, Castro is not concerned with 
the welfare of his slaves. He wants only 
the expansion of Communist power. 
And, unfortunately, there are people in 
this country who are all too ready to help 
him?and there are newspapers which, 
for the money, will assist Communist op-
erations of this type. 
Some people wonder about how Com-
munist. fronts get started, how they func-
tion, the disguises they use to conceal 
their true purposes?and what those pur-
poses are. The facts about the Emer-
gency Committee for Disaster Relief to 
Cuba go far toward answering all (mei-
dons? of this type. This organization is 
one that no American loyal to his coun-
try and the principles on which it Is 
founded would touch with a 10-foot pole. 
PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND THREAT 
TO CANAL ZONE 
(Mr. DORN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. DORM. Mr. speaker, President 
Lyndon Johnson issued the following 
statement this morning at 12:30 a.m. 
after a 21/2-hour conference on the Pan-
natna crisis: 
The.Upitecl States tries to live by the policy 
of the good neighbor and expects others to 
do the same. 
The United States cannot allow the secur-
ity of the Panama Canal to be imperiled. 
We have a recognized obligation to operate 
the Canal efficiently and securely, and we 
Intend to honor that obligation in the in-
terest of all who depend on it. 
The United States continues to believe that 
when order is fully .restored, it should be 
possible to have direct and candid discus-
sions between the two governments. 
I commend President Johnson for his 
strong and reassuring statement, 
Over the years the American people 
have been gravely concerned about Com-
munist agitation, mob violence, and dis-
order all aimed at American ownership 
of the Panama Canal. Communist 
agents, subversives, and saboteurs from 
Red Cuba, Russia, and China are con-
stantly at work to undermine U.S. sov-
ereignty over the Canal. 
I joined the distinguished and able 
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. 
noon) and the distinguished and able 
gentleman from Alabama [Mr. BELDEN] 
and others in opposing the flying of the 
Panamanian flag over the Canal Zone 
beside the U.S. flag. We knew then that 
U.S. acquiescence to this demand would 
lead to further demands and eventually 
would lead to a demand that the United 
States withdraw front the Canal Zone 
entirely, placing the Canal under inter-
national control or under Panamanian 
control. It is now imperative that we 
make no further concessions to Commu-
nist inspired mob violence and the wild 
demands and ridiculous charges in Hav-
ana, Peiping, and Moscow. 
Mr. Speaker, I again commend Presi-
dent Johnson for assigning to the Pan-
ama crisis the proper priority and for 
immediately realizing the grave threat 
to the security of the Canal Zone and 
thus the security of the United States 
and the Western World.

THEIR PRESCRIPTION: INTEGRA-
TION?U.S. NURSES ASKED FOR 
"QUIET, PLEASE" 
(Mrs. FRANCES P. BOLTON (at the 
request of Mr. THOMSON of Wis-
consin) was given permission to extend 
her remarks at this point in the RECORD, 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mrs. FRANCES P. BOLTON, Mr. 
Speaker, as you know, my interest in 
nursing goes over many, many years, and 
I have been particularly interested in 
the very effective and quiet way in which 
the Negro nurses have been taken into 
the American Nurses Association. 
The Association for Colored Graduate 
Nurses was the first group to amalga-
mate with another organization. This 
was due very largely to the consecrated 
work of Estelle Riddle and Mable Keaton 
Staupers. To my mind, there is no 
group in this country who make better 
nurses than our colored people. They 
seem to have an intuitive capacity for it. 
Now that it is possible for them to get 
the best training there is, they are able 
to project themselves into the work with 
their minds and their hands trained?
their hearts already working for the best 
for the patient. 
The Washington Post on January 5, 
published a very interesting article 
about Mrs. Staupers and her work. I 
have taken the liberty to edit it a little 
401 
that It may not be too long, but I feel 
sure that all House Members will want 
to know what is in this interesting 
article: 
U.S. NURSES ASKED FOR "QUIET, PLEASE" 
(13y Louise Durbin) 
"Integration in the nursing profession? 
We did It quietly. The nursing leaders 
thought the quiet way was the best way." 
It was Mabel Keaton Staupers, former presi-
dent of the National Association for Colored 
Graduate Nurses which merged with the 
American Nurses' Association, talking in her 
Washington home. 
Though she undertook it quietly, the 
sprightly, '73-year-old Mrs. Staupers thor-
oughly accomplished her purpose and 
achieved equality for members of her pro-
fession. 
Today, the State nurses' associations in 
every one of the 50 States are integrated?
Georgia was the last to lower the barrier in 
1962. 
The American Nursing Association itself is 
a smoothly operating and integrated organi-
zation that has a full-time department de-
voted to intergroup relations. 
More and more Negro nursing schools are 
closing their doors as qualified Negro stu-
dents are attending integrated schools of 
nursing. 
All six District of Columbia schools of 
nursing?Capital City at D.C. General Hos-
pital, Catholic University of America, Freed-
men's Hospital, Georgetown University, 
Lucy Webb Hayes at Sibley Memorial Hos-
pital, and Washington Hospital Center?ac-
cept Negro nursing students. The number 
who enroll Is small?as reflected in the 5 
Negro girls out of the total 181 students who 
are seeking to become R.N.'s at Capital City 
School of Nursing. 
Of 178 collegiate nursing programs 
throughout the country, 109 had accepted 
qualified Negro students by 1961. * * 
Today, several of these 12 colleges already 
have changed their policies and now admit 
Negro students. * ? ? 
Negro RN's are accepted as officers M all 
branches of the Armed rorces, 
More and more hospitals are employing 
Negro nurses as members of the staff in all 
departments that require R.N.'s. Of the hos-
pitals in the District of Columbia, only Doc-
tors Hospital has not employed Negro regis-
tered nurses to date. 
Typical of area hospitals is George Wash-
ington University Hospital, where 94 of the 
174 full time R.N.'s employed on the staff 
and in administrative positions are Negroes. 
But in 1984, when the NAOMI opened its 
office in the same New York building with 
the other nursing organizations, things were 
tough, though the ANA had, since its begin-
nings in 1890, offered membership to all 
qualified nurses. 
"You must remember that at the age and 
time we started, people definitely believed 
in segregation," said Mrs, Staupers. 
"Frequently I had to send a girl, who came 
to my office, back to prepare herself before 
she could even be accepted by a good school 
of nursing. The dual educational system 
in Southern States didn't provide adequate 
high school training. And of course we had 
to work to get the good nursing schools to 
accept Negro students. 
PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES DID THE FRONT-
RUNNING 
"How did we get nursing schools and hos-
pitals to accept Negro students and R.N.'s? 
You can't do it all alone. The most impor-
tant thing is that you have to get people in 
high places to understand the problems and 
do the front-running," explained the remark-
able pioneer. 
"For years Catholic University didn't ac-

And the remarkable Mabel Staupers has (Mr. POFF (at the request of Mr. 
told her own story, of her tireless, unceasing THOMSON of Wisconsin) was given per-

nate work. /n 1936 we appealed to the Cath-
cilia Interracial Council and asked them to 
change the situation themselves. They did." 
Mrs. Staupers recalled another incident: 
"A Negro who had applied for admission to 
Yale Graduate School of Nursing was told she 
would be happier in a Negro school. 
"I wrote her and told her nursing at its 
best was a lot at hard work and the most 
important thing was to get the best qualifi-
cations?you didn't go to nursing school to 
be happy. 
"Then we appealed to a member of the Yale 
board, Dr. ADS011 Phelps Stokes. He under-. 
stood the problem. In 1946 the first Negro 
nurse graduated from a Yale collegiate nurs-
ing course. 
"One of the greatest champions we ever 
had is Representative PRANCES PAYNE BOLT 
TON, Republican, of Ohio. She spearheaded 
the opening of the Wesern RIDSOTH3 Univer-
sity school of nursing?which is named for 
her?to Negro students in 1946." 
The Barbados-born and Harlem-bred Mrs. 
Staupers recalled other parts of the NACGN 
nursing history of her time. 
"Only tour of the some 200 hospitals in the 
New York metropolitan area employed Negro 
nurses in 1937?Lincoln, Harlem, Seaview, 
and Riverside. 
"And in the few hospitals in the North 
where Negro RN's were employed there were 
subtle ways to differentiate-1f a Negro nurse 
was given a supervisor's job, she wasn't given 
the title or pay that went with it." 
When Mabel Staupers went to bat for the 
NACCIN, she put her appeal for equal pay 
for Negro nurses to hospital boards strictly 
on an eConomic basis. 
"We pointed out that a Negro nurse had 
to pay just as much for her uniform and 
shoes RS a white nurse did," she explained. 
"We were trying to win our fight for the 
tuning profession and policies?to give the 
best patient care?not just for Negroes. The 
most precious friends the Negro nurses had, 
in both the North and South, were the white 
nurses who took up the fight with us?and 
for us," she continued. 
"When a person is ill, the average patient 
would never refuse a Negro nurse so long as 
he knows the hospital is responsible for the 
nurse's qualifications. Qualifications are all-
important," she stressed. 
During World War U, a quota of Negro 
nurses were accepted in the Army?then 
relegated to serving prisoners of war or 
segregated Negro troops. The Navy refused 
to accept Negro nurses. 
Then, after endless redtape and talk with 
generals and admirals, Mrs. Stumm was 
received in November 1044, by Eleanor 
Roosevelt, who listened carefully and 
sympathetically to the-problems. By Janu-
ary 1945, the Navy Nurse Corps announced 
it would accept nurses regardless of race, 
and, at the same time, discrimination in the 
Army was on the wane. 
The smooth blending of the NACC1N into 
the ANA took place 12 years ago, in 1961, 
without fanfare or fuss. An intergroup rela-
tions department had been set up' within 
the ANA in 1946 so that by the time the 
NACGN disbanded in 1961, the ANA and Its 
predominantly white membership were well 
prepared for the merger. 
"We dissolved our corporation, and turned 
our well-being over to the ANA," Mrs. 
Staupera said simply. 
Ironically, it was the Negro girls who had 
to be prepared for integration when it came. 
"We went all over' the country urging the 
girls to Join State nurses' associations when 
they did open their doors to qualified Negro 
graduate nurses. We told them If they 
didn't join and participate, we couldn't help 
them, for we were working for nursing and 
policies, not just Negroes.' she explained.

TIME FOR COOL HEADS 
(Mr. KEITH (at the request of Mr. 
TnomsoN of Wisconsin) was given per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the REcoRD, and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. KEITH. Mr. Speaker, all of us 
are well aware that the situation con-
fronting both the United States and 
Panama is ominous. Now as much as at 
any other time in the history of our rela-
tions, all sensible, diplomatic means 
should be used to reach an agreement 
and understanding which will be mu-
tually satisfactory to both the United 
States and Panama. Our long-term in-
terests and those of Panama are iden-
tical and demand the continued and 
efficient operation of the canal. In this 
connection, I would like to call an ex-
traordinarily reasonable and farsighted 
editorial from the Standard Times of 
New Bedford of January 11, 1964, to the 
attention of my colleagues. 
[From the New Bedford (Mass.) Standard-
Times, Jan. 11, 1964] 
TIME volt Coot HEADS 
It would be a terrible tragedy if hot-
headed young Panamanian leftists, and 
American students who should know better, 
were allowed to provoke a permanent break 
between the United States and Panama. 
The situation in the Canal Zone is made 
to order for Fidel Castro. He is only too 
aware of the undercurrent of ilIwili against 
the United States in Panama and he fans 
the flame at every opportunity, hoping to 
force Washington to abandon the Canal 
Zone. 
The United States has no intention of get-
ting out. It Is in the zone by mutual agree-
ment between the two countries, pays sub-
stantial wages to those who operate the 
canal, and needs the zone as a lifeline be-
tween the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 
The United States has been regularly 
wanting new and more generous economic 
and political concessions to Panama. Last 
January, this country permitted Panama to 
claim titular sovereignty over the Canal 
Zone, and agreed that flags DORI both coun-
tries would fly side by side over 16 designated 
locations. 
The agreement when into full effect Jan-
uary 1, 1964, but American high school stu-
dents broke it this week when they raised 
the American flag at a nonauthorized spot 
in front of Balboa High School despite an 
appeal from Robert J. Fleming, Jr., U.S. 
Governor of the zone. 
Young Panamanians, spurred on by Fidel-
leas, then attacked the U.S. Embassy, de-
stroyed American property and fired on U.S. 
troops who were forced to return the fire. 
The result: At least 20 dead, about 200 
wounded and the most serious disagreement 
yet between Panama and the United States, 
Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, an item ap-
peared in the December 20 issue of the 
Washington Star which may have 
escaped the attention of some lawmakers 
and in which, in my judgment, every law-
maker and law practitioner should take 
an interest. I quote herewith the news 
article which is datelined Warsaw: 
Poland's 6,700 lawyers will be forced into 
collectives under a measure ending private 
legal practice in the Communist nation. 
The bill was passed last night by Poland's 
Communist-dominated Parliament with only 
five opposing votes. Although a client may 
still select his own attorney, fees will be set 
by the Government and paid to the lawyers' 
association. Part of the income will be di-
vided equally among all members of the col-
lective and part in proportion to the work 
they do. 
Sponsors of the bill argued that legal fees 
were too high for ordinary people. 
Mr. Speaker, many lawyers seem un-
concerned about the fact that some peo-
ple in America would like to see the 
medical profession socialized. Because 
they are not personally and immediately 
concerned, they have closed their eyes 
and ears to the threat. Lawyers would 
do well to come to the aid of their sister 
profession. Who can say that the next 
Proposal might not be "Legal Aid to the 
Aged," and next "Medical and Legal Aid 
for Everybody."

Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, since last 
week 'when the Bilglish trade with the 
Communist Cuba bus deal CaMQ to pub-
lic attention, I demanded the State De-
partment t file a protest with the Brit-

ban against Castro's Cuba. 
The Citizens' CoMmittee for a Free 
Cuba has since charged that this deal 
amounting to $12.2 million is the lat-
est in a .series of setbacks in U.S. di-
plomacy." 
The committee cites tie sale of Ca-
nadian wheat to Russia, with a portion 
set aside for Cuba," the increasing num-
ber of spare parts reaching Cuba for in-

showing the "porousness" of U.S. poli-

I enclose in the RECORD the full text 
of the Cftiaens' Committee for a Free

which gWes a full review of the bus deal, 
points Out the further implications of 
the bus deal in that Cubars transport 
system was bogged -crown as the -result Of 
effectiVe sabotage on the part of the Cu-
ban people and "the Leyland bus deal 
goes far in getting him?Castro?off a 
very serious hook with his own rebel-
lious subjects." 
The committee joins in a call I have 
been making, for some time for "greater 
determination" on the part of the Unit-
ed States in our policy of "isolation" 
of Cuba. . 
ENGLISH Bus SALE UNDERMINES CUBAN 
RESISTANCE 
The current sale of 450 Leyland buses by 
England to Castro, with adequate supplies of 
spare parts included, is the latest in a series 
of setbacks in U.S. 'diplomacy; The deal 
amounts to 912.2 million. 
The sale of Canadian wheat to Russia, with 
a portion set aside for Cuba, and the in-
creasing numbers of spare parts reaching 
Cuba through various unauthorized c.han-
neIs for Castro's desperate industrial plant, 
underscores the porousness of U.S. policy. 
Perhaps the most important effect which this 
porousneas has had, and will continue to have 
unless something drastic is done, will be on 
the determination of the Cuban people to 
continue their resistance to Castro's Commu-
nist regime. 
Perhaps inadvertently, possibly deliberate-
ly, the determination of the United States 
and the free World to maintain and strength-
en its economic blockade has been matched 
by an equal determination of the Cuban peo-
ple to sabotage the regime Out of business. 
Breakthrough now by Castro in essential 
transport, represented by the purchase of 
buses, cannot but have a weakening effect 
on the future resistance of the Cuban people. 
It may presage future deals by our own al-
lies, triggered,- some lawmakers maintain, by 
our own Government-sponsored sale of grain 
to Russia .and Iron Curtain countries. Our 
policymakers who hope and expect the Cuban 
people to continue their resistance, and Cas-
tro effectively undermined, can only see their 
policy smashed by spare parts, wheat, and 
other grain deals. 
If, over the past several years, our Govern-
ment had told the story of Cuban resistance 
to our press and made it a point of policy to 
relate this resistance to its economic embar-
go, perhaps the stake of all, including our 
allies, would be more readily understood. In-
stead, the embargo has been handled as a 
part of impersonal economic relationships 
between nations without regard to human 
Values to which it should have been related. 
Here is a partial history of the partially 
effective U.& economic blockade on Castro's 
transportation, the contributions which have 
been made by the Cuban people themselves: 
In 1958 there were 303 urban, interurban, 
municipal, and provincial bus companies in 
Cuba which operated 4,459 passenger buses. 
Many of these companies were run as highly 
efficient and democratic cooperatives. A large 
percentage of bus drivers owned their own 
air-conditioned, modern U.S.-built buses, 
with automatic transmissions, and Cuba had 
bus service unequalled anywhere in the 
Caribbean or Latin America. 
Castro and the Communists seized the bus 
lines arid incorporated them into state-run 
enterprises. In defense of their rights, 
former owner-drivers who were then im-
pressed into working for the state, set about 
sabotaging the Government lines. They per-
mitted people to ride free; they "managed" 
to miss bus stops; drove into groups of Com-
munist demonstrators; and in many cases 
actually burned their vehicles. Their ex-
ploits were documented from 1961 on?in 
daily accounts in RevoluciOn and Hoy of ar-
rests and confinement. Of some 3,000 anti-
Castroites rounded up and jailed in a tunnel 
in Principe Prison on April 17, 1961, the fate-
ful day of the landing at the Bay of Pigs, 258 
were bus drivers, another 183 were con-
ductors., and still another 102 were taxi 
drivers. In February of 1963, Minister of 
Transport, Omar Fernandez, publicly de-
nounced Cuba's bus drivers as "the most 
counterrevolutionary element in our coun-
try." 
The combination of shortage of parts and 
sabotage reduced the number of buses op-
erating in Havana from 1,400 in 1958 to fewer 
than 800 in 1963. These figures were sup-
plied by Hoy itself on March 27, 1963. Of the 
800 left in service, the bulk of them were of 
Czech make, with manual transmissions, no 
air conditioning, and no safety glass or stor-
age facilities for baggage. Ill adapted to 
Cuba's terrain and weather, the Czech buses 
constantly broke dawn and were easy targets 
for the sabotage visited upon them by their 
drivers, maintenance men, and conductors. 
Passengers slashed the seats and broke the 
doors. 
The breakdown in transport also made it 
difficult for factory and office managers to 
determine virelither absenteeism which was 
plaguing the regime was deliberate or was 
due to the breakdown in public transporta-
tion, as the confusion in industry mounted. 
The regime desperately tried to overcome the 
critical situation by impressing domestic 
servants into learning to drive confiscated 
private automobiles and assigning them to 
routes as "popular transport." This merely 
increased the traffic hazards. By the time of 
the sale of BritiSh Leyland buses, the Castro 
regime was reduced to using Soviet military 
trucks, equipped with makeshift benches 
and a small ladder extending down from the 
tailgate. 
Last May, Omar Fernandez excoriated 
Cuba's taxi drivers who, like their colleague 
bus driver-owners, had been deprived of their 
autonomy and virtually of a livelihood. 
Speaking at the National Congress of Taxi 
Drivers, he charged that their ranks are 
"filled with negative elements, bums, and de-
linquents." He threatened that those "who 
do not stop to pick up passengers will be 
severely punished." Describing their atti-
tude as "one of anarchy," Fernandez called 
for tighter controls. Just prior to his out-
burst, in March of 1963, nine cab drivers 
were put on trial for "displaying an unco-
operative attitude and a failure to maintain 
revolutionary vigilance during the night 
hours." The implication was that they 
either were working against the regime as 
members of the resistance or had refused to 
become informers for the Comr4Unists. In 
an editorial last May 18, Hoy accused bus 
drivers of "running their buses onto the 
curbs without regard for their tires." 
297 
Last August 27, the Department of Public 
Order (the secret police) Issued an order 
which set up "popular tribunals to judge 
those workers in the field of public trans-
portation for their infractions." Those 
found guilty were sent to the concentration 
camp of Guanahacabibes in Pinar del Rio 
Province. "Popular tribunals" also were em-
powered to determine, among the public 
transport drivers, those who "drove crazily 
and without regard for the equipment." A 
militiaman was assigned to each eight drivers 
to "watch their attitudes." In September, 
Cuban workers were required to fill out forms 
indicating the types of transportation used, 
the names of the drivers, and "observations." 
Cuba's railways?also administered by the 
Ministry of Transport?have been struck as 
well by sabotage. From December 28 of 1962 
through the middle of February of 1963, 
Cuban saboteurs caused three major train 
wrecks. They occurred In Las Villas, Matan-
zas, and Pinar del Rio Provinces. 
Workers at sugar mills did their share, as 
well. In checking the falling sugar produc-
tion INRA headquarters "noted" the extraor-
dinary number of accidents, with locomo-
tives. Sugar Central Josefita in Havana 
province radioed that it had only one loco-
motive in operation. "The other," said the 
radio operator, "had been derailed." /NRA 
headquarters asked for a full explanation 
and dispatched an inspector to the mill to 
investigate, stating that "there is not an 
extra locomotive in all of Cuba." 
In a 3-week period from the end of Febru-
ary to the middle of March, a rash of reports 
sent to LNRA in Havana told of locomotives 
being derailed at sugar mills. Sugar Central 
Mercedes in Matanzas Province reported on 
February 27 that "a train had been derailed 
while transporting cane to the mill." 
On March 9, the Cuban Government re-
vealed that another train wreck had taken 
place near Ciego de Avila, Camagtiey prov-
ince. The engineer of one of the trains and 
several others were killed in the crash. The 
Government announced that the balance of 
the train crews "have been detained by 
agents of public order." 
In February, the radio operator of the 
provincial delegation of sugar mills foi 
Camagiley radioed Havana that "the people 
most against us are those at the sugar mill 
of San Francisco." On March 20, the head 
of the sugar mills for the province stated 
that "anti-Government groups spread the 
rails of the lines at the sugar mill of San 
Francisco, causing the derailment of two 
trains." 
The inability of Omar Fernandez to stem 
the tide of sabotage led, just last month, to 
his being ousted and replaced by Faure Cho-
mon. Yet, last Wednesday, January 8, Ha-
vana's Radio Progreso revealed that train 
wrecks were still continuing, and were the 
result of sabotage: 
"An important meeting was held at the 
Cuban-Spanish (Communist) Friendship So-
ciety by the railway workers where agree-
ments of the National Railway Council were 
approved. 
'With respect to the train wrecks, it was 
agreed to ask the State Railway Enterprise 
and the Ministry of Transport to punish 
those responsible. [They] should be pun-
ished uniformly and inflexibly with a 1-
year's suspension of work without pay or 
enjoyment of any benefits of labor legisla-
tion. After the year of suspension, they 
should spend another year earning a lower 
salary at lower position than before. In the 
case of being implicated in a train wreck, 
those responsible should be taken before 
the State Railway Enterprise, the labor 
union, and before the courts." 
The announcement also admitted to the 
disappearance of essential property: "To 
combat theft, the State Railway Enterprise 
and the union will both support action 
against the thief, including his final and

The calumny heaped upon bus and taxi 
ivers extended to porters: "It was also 
a eed to suspend and punish those porters 
w o refuse to load baggage." 
An effort to do away with taxi drivers was 
c.ntatiied in the resolution to "study the ad-
v sabiltty of using the 'popular transport' to 
d lye passengers and so put an end to the 
a uses of some taxi drivers and auto own-
It it clear that the Castro regime itself 
^ lates the breakdown of Cuba's transport 
s stein to effective sabotage on the part of 
t e Cuban people. The Leyland bus deal 
goes far in getting him off a very serious 
h..k with his own rebellious subjects. If 
or our allies sell Castro planes for his 
rlines, trains for "interprovincial travel," 
a d taxis to be driven by militants of the 
C nununist Party, whtch he said he was 
d terreined to purchase abroad, our policy 
o "isolation" will have been turned into a 
ajor disaster. Our Cuba policy, which has 
b-en under bipartisan fire, will have col-
,psed entirely. From all indications it 
.uld appear that this growing trend must 
It.t only be stopped, but rolled back with a 
eater determination than has yet been 
splayed. 
KENTUCKY'S RETURN TO THE 
MAJOR LEAGUES 
(Mr. CHELF (at the request of Mr. 
oGEF.s of Colorado) was given permis-
s on to extend his remarks at this point 
the REcoan, and to include extraneous 
atter.) 
Mr. CHEL.P. Mr. Speaker, for the 
St time in over 60 years Kentuckians 
ye an opportunity to secure a major 
1 ague baseball club. The city of Louis-
v lie has always been a splendid baseball 
wit She was a.member of the National 
ague as far back as 1876, and had a 
f anchise with them from 1892 to 1899, 
a tine when Louisville's present base-
11 critics were unborn, unknown, and 
-diapered. 
Ever since I was E4 small child I can 
^ all the accomplishments of our Louis-
lie "Colonels." It hasn't been but a few 
ars ago when it beeame apparent that 
r minor league Louisville team had run 
to financial difficulty and it was most 
eartwarming, refreshing and stimulat-
g to witness the eager and voluntary 
s pport of Kentuckians as they rallied 
ound the Louisville ball club by pur-
e awing enough stock to bail the team 
t. If Kentuckians would do this for a 
riple A" club I submit that they would 
verwhelmingly support Charles 0. Fin-
1 y's major league team. 
Yea, Mr. Speaker, I was just a kid in 
t e old Louisville Masonic Widows and 
rphans Home wl,en I first heard 
rownup's" talk about traveling to 
S eh cities as Cincinnati, Chicago, St. 
Ws, and others in order to see a major 
gue ball game. Mr. Speaker, this 
ractice has been .standard operating 
rocedure in Kentucky far too long. We 
eserve a major league ball club. We 
an, and I sincerely believe, we will be 
ble to support it. 
Our State, county, and city officials 
ave joined with all of us who have the 
onor to represent our Commonwealth 
the Nation's Capitol?irrespective of 
arty affiliation?in order to make this 
ransition of the Atiletics possible. Not 
SIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
only i Kentucky's officialdom united; 
but what's. more important, the vast 
majority cf Kentucky's over 3 million 
people are likewise behind this move. 
Mr. Speaker, no more than I had 
learnecl that our energetic Mayor Wil-
liam Ceavgar of Louisville and our fine 
young , KBntucky Governor, "Ned" 
Breathitt, had caused to be signed a con-
tract with that courageous Charles 0. 
Finley,, sol3 owner of the Athletics, in 
which the 3tate of Kentucky had agreed 
to spend over a half-million dollars in-
creasing tie seating capacity in the sta-
dium Of the Kentucky State Fair-
grounds from 20,000 to over 30,000 and 
had agreed on terms for the 1964-65 sea-
sons, *an I heard that the other base-
ball ch1bs .n the American League were 
opposed to this very legitimate contract 
that had been entered into by and be-
tween !the sovereign State of Kentucky 
and the complete owner of a very legiti-
mate business enterprise. 
Mr. Speaker, this situation brings rise 
to the veil practical question as to just 
who owns the Kansas City Athletics fran-
chise?the man who put his money on the 
line at the time he purchased it or these 
self-appointed and self-anointed repre-
sentatives of the various clubs of the 
Ame,ridan eague? 
Mr. Sps taker, when these interested 
parties possessing possibly several shares 
of stock in an incorporated club?these 
"glass docr fronts"?not a sole owner 
of a ball club?such as Finley?take on 
their hblie athan-thou, go-thither look?
their Chess-cat grin, their affidavit ex-
pressions, and their funeral mannerisms 
of "gloom doom, and tomb," we had 
better look out because, in my opinion, 
bad tremble lies ahead for every legiti-
mate busir ess in America. If these base-
ball clubs are allowed to dominate, con-
trol, pressure, and even intimidate a fel-
low alb cwner, a horrible precedent is 
being established contrary to the Con-
stitution and the laws of our land. This 
is, as I see it, legalized blackmail in that 
it absolutaly forces one?against ones 
will to do tv not to do?or to perform or 
not to perform an act that may be preju-
diced or datrimental to one's self or best 
interests. 
Mr. Spe aker, in a letter written to me 
by the Honorable Ford Frick, baseball's 
commiSsioner, dated May 21, 1958, he 
stated that he was opposed to the then 
Celler *bill. H.R. 10378, on the grounds 
that: 
It wotuld threaten baseball and other sports 
with eficilees litigation of every sports rule 
and agieerr ent. 
He went on to say that: 
AlthOugh baseball is opposed to the Celle,: 
bill it 4 str mgly in favor of legislation which 
will give fair treatment to all four organized 
team sgort by declaring a clean-cut exemp-
tion of the s sports practices from the anti-
trust laws. 
So, Mr. Speaker, baseball knows when 
It has r ge,od thing, and I do not believe 
that si e will make a move that will jeop-
ardize hex rather unique and cloistered 
position. 
Mr. Speaker, if the time ever comes?
God fcrbiet?in America that a bona fide, 
absolute, sole owner of any type or form 
of busnesa cannot sell, transfer, convey, 
January 13 
loan, hypothecate or in any other manner 
trade, barter or even give his interests 
away without a group threatening or 
coercing him, that is the day that there 
should be introduced before my com-
mittee, the Judiciary Committee of the 
House of Representatives, appropriate 
and remedial legislation, not only to in-
sure justice with respect toward property 
rights but an accompanying resolution 
that would seek to inquire into this whole 
blasted mess of baseball. 
If major league baseball is to enjoy its 
present immunity, its status of isolation-
ism, its inner sanctum, its holy of holies 
of preferential treatment; if baseball 
seeks to continue to be over, above and 
away from the worry pangs of antimo-
nopoly and its legal application, then her 
leaders, such as Mr. Joe Cronin, presi-
dent of the American League, and the 
Honorable Ford Frick, baseball high 
commissioner, should wake up, come 
down off of their cloud No. 14, get their 
feet on the ground, take a good, long 
breath of fresh air, get in the amen cor-
ner, adopt a new kind of baseball reli-
gion, acquire a new code of baseball rules 
and ethics or they are headed for a fall 
like mother's bread when her oven door 
slams. 
Mr. Speaker, when it became known 
that Finley had signed a contract with 
Kentucky to transfer his ball club there?
listen to this written order by Mr. Joe 
Cronin, American. League president, to 
Charles 0. Finley. Among other things, 
he said: 
I therefore, as president of the American 
League, direct you to refrain from any 
further arrangements and await the deter-
mination of the American League concerning 
the matter. 
This is a form of a threat. 
Mr. Speaker, boiled down to simple, 
plain, unadulterated, foothills of Ken-
tucky language, this is not a fight 
between the cities of Kansas City and 
Louisville. It is far more fundamental 
and basic than that. I agree with Shirley 
Povich, that great sportswriter for the 
Washington Post, when he said: 
Will a club owner be ousted from the 
league for the first time in history if he chal-
lenges the league's right to make him con-
form? 
And how would they make him con-
form? Naturally by pressure and other 
illegal means. 
Mr. Speaker, I can understand why an 
individual might be blackballed from his 
acceptance into a lodge, but I must con-
fess that I am at a loss to understand why 
a group of men representing other Ameri-
can League clulas are permitted to 
threaten, intimidate or in any other man-
ner, push, shove or force a bona fide, sole 
club owner, literally out of business when 
it is known that such action will produce

and does not mean, as the word might imply, 
that the Center will be an empty shell. 
But even though the Center will be com-
plete with seats and lights and chandeliers 
and drinking ? foUntains, it will still, in a 
sense, bean empty shell until it comes alive 
as a showplace Of American culture. 
This perhaps, will be the Trustees' most 
difficult task--one that has probably been 
complicated at least a little by the large Fed-
eral contribution that has now been prom-
Wed. 
Although it is planned that the Center 
Will be self-supporting and that there will be 
no need for annual Federal appropriations, it 
Would be naive not to assume that at least 
some Members of Congress would take 
lively interest in what goes on at the 
Kennedy Center. 
'PRESSURE FEARED 
, . 
Representative LINDSAY, Republican, of 
New York, raised this question briefly during 
House debate on the bill last week and asked 
' if the Center would not be subject to the 
same pressures as the cultural exchange pro-
'gram. 
Representative SCHWENGEL, Republican, of 
Iowa, said he looked forward to hearing the 
=mid of Meredith Willson played at the 
Center. Certainly, no member of the Cen-
ter's Trustees can look forward to explaining 
to any Member of Congress why he can't hear 
the music he likes or see the drama of his 
State at the Kenendy Center. 
As the Nation's first living Memorial to 
a President, the Kennedy Center undoubt-
edly will arouse questions of what is ap-
propriate in a Presidential memorial. The 
Bolshoi Ballet might well perform at a na-
tional cultural center, but someone is sure to 
ask if Russian Communists should perform 
in a center erected to the memory of an as-
sassinated President. 
Tomorrow the Center's Trustees will hold 
their annual organizational meeting at 2 
p.m. at 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., fol-
lowed by a meeting with the Center's Ad-
visory Board at the State Department. 
Mr. Stevens said he expected the meetings 
to be routine, but it was apparent that he 
and his colleagues had already begun to grap-
ple with the problems that lie in the next 
21/2 years of construction and- yond., ' 
The United Kingdom our closest ally, is 
betting not only the Castro will still be run-
ning Cuba 5 years from now but that the 
country will be fiscally sound with a Surplus 
to pay off debts. 
It is hard to imagine a more devastating 
critique of our policy In relation to COM-
raunist subversion next door. 
The blow is compounded by the fact that 
West Germany, France, Japan, and Spain 
competed with Britain for the privilege of 
bailing Castro out of his transportation 
morass. 
Our policy of toppling Cuban communism 
by economic containment is sunk without a 
trace. 
Willingness of the British to deal with the 
enemy of all democratic governments in the 
Americas?and tossing it off as routine?
should not be too surprising. England, as 
Ed Lahey put it in the Herald yesterday, has 
been known to rise above principle when a 
quick dollar was to be earned. 
We must admit also that our containment 
tactic was never firm and sure handed. It 
was full of leaks. We never really cracked 
down, as we said we would, on Allied ships 
bearing goods to Castro. 
If the economic blockade ever served a 
purpose, it is ineffective now. Castro has 
proven he can get what he wants from free 
nations while the Soviet Union pumps in 
arms. 
So what now? 
There are signs that President Johnson is 
moving to reassess the Cuban situation and 
strengthen the team to deal with it. The 
OAS has matters pending that could lead to 
an inter-American blockade, one that could 
be made to stick. 
The restless exiles might be unleashed to 
help fight for their country's redemption. 
The vast internal unrest in Cuba could be 
exploited rather than damped down. 
The British, in their business-as-usual 
ardor, may have done the free Americans a 
service by making the situation and the need 
for action clear. 
As we said long ago when the strengh of 
the Communist thrust became apparent, 
halfway measures will not do the job that 
inevitably must be done to return Cuba to 
the Cuban people. We might as well get 
to it. 
Mr. Speaker, the proper reemphasis 
a the problems caused by Cuba is fur-
ther seen in an editorial in the Thursday, 
January 9, edition of the Chicago Trib-
une, emphasizing the same problem of 
nations trading and maintaining the 
economy of Castro's Cuba. 
The inability to isolate and crush the 
Castro economy is dramatized by the 
Johnson administration's insistence to 
subLidize and aid the economy of the 
Soviet Union and other Communist coun-
tries. The self-defeating purpose of this 
foreign policy is clearer than ever. 
WHO'S ISOLATING WHOM? 
Fidel Castro has once again thumbed his 
nose at our economic blockade, this time with 
help from Britain. He has arranged to buy 
at least 400 British buses to replace American 
buses which have been disabled by the lack 
of spare parts. These buses will help Castro 
restore Havana's crippled transportation sys-
tem and thus mollify one of the more per-
sistent of his people's many complaints. 
This is the latest of a number of deals 
Castro has made with our allies which are 
thwarting our policy of trying to isolate 
Castro and thus bring about his downfall. 
Yet the State Department's only comment is 
that It is "unhappy." 
There is no ground for formal complaint, 
because Britain has never agreed to help us 
isolate Castro. In response to our many pleas 
COMMUNIST DOMINATIO 
"AMERICAN ROADBLOCK" 
(Mr. DERWINSKI (at the request of 
Mr. SHarvint) was granted permission to 
ektend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter,) 
Mr. DERVVINSKI. Mr. Speaker, the 
fanfare of the New Year and the Presi-
den't state of the Union message have 
not brushed away the cold facts of life?
that our foreign policy throughout the 
world, and especially in Latin America 
continues to deteriorate. 
We are somewhat diverted at the 
present time by the crisis in Panama but 
we must reali7e that the Communist 
domination of Cuba is the basic road-
block to peace and advancement in Latin 
America. 
The Miami Herald, in a very kindly 
editorial, discusses our Cuban foreign 
policy, which as I have emphasized, is at 
the root of our complications. 
OUR CUBAN POLICY GOES UNDER 
Angry as we May be over Britain's deal to 
sell Fidel Castro buses under favorable long-
term credits, the development has some so-
bering implications for our decisionmakers 
in Washington. 
273 
for help, Britain has merely promised to exert 
"vigilance" in preventing further kidnapings 
by Castro in the West Indies. 
Our other allies have been likewise un-
moved. Canada listened politely to our re-
quest for cooperation, and responded by sell-
ing a large supply of wheat to Castro. Spain 
expressed doubt that our blockade would be 
effective, and then proceeded to confirm its 
own doubts by buying $80 million worth of 
Cuban sugar in exchange for Spanish ma-
chinery and fruit. The French Government 
replied sanctimoniously that what French 
exporters arranged with Cuba was none of its 
business. 
Foreign trade with Cuba has, in fact, pro-
vided employment for the nearly 200 foreign 
ships?most of them British, Greek, or Leb-
anese?which have been caught trafficking 
with Cuba and have been banned, under the 
decree of President Kennedy, from carrying 
cargoes financed by the U.S. Government. 
Thus the uselessness of our present pol-
icy has been compounded. 
We have added to the inconsistency of our 
position by agreeing to sell American wheat 
to Russia and thus conceding, in effect, that 
there is no point in penalizing American 
farmers and exporters by restrictions which 
nobody else recognizes. 
We don't know how Castro is going to pay 
for the British buses, but there is little the 
State Department could say even if it should 
turn out that Britain is giving him credit. 
After all, the administration has insisted 
that we give credit to Russia for the purchase 
of wheat. 
There is no rhyme or reason in a policy 
which must necessarily depend on the co-
operation Of allies whom we obviously can't 
control. If we cannot isolate Cuba ourselves, 
there is no point in trying. 
Let us hope that the light of reason 
will dawn upon the White House and the 
State Department, and an immediate 
reversal of our tragic foreign policy will 
be promulgated. 
PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO COR-
RECT INEQUITIES IN OUR MONE-
TARY AND FISCAL POLICIES 
The SPEAKER. Under previous order 
of the House, the gentleman from Texas 
[Mr. PATMAN] is recognized for 60 min-
utes. 
(Mr. PATMAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks and to include extraneous mat-

Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, there is 
nothing more important in the business 
of legislation than to make certain that 
inequities in our monetary and fiscal 
policies be eliminated. Special favors for 
the fortuitous few?for the financially 
powerful?at the expense of the many, 
make for trouble whether in Latin 
America or in the 'United States of 
America. 
I wish to call to the attention of the 
Congress an iniquitous absurdity in re-
gard to the special treatment we afford a 
large section of our banking institu-
tions. We are indebted to the Domestic 
Finance Subcommittee of the Banking 
and Currency Committee for compiling 
and releasing for your consideration and 
that of the general public a volume en-
titled "Banks Holding Treasury Tax and 
Loan Account Balances as of October 15,

ntains a list prepared at my request by 
Federal Reserve of the private com-
ercial banks-11,71)0 of them?which 
re this very minute receiving a subsidy 
t? in my opinion ;Ives the lie to the 
d saw that you cant get something for 
othi ag. 
The banking system of the United 
tates of America at this time is strong 
d powerful. Banks from one end of 
e country to the other are highly 
*Wit able. They can afford to pay their 
ay. Any subsidy to them is wasteful. 
subsidy to them is paid for by the 
erican taxpayer. 
It is indeed ironic that one gentleman 
I know who has gone around the country 
d rying subsidies is the president of a 
nk in Wilmington, Del., which re-
Ives in effect a Government subsidy 
at least $400,001) annually. This 
oney accrues to the bank since it had 
o de:posit as of October 15, 1963, more 
t an 88 million of Federal money, a fig-
that was exceeded during most of the 
ar. As a matter of fact, in early ?o-
ber the bank had over $17 million of 
demi money on e:eposit. His bank 
ys Uncle Sam not 1 cent for this 
ney, but it is loaned out to the citi-
ns of Wilmington and the State of 
D 'law are at the going interest rate for 
c ramercia,1 banks. 
You know that I an. talking about Ed 
N ilan, president of the Bank of Dela-
w re. He is in the tradition of the old 
s 0 who was lecturing on the virtues 
o honesty with the stolen goose up his 
eve. His great crusade against you, 
Representatives of the people?
a ainit several hundred local chambers 
of commerce, paxt of a national organi-
ze, ion hepurports to head; against busi-
n amen in general; against any pro-
gr ive Measures for the betterment of 
o country, such at ARA; and yes, 
ag nst subsidies?alas, this crusade is 
j t as phony as I sale it was before you 
ge tlernen some time ago. And how do 
I now? Has Ed Neilan cried out against 
th subsidy to his bank, accruing from 
th more than $8 million of Uncle Sam's 
m ney on deposit for which he pays not 
1 enry of interest? Has Ed Neilan 
co e to the support of the extremely 
as ute and capable Joseph Campbell, 
C ptroller General of the United 
St Vas .who, according to the Wall Street 
Jo al on December 31, 1963, urged 
th t bunks be charged for the use of 
F eral deposits? The General Account-
in Office, a Federal "watchdog" agency, 
su gests that Congress require large 
ba ks to pay for the use of Government 
f ds kept on deposit with them. 
here, oh where, has the scrooge of 
WI rnington been in fa ling to decry the 
gr t giveaway to American banks in the 
fo of billions of Federal funds on de-
post free for nothing? Mr. Neilan wants 
no ederal subsidies going to depressed 
are for projects that will put men back 
to or. No, he says area redevelopment 
is b d for the country, it is destructive of 
pri ate initiative, it just saps the soul 
of free nation. But a subsidy to the 
Bark of Delaware that eosts not a Penny 
to Ed Nellan nor to his iirectors, includ-
ing a few Dupont stooges, he says that 
Is a it should be. Acco.rding to Mr. Nei-
Ian, the bank renders services Which 
would cogt the Government a lot of 
money, and today the bank does this out 
of the goodness of its heart. 
Incident ally, I do not want the Bank of 
Delaware or any other bank rendering 
any service to the Government of the 
United, States without being adequately 
paid for that service. Most emphatically 
I favor a .;ervice charge for any service 
rendered to the Government by the 
banks. Iv 'ant to see a fair ratio between 
a reasenable profit made by banks on 
Government deposits and actual work 
done fer tie Government by the banks. 
I do not vet ,nt a bankers' bonanza as now 
exists. 
But how to return to the subcommit-
tee report I mentioned a moment ago 
regarding banks holding Treasury tax 
and loan a3count balances. What do we 
mean by a tax and loan account? This 
is simp,1y U.S. Government money that 
sits in private commercial banks. The 
banks ar/L interest on it but not the 
Treasury o:' the United States. The total 
amount of such money in private banks 
as of mid-October was $4,040 million. 
Now hew did it get there? Several 
ways. Fir3t, when a bank buys Gov-
ernment ecurities, whether for its 
customers or its own account, the Treas-
ury may permit the bank to pay for the 
securities without turning the money 
into the Treasury or the Federal Reserve. 
Instead; th e bank opens an account in 
the name of the U.S. Treasury and puts 
the motley into that. In this manner 
the bank gets to keep the money which 
is earmarked for the Government, and 
waits for tre Treasury to call it into the 
Federal Re erve. In the meantime, the 
bank gets interest on the securities 
which it d d not pay for, but got by 
creating the deposit that bears no inter-
est. These same securities could have 
been sold to the Federal Reserve and it 
would not lave cost the people interest. 
A second source of funds in the tax 
and loan account is income taxpay-
ments?not the big, single payment you 
make at the end of the year that goes 
straight into the Treasury--but with-
holding income taxes from payrolls and 
large quarte rly payments made by cor-
porations. This gives rise to probably 
the most luc icrous situation in the whole 
relation4aip between banks and the 
Treasury. :Iere the Treasury deposits 
tax colleetio IS in commercial banks and 
the Governnent receives nothing for 
them. This same money can be used by 
the banks to purchase Government secu-
rities on which the Treasury pays inter-
est. 1)V10 benefits from this nonsensical 
situation? Only the commercial banks. 
Who pays the bill? The poor taxpayer. 
Other scan ces of tax and loan account 
funds inelude railroad retirement taxes, 
payroll Wee from the old age insurance 
program, aril certain excise taxes. All 
of this money is available for the unre-
stricted use of the banks until it is later 
called into tae Federal Reserve system. 
It all earns interest, but not a penny of 
interest goes back to the Government. 
The Federal money on deposit is not a 
convenience to the Treasury. The Treas-
ury does not, draw cheeks on it. The 
Treasury, I repeat, cannot use it until 
January .13 
it is called into the Federal Reserve 
banks. 
Whenever the Treasury balance of 
working cash, which is kept in the Fed-
eral Reserve banks, gets too low, then 
they call in tax and loan money, but 
since it is always coming into the banks 
as fast as it is goi:ng out to the Treasury, 
even faster, the banks know that they 
have a juicy subs:dy in the form of free 
money from Uncle Sam. That is, depos-
its which cost them nothing, but which 
can be loaned to the public. 
During the fiscal year 1963, there was 
never any less than $2 billion sitting 
there. Sometimes, on the other hand, 
there has been over $10 billion, and the 
average for fiscal year 1963 was $5.3 bil-
lion. The interest for 1 year an $5.3 bil-
lion at 5 percent is $267 million. Do I 
hear Mr. Ed Neilan screaming about the 
$267 million annual subsidy to himself 
and his friends? Will someone who 
listens to his next "never-never" speech 
on the wickedness of subsidies be good 
enough to ask him why he has not been 
opposed to the big bankers bonus? 
Now there are 13,500 commercial 
banks in America, end 11,700 of these are 
official depositaries for tax and loan 
account funds. The average amount of 
Government money on deposit with each 
bank is something over $345,000, and the 
average annual interest on this amount 
at 5 percent is about $23,000. Some 
banks have much more than the aver-
age. The Bank of Delaware holds over 
$8 million in Federal money, which is 
23 times the average, and the more than 
$400,000 a year interest this bank earns 
on this money is 23 times the average. 
Eight banks in New York City?Chase 
Manhattan, First National City, Chemi-
cal Bank, Morgan Bank, Manufacturers 
Hanover, Bankers Trust, Irving Trust, 
and Marine Midland?have over $800 
million combined, or more than 20 per-
cent. That is, 8 banks out of 11,700 that 
have one-fifth of all the money in the 
tax and loan account. 
In the main, I have discussed but one 
key subsidy that the Government pre-
sents commercial banks. There are sev-
eral ,others besides the tax and loan 
account. 
Now let us consider for a moment an-
other special treatment afforded our 
commercial banks. It is a simple fact 
that banks are not permitted to pay in-
terest on demand deposits. Now every-
body else pays interest on their deposits, 
savings and loan, and even insurance 
companies, but not the commercial 
banks. These demand deposits are raw 
materials, just like pig iron, that rep-
resent $150 billion on which banks are 
earning interest which they are not pay-
ing to the depositors. Checking ac-
counts are demand deposits. It is lawful 
for a bank to lend money to the holder of 
a checking account and, of course, 
charge him interest. But the banker 
would be violating the law if he were to 
pay interest on this checking account 
money which he in turn loans out, Some 
time or other this inequitable arrange-
ment will be changed. 
Then there are many free services pro-
vided to private banks by the Federal 
Reserve at an annual cost to the Ameri-

s?ne differences Of opinion which I have 
th the Senator from Arizona [Mr. 
GoLinvAixit] Ovef Certain foreign policy 
issues .abOtif which he has expressed 
views in recent days. - - 
I have Se* a coPY of-my remarks to

telling him that I *ciuld be happy to 
have him caw to the floor of the Senate

natUrediy told nie that it would not be

WOUld express himself on the floor of

about to leave his office to make a dona-

not going to deplete him of his blood 
autiply and that II was -Merely going to 
express sonie respectful disagreement 
With his point of view. I would discuss 
in3r disagreement With the Senator from 
Arizima, On foreign peaky under the

Affairs of. the Coriunittee on Foreign 
Relations t, would remain silent when 
EtnyOne titthe fifipliftanCe arid the stand-
ing of the 'junior Senator from Arizona 
expressed views on the Cuban situation so 
diametrically opposed to my own. 
On_ the . basis of his recent campaign 
state11141its'.,inlqe*HairiPshire, the junior 
Senator from AriZoila appears to be off-
ering hlmaelf as' a '15-residential candidate 
who will lead the United States into in-
ternational banditrY. That is the best 
that can be Said for his statement that 
if he were President, he would support 
and promote the e'fforts of Cuban ref-
ugees to invade Cuba and Overthrow the 
Castro diotatorghip. "I would help 
them,' said the Se.riator, "I would train 
them, surifly- them' get them there." In 
addition, he would be "inclined" to pro-
vide "air cover to any refugee invasion 
attempt. 
? - 
The Senator's proposal for Cuba is ap-
parently n'art of his grand design for 
dismantlyik, 
the foreign policy powers 
of the'dOveriiinerif of The-United States. 
As the fVfebabers"df this body have been

ator'figniArizonals deeply dedicated to

ast7078-modirsdi-ris a grate and 
itime -W,Ilireart"6 The United States 
arid that7eVery "Ey Of its survival is a 
day of mortal peril for the United States. 
Because 'the Senator is known to held hope to accbtnplish in the decentraliza-
tion of our foreign policy? 
There is another aspect of the Sena-
tor's views on Cuba that give me some 
concern. That is that what he proposes 
is clearly illegal, a clear and direct vio-
lation of our obligations under the 
Charter of the Organization of American 
States. I commend to the Senator arti-
cle 15 of the OAS charter, which clearly 
prohibits the kind of U.S.-sponsored ref-
ugee action that he advocates. Article 15 
reads as follows: 
No state or group of states has the right 
to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any 
reason whatever, in the internal or external 
affair's of any other State. The foregoing 
principle prohibits not only armed forces but 
also any other form of interference or at-
tempted threat against the personality of 
the State or against its political, economic 
and cultural elements. 
There are those who regard treaties 
and other instruments of law as mean-
ingless pedantries, suitable areas of con-
em for vague and sentimental law pro-
fessors but hardly a fit basis for the hard 
decisions of international power politics. 
I, for one, believe that the United States 
can play fast and loose with its interna-
tional legal commitments only at grave 
peril to its own vital interests. Interna-
tional legal commitments have the same 
meaning for the shapers of foreign policy 
as contracts have for businessmen. 
There is nothing sentimental or particu-
larly idealistic about them. They pro-
vide a basis for predicting the actions of 
others, for being able to judge who is with 
you and who is against you, whom you 
can count on and whom you cannot' count 
on. As long as international legal in-
struments are honored, the parties to 
them have in effect increased their own 
power because they can add to their own 
resources those promised to them by the 
international agreements. To disregard 
international legal obligations is to un-
dermine this addition to national power, 
to destroy the basis for predicting the be-
havior of others, and to destroy the con-
fidence of other nations in our own 
promises and commitments. 
I am sure that these observations 
about law, as they pertain to Cuba, will 
be of interest to the Senator from Ari-
zona. They will interest him because he 
is a conservative, and if there is anything 
that is vital to the ideology of conserva-
tism it is the fundamental importance 
and inviolability of law. The Senator has 
spoken frequently and wisely about the 
sanctity of law. I am confident, there-
fore, that he can be expected to recon-
sider his views on sponsoring a refugee 
invasion of Cuba with a view toward try-
ing to reconcile these views with his well-
known dedication to the rule of law as a 
guiding principle for both the internal 
life of our country and its foreign rela-
tions. 
If the Senator from Arizona has been 
somewhat inconsistent in his views on 
law in international relations, he has 
been absolutely constant in his advocacy 
of the principle of decentralization of 
Government functions. 
The Senator declared that under cer-
tain circumstances he would withdraw 
recognition from the Soviet Union, but 
only with the consent of the Senate. 
these views, it is difficult to understand 
Why he does not favor direct action by 
the U.S. Armed Forces rather than a 
proxy invasion by a small army of badly 
armed, badly trained, and badly orga-
nized Cuban refugees. 
Furthermore, speaking hypothetically, 
has he given consideration to the kind 
government that would be established 
n Cuba if all the Cuban refugees in the 
United States could simply be implanted 
In Cuba and authorized to establish a 
government? I think we would be very 
much surprised to find how closely such 
a government would resemble the Batista 
government. As I have previously said 
in the Senate, a considerable percentage 
of the Cuban refugees in the United 
States are Batista-ites and would 
not set Up, if given the authority 
to do so, a constitutional, demo-
cratic form of government. Large 
numbers of them are more interested 
in regaining their corporeal and material 
holdings in Cuba, to carry on the bad 
economic policies that characterized the 
Batista regime. I have the right to 
speak thusly, because I was the first in 
this body to speak out against the Castro 
regime. I did so almost when it took 
over, starting with its blood baths and 
Castro's placing under house arrest the 
first President under the Castro regime, 
that great Cuban judge, Irrutia, because 
Irrutia would not be a party to the totali-
tarian procedures that Castro inflicted 
upon the Cuban people. I said then, 
and repeat now, that all we were pre-
sented with in that change of adminis-
tration was the substitution for a Fascist 
tyrant of a tyrant who followed the 
Commie line. 
To consider Fidel Castro a grave 
enough threat to the United States to 
turn America into an outlaw nation is 
to credit him with vastly greater power 
and vastly greater leadership talents 
than in fact he possesses. If, however, 
he posed a grave and mortal threat to 
the United States, he should be dealt 
with by direct action by the Armed 
Forces of the United States under the 
command of the President. 
In October of 1962, President Kennedy 
made clear that our Government can be 
counted upon to take care of any aggres-
sive course of action that either Castro 
or Khrushchev acting through Cuba 
may threaten. 
One is forced to the conclusion that 
although the Senator from Arizona feels 
gravely threatened by the Communist 
regime in Cuba, he is so anxious to de-
centralize the powers of the U.S. Gov-
ernment that he would turn over the 
shaping of our Cuban policy to a group 
Of Cuban exiles and reduce the U.S. Gov-
ernment to the role of adviser and assist-
ant to them in their efforts. This would 
indeed be a major step forward toward 
the decentralization of the foreign policy 
powers of the U.S. Government. The 
control of American policy over an issue 
which, as we saw in October of 1962, in-
volves the threat of nuclear war would 
be taken out of the hands of our Presi-
dent and placed in the hands of a group 
of private individuals?and foreign indi-
viduals at that, not even citizens of the 
United States. What more could we

e Senate does not, under our Consti-
t tion, play any official role whatever in 
t e recognition of governments or in 
ithdrawing recognition. The Senator 
patently would like to give the Senate 
t at power, thereby depriving the Presi-
d nt ,of one o..1 his basic foreign policy 
Weis under the Constitution. 
Secondly, the Senator has suggested 
t at the authority to use tactical nuclear 
eaporis should be 1 ested in the corn-
ander of the NATO forces without be-
i g subject to any direction or control 
b the President of the United States, 
o, under our Const tution, is the Corn-
ander in Chief of our Armed Forces. 
It appears that the Senator, in his zeal 
fir the decentralization of control of our 
f rejgn policy, is prepared to relieve the 
esident of many or most of his powers 
a Commander in Chief of the Armed 
Forces. 
On Issues ranging from the Tennessee 
ley Authority to an invasion of Cuba, 
e Senator has been unshakeable in his 
dication to the principle that all pos-
le powers should be removed from the 
nds of the Govern' lent of the United 
ates and placed in the hands of private 
victuals and groups?either foreign 
domestic, the important point being 
t under no circumstances should they 
subject to the control or direction of 
U.S. Government. , 
inston Churchill once said that he 
not become His M aJesty's First Mi-
^ to preside over the liquidation of 
British Empire. Should the junior 
'tor from Arizona be elected Presi-
t of the United Sta ;es, it appears that 
will dedicate himself to a quite oppo-

proclaimed by Churchill. The Sen-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Mr. OORSE. Mr. President, recently 
Mr. 0., K. Scott, of Prineville, Oreg., 
brought to my attention copies of certain 
letters on subjects of interest. I ask 
unanirdous consent that they be printed 
in the IkECORD. 
There b ing no objection, the letters 
were okcler ad to be printed in the REC-
oRD, as f011OWS: 
NOVEMBER 6, 1963. 
DEAR EDTIOR: I would like to make one 
more desperate appeal to the dormant pa-
triotism of our local citizens. Senator MORSE 
has at last admitted that the suggestion to 
utilize spme TV time for public education is 
a good idea, but without good public sup-
port froM home it is hardly fair to expect 
any one mall? official to risk his scalp on a 
proposition is bold as this. !('his is some-
thing that deserves the initiative of the vot-
ers. 
The ptmicus series of letters to the editor, 
has had. a noticeable effect on many local 
citizens, and not a single word of condemna-
tion from any of the many who have been 
sounded out throughout the Nation. Many 
have commented favorably, none too en-
thusiastic, quite a few were silent, but none 
ventured, to lay truth is not important. 
I expected .nore letters from voters to their 
representatives from this locality, most of 
the ones I hi.ve talked to just sort of pass it 
off as beihg t 3o lazy in a joking way, but this 
is no joke. I think your column one ar-
rangement will be much more effective be-
cause only a minority look at the editorial 
page. 
enclme the letter from Senator MORSE 
for your Inspection. Will you please hold it 
for me? I will call for it later. I also in-
clude my reply to the Senator. 
As far es I um concerned, the Oregon dele-
gation to Washington is as good as we can 
ever hope to get and I hope we can keep 
them on_the Job, they will respond to the 
will of the people back home if these people 
will only let them know what is in their 
minds. cannot help but think that the 
right to see, hear, and learn to know and 
understand the truth, ranks high in the 
mind of every true patriot, but they are still 
under the sp311 of McCarthy demagoguery. 
But truth is caangeles,s and indestructible, it 
can neither be diluted nor dissolved, not even 
in a fullicnsterree y, 
strength solution of GOLDWATER. 
s 
O. K. Scow. 
To the EDiTOR 
Truth i ti.e supreme authority in our 
universe. Without it, Man is but little bet-
ter than a devil, and his world can never 
get much hettar than a hell. General Sher-
man was ,absolutely right. "War is hell," 
hot or cold. 3ut with the truth, man can 
become m4ster of his environment, and build 
a civilization resembling heaven, limited 
only by the honest application of his knowl-
edge and his willingness to work. The 
human energy and material wealth that has 
been wasted 01 wax just since I have been 
here on erth, has been many times more

than enough to have eliminated all the 
poverty and its twin, ignorance, from the 
world, but these twin curses still hold the 
world in thrall. 
Every war that man has become involved 
in, is a harvest from seeds of dishonesty, 
planted and cultivated by dishonest man. 
Nothing has ever been settled by any war, 
that could not have been settled a thousand 
times better, by truth and honesty. In fact, 
the only thing ever settled by war is the 
certainty of a bigger and more terrible dis-
honest war to follow. 
The cause of this disease, "wax," is the 
virus of dishonesty. The only cure is truth. 
The political palliatives, and what the labor 
unions are doing, and have been doing, are 
just as silly and ineffective, as if the medical 
scientists had confined their attack on polio, 
to the application of band aids and ice water 
massages. There are plenty of good honest, 
intelligent people in this land, who know 
and understand the truth, and have what 
it takes to convey that truth and under-
standing to the minds of all potentially 
honest citizens, which includes at least 80 
percent of the total, but this insignificent 
minority of wantonly dishonest, has insidi-
ously build up a power sufficiently strong 
enough to conceal the truth from the over-
whelming majority, by the simple expedient 
of pricing them out of the market, in spite 
of our constitutionally guaranteed freedom 
of speech and press. 
Just because one of these lunatics, suc-
cessfully caused a lot of other lunatics to 
believe that a lie, repeated often and well, 
was just as good as the truth, the whole 
world became involved in the most stupid 
ogre of death and destruction of all, and 
the only thing we got out of It was the 
plague of atomic stalemate, with its poten-
tial destructivenes now in excess of a car-
load of TNT for each human being on earth: 
With one hour of TV time each week, made 
available for truth, the curse of dishonesty 
could be arrested to the point where truth 
could at last become effective from a great 
many more honest patriots than it ever has 
had. Is four letters each, from each honest 
patriot too much of an effort? Must we 
devote all of this marvelous medium of 
public education to "break down sales re-
sistance" and programs that undermine the 
character of our young ones? There is no 
substitute, just as good, or anywhere near 
as good as truth. It is your business and 
deserves your attention. None will ever es-
cape the consequences of the neglect that 
will inevitably lead to some lunatic trying 
to prove that he can win with atom bombs. 
Sincerely, 
0. K. SCOTT. 
NOVEMBER 13, 1963. 
To the EDITOR: 
Truth is the keystone for the arch of 
liberty, that has been slowly and laboriously 
constructed by the efforts of honest intellect 
for centuries, this arch spans the bottomless 
chasm of greed, graft, and corruption, that 
has successfully defied orderly progress along 
the road of liberty toward that distant goal 
of freedom, that has inspired the best efforts 
and hopes of honest, intelligent, thinking 
people. 
The keystone is not yet in place, but it has 
been carefully measured and cut to fit. 
Without this keystone, the structure can 
never hold the weight of the traffic that must 
pass over it. It is an exceedingly bulky item, 
of such a nature that no possible kind of 
machine can ever put it in place. The only 
way it can be done is by the honest, intelli-
gent cooperative efforts of many citizens. 
The task is simple and the labor light. The 
more hands that willingly volunteer, the 
easier the task, and there is no such thing 
as not enough room for all, who care to help.

2644 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE 
During the presidential campaigns and 
throughout his subsequent service in the 
realm of international affairs, Mr. 
Stevenson has added a new dimension to 
the Illinois State motto?that of an ac-
tive commitment to the cause of a free 
world at peace. His fellow citizens in 
Illinois are proud of his devotion and 
tireless work in behalf of a better Ameri-
ca in a world at peace. 
Adlai E. Stevenson is the fourth out of 
five generations to serve the people of 
his State and of the Nation. Even now, 
his eldest son and namesake, Adlai E. 
Stevenson III, is embarked upon a new 
role as a member of the House of Rep-
resentatives of the State of Illinois. He 
is following the example of his illus-
trious father, and a more outstanding 
example he and others would be hard 
put to find. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a priv-
ilege to speak publicly, on this my first 
statement in the House, of the unselfish 
concern for and outstanding participa-
tion in public and world service by the 
'Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois 
during the greater part of his 65 years 
among us. 
He, more than many of us, has always 
been aware that all of us have to be con-
cerned about the future because we are 
going to spend the rest of our lives there. 
As he enters his 66th y ar, he continues 
to look a.head to andAvork for a better 
futu.re for 1. 
LEGISLATION TRODUCED TO 
HALT CLS. ALLIES SHIPPING TO 
CUBA 
(Mr. ROGERS of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I am introducing legislation today to 
curb the traffic of U.S. Allies shipping to 
Cuba. 
Not only have our allies been sending 
their ships to Castro's island, but ships 
from Britain, Greece, Lebanon, Norway, 
and the Netherlands have been supplying 
communist North Vietnam. 
As a member of the House Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries Committee, I have 
long been concerned with the situation 
whereby U.S. articles are transported 
aboard vessels sailing under flags par-
ticipating in trade with communist coun-
tries. There is considerable support for 
putting a stop to this situation, and it 
may be found not only here in the Con-
gress but in the shipping industry and 
the American public as well. 
So outrageous is this practice that even 
foreign corners echo discontent over 
ships from nations friendly to the West 
carrying goods to Communist govern-
ments. Just Saturday the Venezuelan 
longshoremen saw their proposal for a 
labor boycott of Cuban trading vessels 
adopted by a committee of the Inter-
American Regional Labor Organization 
meeting in Mexico City. American dele-
gates from the AFL-CIO urged even 
stronger steps. 
Unfortunately a *large portion of this 
shipping is carried on under the British 
flag. According to information which I 
have received, some British ships may 
even sail direct from Red China to Cuba 
and North Vietnam. 
The world has just witnessed the pass-
ing of a great British statesman, Sir 
Winston Churchill. Although it was 
Churchill who first warned of the dan-
gers of world communism, the England 
he governed now aids the Reds. The 
British merchant marine, once under 
Churchill when he served as First Lord 
of the Admiralty, now serves the Com-
munists by transporting their profitable 
cargos. 
Recall Churchill's pleas for the United 
States to aid Britain in the early days of 
World War II. By contrast, today's U.S. 
requests for an end to British shipping 
to Communist Cuba have thus far gone 
unnoticed. 
In 1941, when Britain was enlisting 
U.S. help, Churchill said: 
The action of the United States will be 
dictated not by the methodical calculations 
of profit and loss, but by moral sentiment. 
The Congress must act now to incite 
the moral sentiments of Britain and 
other allies whose ships aid commu-
nism. Enactment of the legislation I 
have introduced today will serve that 
purpose. 
PRESIDENT'S FARM MESSAGE IG-
NORES CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL 
NEED 
(Mr. TEAGUE of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. TEAGUE of California. Mr. 
Speaker, California, the Nation's leading 
agricultural State, and the critical need 
of its farmers for workers, were totally 
ignored by the President in his farm mes-
sage to Congress. 
When the law permitting Mexican 
farm workers to enter this country was 
allowed to expire, at the instigation of 
the administration, California farmers 
were immediately confronted with a 
shortage of harvest laborers.( To make 
matters worse, the Secretary of Labor 
then issued an order setting discrimina-
tory wage rates that place California 
farmers at a serious competitive disad-
vantage. Rates in other States have been 
fixed at substantially lower figures. Cali-
fornia agriculture today is in the most 
critical stage of its history, yet it is being 
totally ignored by the President. 
All the emphasis of the message was 
placed on help for the growers of sub-
sidized crops, such as wheat arid feed 
grain, cotton, tobacco, rice and wool. 
Most of our California crops are with-
out subsidy, although we grow 43 percent 
of the Nation's vegetables and 42 per-
cent of the fruit and nuts?all of which 
are not subsidized. The President sug-
gests nothing to assure that this prod-
uce, vital to the entire country, will 
be harvested. 
Agriculture is California's leading in-
dustry, by dollar volume of production. 
It would seem to me that any threat to 
its health ought to be a matter of special 
concern to the President. However, we 
do not seem to have any friends in this 
administration, since we are being over-
February 8 
looked by the President and harassed 
by the Secretary of Labor. 
HORTON RESOLUTION CONDEMNS 
SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM 
(Mr. HORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have 
introduced today a concurrent resolu-
tion to condemn the Soviet Union for its 
persecution of Jewish citizens. 
The wave of anti-Semitism in the So-
viet Union is wicked evidence of the god-
less nature of communism and should be 
exposed before the world. 
Soviet efforts to crush the spirit of 
Russian Jews are sickening to Ameri-
cans. We deeply believe in freedom of 
religion for all people. 
Our national and natural opposition 
to any infringement of religious freedom 
summons us to denounce the Commu-
nists' campaign which is bent on de-
struction of traditional Jewish values 
and institutions. 
We have abundant evidence that the 
Government of the Soviet Union is per-
secuting Jewish citizens. It is singling 
them out for extreme punishment of 
alleged economic offenses, synagogues 
are being confiscated, Jewish cemeteries 
are being closed, rabbis and lay leaders 
are being arrested, religious activities 
are being curtailed, educational and cul-
tural opportunities are being denied 
Russian Jews, and restrictions are being 
imposed that prevent the reuniting of 
Jewish families. 
The powers of the Soviet state are be-
ing ruthlessly and inhumanly directed 
against Jewish citizens. Jews suffer 
persecution in Russian universities, in 
Russian publications, and in Russian 
courtrooms. 
This shocking condition demonstrates 
the base treachery of communism and 
should be so noted before the world, 
especially in the face of Soviet claims of 
equality. 
The U.S. Congress has before it the 
opportunity to endorse and encourage 
the protests of millions of our fellow 
citizens. Let us, then, affirm their ap-
peal to Soviet authorities that in -the 
name of decency and humanity religious 
freedom be restored to the Jews of 
Russia.

THE CLoSEgG OF THE VA HOSPITAL 
AT GRAND JUNCTION, COLO. 
(Mr. Mor C10ER asked and was given 
permissidn to address the House for 1 
minute arid k) revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MCVIMER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to state that 
I am whOleheartedly in favor of the pro-
visions that were placed in this bill by 
the Senate. I am wholeheartedly behind 
the amendrn ents to the 1965 agriculture 
appropriations supplemental bill, which 
would proh: bit the closing of certain 
Veteran' Administration facilities and 
agricultnre I esearch stations. 
The cilosi ag of the VA hospital at 
Grand Yunction, Colo., presents a prob-
lem pecnliar to the West. To those vet-
erans and their families on the western 
slope of the Rockies it would mean a 
great harlship to travel hundreds of 
miles to the nearest VA hospital. It will 
not savd money; it will only cheapen 
services., Da we not owe a great debt 
to these dtabled veterans in bringing 
the best pos3ib1e hospital facilities at the 
greatest possible convenience? The 
gentlemsn f :om Colorado, the Honorable 
WAYNE ASP] NALL, in whose district this 
Grand Junction hospital is located, has 
given his fill- support to retaining this 
hospital: and I wish to associate myself 
with hint. 
While: the Cheyenne Horticultural 
Field Station at Cheyenne, Wyo., is not 
in Colorado. it is a regional station serv-
ing my :constituents. If the Cheyenne 
Horticultural Field Station is closed as 
planned there will be no institution left 
in the vviholo Great Plains-Rocky Moun-
tain region doing any significant re-
search on those plants needed for Presi-
dent 4ohr son's "green legacy for 
tomorroW." Certainly no other part of 
the United States has greater need for 
horticulturid reseach, because ours is 
the last: great area of the country to be 
settled 4ncl ecause our conditions are so 
different from those of the older East, 
Midwest, and Far West that their horti-
cultural plants and practices cannot be 
employed here. 
I feel that it would be a great blunder 
to discontinue the research now under-
way at Cheyenne. 
AMBASSADOR ADLAI E. STEVENSON 
(Mr. SCHISLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCHISLER. Mr. Speaker, while 
we were adjourned Friday last, there oc-
curred in the life of one of my fellow Il-
linoisans one of those milestones we each 
and every one note with the passing of 
the calendar years. This gentleman 
from Illinois has seen 65 years come and 
go, and he has not stood idly by while 
these birthdays came and went. As we 
know from the events of recent days, he 
worked Friday last on the occasion of his 
65th birthday, as indeed he has for many 
birthdays in the past, and we hope, as 
he shall for many in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, this statesman?for 
statesman, he is?has, in fact, been one 
of those active paticipants in history 
without which our lives would be less 
meaningful and our history less pur-
poseful. 
It is appropriate, therefore, that we 
say not only "happy birthday" to Am-
bassador Acllai E. Stevenson, but also 
express appreciation for his years and 
decades of unselfish public service to his 
fellow countrymen, not to mention his 
fellow citizens of the world. He comes, 
Mr. Speaker, from a State whose motto 
Is "State Sovereignty, National Union." 
As one of the outstanding Governors of 
Illinois, he was always faithful and true 
to this admonition. As a candidate for 
the highest civil office in our land, he 
demonstrated in his speeches and writ-
ings a profound understanding of the 
deep philosophical roots of our demo-
cratic system and an acute awareness of 
the practical operations of its diverse 
parts. I might add a personal note that 
his speeches and writings first sparked 
my own interest in public service.

As '1 Understand it now, if you take away 
the base there would be a recession, because 
you don't have the industries or other back-
up work for people that work outside the 
base. 
If you take away the base, then the re-
lated work which the payroll of this base 
keeps going will also disappear. Certainly 
you will have a depression, not a recession. 
In my statement, Senator. I said how can 
our. Goverment create an unemployment in 
an already depressed area, only then to ask 
Congress for funds to raise employment in 
the same area? This is an inconsistency 
which must be repugnant to all. 
As national president of the American 
Federation of Government Employees, I have 
been informed of the Department of De-
fense's plans to close certain defense agen-
cies. There was no consultation with this-
union or to my knowledge with any union 
prior to the announcement that the Olmsted 
employees would be affected by the base 
closures. 
The Secretary has assured the civilian em-
ployees that every effort will be made to find 
new positions, both within the Government 
and private industry. I have no quarrel with 
this statement, but as you gentlemen from 
Pennsylvania know, people do not just pick 
up roots and move without hardship. The 
employees from Olmsted must move unless 
the Department of Defense is able to relocate 
other defense activities at Olmsted Air Force 
Base which would utilize the skills of these 
employees. I say that they must move be-
cause the labor market area cannot absorb 
these people. Some of the other gentlemen 
here today from the State of Pennsylvania 
will undoubtedly give you more details con-
cerning the impact that this action will have 
on the Middletown area. The Department 
has given public assurances that every effort 
will be made to retrain employees. To date 
our union has not been consulted on this 
vital problem. 
We must not forget that Middletown af-
fects the northern Appalachian area and this 
region is receiving considerable attention by 
the administration and hopefully the U.S. 
Congress will act to relieve po erty in this 
area. 
'Soviets Take Over Cuban OcJitn Studies 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
HON. BOB WILSON 
OF CALIFORN/A 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 26, 1965 
Mr. BOB WILSON. Mr, Speaker, 
wish to call my colleagues' attention to 
the shocking story which appeared in 
Hydrogram Intelligence Briefings on Oc-
tober 16, 1964. The article is entitled 
"Soviets Take Over Cuban Ocean Stud-
ies," and reads as follows: 
The Navy is concerned over the Soviet mis-
sion which has come to Cuba to take over its 
oceanographic studies. These studies can 
have two directly connected effects on the 
United States-Soviet balance of power. 
Charting the islands, reefs, keys, and un-
derwater canyons in the Caribbean may lo-
cate nondetected submarine routes for Soviet 
submarines. Our detection devices would 
find it difficult to track submarines moving 
near the ocean buttom and shielded by a 
line of islands with connecting underwater 
reefs. 
The Soviets also could be locating detec-
tion-proof passages where its subs could lay 
seCret mines to be fired by remote control. 
Soviet mining of terminal area sealanes and 
harbor approaches in the Caribbean and Gulf 
of Mexico would put the free Americas at a 
considerable disadvantage in facing a con-
ventional war. 
Dream Comes True 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT McCLORY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 26, 1965 
Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, as Rep-
resentative of the 12th Illinois Congres-
sional District in the heartland of the 
Midwest, I am always proud to recount 
new instances of the qualities of my con-
stituents. 
From the Waukegan News-Sun, the 
largest daily newspaper published in this 
district--Lake, McHenry, and Boone 
Counties?I have just clipped an article 
which I wish to share with my colleagues. 
I commend for your reading pleasure a 
people-to-people project in which a col-
umnist, an ex-serviceman and his fam-
ily, and a little Japanese girl are the 
principals. We are grateful to the col-
umnist, Mrs. Bernice Just, for calling 
this item of human interest to our atten-
tion. 
The article follows: 
DREAMS COME TRUE 
To a -petite Japanese girl, the Waukegan 
News-Sun is not just a newspaper but a fairy 
godmother, also. 
How the News-Sun became a godmother 
to the girl has a beginning. 
Once upon a time, almost a year ago, the 
girl, whose name is Shigeyo Chiba, wrote to 
"The Waukegan Newspaper in Waukegan, 
Ill." 
"Would you ask in your column if some 
family in your area would keep me next 
school year so I could go to classes there 
and learn more about your wonderful coun-
try?" wrote Shigeyo, of Hokkaido, 
At the time, the News-Sun never thought 
of itself as a godmother, and besides was 
fresh out of wands. Fortunately we had 
plenty of sticks of type. 
In this column we told about Shigeyo. 
Two families immediately volunteered to 
adopt Shigeyo for the year. 
We asted former News-Sun proofreader, 
Mrs. G. B. Hanna, and Miss Eleanor Moore, 
both American Field Service advisers with 
experience in selecting families for foreign 
students, to decide which of the two families 
should be chosen for Shigeyo. 
The AFS committee liked both families so 
much and found both so qualified as foster 
parents that the women, we think, flipped 
a coin. 
They chose the Curt Rosemann family of 
1524 West Deiring Lane, Lake Villa. The 
sons are Bruce, /5, and Craig, 13. The rest 
of the family are rabbits, cats, geese, dogs, 
and parakeets. 
Rosema.nn, an engineer for Jan-Air, Inc., 
Richmond, was in Japan when he was in 
service. All year long the family has been 
corresponding with Shigeyo and reading 
about Japan. 
Shigeyo, in the meantime, has been con-
tinuing her study of English and trying to 
learn as much as possible about the United 
States. 
A285 
"Tell me," she wrote to Mrs. Rosemann, 
"everything your family does in 1 day, from 
time you get up to when you go to bed." 
Shigeyo kept writing the News-Sun. 
"I want my American family to know well 
about me. I want to become like their true 
daughter." 
The year of planning, correspondence with 
the American Embassy and the Japanese 
Government and other paperwork finally 
came to fruition: Shigeyo has been granted 
permission from her Government to come to 
Lake County. 
So now we come to the beginning of 
another beginning. 
Shigeyo will fly from Tokyo to O'Hare 
International Airport, Chicago, on March 30 
or 31. 
The fact that she will fly here has the 
sound of a fairy tale with godmothers and 
wands and wishes come true. 
So maybe Shigeyo is right after all. 
Maybe the News-Sun is not just a news-
paper but a fairy godmother, also. 
Harvest of Shame 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. CHARLES M. TEAGUE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 26, 1965 
Mr. TEAGUE of California. Mr. 
Speaker, under leave to extend my re-
marks, I call the attention of my col-
leagues in the Congress to the following 
excellent article entitled "Harvest of 
Shame." This editorial appeared in the 
Daily News, Camarillo, Calif. 
The editorial follows: 
HARVEST OF SHAME 
During 1964, the last year of the bracero 
farm labor program, western do-gooders and 
eastern know-nothings sowed the seeds of 
folly when they managed to beat down legis-
lative attempts to have this workable system 
continued. This year, California is reaping 
a harvest of shame. While furtive attemtps 
are made to fill the farm labor gap with un-
qualified domestics, the agricultural econ-
omy of the Nation's No. 1 farming State 
teeters on the brink of disaster. 
Newly elected Senator GEORGE MURPHY, 
who vigorously opposed cancellation of the 
bracero program during his campaign, stated 
last week that farmers are letting fields lie 
fallow rather than plant crops only to have 
them rot on the vine. 
With the domestic worker system only a 
few weeks old, the problems brought about 
by the change are already exceeding forecasts 
of the bracero proponents. And the troubles 
go beyond the basic difficulty of farmers 
dealing with this uncertain labor market. 
County and city law enforcement officials 
report a sharp rise in incidents involving 
farmworkers notably fights and drunken-
ness. Oxnard Police Chief Al Jewell had so 
many drunks the first weekend after the 
farmworkers were paid that the city drunk 
tank was filled and some had to be sent to 
the county jail. 
A sheriff's office spokesman said the de-
partment has received many calls on fights, 
both at the labor camps and in the fields. 
He said this was in marked contrast to the 
almost complete lack of this type of incident 
among the braceros. 
Drinking and fighting are just openers?
the rapes, burglaries, assaults and other 
crimes of violence are yet to come. Sheriff's 
officials, knowing the type of individuals that 
are being brought into the county to work

286 CONGRIFSS IONAL RECORD APPENDIX 
In the fields, are certain they will come. A 
long, hot summer. of violence may be in store 
fo:: Ventura County and other agricultural 
areas. 
The Government alayed a dirty trick on the 
farmers and rural area residents when it de-
cided to trade brac3ros for America's unem-
ployed. Farmers and ranchers were handed 
the job of rehabilitating the chronic unem-
ployed. In an effort to secure enough farm 
hands and thereby prove that there are suffi-
cient domestic workers to fill the need, labor 
recruiters dragged the slums of Los An-
geles and other large cities. 
Among the herds of field recruits rounded 
up is an ample sprinkling of winos, derelicts 
and skidrow bums. These individuals, un-
fortunate though t fey, may be, need more 
than a job to set their lives aright, they 
require a carefully E.upervlsed rehabilitation 
program. 
Of course, the majority of the domestics 
are good, honest workers, interested in mak-
ing a decent living. But the supply of this 
type is limited and they usually have an eye 
open for better employment. 
The bracero program was a sound program 
all around. It provided farmers with a stable 
supply of good adept, willing farmhands. 
Braceros were noted for their good behavior. 
They had to behave i: they wanted to remain 
in this country. 
They were a far cry from the slave laborers 
as many of the dogocders tagged them. The 
Mexican workers wer3 paid far beyond what 
they could expect in their homeland. They 
were well fed, clothed, sheltered and super-
vised. The fact that they were happy with 
their lot was reflected in their regretful de-
parture last month. 
The most baffling aspect about the whole 
situation is that by putting the ax to the 
bracer() program, Uncle Sam canceled an im-
portant part of our :?oreign aid that didn't 
cost the taxpayers a red cent. The United 
States annually pours millions of dollars into 
Latin America with few thanks and little 
promise of being paid back. Yet in this in-
tame, millions of ciallars were going into 
exipo in pockets of grateful braceros who 
eft behind the most ?aluattle harvest in the 
orld. 
But maybe this is why the "experts" in 
est ington killed th3 bracero program?it 
ust made too much commonsense. 
Car Saks Hold Key to 1965 Prosperity 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
ON. CHARLES E. CHAMBERLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, Janlary 26, 1965 
Mr CHAMI3ERL.P.IN. Mr. Speaker, 
tl e President's recent budget message 
I dicates that the depressing effects of 
r excise tax system are finally to have 
tteir;ion. I sincerely hope that this is 
t e year that something will be clone 
a out reduction or repeal of the auto-
obile excise tax. The importance of 
s ch a step is clearly pointed out by 
J A. Livingston, WaEhington Post econ-
o 1st, in his article included in the Post's 
e onomic review section of January 10, 
165. 
This article, "Car Sales Hold Key to 
1 65 Prosperity," illustrates that "as 
a tos go, so will 1965, and vice versa." 
S nce we in the House may soon be faced 
w th a decision an auto excise taxes I 
t e this opportunity to commend this 
penetrating, article to the careful atten-
tiorl of my colleagues in the House and 
under unanimous consent, I include it 
in the ilppendix of the RECORD: 
CiR SALES HOLD KEY TO 1965 PROSPERITY 
(By J. A. Livingston) 
What's to keep prosperity rolling? 
That is the question, as we enter 1965. 
This las been a 20-year boom. 
RI begin right after Wor:d War It and has 
nerslistec . with only four minor interrup-
tions-1149-50, 1953-54, 1957-58, and 1960-
61. The setbacks were so mild we introduced 
a ne,w term: Recession, instead of depression. 
The latest advance has been a gallop. It 
started in February 1961?the month after 
Presiden Kennedy's inauguration?and has 
hardly sl opped for breath since. 
It is now the second longest peacetime up-
cycld on record, exceeded only by the un-
prosper() is recovery from the great depres-
sion.. 
Btet tt is raises a critical question: Is it 
petering out? 
The majority of economists who responded 
to my yeizend questionnaire think so. Their 
predicted pattern for the year is: First half 
up, second haltup also, but not se fast. This 
leads to he inference: Recession in 1966. 
I 
Here as e seven reasons for apprehension: 
1. The automotive industry has had 3 
superiathe years in a row. Adding on a 
fouawculd be like filling an inside straight 
In , er. It can be done, but the experts 
advise: "Don't bet your all on it." 
2. Housing continues to clip. The con.-
tinueed ris3 in foreclosures arid the persistent 
vacanby rite of more than 7 percent hardly 
foreshado w any immediate reversal. 
3. The United States has not yet solved its 
balante-of-payments difficulties, and even 
more empnatical/y, neither has Great Britain. 
A sterling crisiS could upset international 
money markets and perhaps put pressure on 
the dcillar 
4. As a corollary, the Federal Reserve 
System ii inhibited. Modern economic 
thought ?1. la Keynes?dictates that central 
banks sho rld make money and credit cheap 
and plentiful when business is not expand-
ing ra tall:, enough to take up slack in em-
ployment. But if interest rates were to fall 
in the iUni :ed States, foreign banks, business 
firms, land investors would pull out funds?
hot money ?from this country. This would 
put pressure on America's gold supply and 
perhaps cease a dollar crisis. 
5. Closing of military bases, if not care-
fully planr ed and spaced, can cause pockets 
of urrimployment and a fear psychology. 
Indeed retrenchment in defense spending?
highly des rable, in itself?is a source of 
uncertainty. 
6. Labor unrest is possible. The rivalry 
betweeo. Di.vid J. McDonald, president, and 
I. W. Abel, secretary-treasurer, for the 
presidency of the United Steelworkers in-
creases the chance of a strike. Whoever is 
elected will want to prove he deserved. it?
by winning a signal wage boost. 
7. Moremer, in anticipation of trouble in 
steel, many manufacturers and retailers are 
building up inventories. Not only are they 
ordering stsel but also products made of 
steel. This could lead to an up-down 
inventory c;,cle. 
RETURN GROWS 
So ranch ;or the question: What's to cause 
a slowdewn ' Now to: What's to keep pros-
perity rolling? 
Recoverlei are often propelled along by un-
expected. str sngths generated by recovery, it-
self. This is possible in 1965. 
Corporate profits have made the great leap 
upward:" Frcrn $22 billion after taxes in 1961, 
to 825 WM? i in 1962, to $27 billion la 1963, 
and in 1964 x) well above $30 billion. This is 
a major breekthrough. , 
TROUBLE SPOTS 
January 26 
The return on invested capital has been 
increasing. Th:.s courses through the econ-
omy in unexpected ways and places. It in-
duces corporate boards of directors and 
entrepreneurs to put more money into new 
capacity and development projects. 
This flow-through is discernible in the rail-
roads. For years they were the economy's 
stepchildren. Now, profits are up, and this 
year's capital expenditures will be three 
times those of 1960. 
Furthermore, the social needs of modern 
living?highways, schools, parking facilities, 
hospitals, sewage disposal systems?require 
continuing expansion in capital improve-
ments by State and local governments. 
These will be a powerful force again this 
year. 
And the increase in employment?at rising 
income levels?widens the base of consumer 
demand. Affluence always lifts families into 
higher spending brackets. 
This widened demand will be reinforced by 
an upsurge in marriages. The big crop of 
babies born just before and after the end of 
the war is reaching the age of nubility. 
PRESIDENT AWARE 
Finally?and this is what keeps me opti-
mistic?Preisdent Johnson and his economic 
advisers are fully aware of the standard fore-
cast: Up in the first half, second half up 
also, but not so fast. Such retarded eco-
nomic growth would mean a shortage of 
jobs for the bumper crop of 18-to-21 year 
olds. 
The second stage of the tax cut voted last 
year will take effect. This will add somewhat 
to incomes. And elimination or reduction 
of excise taxes is probable. This will reduce 
price tags on higher priced items, such as 
autos, furs, etc. Finally, if necessary, Presi-
dent Johnson can have ready a shelf of pub-
lic works?just in case. 
The greatest danger this year is external?. 
events beyond the mastery of the President 
and his aids, such as an international mone-
tary crisis, deeper involvement militarily in 
the Far East, disputes with the Soviet Union. 
But these are the unpredictables. And in 
business and investment planning, it's not 
easy to do much about them. 
The domestic economic test will come in 
the spring. If automobile sales keep pace 
with the optimistic forecasts of Detroit exec-
utives, then a good second half will hatch. 
Conclusion: As autos go, so will 1965, and 
vice versa.

OF DELAWARE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 26, 1965 
Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, the 
presses are running overtime today pro-
ducing evaluations of the present situa-
tion in South Vietnam.' Foreign policy 
experts are blossoming forth every Mon-
day morning in the tradition of the 
"Monday morning quarterbacks." 
Some of the articles appearing are in-
deed enlightening and are based an fac-
tual information of responsible reporters 
and journalists in the field. Others are 
obviously written by those who merely 
want to jump on the bandwagon of the 
critics. 
Without doubt, the military and po-
litical situation in South Vietnam grows 
more ominous from day to day. The

sioNAL RECORD --- HOUSE February 15 
%PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT OF 
WITHHOLDING TAXES 
(Mr. M1NSHALL (at the request of 
Mr. Gaoss) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. MINSHALL Mr. Speaker, mil-
lions of American taxpayers are shocked 
to find themselves owing the Federal 
Govermnent a great, deal more income 
tax for 1964 than they had expected. 
This is a debt few of them anticipated 
and that many are not financially pre-
pared to meet without serious economic 
hardship. 
Because income taxes were underwith-
held by the Government last year, 
through confusion and conflict in the 
administration's tax rate bill, taxpayers 
now must pay the penalty for the Gov-
ernment's carelessness in setting up a 
two-stage drop in the tax rate, while 
allowing a larger, one-stage drop in with-
holding. Many of u ca,utioned that 
payroll deductions would not be large 
enough, but no steps were taken to cor-
rect the inequity and taxpayers were 
urged to spend their bigger take-home 
paychecks. The onus is on the Govern-
ment, not the unsuspecting taxpayer. 
Only last week, Congressman UTT in-
troduced legislation to spread payments 
due on April 15 over the next year so that 
taxpayers will not feel such a heavy im-
pact at this time. Economic problems 
on the family level are quickly reflected 
in the national economy, and I fear the 
repercussions that mass borrowing and 
depletion of personal savings accounts 
could have. I am therefore cosponsoring 
a bill to give taxpayers a chance to adjust 
withholding taxes so that the time for 
Payment of one-half of the 1964 with-
holding deficiency will be April 15, 1966. 
By adjusting withholding taxes during 
the balance of 1965, it would, in effect, re-
store a two-stage withholding system to 
correspond with the two-stage tax re-
duction. 
Because April 15 is drawing near, and 
because taxpayers are being urged to file 
returns early, I hope that the House will 
take remedial action just as quickly as 
possible. 
CAPTIVE NATIONS 
(Mr. ROBISON (at the request of Mr. 
GROSS) was .granted permission to ex-

Mr. ROBISON. Mr. Speaker, this is 
indeed a week of great significance in 
the history of Lithuania. Not only do 
we commemorate the 47th anniversary 
of the establishment of the Republic of 
Lithuania, but this week also marks the 
714th anniversary of the formation of 
the Lithuanian state and the 712th an-
niversary of the founding of the Lithu-
anian kingdom, 
As we again pause to honor the Lithu-
anian Independence Day, it is sad that 
the peoples of that country have little 
tp gelebrate. The ,people of Lithuania 
and the other Baltic States have now 
been under the control of the Soviet 
Union for almost 25 years. 
I have today reintroduced a concurrent 
resolution requesting the President to 
bring the Baltic States question before 
the United Nations so that these peoples 
might once again enjoy the freedom they 
hold so dear. While these thoughts are 
still fresh in our minds, urge the Con-
gress to adopt this measure as soon as 
possible. The peoples of the Baltic States 
have already lived too long as captives.

4111-ANNIVER,SITY OF 
THE SINKING OF THE BATTLE-
SHIP "MAINE" IN HAVANA HAR-
BOR, CUBA 
The SPEAKER. Under special orders 
heretofore entered into, the gentleman 
from Illinois [Mr. O'HARA] is recognized 
for 60 minutes. 
Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
today is the 67th anniversary of the 
sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in 
Havana Harbor in Cuba. It is an anni-
versary that veterans of the war with 
Spain, which was triggered by the blow-
ing up of the Maine, observed during the 
years with appropriate memorial serv-
ices for the Maine's heroic dead, num-
bering 266. 
Ninety-two veterans of the war with 
Spain were elected by their constituents 
to the Congress of the United States, 
When I came to the House of Repre-
sentatives in 1949, I was one of four 
Spanish War veterans then serving in the 
House. Today, I am the last veteran of 
that war of 67 years ago in this or the 
other body. This has been the case for 
a number of years. 
Deeply I have felt that this circum-
stance of survival has placed upon me 
a responsibility. In respect and affection 
for my comrades who are gone, I feel 
that to the utmost of my ability I should 
continue, as long as I am here, to be a 
sort of spokesman for the spirit of 1898. 
The spirit of 1898 was a previous ex-
pression of pure patriotism, something 
that was in the nostrils and the hearts 
and the souls of American men and 
women near the film of the century. It 
was the spirit of a people responding to 
the call of the destiny ahead, a spirit 
that with the succession of events it 
influenced, truly, can be said to have 
turned the course of history. 
Every year of my congressional tenure 
I have been granted a special order on 
February 15 or the date closest thereto 
if on February 15 the House were not in 
session. I appreciate that as a veteran 
of a war fought 67 years ago I cannot 
continue this practice for too many years, 
I earnestly suggest that after this last 
Spanish War veteran is gone, members 
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars might 
wish to continue the observance on the 
floor of this Chamber of the anniversary 
of the sinking of the Maine. 
It will be remembered, of course, that 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the 
United States was founded by the over-
sea veterans of the Spanish-American 
War, sailors who had served in the At-
lantic and the Pacific, soldiers who had 
fought in Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto 
Rico, and in China during the Boxer 
uprising. 
Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
sent, I insert at this point an editorial 
from the February 11, 1965, issue of the 
Stars and Stripes, the National Tribune: 
SINKING OF THE "MAINE" 
The passage of 67 years has dimmed in the 
minds of most Americans the historic event 
that took place in Havana Harbor. Cuba, 
on February 15, 1898. 
Few Americans alive today can recall the 
mksterious attack upon the battleship Maine 
as it lay at anchor off Havana. The explosion 
which rent the battleship with the loss of 
266 officers and men out of a complement 
of 354 was a major disaster and it brought 
the United States into direct conflict with 
the Spanish Empire. 
The sinking of the Maine awakened the 
conscience of this Nation and immediately 
there arose an insistent demand from mil-
lions of Americans that we go to war with 
Spain. Inevitably this decision was made 
and history records the splendid accomplish-
ments of the last completely volunteer army 
made up largely of American boys in their 
teens. More than 6,000 American youths 
died in action or from deadly tropical dis-
eases. In addition the lifespan of many 
more thousands was curtailed because of 
the hardships endured during the campaigns 
in the tropical areas. 
The plight of the Cuban people particu-
larly had been deteriorating for a number 
of years under the dominance of the King-
dom of Spain. 
Only 90 miles from our shore, this country 
had not only taken official notice of the 
sad status of our neighbors but the American 
people themselves viewed the situation with 
some alarm. Thus it was an easy matter 
to step into conflict in an endeavor to gain 
freedom for the Cuban people.

or r nts they can:afford, There must be 
more vigorous efforts in the District, both 
pubic, and private, to take advantage of 
all lhe programs now available under the 
national housing laws. 
e District's urban renewal program

ahe d to provide decent housing for low-
arid moderate-income f unifies. The re-
habilitation and renewal project now un-
derway in Northwest Urban Renewal

TOi little effort has been exerted to as-
sur that violations are detected and cor-
rec ed promptly. Both eenants and land-

res onsibilities as well as their rights. 
? rban renewal powers must be made

other aLties, to aid in the development 
of blighted commercial areas. They are 
particularly needed in the central city, 
where the demonstrated interest of the 
bu inese community insures a fruitful 
cooperatlon between pablic and private 
eff rts.

of he urban renewal and public housing

number o rendents or in-area,' Increas-
ingly, the pre blema of the District blend 
into and become a part of regional prob-
lems Transportation, Water, air pollu-
tion, sewdge and waste disposal, fire and 
police proteetion, recreation, employ-
ment, arid economic development are 
only a mirth I list of matters in which 
neither the District nor any other part of 
the area can proceed behind its own 
jurisdictiena: curtains. 
A. Transportation: The most critical 
of the regicnal development needs is 
transportatien. Washington is now the 
only major c apital in the Western World 
lacking h rail rapid transit system. 
There is 'urgent need to begin the con-
struction of such a system?largely with-
in the District at the beginning, but 
eventually eetending into the suburbs 
of Maryland and Virginia. I have al-
ready transmitted to the Congress pro-
posed authorizing legislation. 
The highway program, both within 
and without the District, must likewise 
not be allowed to lag. The cooperative 
efforts of District and Federal agencies 
through the Policy Advisory Committee 
to revieW some elements of the program 
should be continued. Construction 
should proce ed as rapidly as funds can 
be made available. 
B. Regional development: I have al-
ready indica ;ed my hopes that the Poto-
mac River wil become a model of beauty 
and usefulness for the Capital and the 
Nation. The re are, however, many other 
problems of the Washington metropoli-
tan area for vhich long-range metropoli-
tan solulfione are necessary. The inter-
est of the Pederal Government in the 
best develop ment of the region is mani-
fest, arid its cooperation in resolving 
regional oro 31ems is essential. We must 
encourage and facilitate local efforts to 
create effeceive organs of regional co-
operation. In addition, the Federal 
Govermnent must utilize its own policies 
and programs to assist the region to de-
velop in a way which will maximize the 
efficiency as .d economy of Federal Gov-
ernment operations, and which will per-
mit this regi Dn to exemplify to the United 
States a:Ind ;o the world the best in re-
gional cooperation and metropolitan 
growth. ' 
Iv 
Washingtm as a national capital: 
The Dietrict, as the Nation's Capital, 
must meet I he special requirements im-
posed on the capital city of a great na-
tion. We are committed to preserving 
and enhancing the great avenues, the 
great =seams and galleries, the great 
sweep of the Mall. 
Legislation is being prepared in con-
nection 'with the proposals to transform 
PermsylVan .a Avenue from its present 
shabby State, to a new dignity and gran-
deur. As long as blight and ugliness dis-
figure itny part of this historic link 
between the Capitol and the White 
House, dt cannot suitably serve as the 
main ceremonial avenue of the Nation, 
either tia American citizens or to visitors 
from abroad. The proposal need not be 
undertaken at once in all of its aspects, 
but evev ad and encouragement should 
be given to further study and refinement 
of its details and to the establishment of 
the creative partnership of Goverritent 
and private enterprise needed to convert."" 
the avenue into a thoroughfare worthy 
of the Nation's pride. 
There are other areas where needed 
improvements can also be accelerated. 
The Washington Monument can be given 
the setting it deserves as soon as the de-
velopment of ? the freeway from the 
Roosevelt Bridge to the 14th Street 
Bridge, and the 9th arid 14th Street 
underpasses of the Mall permit the elimi-
nation of the 15th Street traffic from 
near the base of the monument. The 
temporary buildings which huddled at 
its base are already gone, and the plans 
to improve its immediate surroundings 
must be pushed forward. 
The Lincoln Memorial, long throttled 
by a circle of heavy automobile traffic, 
can be freed of its noose as soon as the 
freeway running beneath its grounds 
permits the area facing the Reflecting 
Pool and the monument to be reserved 
for the visitor on foot. The memorial 
will not achieve its proper setting, how-
ever, until the remaining obsolete and 
temporary buildings on Constitution 
Avenue are eliminated. 
There are many other projects. Tem-
porary buildings on public space 
throughout the monument area must 
be removed. There is need to carry for-
ward the plans to develop the potential 
of the Mall, so that it may be a place of 
life and beauty, of pleasure and relaxa-
tion. There is need for a visitors' center 
which will provide perspective and 
understanding regarding the Federal 
Government to the myriad students and 
tourists who come to Washington to see 
and learn. 
There is also urgent need to proceed 
with the improvement of the central 
business district in a way which permits 
full coordination With the progress or 
Pennsylvania Avenue. ? The full poten-
tial of Pennsylvania Avenue from the 
Capitol to the Anacostia River as a major 
entranceway to the city has not been 
realized. There is the development of 
Washington's waterfront in connection 
with the new aquarium. There is the 
need to identify landmark buildings and 
places, and to work out means by which 
to encourage their preservation. 
The District presents both a challenge 
and an opportunity. Here we have nat-
ural beauty as well as buildings of his-
toric and architectural value. ? The great 
sweep of the Potomac River, Rock Creek 
Park, and the ring of parks where the old 
Civil War forts stood make the District 
a city in a park. In its heart the gran-
deur of the Mall, the many circles and 
squares, and the great street trees carry 
natural beauty to everyone. 
? Today there is new awareness of our 
urban environment. We can, if we will, 
make the District the symbol of the best 
of our aspirations. We can make it a city 
in which our citizens will live in comfort 
and safety, and with pride, and in which 
commerce and industry will flourish. We 
can make it a capital which its millions 
of visitors will admire. All this we must 
do. I am sure the Congress will join me 
in accepting the challenge.

-`11Phile some historians have seen fit to 
minimize the war itself and its afterward 
effects, it is a historic fact that the success-
ful conclusion of this warfare brought to 
America untold immediate wealth. Victory 
made possible the Panama Canal, brought 
ultimate success over the dreaded plague 
of yellow fever and opened up broad vistas of 
world commerce. It can be unequivocably 
stated that the lessons learned during this 
conflict laid the foundation for victory in 
both World Wars. 
Now the ranks of the survivors of this 
conflict grow thinner each year. Their aver-
age age is well over 83, but they can take 
pride and comfort in the fact that they 
played a vital role in the making of America 
as we know it today. 
(Mr. ALBERT (at the request of Mr. 
O'HARA of Illinois) was given permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD.) 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege for me to join our distinguished 
colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, 
in observing the 67th anniversary date of 
the sinking of the battleship Maine in 
Havana Harbor, which triggered the in-
volvement of the ,United States in a 
Major military action against a foreign 
power on foreign soil and in defense of 
freedom on this continent. As the House 
knows, the gentleman from Illinois was 
himself a Member of the Army of over 
18,000 Regulars and volunteers who 
fought in Cuba in 1898. He served with 
the 33d Volunteer Infantry of Michigan 
under General Duffield. He is the lone 
Member of the House at this time to have 
experienced the rigors of the Cuban cam-
paign. He has shared with us his rec-
ollections of the battles and events of 
that epic period in our history. Through 
him we have come to know the spirit 
of liberation and abiding belief in free 
government which inspired these cou-
rageous men who fought under circum-
stances rarely s.uffered in modern war-
fare?shortages of munitions and equip-
ment, food, and medical supplies. 
He has transmitted to us their deter-
mination to aid the suppressed Cuban 
peoples suffering under the yoke, of Span-
ish rule. He has opened our eyes to the 
deeds of bravery and self-sacrifice com-
missioned by the troops, and the military 
genius of strategegist Maj. Gen. Wil-
liam R. Shafter who commanded the 
Army in Cuba, of Gen. Leonard Wood, of 
division commanders Lawton and Kent, 
and brigade commanders, Chaffee, Haw-
kins, Ludlow and Duffield, all names let-
tered in gold on the rosters of our mili-
tary heroes. 
These were the forces which, together 
With our strong naval forces under Com-
modore George Dewey, occupied not only 
Cuba but Puerto Rico, the Pacific island 
of Guam in the Marianas, the harbor 
of Manila Bay in the Philippines and 
which were indirectly responsible for the 
annexation of Hawaii which had been 
seeking union, with the United States 
since 1893, The peace treaty provided 
for full title to the Philippines, cession 
of Guam and Puerto Rico and Spain's 
relinquishing of sovereignty over Cuba. 
These new bases in the Pacific, a boon 
to American trade in the Orient and 
helpful in offsetting the effects of then 
recently acquired Zuropean bases in that 
area, were slated to have even greater 
Approved For REttmtifigffifiatCA-M7B0214klyr0500080005-4 
significance in the outcome of a world 
war decades later. 
This American victory gave the United 
States strategic supremacy in the Carib-
bean area, involved it in the problems of 
the Far East, spurred the growth of our 
Navy, and paved the way for the opening 
of the Panama Canal. Destiny, we know 
now, at this point in our history, had 
called the United States to a leading role 
In world affairs. Henceforth, America 
turned her gaze outward and, building 
upon the base provided by her leadership 
In Cuba, commenced a new role on the 
world stage. 
It is scarcely an wonder that our col-
league, the gentleman from Illinois, trea-
sures his memories of those momentous 
days when our country laid aside the 
things of her youth, and took up the bur-
dens and glories of world leadership. 
He sees these events both from the per-
sonal and the broader national and in-
ternational view. He knows the hun-
dreds of human sacrifices, great and 
small, which made possible our emerg-
ence as a world power. He knows that 
we have accepted these sacrifices and 
perhaps acknowledged them and com-
pensated them too little. 
It is a privilege to pay tribute to him 
personally and to his comrades of his 
early years to whom we owe a debt be-
yond accounting. 
(Mr. CRAMER (at the request of Mr. 
O'HARA of Illinois) was given permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in 
the RECORD.) 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, it is in-
deed a pleasure for me to join my distin-
guished friend and colleague, the gentle-
man from Illinois, in paying tribute today 
to that wondrous breed of men who 
fought for America on a purely voluntary 
basis during the Spanish-American War. 
I believe the gentleman is the only Mem-
ber of Congress serving in the 89th Con-
gress who fought in that war during 1898. 
It was 67 years ago today, Mr. Speaker, 
that the tragic event occurred. On a 
peaceful Sunday evening at Havana Har-
bor in Cuba, 266 Americans lost their 
lives when the great Battleship Maine 
was torn apart by a terrific explosion. 
The sinking of the Maine caused America 
to forget her sectionalist problems and 
bound her together in a tremendous wave 
of patriotism. When President McKin-
ley asked for 125,000 volunteers, more 
than 1 million offered their services. 
Overnight, "Remember the Maine" be-
came the battlecry of all America. 
Although the war was short in dura-
tion, the insurrectionist movement across 
the Pacific in the Philippines caused the 
Injury or death to many Americans long 
after the 10-month war was technically 
over. 
Mr. Speaker, should you ask a member 
of today's younger generation what he 
or she knows about the Spanish-Amer-
ican War, you would probably hear the 
reply that it was started with the sinking 
of the Battleship Maine. But, beyond 
that, you would not receive much in-
formation. Like my friend from Illinois, 
this to me is a tragedy. I recently picked 
up a copy of a sixth-grade history text 
and was astonished to note that only 
three short paragraphs covered the en-
2609 
tire war. When you consider that it was 
the Spanish-American War that started 
this great Nation on its climb to the posi-
tion of world prominence which she en-
joys today, this is certainly a paradox. 
I am hopeful that the historians who 
look back upon the events of 1898 will 
soon put them into their rightful and 
proper perspective. 
This is the reason, Mr. Speaker, that 
our colleague has reserved this hour to-
day. it is, I am sure, the reason he has 
spoken on this topic each and every year 
he has been a Member of this august 
body. And it is the reason I join in his 
cause. It is a just and honest one and I 
am certain he shall meet success. 
(Mr. ROOSEVELT (at the request of 
Mr. O'HARA of Illinois) was given permis-
sion to extend his remarks at this point 
in the RECORD.) 
Mr. ROOSEVELT. Mr. Speaker, Feb-
ruary 15, 1965, marks the 67th anniver-
sary of the sinking of the battleship 
Maine in Havana Harbor, a naval disas-
ter that plunged the United States into 
the Spanish-American War under the 
popular slogan "Remember the Maine." 
That war grew out of the Cuban insur-
rection against Spanish rule that began 
in February 1865, an insurrection fought 
ruthlessly and ferociously by both sides. 
Pressures for American intervention 
were resisted by President Cleveland, and 
his successor, President McKinley, fol-
lowed the same course during the begin-
ning of his administration. A settlement 
seemed in prospect when the destruction 
of the Maine led to great anti-Spanish 
feeling in the United States. On April 
11, 1898, the President sent Congress a 
message asking for authority to end the 
civil war in Cuba. On April 19, Congress 
passed resolutions recognizing the inde-
pendence of Cuba, demanding that Spain 
withdraw from the island, and authoriz-
'Mg the President to use the Armed 
Forces for these purposes; another reso-
lution disclaimed any American inten-
tion of annexing Cuba. On April 25, 
Congress declared that a state of war had 
existed from April 21. 
A midshipman rescued from the Maine 
later became an admiral. Writing of the 
sinking of the Maine in his memoirs, 
Adm. W. T. Cluverius recounted: 
Shortly after three bells, I finished my let-
ter. As I rose from my desk, I heard a sharp 
sound * * *. Immediately *there followed a 
terrifying explosion. 
The explosion that sank the Maine led 
to a war which diplomatic historians 
consider to be the beginning of the emer-
gence of the United States as a world 
power. 
The Spanish-American War was 
fought by volunteers. Over 5,000 died, 
many more from disease than in battle. 
The average age of veterans of that war 
is now in the eighties. There are very 
few of them left. To them, and to the 
memory of their comrades of long ago, 
we say that we still "Remember the 
Maine." 
(Mr. MATSUNAGA (at the request of

a ain the forces of tyranny are on the 
oVe, and once again the cause of free-
m hangs in the balance, it is well to 
r Meniber that in many times past 
Moss crises have given way to vic-
t ry. 
At the close of our great and tragic 
ivil War, we found our Nation rent 
part and all but devastated. That is to 
ay, we were, to all intents and purposes, 
thoroughly divided people, with little 
lope of ever again acting as a united 
ation. 
Throughout the world it was widely be-
'eyed that our country was weakened 
y warfare to such an extent that no 
aticn had reason to respect us as a force 
n international poli :des. Acting on this 
lief, the agents of royal Spain saw fit 
o prey upon our rig ats in the Caribbean 
ea. In November 1873, news reached 
s of the capture of an American ship, 
he 17irginius, by Spanish authorities, off 
he coast of Cuba. On November 12, 
Onfirmation arrived that Captain Fry of 
he Virginias and 36 members of his 
area had been exect ted by a Spanish fir-
ing squad, on a charge of "piracy." 
Enraged by the e aormity of this atro-
cious act, a great many Americans clam-
ored for war; but rioderation prevailed. 
In time, on a basis of negotiation, the 
Virginius and her survivors were repatri-
ated to the United 'States. 
The belief persisted abroad that we 
wer e two nations, North and South, and 
that we consequen:ly dared not under-
take a fight in behalf of our principles. 
In keeping with this belief, Spanish 
abuses continued. 
Indeed the battle cry, "Remember the 
Maine," is only one of many rallying cries 
? we have had in the history of our coun-
try, and tyrants wi I find in the future as 
well that fight we will in the cause of 
justice and freedom. 
For some time toe United States suf-
? fered in patient brbearance?through-
out the 1870's, ti rough the eighties?
? wh de meanwhile conditions worsened in 
the Caribbean. Then it happened?the 
? stroke that could not be ignored; the 
blow we could not overlook. 
On the afternoon of February 15, 1898, 
the second-class American battleship 
Maine lay moored !n Havana harbor, offi-
cially protected by the powers of Span-
ish authority. Then, at 9:40 that night, 
two explosions rocked the harbor, throw-
ing parts of the Maine 200 feet in the air. 
Two officers and 258 members of the 
clam were killed b y the blast Suddenly, 
? American patience was exhausted; over-
night we were at war. 
?As it turned out; on that occasion, the 
United States was not in fact a divided 
nation, but whole and sound, capable of 
fighting effectively under one flag. In 
Short time we swept the enemy before 
us, at one and the same moment driving 
Spain from the :anks of the Powerful 
and donning the mantle of world leader-
ship ourselves?a Mantle we wear to this 
very day. 
The lesson is c.ear, I think for all to 
see. That we, the people of the United 
States, will tolerate only just so long the 
force of those concerned primarily with 
power. Ours is 3. cause established on 
principle, and we are convinced that in 
every ttst yf strength between principle 
and sheer force, principle is stronger. 
On that belief we have built this, our 
great nation, and are dedicated to help-
ing others to do the same.

Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, several 
generations of Americans have but a dim 
memory of the Spanish-American War. 
The Congress is reminded each year by 
our colleague, the gentleman from Illi-
nois, COrigTeSS1119.11 BARRATT O'HARA, of 
facts concerning this historical occasion 
which are not recorded in the history 
books. 
Sixty-seven years have passed since 
that memorable event which took place 
in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, 
the sinking of the Battleship Maine. The 
newspapers of that day recorded it as a 
mysterious attack upon the great battle-
ship as it lay at anchor off Havana. The 
dynamiting of the Maine by the enemy 
killed 266 officers and men and this major 
disaster brought the United States into 
war with the Spanish Empire. 
History has recorded in many volumes 
the splendid accomplishments of the last 
completely volunteer army made up 
largely of American boys under 21 years 
of age. Over 6,000 American youths died 
In action or from deadly tropical dis-
ease. The lifespan of thousands more 
was curtailed because of the hardships 
endured during the battles in the dis-
ease-infested tropical areas. 
In winning the great victory, the 
United States served notice on the world 
that our Nation was a champion for lib-
erty and when its flag was attacked it 
would fight not only to preserve our 
honor but to also help gain freedom for 
the people of an enslaved neighbor na-
tion. 
The Spanish-American War Victory 
started America on its road to eventual 
leadership of the nations all over the 
world, and gave to the people of America 
an international status both through 
trade and prestige which eventually 
brought prosperity and untold success 
to the people of our land. The victory 
made possible the U.S. construction of 
the Panama Canal and also brought sci-
entific medical discoveries against yellow 
fever and many more disease plagues 
which have relieved world humanity of 
untold suffering and death. There is no 
doubt but what the Spanish-American 
War victory laid the foundation for our 
victory in both World War I and World 
War II. 
The ranks of the heroes of the Span-
ish-American War are growing thinner 
as the years and months pass. Very few 
veterans of that conflict are alive today 
and their average age is around 85 years. 
The Members wish to commend our 
colleague, the only Spanish-American 
War veteran in our ranks in Congress, 
BARRA.= O'HARA, for keeping alive this 
annual tribute to the leaders and par-
ticipants in that great conflict of over 
60 years ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? MUSE 
Timis for bringing again to the? atten-
tion of this House and the country the 
stirring days of 1898. On this anniver-
sary of the sinking of the Maine I think 
it behooves all of us to look back to those 
days and to remember the people who 
were heroic in their deeds and who 
dreamed dreams which we have seen 
come to fruition. 
As a Representative of the State of 
Arizona I am particularly pleased to be 
able to share with the gentleman from 
Illinois my respects on this occasion be-
cause, as the gentleman will remember, 
many of the Roughriders were re-
cruited from the State of Arizona. One 
of the most famous was Bucky O'Neal 
Who led one of the companies of Rough-
riders and even at that time was one 
of the most famous lawmen of all time, 
having been a frontier sheriff whose 
name was famous in the Territory of 
? Arizona. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I think it is an oc-
casion, on which all states of the Union 
may take justifiable pride in remember-
ing the exploits, the deeds, not only of 
their own sons but the sons of their 
sister .States, in that war of 1898. 
? So, I hope, Mr. Speaker, and I know it 
will be so, that the gentleman from Il-
linois will be here for many years to 
bring forth the Memories which we now 
bring forth on this day. I certainly wish 
for him and all of his fellow veterans of 
the Spanish-American War the very best 
of everything in the days to come. 
Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. I thank the 
gentleman from Arizona and I might re-
mark that in 1914 when I was touring 
the country for the commander in chief 
of the United Spanish War Veterans I 
? visited Phoenix and one of the great 
meetings we had was with the fellow 
veterans in Phoenkk? I thank the gen-
- tleman for his comments. 
Mr. MORGAN. Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the 67th anniversary of the sink-
ing of the battleship Maine, in Havana 
Harbor. That tragic event led to the 
war with Spain and started a chain reac-
tion that led to freedom for Cuba and 
? eventual independence for the Philip-
pines. It also marked the first time that 
uniformed Americans served overseas. 
In rising to speak on this occasion, I 
wish to commend my distinguished col-
league from Illinois for arranging the 
time today to observe this historic anni-
versary. He is the last remaining vet-
eran of the Spanish-American War in 
the Congress and is one of the few sur-
viving founders of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. Our esteemed colleague 
has maintained a, constant interest in 
Latin America, and while he has long 
served as chairman of the Foreign Af-
fairs Subcommittee on Africa, he has at 
the same time given service as the active, 
energetic, ranking majority member of 
the Subcommittee on Inter-American 
Affairs. 
I thank my friend and colleague for 
reminding us of the sinking of the 
Keane and all the subsequent events 
3'v1'iieh. are,?? called to mind when we think 
Of Cuba and developments there. It is 
Sad to realize that the people of Cuba 
have again lost their freedom?this time 
No, 29-3 
to a dictator from within, aided and sup-
ported by international communism. On 
this anniversary it is timely and fitting 
that we rededicate ourselves to the use 
of every effort to eliminate Communist 
domination from this hemisphere. 
Mr. MONAGAN. Mr. Speaker, today 
is the 67th anniversary of the sinking of 
the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana 
Harbor. 
This is a time to pay tribute to the 226 
Americans who lost their lives in this 
tragic event that triggered our war with 
Spain in 1898. 
Today we count Spain among our 
friends in the struggle for international 
peace, while Cuba is ruled by a dictator 
whose sympathies are with our enemies. 
On this anniversary of the sinking of the 
Maine, our Nation looks to the time, and 
it will come, when the freedom-loving 
people of Cuba will again enjoy the privi-
leges of liberty and the rights of self-
government. We do this in the name of 
the Americans who served and died in 
the Spanish-American War. 
On this anniversary of the sinking of 
the Maine, we extend our compliments 
and express our gratitude to the surviv-
ing veterans of the Spanish-American 
War and especially, to an outstanding one 
of them, a gallant, courageous, and be-
loved colleague and friend, the gentle-
man from Illinois [Mr. O'HARA]. 
Events of the past few years have fo-
cused new international attention upon 
Cuba. Once again the dignity of man 
and the future of free political institu-
tions are at stake on that embattled 
island. We must not forget the Maine 
or Cuba, nor will we drop our guard 
against the dangerous influences which 
have come to our hemisphere with the 
rise of Castro in Cuba. In this time of 
difficulty, our hearts will be lifted up by 
the memories of those gallant boys of 
1898. 
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today we 
observe the 67th anniversary of the sink-
ing of the U.S. battleship Maine in Ha-
vana Harbor, with the loss of 260 officers 
and men. The news of the frightful 
tragedy startled the world. It led to the 
Spanish-American War and started the 
United States on the road to world power. 
The sympathy of our countrymen had 
gone out to the Cubans in their long 
struggle for liberty. Numbered among 
their military leaders were Maximo Go-
mez and Antonio Maceo, men of brav-
ery and patriotism unexcelled in the 
annals of any nation. Jos?arti, the 
apostle of liberty, belongs in the com-
pany of Jefferson, Bolivar, Lincoln, and 
Juarez. Today, in Cuba, these heroic de-
fenders of liberty have been replaced by 
men like Fidel Castro, and the world 
is poorer because of that change. 
In 1895 the revolt in Cuba had flared 
up again after more than a decade of 
relative tranquillity. As the situation be-
came worse, Fitzhugh Lee, the 'U.S. Con-
sul-General at Havana, appealed for 
support in the form of a naval force to 
insure the protection of U.S. citizens in 
Cuba. 
On the morning of January 25, 1898, 
the Spanish authorities having been no-
tified of her visit, the Maine, Capt. 
2611 
Charles Sigsbee, steamed into Havana 
harbor and was moored to a buoy 500 
yards off the arsenal. The Spanish 
officials acted with punctilious courtesy 
and the social amenities between Ameri-
can and Spanish officials proceeded ac-
cording to naval protocol. No unusual 
incident took place until 9:40 p.m. on 
the night of February 15, when two ter-
rific explosions threw parts of the Maine 
200 feet in the air. The forward half 
of the ship was reduced to a mass of 
twisted steel; the after part slowly sank. 
Immediately after the sinking of the 
Maine a board of inquiry was convened 
by the American Government and a sim-
ilar one by the Government of Spain. 
In 1912, when the wreck was raised 
from the floor of Havana Harbor, a board 
of officers of the Navy made a further 
investigation. Opinions of experts have 
differed, and the cause of the explosion 
has never been conclusively established. 
It remains one of the unsolved mys-
teries of our time. 
Whatever the cause of the appalling 
catastrophe may have been, its effect 
is clear. News of the disaster produced 
great excitement in the United States, 
and some newspapers accused the 
Spaniards. National feeling about the 
difficulties in Cuba crystallized In the 
slogan: "Remember the Maine." Rela-
tions between Spain and ?the United 
States, already strained by the indigna-
tion of the American people over the 
treatment and abuse of the Cubans by 
the Spanish Government, reached the 
breaking point. The events that fol-
lowed culminated in a declaration of war 
on April 25, 1898. 
The war that followed taught us the 
danger of unpreparedness. It taught us 
lessons in sanitation and disease control 
which probably saved the lives of thou-
sands in World Wars I and II. It helped 
to heal the wounds of the Civil War and 
cemented North and South into one 
great people under one glorious flag. In 
the War with Spain the people of this 
country, as always before and since, dis-
played a unity and a patriotism scarcely 
matched in the history of the world. 
Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, on this, 
the 67th anniversary of the sinking of 
the battleship Maine, I join with my col-
leagues in honoring the Spanish-Ameri-
can War veterans. In consequence of 
that war, tyranny was smashed in the 
Caribbean, and, until a few years ago, 
democracy prevailed. In a sense all this 
resulted from the sinking of a single ship, 
the American battleship Maine. 
The cost of victory was high, for more 
than 5,000 American lives were lost, but 
then, as now, Americans have never hesi-
tated to give their lives for the cause of 
freedom. 
So today let us make clear to the Cas-
troites that the words "Remember the 
Maine" are as important as they were in 
1893. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, the 
67th anniversary of the sinking of the 
Maine reminds us that this body is hon-
ored to have as one of its Members, 
the gentleman from Illinois, BARRATT

nit only served his country in this war, 
b t also in World War I. BARRATT O'HARA 
h s always had an intense interest in our 
n ighboys to the south. As a boy, he ac-
e Irma-hied an American expedition 
lob was marking a route`through Nic-
a agna for an interoceanic canal. He 
a ? went with a Smithsonian Institu-
t in party exploring the jungles of Cen-
t al America and was with a U.S. expe-
? tion sent to help settle a boundary dis-
p te between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
t the age of 15, BARRATT O'HARA, then a 
s phomore in high school, enlisted in the 
3 d Michigan Volunteer Infantry and 
1 nded in Cuba only a few days after 
eddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. 
e participated in the seige of Santiago 
d Cuba and later was decorated by the 
epublic of Cuba for services rendered to 
t e people of Cuba d rring their war for 
i dependence. 
Since then, BARRAT'C O'HARA, has spent 
a lifetime in distinguished service to his 
c unt-y and the catme of peace. He is 
C rrently the chairman of an important 
reign Affairs subcommittee and a 
s rong supporter of administration for-
e gn policy. I have noticed something 
ecial about the gentleman from Illinois 
f r. O'HARA]. He never views world 
p oblems in a narrow political or eco-
mic sense. He beleves that the hu-
anitarian aspect is of much greater 
s gniiicance and, for this I salute him. 
Mr. Speaker, we often talk about the 
piria of '76" in regard to America's 
le in world leadership. Well, there is 
so the "spirit of '98,' another milestone 
I the fight for freedom. BARRATT O'HARA 
s bonzes that spirit, Mr. Speaker, and 
I take this occasion to wish him many 
ore long years of kervice in behalf of 
s country and the free world. 
? Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, it is our 
vilege to join here today in paying 
tribute to those who :'ought in the Span-
14h-American War. 
The part that all the brave partici-
nts were to play in this brief but fierce 
?nfil at was triggered by the sinking of 
t e battleship Maine in Manila Harbor, 
this day-67 years ago. This event, 
hich is sometimes called "The Pearl 
arbor of 1898," was to set off a sequence 
o engagements whicn culminated in the 
attle of San Juan Hill, and on the 1st 
y of July 1898 we tee that courageous 
d robust young American, Theodore 
oosevelt, storming up the heights of 
an Juan hill, spurring his men on. 
It was this land action, in support 
o our blockade of Santiago Harbor that 
a complisheel the destruction of Span-
i h aggression and virtually brought 
ut the end of the Spanish-American 
ar. To those young Americans who 
lid CLown life before it had hardly be-
n, to the Rough Riders and their in-
t epid young leader LS they stormed the 
dge.s of San Juan Hill to pave the way 
? victory, and to all our brave men who 
s rved our great cour try in the Spanish-
mean War, we pay tribute. 
But in honoring those who spread the 
aunt of this confict, which brought 
t e United States to its rightful place 
a true champion of liberty, across the 
ges of history in the indelible ink of 
t eir bravery, we would be indeed remiss 
I we failed to honor our own. We have 
I 
? 1 
, 
? 
among us a distinguished gentleman 
whose own brave life reads like the most 
imaginative of adventure stories. I 
speak of that distinguished gentleman 
!from Illinois, the Honorable BARRATT 
O'HARA 
To say that truth is stranger than fic-
tion is, ur derstating annum O'Haaa's 
adventnrot s life. His brave experiences 
took hin through that rugged segment of 
Ameridan history, the "authors" of 
which we honor today. At the brave 
young age of 15 years, he landed in 
Cuba 3 daas after Teddy Roosevelt and 
his RoUgh Riders had blazed the trail of 
freedore up San Juan Hill and for his 
particioatien in the siege of Santiago 
our colleague was awarded the Order of 
MilitarY Merit in White, by the Republic 
of Cuba, for services rendered to the 
Cuban people in their struggle for in-
dependence from Spanish rule. 
Each of us here knows of the incredi-
ble braver!' and excitement with which 
BARRATT 0 HARA'S life unfolded, and as 
our colleague in this great 'body he rep-
resents to 1 ts not only all that is the best 
and t4 brave in service to our country 
and to hi:. fellowman during times of 
stress, but he has distinguished himself 
among !us for his long and devoted serv-
ice as 4 M?.mber of the Congress of the 
United States. To this brave man we 
pay tribute, and by the honor we pay 
him as' a s imbol of all that is great and 
good Ili our American determination 
to protect and preserve freedom among 
all peoples, we also do honor to those who 
served?as did BARRATT O'HARA?in that 
bloody conflict, the Spanish-American 
War. 
Mr. PA ITEN. Mr. Speaker, it is 
natural and right that our distinguished 
and belovi al colleague from Illinois is 
leading ti e ceremony being observed 
today?commemorating the 67th anni-
versarY of the sinking of the battleship 
Maine. 
BARRhTT O'HARA showed his great 
patriotism courage and love of freedom 
when he was only 15 years old. He was 
then a so ohomore in high school and 
enlisted in the 33d Michigan Volunteer 
Infantry. 
Landing in Cuba 3 days after "Teddy" 
Roosevelt And his famous ''Rough Rid-
ers," he took part in the siege of Santi-
ago de Cuba. 
Later he received the Order of Military 
Merit in White by the Republic of Cuba 
for his skill and valor in Cuba's battle 
for indep ?.ndence. This remarkable, 
versatile and unforgettable man also 
served the United States in World War I. 
So *hen BARRATT O'HARA takes the

edge, experience and authority. He 
knows the horrors of war?but he also 
knows 'of the challenge and responsi-

explosion of that now historic battle-
ship. They were: Frederick L. Jernee, 
William H. Robinson and John H. Vieg-

To honor their service and memory, 
a monument was erected and later ded-
icated on May 3C1, 1899. For years it 
graced the courthouse area in New 
Brunswick, reminding the thousands 
who passed of the sailors' sacrifices. It 
remained there until Middlesex County 
built its new courthouse. A plaque was 
later placed in Buccleugh Park contain-
ing a simple but eloquent tribute. 
On the 67th anniversary of the sink-
ing of the Maine, let us remember the 
bitter and tragic and costly lesson that 
we seem to forget?until perfidy strikes 
again?as it did in 1941: 
That a nation enjoying the serenity 
and security of peace should always be 
aware of the dangers of treachery. 
And that the best deterrent to attack?

courageous and vigilant defense. 
Let us hope?and make sure?that 
our strength remains great, that our 
courage remains indomitable, and that 
our vigilance remains constant and

and land we love so well. 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to join my beloved colleague, 
the Honorable BARRATT O'HARA, of Illi-
nois, in commemorating today the 67th 
anniversary of the sinking of the battle-
ship Maine in Havana Harbor, the event 
which started our war with Spain in 
1898. As a member of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, I am especially interested 
In participating in the observance of this 
important episode in our history because 
the Spanish-American War Veterans, 
who were ,the first uniformed Americans 
to serve overseas, were the founders of 
the VFW. 
In 1898 the United States, motivated 
by the highest principles, fought suc-
cessfully to free the Cuban people from 
Spanish control, and it is, therefore, es-
pecially tragic that we now find the Cu-
bans under Communist domination. In 
contrast to the Spanish-American War, 
we witnessed, in the early days of the 
Kennedy administration, the abortive 
Bay of Pigs invasion, which resulted in 
such an inglorious defeat for Cuban and 
American forces attempting to restore 
independence and freedom to the Cuban 
people. 
May I take this opportunity to com-
mend MY colleague BARRETT O'HARA, the 
only Spanish-American War veteran still 
serving in the Congress and one of the 
founders of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, whose outstanding service in the 
House of Representatives and dedication 
to his responsibilities in the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee are a source of inspira-
tion to all of us. 
_ Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Speaker, the 
sinking of the Maine and the ensuing 
war with Spain marked the emergence 
of the United States as a world power. 
Brief though it was, the Spanish-
American War offered the opportunity 
for a demonstration of American military 
and naval might over a 10,000-mile arc 
/945 
from Cuba's San Juan hill to Manila 
Bay. 
Hitherto concerned principally with its 
own problems, the American Republic, at 
the turn of the century, had projected 
itself, for better of worse, as a force to 
be reckoned with in world affairs. 
Within our own borders the war of 
1898 was a Unifying force. Once more 
men from North and South fought under 
the same flag. The 4th Illinois Volun-
teer Infantry, made up of several Na-
tional Guard companies recruited in cen-
tral Illinois, served in Cuba under the 
command of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, 
who also had been a general in the Civil 
War, on the Confederate side. 
At the time thousands of American 
youth doubtlessly looked upon the war 
with Spain as a glorious military adven-
ture with the idealistic aim of freeing 
the Cuban people from a tyrannical rule, 
rather than as a turning point in Ameri-
can foreign policy. 
No military draft was needed for this 
war. Volunteers rallied to the cause in 
every town and hamlet, echoing the bat-
tle cry, "Remember the Maine." Some, 
like our colleague, the gentleman from 
Illin.ois [Mr. O'HARA] even falsified their 
age to join the colors. Leaving high 
school in Benton Harbor, Mich., at the 
age of 15, he landed in Cuba just 3 days 
after Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough 
Riders. 
Sixty-seven years have passed since 
the sinking of the Maine in Havana Har-
bor on February 15, 1898. Once again a 
tyrannical power has established itself 
on that island 90 miles off the shore of 
the United States, backed up by inter-
national communism, a much more for-
midable foe than the decadent Spanish 
monarchy against which we fought al-
most seven decades ago. 
Each generation in our history has 
been called upon to make sacrifices in 
the cause of the freedoms we hold so 
dear. It is appropriate for us here today 
to honor those who carried our banner 
in the Spanish-American War. This is 
also a good opportunity to pause and re-
member that freedom's job is never done. 
We have young men who right now are 
carrying on the struggle in the jungles 
and in the skies of Vietnam. 
Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, to-
day we commemorate the 67th anniver-
sary of the sinking of the battleship 
Maine in Havana Harbor. Far too little 
attention has been paid to the war with 
Spain that resulted from this tragic event 
and to the heroic men who fought it. 
I am proud to join my distinguished 
colleague from Illinois [Mr. O'HARA], who 
Is, as we all know, the last remaining 
veteran of this conflict serving in Con-
gress, in observing this anniversary. 
The Spanish-Amrican War wao a turn-
ing point in American history. It marked 
America's coming of age as a world power 
dedicated to the preservation of freedom 
around the globe. 
The immediate result of our victory 
was the liberation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, 
and the Philippines from oppressive colo-
nial rule. 
But the ultimate significance of the 
War extends far, beyond even this. It es-
tablished a permanent American pres-

ence In the Pacific committed to the de-
fense of human dignity and liberty. 
All of this was accomplished by a force 
of American fighting men composed en-
tirely of Volunteers?soldiers who, in 
spite of hurried training, insufficient 
supplies and equipment, Eind inadequate 
protection against tropical diseases, won 
a series of brilliant victories on land and 
sea. 
The service these men rendered their 
country?indeed the cause e freedom 
everywhere?could never have been ade-
quately repaid. But to our national 
shame, never in the history of this coun-
try has any army or its soldiers been 
so carelessly treated. 
None of the veterans benefits which we 
have come to regard as the just due of 
American soldiers were provided for the 
veterans of the war with Spain. They 
were mustered out without bonus or 
separation pay. They were given no edu-
cational or vocational training rights. 
They were brought under no pension sys-
tem until 1933, and they were not even 
provided with hospital care for service-
connected disabilities until some 24 years 
after the end of the conflict. 
The fact that many of these wrongs 
were ultimately corrected was due in 
large measure to the efforts of the Veter-
ans of Foreign Wars, an organization 
which was founded by veterans of the 
war with Spain. Their campaign to ob-
tain justice for the veterans, of this war 
has made a significant contribution to 
the welfare of the veterans of all our 
conflicts, 
So, this February 15 is not only an an-
niversary of a great national loss; it also 
marks the beginning of the modern era 
in American life. It serves as a reminder 
of how much we owe to our young men 
in uniform. 
Mr. DADDARIO. Mr. Speaker, we 
celebrate today a mournful anniversary 
of an event which brought this Nation 
into war. We celebrate as well, the 
valiant and brave spirit of the men who 
undertook to defend our flag in that 
conflict. 
It began with the sudden explosion on 
board a battleship, and the American 
people then took up the battlecry: "Re-
member the Maine." To those who 
served, and especially to our gallant col-
league from Illinois, we owe our tributes 
this day. 
I sought to recall, when I was consider-
ing this memorial, the story of that 
battleship, and so I asked and received 
this following brief account, of an hour 
we must all have studied: 
THE 67TH ANNIVERSARY OF TFIE LOSS OF TUE 
BATTLESHIP "MAINE" 
The U.S. battleship Maine left the fleet at 
Key West on January 25, 1898, and proceeded 
to Havana, Cuba. The Maine, rated as a 
battleship of the second class, carried four 
10-inch guns, two in the forward and two in 
the after turret. six 6-inch guns, and a num-
ber of 6- and 1-pounders. Her commander 
was Capt. C. D. Sigsbee, and there were 328 
men on her rolls in addition to a regular 
complement of officers. 
The night of February 15, 1898, was hot and 
sultry. The Maine had swung around to an 
unusual position at the buoy to which she 
had been assigned by the Spanish port of& 
dela; she had happened to take the position 
2613 
she would have adopted had there been an 
intention to shell the harbor forts. Such 
was never her intention. 
The usual routine was observed. The chief 
engineer reported his department secure: 
the various petty officers reported their store-
rooms secure. Eight o'clock lights and galley 
fires were reported out, and the ship's lieu-
tenant commander reported to the captain 
that everything was secure. At 9, the offi-
cer of the deck mustered the watch, and 
made sure the men knew their stations in 
the event of an alarm. The captain was 
writing in his cabin. Most of the men were 
asleep. 
At 40 minutes past 9 o'clock, the battleship 
Maine, exploding, rose up out of Havana Har-
bor in a burst of fire and smoke. The detona-
tion shook Havana from one side to another. 
A rain of debris and the bodies of dead and 
wounded men fell back into the waters of the 
bay. Two hundred and fifty-four lives were 
lost that night, seven of the wounded later 
died, and many more of the wounded were 
crippled for life. 
A Member of this House shortly afterward 
spoke thus of them: "No foe had ever chal-
lenged them. The world can never know 
how brave they were. They never knew de-
feat; they never shall. Meanwhile a patient 
and patriotic people, enlightened by the les-
sons of our history, remembering the woes of 
war, both to the vanquished and victorious, 
are ready for the,truth and ready for their 
duty." 
Now, as then, Americans "Remember the 
Maine." 
Mr. MAHON. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to commend my able and good friend, 
the distinguished gentleman from Illi-
nois [Mr. O'HARA.] for again taking note 
of this special anniversary occasion. 
I believe it was President Kennedy who 
said that a knowledge of the past pre-
pares us for the crisis of the present and 
the challenge of the future. The Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars of the United 
States, founded, as the gentleman has 
said, by the Spanish War Veterans, has 
contributed beyond measure to the 
strength and security of these beloved 
United States and to the promotion 
among our people of a high sense of 
patriotism and devotion to national duty. 
So I take pleasure in joining in this 
public note of the good work of 
the Spanish War Veterans and the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars and of the 
gentleman from Illinois in taking the 
leadership in bringing this to the atten-
tion of the House and the country. I 
felicitate the gentleman and wish him 
the continued privilege. 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, today, 
In the midst of international turmoil, we 
pause to recall another moment, imme-
diately preceding the turn of the cen-
tury, when our Nation, then as now, 
stood face to face with both violence 
and destiny. 
Just as we, today, view with shock and 
alarm the aggressive and destructive pol-
icies of Red China and the Vietcong, so, 
67 years ago, Americans were shocked 
and alarmed by the outrageous policies 
of royal Spain. From the close of the 
Civil War through the 1870's, 1880's, and 
1890's, Spanish and American shipping 
engaged in the fiercest kind of com-
mercial rivalry. Moreover, from 1868 
to 1878 the Spanish Government en-
deavored, unsuccessfully, to put down 
rebellion on the island of Cuba, knowing 
full well, as they did so, that the Amer-

ican people wanted Cuba to be free. 
Consequently, when the war for Cuban 
independence was revived, in 1895, the 
Spanish authorities regarded the United 
States as a party to the act, in spirit if 
not in deed. 
With all this in the background, the 
American Government endeavored, 
nonetheless, to keep the peace with 
Spain and, in January, 1898, the second-
class battleship Mzine was ordered from 
Key West to Havana on a friendly visit. 
For 3 weeks the ship lay. moored in Ha-
Vaila, Harbor. Then, on February 15, at 
9:40 p.m., two explosions rocked the har-
bor, and the Maine was blown sky high. 
Two hundred and sixty Americans gave 
their lives in the tragedy, and virtually 
the next moment, the United States and 
Spain were at war. 
The sinking of the battleship Maine 
set in motion a series of events which 
catapulted this Nation to the front rank 
of world power. It immediately resulted 
in war with Spain, thereby testing for the 
first time the mett!e of American men in 
battle on foreign soil, fighting a wholly 
different variety o manifest destiny. 
The consequences of that war are still 
with us. And the bravery and sense of 
adventure which characterized our troop 
forces in that war form a memorable 
part of our national heritage. 
With the 67th arniversary of the sink-
ing of the' Maine, it is appropriate that 
we contemplate this period in American 
life, the turn of the century, for I think 
It is full of meaning and pregnant with 
lessons which today yearns for a closer 
hearing. 
Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI. Mr. Speak-
er, 07 years ago tor ight, on February 15, 
1893, at 9:40 p.m., 266 American service-
men lost their lives in defense of free-
dom when the battleship Maine was 
blown up in Cuba's Havana Harbor. 
Sixty-seven years ago--this was before 
most of the Members of this great body 
were even born. To most Americans 
today, unfortunately, this event is noth-
ing but a dimly recollected Passage in a 
high school American history book, an 
event which caused a war that was over 
in less than 3 rr.onths. Names like 
Capt. Charles Sig sbee, Gen. Fitzhugh 
Lee, Chickamauga and San Juan Hill 
stir vague memories, perhaps, but bring 
no feelings of pride, or anger, or grief. 
But 67 years ago, "Remember the 
Maine" was the rat ying cry of a nation, 
battle cry of an army, the victory cry of 
freedom. It was the "Remember the 
Alamo" of later years, the "Remember 
Pearl Harbor" of earlier years. Five 
weeks after the Maine was sunk, the 
President issued a call for 125,000 volun-
teers. More than 1 million took up this 
call to arms, and answered. And these 
en were volunteers--they served long-
er than the boys of World War I, and at 
one-half the pay. Their death losses 
ere, percentagewise, six times those of 
e World War I soldiers. They received 
one of the insurance benefits, separa-
ion pay or pensicns that subsequent 
eterans have received. And these men 
olunteered, rememoer, in the days be-
ore there was a compulsory draft law. 
hey were poorly fed and poorly 
quipped and poorly organized. Yet 
theie men, representing this country, 
never lost a battle, never suffered a re-
vel*, never retreated once. This war 
has ,gore down in history as a relatively 
"minor and easy" one, because we won 
so quickly. But gentlemen, we were 
fighting Spain?a nation that at that 
time was considered to be one of the 
four gr e at national powers of the world. 
And indeed, our victory there resulted 
in More than an assurance of continued 
pea* and freedom in the Western Hem-
isphere. It mended the rift caused by 
the Civil War. Once more American 
boys, bcth northern and southern, were 
united in a cause, fighting side-by-side 
in defense of liberty. And the victory 
paved the way for the construction of the 
Panama Canal, which every nation has 
since benefited from. We let the rest of 
the World know that the United States 
of America was now a power to be reck-
oned with, a power that would not idly 
stand 133- while a strong nation oppressed 
a weaker one. And now, 67 years later, 
the Wor: d still knows this, for many of 
our boy e still lie in faraway places like 
Guain E-nd Okinawa and France, and 
across the Potomac in Arlington, boys 
who like those back in 1898, died-preserv-
ing the :ights of other peace-loving na-
tions, ar.d other freedom-loving peoples. 
The lessons we learned in the Spanish-
American. War saved the life of many 
an lime :Jean soldier in World Wars I 
and 11. 
So, as we drift off to sleep tonight, gen-
tlemen, tet us remember that ours is a 
better A nerica today, a stronger Amer-
ica tecia:r, and ours is a better world to-
day, a m ore peaceful and free world to-
day, :bec ause of the brave battles of a 
brave country 67 years ago, and let us 
say R prayer for those 266 men who died 
on the bE ttleship Maine. 
Mr. O'ElARA of Michigan. Mr. Speak-
er, 67 years ago in the spring of 1898, 
Americans trooped off to war. They 
went, into that war with a slogan "Re-
member the Maine" ringing from their 
lips. 
Today Mr. Speaker, we mark the 67th 
anniVers try of the tragic event that gave 
birth: to that phrase. While moored in 
the waters of Havana Harbor, the battle-
ship 43faine was rocked by an explosion 
and sun c and the United States was 
plunged :nto a war with Spain. 
That February 15, Mr. Speaker, was 
a tragic Ind fateful day for the sinking 
of the Maine was an act of destruction 
and deat a. 
A 'jays I court of inquiry convened by 
Rear' Ad n. Montgomery Sicard found: 
The deszuction of the Maine occurred at 
9:40 p.m. -3n the 15th day of February, 1898, 
in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, she being 
at the time moored to the same buoy to 
which she had been taken upon her arrival. 
There war o two explosions of a distinctly dif-
ferent character, with a very short but dis-
tinct tnte:wal between them, and the for-
ward part of the ship was lifted to a marked 
degree at the time of the first explosion. The 
first efplohlon was more ;n the nature of a 
report likf that of a guts while the second 
explosion ?vas more open, prolonged, and of 
greater volume. This second explosion was, 
in the opinion of the court, caused by the 
partia1 exr lasion a two or more of the for-
ward magazines of the Maine 
The court finds that the loss of the Maine 
Approved For Releas 
Februcify t15 
on the occasion named was not in any re-
spect due to fault or negligence on the part 
of the officers or members of the crew a 
said vessel. In the opinion of the court, the 
Maine was destroyed by the explosion of a 
submarine mine, which caused the partial 
explosion of two or more of the forward mag-
azines. The court has been unable to ob-
tain evidence fixing the responsibility for 
the destruction of the Maine upon any per-
son or persons. 
The Spanish Government had a dif-
ferent opinion, on March 22, 1898, its 
naval board of inquiry found: 
That the important facts connected with 
the explosion in its external appearance at 
every moment of its duration having been 
described by witnesses, and the absence of 
all circumstances which necessarily accom-
pany the explosion of a torpedo having been 
proved by these witnesses and experts, it can 
only be honestly asserted that the catastro-
phe was due to internal causes. 
The list of the Maine dead covers three 
pages printed in very small type. On 
that tragic night 67 yens ago, 254 lives 
were lost, 7 wounded men died a short 
time later, and many of the wounded 
suffered from the effects of their in-
juries for the rest of their lives. 
Spanish-American War Veterans have 
traditionally observed February 15 with 
appropriate ceremonies. They have 
cause for great pride in their own com-
pletely voluntary service. There was 
no draft in their war. Since serving 
their country Sc) well as patriotic young 
men, their ranks have grown thin. 
Mr. Speaker, on this anniversary of 
the loss of the Maine, we salute the vet-
erans of the Spanish-American War and 
pay our tribute to the memory? of their 
comrades. 
Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, 67 years 
ago today the Nation was horrified by the 
news that the Maine had been sunk in 
Havana Harbor. On a peaceful Tuesday 
evening the great battleship was torn 
apart by a terrific explosion that cost the 
lives of 260 officers and men. 
The Maine, a second-class battleship 
built at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, was 
launched on November 18, 1890, and 
commissioned on September 17, 1895. 
Although she was small compared to 
modern warships, in her day the Maine 
was formidable. She was 324 feet long 
and 57 feet at the beam, and had a dis-
placement of 6,650 tons. Her armament 
consisted of four 10-inch guns, six 6-
inch breech-loading rifles, seven 6-
pounder rapid-fire guns, eight 1-pound-
ers, and four Gstling machineguns. In 
addition, she had tubes for four torpe-
does. 
Hostilities had broken out again in 
Cuba in 1895 after a decade of relative 
tranquility. As the situation grew stead-
ily worse, the American people were 
moved by a deep sympathy for the Cu-
bans who were engaged in a long struggle 
for liberty. On January 24, 1898, the 
Maine was ordered to Havana, ostensibly 
"to resume the friendly naval visits at 
Cuban ports." The actual purpose was 
to protect U.S. citizens who might be 
endangered by the increasing friction be-
tween the United States and Spain. 
At 11 a.m. on January 25, the Maine 
steamed in past Morro Castle. The cus-
tomary salutes were fired and the Maine

proceeded into the harbor and dropped 
anchor where the harbormaster directed. 
A trained investigator might have de-
tected an undercurrent of feeling, but 
official calls were made and the social 
amenities were observed. For 3 weeks 
no untoward incident occurred. 
Then, at 9:40 p.m. on February 15, 
two explosions threw parts of the ship 
240 feet in the air and illuminated the 
whole harbor. 
Reports of the disaster were received 
In the United States with consternation. 
Accusations against- the Spaniards were 
freely expressed in certain American 
'newspapers. Most Americans held Spain 
responsible, although the evidence was 
never sufficient to fix the blame officially. 
Some 2 months later came the Spanish-
American War which was to mark the 
collapse of the Spanish Empire and the 
emergence of the United States as a 
world power, 
Referring to the slogan, "Remember 
the Maine," Captain Sigsbee, the tom-
Mander of the ship, later had this to say: 
Therefore I conceive the motto, "Remember 
the Maine" used as a war cry would not have 
been Justifiable. Improperly audied, the 
motto ? * * savors too much of re-
venge * * * but it may be used in an en-
tirely worthy sense. During the recent war 
with Spain about 75 men were killed and 
wounded in the U.S. Navy. Only 17 were 
?killed. On board the Maine 252 men were 
killed outright and 8 died later?nearly 15 
times as many as were killed in the U.S. Navy 
by the Spanish land and naval forces during 
the entire war. In the way that the men of 
the Maine died and suffered there was enough 
of the heroic to provide a sound foundation 
for the motto, "Remember the Maine." 
It is in this way that we, in our ob-
servance here today, seek to "Remember 
the Maine." 
Mr. MULThat. Mr. Speaker? 67 years 
ago these headlines flashed across my 
home State of New York, "Maine Blown 
to Atoms in Havana Harbor: Over 100 
of Her Crew Killed. Three-million-dol-
lar Battleship Destroyed by a Terrific and 
Mysterious Explosion While Her Men Are 
Sleeping." 
? Today, on the anniversary of this dis-
aster, we remember that it was this news 
which ignited the sympathies of the 
American people and which pushes a 
long series of events toward a climax. 
On April 25, 1898, the United States de-
clared war against Spain and the Span-
ish-American War began. And it began, 
said President McKinley, "in the name of 
humanity, in the name of civilization, in 
behalf of endangered American inter-
ests." . 
The actual cause of the destruction of 
the Maine remains now as it was then a 
?mystery. No conclusive proof has ever 
been produced which could definitely fix 
the blame in the tragedy. But in 1898, 
as the news spread that 269 American 
officers and crewmen had lost their lives 
and as some newspapers freely accused 
Spanish agents of responsibility, public 
'opinion, already in strong and open sym-
pathy with Cuban patriots, crystallized 
Into the slogan: _"Remember the 
Maine." 
For years, the Cuban people had 
sought to throw off Spanish misrule and 
oppression. They had engaged in a he-
roic but unsuccessful effort for independ-
ence between 1868 and 1878, the Ten 
Years' War. During that revolution the 
American people, though strongly sym-
pathetic to the Cuban cause, had only 
given expressions of support. 
But in 1895, when revolution broke out 
anew against the continuing corruption 
of the Spanish administration, the peo-
ple of the United States showed increas-
ing alarm. From the beginning, the 
struggle in Cuba took on aspects of fe-
rocity that horrified Americans. Vivid 
accounts were reported to the public in 
a theretofore unprecedented era of 
journalistic coverage. 
The extreme methods of coercion used 
by Gen. Valeriano Weyler?or "Butcher" 
Weyler, as he soon came to be called by 
the press?were well known. Americans 
watched helplessly as he, in an attempt 
to stamp out the Cuban guerrilla forces, 
ordered the entire civilian population of 
certain areas confined to concentration 
camps. There, they died by the thou-
sands, victims of disease, malnutrition, 
and atrocities. 
Against this background, it is not sur-
prising that when the battleship Maine 
exploded a white-hot wave of anger 
gripped the American people. Within a 
few short months, 1 million of the young 
men of this country had volunteered to 
fight side by side with the Cuban patriots 
until the despotism of Spain could be re-
moved from that island. 
There are some who seek to detract 
from the American contribution to the 
Cuban cause, but, as an editorial from 
the Havana Post of 1959 states: 
There can be no successful mutilation of 
the history of Cuban and U.S. allied coopera-
tion in the war of Independence. * * One 
has only to see those names on the bronze 
plaques on San Juan Hill, just outside Santi-
ago, to know the extent of the aid given the 
cause by the United States. 
On those plaques, one finds inscribed 
the names of Americans from every State of 
the Union who gave for the cause of Cuba 
the most that any man can give for any 
cause. They gave their lives. 
Today, we pay tribute to the idealistic 
and courageous young men who fought 
for and gave their lives for the freedom 
and independence of a neighboring peo-
ple. We pay special tribute, also to the 
valor and the patience of the Cuban peo-
ple who have found it necessary to strug-
gle almost continually over the years for 
their liberties. 
And today, a black cloud is again 
heavy over this beautiful Caribbean is-
land. Its people again know the horrors 
of tyranny. Again, they are showing 
courage and heroism in their struggle 
against it. Today, as we remember the 
Maine of 67 years ago, let us also re-
member the present. 
Mr. PUCINSKI. Mr. Speaker, 
throughout our history, America has 
responded to acts of aggression with a 
special courage, decisiveness and will to 
succeed which have become legendary 
in the annals of the defense of liberty. 
Regardless of the strength of our op-
ponents, those who have challenged us 
have been defeated or deterred. We have 
often succeeded in making allies of 
former enemies; individuals and govern-
ments wise enough to join in the ancient 
and enduring struggle for peace and 
liberty. 
2615 
America, itself, symbolizes many things 
to the people of the earth. Of all these 
symbols, perhaps our greatest strength 
lies in our ability to sustain countless ir-
responsible acts and errors of statesman-
ship with patience and prevailing wis-
dom. However, foolishly unmindful of 
our determination to defend our freedom, 
other nations have on occasion mis-
judged our patience for cowardice and 
indeeision. 
Such an error in judgment led Spain 
into believing we would not defend our 
interests in the Carribbean. On Febru-
ary 15, 1898, the Battleship Maine was 
sunk in Havana Harbor. And before the 
world had time to digest the news, the 
United States had reacted swiftly, surely 
and with great strength. Our war with 
Spain involved some of the bloodiest and 
most individually gallant sacrifices in our 
history, yet they were in our American 
tradition and, in the end, our just cause 
prevailed. 
Although some 67 years have passed, 
we have continued to demonstrate our 
strength and ow determination never to 
yield when the price is the loss of liberty 
for ourselves or our allies. Those in 
other nations who would wish us ill had 
best be reminded of our willingness to 
bear any burden to secure liberty for all 
those men who seek it and who will join 
in fighting alongside us to obtain it. 
The men who fought at San Juan Hill, 
at Bunker Hill, at Pork Chop Hill earned 
us the right to live in peace with one an-
other and the world. We would do them 
a grave injustice if we failed in our his-
toric defense of the self-determination 
all men seek in their hearts. 
On this 67th anniversary of the sink-
ing of the Maine, it is an honor to stand 
with my colleagues and fellow citizens in 
commemorating the heroism and the 
love of justice which have made our 
country the bulwark of freedom through-
out the world.

Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Speaker, the

forcefully the hard and bitter truth that 
our country is engaged in war in Viet-
nam. 
It has been apparent for some time 
that our Government's stake in the say-

e straggle in Vietnam is a major one, 
w th more than 23,000 American officers 
d men engaged in assisting the forces 
Oi South Vietnam, et a daily cost' in 
e cess of $2 million. 
On February 6, Vietcimg guerrilla 
farces entered an American air base at 
P eiku and blasted planes, helicopters, 
a d barracks on the base, leaving 8 of 
o r enlisted men dead and more than 125 
uneled. 
The following day, the President of the 
itecl States ordmed an air strike 
ainst military targets in North Viet-
and fighter bombers from three of 
r carriers were involved in action more 
an 50 miles north Cf the 17th parallel, 
ich divides North and South Vietnam. 
The President proceeded to order the 
thdrawal of 1,800 American depend-
e- ts from Vietnam, and declared on be-
h lf of our Government: 
We have no choice row but to clear the 
d cks and make absaately clear our con-
t ued determination tc hack South Vietnam 
I its fight to maintair its independence. 
In the days which have followed that 
p esidential announcement, Vietcong 
f rces have engaged in another savage 
a tack upon quarters occupied by Ameri-
c n forces, inflicting heavy casualties , 
a d bringing the total number of Ameri-
c ns dead by Vietcong action to nearly 
310. 
In response to the enemy attack of 
ebruary 9, 160 planes of the United

ords of this Nation's "continued deter-
ination." 
HOIVIEFRONT QUESTIONS 
In the wake of an unquestioned escala-
t on of military acti-n during the past 
eek, many Americans were asking 
s arching questions--both publicly and 
? rivately?concerning the course of the 
ar. 
With regard to the central aim of our 
resence in Vietnam, the President has 
1 ft no room for reasonable doubt. He 
as said publicly that he considers it 
ssential" to American interests to de-
t the Communist aggression against 
outh Vietnam. He has declared his 
c.nvition that our failure there "would 
?nvince every nation in south Asia that 
must now bow to Communist terms 
survive." 
Notwithstanding these strong words, 
ith their clear commitment of U.S. 
?restige as declared by the Nation's Chief 
xecutive, the charge is now heard in 
ore than one quar ter that the extent 
nd validity of that commitment remain 
ncertain and ill-defined. 
In the New York Times for Sunday, 
ebru.ary 14, 1965, both Arthur Krock 
nd James Reston have voiced their pro-
t st over White House failure to "make 
t ings clear" and to advise of "plans to 
eet whatever contingencies may arise

from tise new U.S. policy of immediate 
and in4reasingly powerful military re-
prisal."' 
Mr. Krock and Mr. Reston were chiefly 
concerned with the absence of informa-
tion and knowledge at home concerning 
the depth and breadth of our Vietnam 
commi4ner.t. 
Other cc mpetent observers, however, 
have been even more concerned about 
the effect of uncertainty in the Commu-
nist world. 
Writing in the Washington Post for 
February 14, 1965, Donald S. Zagoria?
in an article entitled, "Communists Doubt 
Our Will in Vietnam"?reported as fol-
lows: 
The Comitunists have long believed that 
the 'United States would not have the pa-
tience ok will to stick out the war and re-
cent stitten ents by influential Americans 
calling or nagotiation and/or withdrawal al-
most chrtainly increased their optimism. 
They have Ill along eagerly seized on any 
American at ttements urging negotiation and 
withdratval. In the past 8 months, several 
promineart American Senators, columnists, 
and nevispa >ors have called for negotiations 
and, in the absence of a clear-cut policy, 
rumors dev ;loped that the administration 
was in fawn of negotiation. 
All this doubtless strongly reinforced the 
Communist belief that victory in South Viet-
nam wah close at hand. 
In the c pinion of Mr. Zagoria, "two 
bombing artacks will not suffice" as suf-
ficient prem sure "to bring a reluctant Ho 
Chi Minh to the conference table." 
They will not so easily give up at the con-
ference tabla what they have fought so hard 
and so loin; on the battlefield to achieve, 
and at a time when final victory seems near?
Mr. ei,g-cTia concludes. 
A memt er of Columbia University's 
Researeh I utitute on Communist Affairs 
and the au thor of "The Sino-Soviet Con-
flict, 1956-61," Mr. Zagoria has impres-
sive ceede -itials as a commentator on 
Coenmunis, thinking. His conclusion 
that tir Communists question our will 
and de ern dilation in Vietnam may well 
provide the key to understanding of Viet-
cong p6lic3- . 
Mr. i?,os roe Drummond, also writing 
in the IVV, aehington Post on February 14, 
shares the view that American policy 
statem'ents "have not persuaded the 
Asian Communists the United States 
really belie yes that turning back the ag-
gression against South Vietnam is es-
sential Cr that we intend to do what-
ever is necessary to see that this aggres-
sion will nyt be defeated." 
The rhason is?
Writes Mr. Drummond?
that action, not words, make policy believ-
able to the enemy. Our actions in Vietnam 
have ncit equaled our words. We have treat-
ed this was as though winning it were essen-
tial to Sou .h Vietnam but not essential to 
the United States. We have for the most 
part porn-tilted North Vietnam to practice 
aggression Ind enjoy immunity. Secretary 
Rusk ohce gave a somber cease-and-desist-
or-else *tarring. When it was not heeded, we 
did nothing. 
Up lintf the last week, Mr. Speaker, 
that was more or less the situation, and 
the pl4in truth about the impression 
which we had created in Asia concerning 
our porcy in Vietnam. We were send-
Approved For Release 
ing thousands of men, and spending mil-
lions of dollars, but we were not con-
vincing the Communists of our inten-
tion to do everything necessary to defeat 
aggression in Vietnam. 
CHANGE 3N DIRECTION 
Now, in the words of Mr. Drummond, 
"something more is being done." 
We have undoubtedly convinced the 
Communists in North Vietnam of our 
intention and readiness to hit, and hit 
very hard indeed, when American mili-
tary forces in Vietnam are attacked di-
rectly by the Vietcong. We have made 
it very clear that North Vietnam is not 
a privileged sanctuary, and we have dem-
onstrated that our forces are not afraid 
to cross the 17th parallel. 
Without question, we have ,also im-
pressed the Communists of Asia with the 
quality and effectiveness of American air 
forces?both land and sea\-based?and of 
the rising quality and effectiveness of the 
air force of South Vietnam. 
Finally, and notwithstanding some 
critics, President Johnson has undoubt-
edly rallied the support of an overwhelm-
ing majority of his fellow citizens in sup-
port of his policies of the past week. 
In the Congress, leaders of bath parties 
have spoken out strongly in support of 
the air strikes on North Vietnam. 
In the press, editorial comment across 
the Nation has generally approved, and 
most have agreed with the Seattle Times 
that the President "has the overwhelm-
ing support of the American people." 
Even Mr. Reston, in his largely critical 
column, declared that "very few people 
here question the necessity for a limited 
expansion of the war by U.S. bombers 
into Communist territory." 
And yet, while there is general agree-
ment that the situation in Vietnam has 
entered a radically new phase, I have 
not found a single authority who believes 
the bombing attacks of last week will re-
sult in early conclusion of the long and 
bloody conflict?either by military vic-
tory or the conference table. 
On the contrary, Mr. Zagoria is em-
phatic in the belief that "persistent and 
heavy pressure" must be brought to bear 
against the North, and offers the view 
that "positive incentives"?both eco-
nomic and diplomatic?should also be 
offered as an alternative to widespread 
destruction in North Vietnam. 
Mr. Drummond is convinced that we 
must make it clew: that we are prepared 
to participate in joint air strikes with 
the forces of South Vietnam in response 
to Vietcong attacks upon Vietnamese 
forces, as well as in response to attacks 
upon Americans. Such a willingness is 
indispensable to our relations with South 
Vietnam, and would make even more 
clear our determination to halt Commu-
nist aggression in that country. 
The Drummond view on this last point 
is shared by Rowland Evans and Robert 
Novak, writing from on the scene in 
Saigon, who say our relationship with 
Vietnamese forces in the field is at stake 
in the decision to use our planes to coun-
ter attacks upon the forces of South 
Vietnam. 
Unless our "forward strategy" of the 
past week is "continued and intensified," 
in the view of these Saigon observers,

3134 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ?SENATE February 19 
tomers this extremely important question: 
Would we, and our country as a Whole, be 
better off if the railroads (and, possibly, the 
other public carriers) were nationalized? 
On the shippers' answer to that question, 
rather than on the contentions of a group of 
sulking and possibly vindictive labor union 
leaders, the Federal lawmakers should base 
their decision for or against nationalization, 
if and when proposed legislation is intro-
duced in Congress to implement the recent 
agreement, by a "unanimous majority" of 
the members of the Railway Labor Execu-
tives' Association, to press for Government 
ownership Of the U.S. railroads. 
In a Federal administration that in more 
than one way has revealed pro-labor-union 
leanings, any proposal that has the back-
ing of several labor organizations must be 
regarded as "strongly backed." Por that rea-
son, Traffic World proceeded, shortly after 
the REBA announcement of advocacy of rail-
road nationalization, to mail questionnaires 
to industrial and commercial traffic execu-
tives on the Traffic World subscription list, 
asking them to state their views on the rail-
road nationalization issue. We were a bit 
reluctant to send out this questionnaire be-
cause we realize that many good citizens are 
generally hostile to the idea of filling out 
questionnaires. However, we were at the 
same time hopeful that the questionnaire 
returns would be numerous enough to re-
flect adequately the attitude of a substantial 
majority of the principal transportation-
service users of this country toward sub-
stitution of public ownership for private 
Ownership of the American railroads. 
None of us in the editorial department 
of this magazine, not even the editorial as-
sociate who promoted and devised the ques-
tionnaire, dared to predict that the percent-
age of questionnaire returns would be half 
as large as it actually was. The question-
naires were mailed to 5,500 of our subscrib 
era. The morning of February 11 the return 
totaled 2,467?and more were received wit 
each mail delivery. Checking of the answers 
restealed the significant fact that more than 
'96 percent of the friends pf Traffic World who 
filled out and returned the questionnaires 
were firmly opposed to the placing of the rail-
roads in the Government's hands. All but a 
few of these respondents (as shown in our 
report on the questionnaire returns, on other 
pages of this issue) stated explicitly their 
reasons for opposing nationalization of the 
rail carriers. 
To all the Traffic World readers who re-
Asponded so promptly and helpfully in this 
referendum by mail we say, "Thank you very 
much. We feel sure that if and when the 
nationalization issue is brought out into the 
open on Capitol Hill, the opinions you have 
' expressed, anonymously but clearly and 
forcefully, will help the legislators to make 
the right decision." 
In a speech in Cleveland, February 4, Dean 
George P. Baker, of the Harvard Graduate 
School of Business Administration, who is 
chairman" of the TAA board of directors, 
' specified five good reasons for junking the 
nationalization proposal which, he said, 
would be "a national disaster if /imple-
mented." 
These would be the disastrous results of 
nationalization of the railroads, Dean Baker 
-asserts: 
1. Government monopoly would be substi-
tuted for the private competition upheld and 
advocated by President Johnson and the late 
President Kennedy. 
2. The Cost (to the taxpayers) of national-
/ging the railroads Would he at least $50 bil-
flon, and the taxes now paid by the railroads 
would be lost to the Government. 
3, Bargaining issues in dispute between 
rail labor unions and the owner-manager of 
the railroads (the Government) would be 
Converted into political footballs. 
4. By nationalizing an industry that has 
operated long and successfully as a part of 
the American private enterprise system, we 
would be making a false confession of weak-
ness of our capitalistic system. 
5. Nationalization of one large industry 
would be likely to cause public indifference 
to, or acceptance of, proposals for nationali-
zation of other modes of transportation and 
other key industries, and the United States 
would be converted from a capitalistic to a 
socialistic country. 
In May 1963, Eugene Landis, the director 
of transportation of the International 
Minerals & Chemicals Corp., made a speech 
in Jacksonville in which he satirically en-
visioned some transportation news stories 
that might be published in 1970 if the rail-
roads were to be nationalized. He read an 
imaginary "dispatch" about issuance by the 
Director General of the Federal Railway Sys-
tem of a temporary order making a 12-hour 
demurrage rule effective immediately, "be-
cause of the backup of train shipments at 
the east coast ports." Other imaginary 
"dispatches" that he read pertained to estab-
lishment of a new rate structure "based on 
the 435 newly, created Federal Railway dis-
tricts"; the subsequent cancellation of that 
"module rate system" after a flood of pro-
tests against it; a critical car shortage, and 
ultimate denationalization of the railroads, 
in order to clear up the mess resulting from 
Federal ownership. 
Mr. Landis and many other traffic execu-
tives and defenders of private enterprise aver 
that Government ownership of the for-hire 
carrier ar would be inefficient and costly. 
They and we are in hearty agreement with 
the opinion written by one of the respond-
ents in our referendum by mail:

BA FIDEL CASTRO?AD-
DRESS B MISS JUANITA CASTRO 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, early last 
Year the world was startled by the news 
that Fidel Castro's sister, Miss Juanita 
Castro, had defected to Mexico, and 
that her first action was to go on the 
air to denounce the Castro regime for 
what it had done to the Cuban people 
and for what it planned to do to the 
Peoples of the Americas. 
Since her defection, Juanita Castro 
has been an indefatigable speaker 
against Castro tyranny. No one has 
warned more eloquently or more stub-
bornly than she against the danger of 
doing nothing about Castro. 
In a speech which Miss Castro deliv-
ered before the Los Angeles World Af-
fairs Council, on February 8, she made 
several statements which I wish to call 
to the attention of the Senate. 
About Fidel, Juanita Castro said the 
following: 
After studying Fidel closely, I am sure 
that we are in the presence of another Hitler. 
If Fidel had at his disposal the enormous 
resources which were Hitler's, humanity 
would already be deeply entrenched in 
world war III. Fidel's hatred is aimed not 
only against the United States but also 
against all of his fellow men. It does not 
matter to him that he may bring catastro-
phe to the nations of the hemisphere so 
long as he is able to satisfy his brutal am-
bition of conquering and dominating the 
continent. 
About Fidel Castro's plans for Latin 
America, Jaunita Castro said that she 
had heard her brother utter these words: 
me out even." 
If we train but 300 men to act as group 
leaders in each country, we will have enough 
to explode the Socialist revolution volcano 
in Latin America. If to this we add the 
militant and/or nonmilitant Marxist-Lenin-
ists in all Latin America who will act as a 
fifth column, as well as the other elements 
which, through contagion, economic, or social 
frustration, political ambition?either left or 
right?are conditioned to join an insurrec-
tional movement, Soviet rockets will not be 
needed in the takeover of the entire conti-
nent. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the complete text of Miss Cas-
tro's statement be printed in the RECORD, 
at the conclusion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SPEECH PRONOUNCED BY MISS JUANITA CASTRO 
ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1965, IN Los AN-
GELES, CALIF., BEFORE MEMBERS OF Los AN-
GELES WORLD AFFAIRS Comccu. 
Distinguished members of the Los Angeles 
Council for World Affairs, ladies and gentle-
men, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity 
you have given me to come to this meeting 
and speak of the heart breaking facts which 
my country is facing. I am also taking ad-
vantage of this occasion to present my per-
sonal testimony on the now historical trea-
son which has been perpetrated against my 
homeland, a treason which continues even 
now trying to stamp out all democratic forces 
on the island of Cuba as well as those of all 
other nations of this American Continent. 
The United States, indirectly, is the very spe-
cial target of this carefully conceived action. 
The full realization of the goals of my 
brother, Fidel, came to me very slowly while 
I was still in Cuba. But, as I watched the 
monstrous plans being put into effect, first 
against defenseless Latin American coun-
tries and then against the United States it-
self, I could not stand the torment which 
took hold of me for I could see the tragic 
destiny which had befallen my country and 
'was now threatening other peaceful and 
trusting peoples. 
I suffered through endless days and nights 
of indescribable anguish. I was only able to 
share my fears with my poor, late mother, 
and her pain was indeed great as she watched 
her sons (and I watched my brothers) drag-
ging our nation to the brink of destruction, 
betraying our people, and preparing to do the 
same to other nations. 
As I listened to their planning and watched 
how things developed and I realized the in-
humanity and treachery which existed, the 
decision that I had to make became extreme-
ly clear. My Christian upbringing certainly 
aided me greatly in making my choice. And 
what were my alternatives? God and my 
country or an aggressive military bloc (such 
as is the Sino-Soviet one). The traditional 
feeling of brotherhood which has always 
existed among all the nations of this con1,1.-
nent is being threatened by a sinister con-
spiracy which flows simultaneously from 
Moscow, Havana and Peiping. From these 
strategic positions the intrinsically perverse 
nature of international communism, which 
was, is and always shall be one and the same, 
regardless of what form it may take or of how 
peculiar circumstances may tend to conceal 
the ultimate goal which is world domination. 
To most, it seems that this goal is being at-
tained through two methods: the Soviet 
Union's coexistence and Red China's violence. 
The target of either one, however, is the 
Christian civilization of democratic coun-
tries. 
I make these statements because I have 
ample and well-founded reasons. I was an 
eyewitness to the facts and plans that sub-
stantiate my conclusions.

e basic thread of complaint running 
t ?ugh the comments of those shippers who 
fa or rail nationalization is the "failure" of 
re, lroad management to provide adequate 
se vice, particuraily to the small shipper. 
is ccsnplaint is expressed in various ways, 
b t the following comm ant from a shipper of 
m nufactured products spending about $9 
Ilion a year for rail service illustrates gen-
e 1 views expressed by those shippers favor-
is: nationalization. 
"It has become increasingly and painfully 
o vious that the manegement of the rail-
^ ds tsinadequate, untrained, and quite un-
til/4)nd to cope with the problems con-
orating it today. 
"During the past several years, there have 
ben signs of desire by railroads to modern-
their management, but these efforts are 
oh too little and too late. Therefore, the 
tuation couldn't be much worse under 
verriment ownership and operation than it 
nd has been?under private operation 
d te,anagementi.' 
"My specific complaint (or, I should say, 
ajor complaint) concerns the fact that the 
ishes and desires of railroad customers (ex-
essions of which are constantly solicited 
railroad sales representatives) are not 
ted upon. There is no consistent evidence 
a desire to run the :7e,iIroacts according to 
e needs and wishes or the custothers. 
hat evidence there is in this area is transi-
ry and sporadic. 
"Furthermore, let us not overlook the fact 
thas despite Much obvious effort on the 
art of railroads in this country to paint a 
in picture?the fact remains that Govern-
No. 33-3 
ment owirsblp and operation of railroads in 
many other coantries (with smiliar density of 
traffic ani similar problems) does work and 
work we.. It accordingly fellows, even 
granting the dreadful inefficiencies, graft, and 
indolence rampant in our Government today, 
that it [nationalization] is worth a try." 
Such viiews run counter to the beliefs ex-
pressed by those shippers who oppose rail 
nationalization. Most (but not all) of these 
shippers ;eel rail management is doing an 
adequate Job or, at least, beginning to do an 
adequate ,job. Most feel that rail service is 
adequate and improving and that Govern-
ment ovvriersnip and operation of the rail 
system wsrulc provide the shipping public 
only with poo 7er service. 
Spannirig virtually all of the wide-ranging 
views of thoss shippers opposed to national-
ization arid offering rail labor a novel sug-
gestion isi th s comment from a shipper of 
building products who spends about $5 mil-
lion a year fcr rail service: 
"As an industrial traffic manager, I feel 
that the .diss dvantages would far outweigh 
the advantages that might be secured 
through hatlonalization of the Nation's rail-
roads. Off hand, the only advantage to the 
shipping: ub .ic that I can possibly see would 
be the e mirstion of strikes and threats of 
strikes. Whi e this problem is serious, there 
is no guarantee that nationalization of the 
railroads! will completely eliminate strikes. 
I note irhat the nationalized ? railroads in 
France risen ly underwent a brief strike. 
"The disadvantages of a state-owned rail-
road system are many and are serious. There 
is ample background for studying the effects 
of national's ad railroad systems. in countries 
all over the 'vorld. In nearly every country, 
these rafIroa i systems operate at a tremen-
dous deficit In this country our own Post 
Office Department is not able to break even 
and conatanly suffers at the hands of pri-
vately owned competitors who must keep 
their chM?ges at or below the Post Office level, 
provide as good or better service, and pay 
taxes. Iri short, there in no reason at all to 
expect that a nationalized railroad system 
would not almost immediately become a 
drain on the general tax income of the Gov-
ernments Nat only will the railroads begin 
to drain: away national tax funds, but, by 
being nationalized, they will destroy sources 
of tax inborn a to State and local governments. 
In som& are: is of the country, acme units of 
local go).1errnaent are heavily dependent upon 
railroad projerty taxes: 
"Once, ths railroads are operated from 
Washin4ton on the basis that there is no 
need to Fattr act traffic, I am fearful that the 
service Will deteriorate badly. Railroad serv-
ice in many parts of the country is extremely 
poor not, but I shudder to think what would 
happen if there were no incentives at all to 
provide [satt.factory service. 
"The nett malization of the Nation's rail-
roads cannet help but lead to the national-
ization Of the inland waterway industry, the 
airlines,: and so on. Will this eventually lead 
to the riationalization of kiddie rides at the 
local park? 
"Unicen management obviously is frus-
trated hy the fact that the number of rail-
road jots has declined over the past 2 years 
and contint es to decline. They also are frus-
tratedecause railroad management appears 
to be s iffening its stand on concessions to 
union employees. This is particularly true 
in those cases where certain employees are 
totally !unnecessary or the work performed 
is not 4ctuldly required. 
"Union nranagement bases its suggestion 
for nationalzation on the premise that the 
current' Owners of the railroads are not look-
ing outlor ;he general interests of the public. 
Inasinrich is the union leaders have recog-
nized this ' sreat fault' of the present_ owners 
of the rail] cads, perhaps they are' prepared 
Approved For Releas 
to undertake to manage railroads more ef-
fectively. I would suggest that the unions 
raise funds among their own members and 
purchase one of the railroads, particularly 
one in the east that is in serious financial 
difficulty. I suggest the eastern part of the 
United States because of the very heavy truck 
competition and so that the new management 
of the railroad would be faced with the prob-
lem of immediately cutting costs and im-
proving service in order to hold on to the last 
remaining bit of traffic now moving by 
railroad. 
"From my remarks, I am sure that you can 
see that at least this industrial traffic man-
ager?and I am sure nearly everyone in my 
position in industry--is very much opposed 
to the nationalization of the railroads." 
Among -those exeautives contacted by 
Traffic World were several Canadian shippers 
Who regularly deal with Canada's nationalized 
railway and its privately owned railway. 
These Canadian views, although not tabu-
lated as part of Traffic World's survey, are 
Interesting in that every Canadian shipper 
expressed opposition to the nationalization 
of U.S. railroads. Illustrating the Canadian 
viewpoint are these comments: 
From a shipper of manufactured products 
spending about $10 million a year for rail 
service: 
"Government control of railways in Great 
13ritain resulted in a worsening financial po-
sition. Government control in Canada in-
volves millions in subsidies yet Canadian 
National Railways continues to show red 
figures." 
From a shipper of petroleum spending 
"some millions" each year for rail service: 
"We are Canadian shippers. The Canadian 
National Railways, our Government-owned 
railway system, has become an efficient, pro-
gressive organization, but due?at least in 
part?to its privately owned competitor, the 
Canadian Pacific Railway." 
To recapitulate 1;he results of Traffic 
World's survey: 
The Nation's professional shippers?cor-
porate executives who deal most directly with 
railroads and, thus, are obviously in the best 
position to judge the merits of railroad na-
tionalization?are emphatically opposed to 
such a step because they believe the Govern-
ment could not provide them with efficient 
service at reasonable cost. Perhaps the ob-
jections of the Nation's professional shippers 
to rail nationalization is best summed up in 
this blunt comment from one of them: 
"It is my belief that one of the worst 
things that could happen to the transporta-
tion system of our country is for the opera-
tion of the railroads to be taken over by the 
Federal Government, 
"I don't believe Uncle Sam could run a 
peanut stand and come out even."

PRIVATELY OWNED TRANSPORT WELL 
DEFENDED 
Users of the services of for-hire carriers 
of freight in this country are certainly bet-
ter qualified than other members of the 
American public to say whether it's desirable 
to place any mode or all modes of for-hire 
carriage under Federal Government owner-
ship and operation. Good, reliable trans-
portation service is essential, of course, to 
satisfactory operation of any establishment 
that produces, processes, manufacturers, 
and/or markets the goods that flow in the 
channels of trade. 
And so, to the buyers of transportation, 
many of whom long have been and still con-
tinue to be outspoken critics of the f or-

supported proposal that the railroads be 
taken over by the :Federal Government is a

1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 3135 
This is the story I wish to tell you and all 
people for, from the moment that I became 
fully aware of the monstrosity which was 
being perpetrated, I swore to denounce this 
fact on all corners of the free world, any-
where where someone is willing to listen to 
me, willing to consider this lethal danger 
which threatens humanity. My efforts will 
not cease Until both the governing classes 
arid the people wake up from their lethargy 
which is based on an erroneous confidence in 
a strategy inadequate to combat the mon-
strous Marxist-Leninist conspiracy. 
I trust in God for our salvation. I trust 
in the history of mankind which shows that 
somehow visionary leaders always appear to 
enable victory over the forces which would 
retrograde humanity to a barbarian or slave 
state. 
I believe in the strength of democracy in 
which I have placed my trust along with 
millions of souls and this is why I appeal 
to its moral and material reserves. 
Humanity has just lost one of those vision-
aries who, after offering his people "blood, 
tears, sweat, and sacrifices," led them on to 
victory. But many years before the unfor-
tunate day of his death, he clearly identi-
fied the new totalitarian menace which he 
dubbed "the Iron Curtain." Behind this 
Iron Curtain, as is well known to me and 
millions of people who have had to live un-
der its slavery, mass killings are an every-
day occurrence as are the premeditated and 
relentless preparations for the death of even 
more innocent victims and the burial of uni-
versal democracy. 
Let us do something to stop this crime 
which hides behind a mask of ideology to 
confuse those naive souls who search utopian 
formulas, those useful idiots and those who 
have been misguided in the placement of 
their trust. 
Let us do more than we are doing be-
cause, and I can assure you from personal 
experience, any effort is too small, only thus 
can we overcome the monstrous plans which 
are being formulated to destroy our Chris-
tian civilization. 
These plans include all countries, both 
great and small. International communism 
has prepared a mortal trap for every cate-
gory, for every nationality, for every 
poWer. 
He who doubts this, he who thinks that I 
exaggerate, let him observe and study a map 
of the world and see the subversive move-
ments and the frontal attacks which interna-
tional communism has made on the face of 
that world. There he will find the evidence. 
In less than half a century, the Sino-Soviet 
empire has ensnared 38 nations and 1,260 
Million people who are desperately awaiting 
liberation but who are impotent to do the 
job. The Kremlin and Peiping, like armed 
fanatics, thrust their power against nations 
who desire nothing but peace and coexistence 
but not the coexistence which the treacherous 
Communists describe, for they do not use 
the definitions that our Christian doctrine 
or OUT grammars have taught us. 
They cynically classify the dictatorship of 
a group of opportunists who have developed 
from the new puling class as a "dictatorship 
of the proletariate." For them, tyrannies are 
"popular democracies." And so on and so 
forth. We thus can see how the Marxist-
Leninist dictionary has completely changed 
the accepted meanings of words and how 
the system does not respect human rights. 
I4e who doubts or believes that I exag-
gerate should try to find an explanation for 
the Cuban case. How could this have hap-
pened? A little island' like the island of 
Cuba; 6 years ago it was militarily insig-
nificant, its population only 7 millions. And 
look at it today. An arsenal of nuclear 
weapons aimed at the very heart of the 
American continent, That Cuba, only 90 
miles from the U.S. mainland, has been 
transformed into an aggressive power by 
Communist imperialism was clearly demon-
strated in the October 1962 crisis, when the 
late President, John V, Kennedy, ordered a 
blockade of the little island. 
He who doubts or believes that I exag-
gerate should ask himself if 6 years ago he 
would have believed that this little island 
would one day have one of the most power-
ful and aggressive armed forces in all of 
Latin America and that its Government 
would be cynical enough to state that it 
would be willing to place all resources at 
the disposal of forces bent on the destruction 
of democratic institutions in all the nations 
of the Americas, thus turning them into 
carbon copies of the Cuban drama. 
I personally was a witness to the formula-
tion of those plans. I shall relate to you 
some of the facts which came to my per-
sonal attention. 
With all sincerity, with the clearness of 
vision necessary to recognize the truth, with 
the valor which is needed to meet the chal-
lenges of the enemy, with the crudeness 
which the inhumanity of these plans has 
forced me to use in my efforts to denounce 
this treason on all corners of the earth, I 
must say that those who doubt the danger 
that this aggressive, Communist imperialism 
holds cannot in any way be a part of the 
victorious legion who believed in the vision 
and courage of Winston Churchill. These 
will pass into history along with Chamber-
lain's umbrella. 
Let us study these plans that I will now 
explain to you. Let us evaluate the facts 
and try to draw practical conclusions so as 
to save this continent and its citizens. 
In the month of October of 1960, I located 
Fidel in one of the many houses which he 
had appropriated for his personal comfort, 
and which he used as hideouts in which to 
plot against those whom he had decided were 
not being blindly obedient and should be 
removed. This characteristic of Fidel's is 
well known to all of his intimate followers. 
It is a pathological affliction. This particular 
house was a most elegant one, situated in 
Cojimar, which is a few miles out of Havana. 
Fidel let it be known that he lived in this 
particular house; but very few people actu-
ally knew where he would spend any par-
ticular night. 
Around this date, Fidel no longer even 
trusted his own personal guard which had 
been with him since his Sierra Maestra 
days when the revolution was still on Cuban 
mountains. The guard was composed of 
poor, young peasants to whom he despec-
tively referred as the little donkeys because 
during his many hikes through the moun-
tains they had been forced to follow him, 
first of all to protect him, and secondly to 
carry Fidel's knapsacks. 
He dropped these young men as soon as 
he reached Havana and started to choose 
militant Communist Party members in their 
place. This, of course, was necessary because 
the new guard was going to hear only that 
Which would please a Communist. This 
would not have fallen well on the ears of 
these farmers who had been promised "jus-
tice, bread, and liberty." 
One day I observed with great sadness 
how these peasants who had guarded my 
brother while he was in the Sierra Maestra 
Mountains were cast aside. I commented on 
this to Fidel and he answered: "These little 
donkeys have to be indoctrinated so that they 
may learn Marxism. This is why I have given 
them scholarships and sent them off to 
study." 
That was not Fidel's first inhuman action 
nor Would is be the last. I had seen many 
signs of it before and the world is now wit-
ness to the many which have followed. 
I was able to find out that Fidel was 
silently plotting to turn over all key positions 
of the revolutionary government to Com-
munist Party agents. Thus he set about, 
systematically, to displace all veterans of 
the revolution in military and government 
positions. 
And so it was that Fidel's partners in arms, 
his friends who faithfully served under him 
during the many years of the revolution, 
those men who had risked their lives within 
the cities and on the mountains, those who 
made victory possible on that January 1, 
1959, were periodically replaced, upon Fidel 
Castro's direct orders, by militant mem-
bers of the Communist Party. These changes 
were usually made very secretly. The men 
who were thus advanced into top government 
jobs had neither sacrificed themselves nor 
risked their lives during that revolutionary 
war which took so many. 
On that day and in that Cojimar mansion, 
Fidel was meeting with the international 
adventurer known as "Che" Guevara and 
other old Communist leaders: Bias Roca, 
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and Lazar? Pena. 
Both the civil and military structure was 
being rearranged to fit the Soviet mold. 
I was amazed to see how meekly Fidel ac-
cepted the proposals of the Communist 
Party leaders as they indicated just what 
steps should be taken by Fidel and the rev-
olution. "Che" Guevara and Carlos Rafael 
Rodriguez were explaining facts to Fidel and 
urging his continental future. 
It was hard for me to contain by amaze-
ment but I did manage to mantain my se-
renity sufficiently so as to be able to analyze 
the magnitude of the plans which had been 
traced by the old Cuban Communist guard. 
Fidel was becoming more and more enthusi-
astic as they successfully goaded his ego and 
I realized that day just how great his ego 
really was. 
I still recall the exchange of conversatron 
between Bias Roca and Fidel, words which I 
was not fully able to believe until some time 
later when I had accumulated other cor-
roborating facts. 
Blas Roca, one of the top Cuban Com-
munists told Fidel: "Whatever you do in 
Cuba via a Marxist-Leninist revolution, our 
organization in Latin America will take care 
that it is presented as the only possible social 
solution for those countries. With the help 
of Russia and Red China, you will become 
a continental hero. We shall place all re-
sources in your hands. First, we must start 
out with psychological propaganda. This will 
then be followed by sufficient material to 
make it possible for you to carry out whatever 
revolutions are necessary to deliver all Latin 
American nations into your hands." 
I confess that, upon hearing these words, 
I thought that they were kidding Fidel or 
that perhaps they were staging a little com-
edy. Soon, however, my doubts vanished. 
Fidel presented the following arguments, 
very seriously: "That plan is exactly what 
I want. While I was up in the Sierra Maes-
tra 'Che' and Carlos Rafael gave me a rough 
idea of how it could work. I know that you 
are aware of this but, of course, I needed to 
have assurances of Russia's backing. I now 
see that I have this." 
The old-guard Communists, Moscow's 
trusted agents in Cuba, answered: "It is an 
absolute fact." 
"Che" Guevara then gave a detailed ac-
count of how conditions in the different 
Latin American nationa favored a revolu-
tion. 
I was awed by the information that the 
"Che" had on each Latin American coun-
try and especially by the way he presented 
his material, cleverly adapting the general 
panorama so as to build up Fidel's ego. 
After quite a bit of time, my brother spoke 
and I noticed that he had been thoroughly 
convinced of his ability to obtain what they 
had described as a continental objective. He 
said: "This continental action must begin 
with the two countries where conditions are 
the most favorable; i.e., Venezuela and 
Brazil. It will take about 10 or 15 years to 
get all of the other nations into the fold.

to explode the Socialist Revolution volcano 
in Latin America. If to this we add the 
militant and/or nonmilitant Marxists-Len-
inists in all Latin America who will act as a 
fifth column as well as the other elements 
which through contagion, economic or social 
frustration, political ambition, either left or 
right, are conditioned to join an insurrec-
tional movement, Soviet rockets will not be 
needed in the takeover of the entire con-
tinent." 
These were his words. The facts now 
clearly demonstrate that Cuba has met and 
passed the goal which Fidel set 4 years ago. 
More and more guerrilla fighters have been 
trained and the results can be evidenced in 
any morning newspaper. Several heads of 
State and continental newspapers are ever 
decrying the active presence of the Castro-
Communist guerrillas. 
The U.S. Under Secretary of State for Latin 
American Affairs, Mr. Thomas C. Mann, re-
cently stated: "Cuba continues to train 
agents in guerrilla warfare and to send them 
out into Latin America to carry out their 
activities. Guerrilla groups exist in Vene-
zuela, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala, and 
in the central region of Bolivia. And I be-
lieve," added Mn Mann, "that this threat to 
hemispheric peace will continue for some 
time to come." 
It has given us great satisfaction to see 
the solidarity of the labor movement in Latin 
America which has resulted in the taking of 
effective measures against the ships and the 
countries which feed the Communist Cuban 
regime. We quite deliberately state that they 
only feed the regime because the industrial 
and agricultural products which capitalis-
tic countries send to Cuba do not reach the 
starving Cuban people. This only serves the 
regime's privileged bosses or is reshipped to 
Moscow, the metropolis of Soviet imperial-
ism. In the meantime, blockade or no block-
ade, the Cuban people will continue to suf-
fer from want and hunger. 
Now let us be alert to the latest maneuver 
which has been conceived by the diabolical 
minds of Fidel and his followers. 
I can assure you that this is a fact. When 
Fidel considers that he is lost and is about 
to be overthrown by the patriotic Cuban 
people, and such an attempt is apt to be tried 
at any moment because internal dissention 
exists within the ranks of the Havana re-
gime, and besides the fearless and harassing 
landings from outside which will continue, 
he will not leave without carrying out the 
plan which he has prepared for such an 
emergency. 
This plan calls for immediate action, even 
to the extent of provoking war with some 
Latin American country, in order to avoid 
being toppled by an internal uprising. 
Should this moment come, Fidel will be more 
dangerous than ever. 
I heard Fidel say on one occasion: "If I 
ever find that I have lost, thousands of men 
will have to fall with me because any arma-
ment that I have at my disposal will be fired 
against the United States or against any 
neighboring country on the continent. I 
shall thus force collective action against us 
for one thing. I will not have the world think 
that we have been destroyed by the people." 
Fidel has never kept one single construc-
tive promise. This was true when he lived 
with us in our home and is still true now that 
he keeps his homeland in a state of agony. 
But Fidel has kept most of his warlike 
threats and he has never been particularly 
shy about confessing this, sometimes pri-
vately, sometimes in public. 
I would like to alert all cOuntries on this 
continent, whether these be small or large, 
to the fact that Fidel does have sufficient 
resources to produce a most disastrous ca-
tastrophe, something which must be avoided 
and can only be avoided if steps are taken 
in time. His plan is similar to that of Nero 
when he set Rome afire. His plan calls for 
/ ' 
When all cnuntriet: have socialist govern-
Moats we will be aale to place them under 
one single military and civil head. This is 
when I shall be able to assume the leadership 
In. the name of the Latin American revolu-
tio a." 
When Bias Roca smiled cynically and said: 
"Those nations will be called the Union of 
Socialist Republics of the Axnericas (U.S.R.A.) 
and they will become part of the Commu-
nist bloc." 
Pidel's enthusiasm was uncontrollable. 
xiit, eyes were popping out of their sockets as 
he paced back and forth among the group, 
once suddenly stop:sing to say: 
"I am willing to do anything and I will 
not be satisfied with this little island. But, 
in order to get territorial. advances I must 
have military help es soon as possible." 
This was immediately promised, in Russia's 
name, by Bias Roca, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez 
and "Che" Guevara. 
On one point Fidel insisted: "I most keep 
Cuba armed with the most modern equip-
msat so that the United States and some of 
the Latin American nations can be restrained 
until the moment a at we are able to launch 
?Ur continental plans. In order to do this 
/ need hundreds of thousands Of light and 
heavy infantry weapons, planes, and 
IRBM's. Every nation of this continent must 
be within our range, from New York to Wash-
ington, from Santiago de Chile to Buenos 
Alms. If I do not have this I will not be 
able to act from a pesition of strength, I will 
not be able to unleash revolutions, for I 
would immediately he dealt a crushing blow. 
This must be understood by the Soviet Union 
for, it is she who 3ossesses the arms and 
projectiles that I need." 
I confess and repeat that, even though I 
had already come to believe Fidel capable of 
the craziest of schemes I never thought that 
his monstrous plans would be on such a 
large scale and much less ever even dreamed 
that these would come true. But I had 
further opportunities to confirm the fact 
that the matter had indeed been referred to 
the Kremlin. Tow rd the end of 1962 I 
found out that Russia had placed the 
1RBM's in Fidel's murdering hands. He now 
had the American Continent Within his gun-
sights. 
FrOm that moment on I was to learn, 
through very bitter experience, that Fidel 
and Communist imperialism were capable of 
anything in their drive to dominate all 
humanity. 
But there are other important details 
Which clearly show that Fidel and interna-
tional communism i have not given up their 
arab Mons. 
. Anastas Mikoyan was forced to tell Fidel 
that, Russia had to withdraw its missiles 
becatpse of the October crisis. 
Why did Fidel finally approve the meas-
ure? It was not only because he was forced 
to do so because I know that in return for 
his cooperation both Russia and Red China 
(which is even more aggressive than Fidel) 
agreed to continue to aid him in his plan 
to conquer Latin Arlerica through subver-
sion, terrorism, and a strategy which was 
aimed at the immediate crumbling of all 
democratic institutions in Latin America so 
as to permit the colcnial expansion of com-
munism into the Araerican Continent. 
During Mikoyan's visit to Cuba, at the 
time of the October crisis, I learned of the 
details of the new plan which, I assure you, 
in no way eliminated the possibility that 
Cuba would once again have her nuclear 
warheads if the Western Powers dared to 
"doze" off again, as Fidel insisted they 
would. Fidel was most insistent with Mi-
koyan on the point taat the missiles should 
be returned to Cuba the very first minute 
that the democratic countries showed the 
slightest signs of relenting. 
Later on, Fidel started demanding loudly 
that the antiaircraft rockets which were in 
ehai;ge ,)f the Hussitens be ,put in Cuban 
hands. This has now been accomplished. 
Fidel vas quite indignant in his conversa-
tion: wit a Mikoyain. "The United States has 
forefd me to shelve ray. plan temporarily but 
at:sniff:lay we will drop bombs on the United 
Stats a ad this will be my revenge." 
I can assure you that his madness knows 
no ;Waits. All those of us who know him 
have no doubt in this matter. He most de-
cide 
ti 
ly would not hesitate to drop bombs 
on e heads of millions of human beings. 
It would make no difference to him whether 
this be en a North American or South Amer-
ican:city. The reason I can make this state-
ment is that Fidel is very open about his 
plan when he is around his followers. He 
mai* no effort to conceal these thoughts 
front his intimate circle. 
After ftudying Fidel closely I am sure that 
we dre n the presence of another Hitler. 
If Fidel had at his disposal the enormous 
rest:three:. which were Hitler's, humanity 
woutid elready be deeply entrenched in 
worlii Wel. III. Fidel's hatred is aimed not 
only agninst the United States but also 
agaidst all of his fellovmsen. It does not 
mather to him that he may bring catas-
trophe to the nations of the hemisphere so 
long as 1 e is able to satisfy his brutal ambi-
tion ' of conquering and . dominating the 
conthaen,i. 
04 another occasion I heard Fidel say: 
"Thai po ver Of the United States must be 
immtaaili zed. This can be done by conquer-
ing i, atin America so as to have them fight 
the Iltortli. The strategic encirclement must 
come Ire m below. It's just like taking a 
rebel: hill by controlling all the flanks. This 
operation would be tantamount to crushing 
an inveri ed pyramid. The material backing 
needd t s bring down this pyramid will be 
foundin Russia, Red China or anywhere I 
can et it." (This is the way he talks to his 
innei1 cirole). 
Fidel :las not abandoned this -strategy. 
AlthOugb he has been set back by failures 
such as that he found in. Venezuela and 
Brazi:1 which, somehow, managed to escape 
from, his hands when civic and military 
forces joiaed to produce a coup that deposed 
the Mstris-Communist instruments who had 
been in y ower, Fidel's tenacity is dangerous. 
He is determined to reach his ambitious 
goals He is backed by Asia and is maneu-
verin0 the African countries so as to black-
mail Moscow. This will probably give him 
more train tary and economic aid. 
Since 1)60 Cuba has been the Latin Amer-
ican 4Technical Institute" for the destruction 
of de cm soy and massacre of human beings. 
Cu a gi aduates thousands of young Latin

to Cuba but also to all neighboring countries.

that he is a definite menace to continental 
peace, let us all do something quickly so as

THE FLIGHT STATION AT 
SHERIDAN, WYO. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, last 
year the Federal Aviation Agency served 
notice o/ its intention to "remote" 42 
flight-service stations at various points 
throughout the country. The Agency's 
plan includes a number of stations in 
Wyoming. At the time of the announce-
ment, I strongly protested the action, 
which would, in effect, automate a num-
ber of extremely important flight-service 
stations in Mountainous, meteorologi-
cally unpredictable areas, thereby de-
priving pilots and others of the most 
valuable asset of the stations as presently 
constituted?human intelligence and 
availability. This, in my view, is one of 
the least sensible manifestations of auto-
mation. 
Wyoming has areas of rapidly chang-
ing weather, mountainous terrain, and 
sparse population. The manned flight-
service stations perform a very necessary 
and basic safety function. The location 
of the Wyoming flight-service stations in 
proximity to the high mountains com-
bines with the unpredictable weather of 
Wyoming to make these stations the 
most strategic in the United States. 
Time after time, flight-service stations 
in Wyoming have proven their worth in 
saving lives. Their importance is not 
In question. 
Services provided by manned stations 
in such an area enhance flying safety, 
by providing extra flight information 
during times of marginal weather. 
These Wyoming stations are not just 
aids to the local operator, but are of 
very great assistance to cross-country 
operators who are not familiar with the 
mountainous area. 
I submit, for printing in the RECORD, 
a wire-service dispatch describing an 
incident which occurred last week in 
Wyoming. The dispatch was sent to me 
by a good friend, Dr. Peter Madsen, vice 
president of the Wyoming State Sen-
ate. This case graphically presents the 
factors I have set forth in my arguments 
in opposition to the proposed action of 
the Federal Aviation Agency. 
I appreciate the move for economy in 
Government. However, this is one case 
in which human safety must be the 
prime consideration. Life should not be 
measured in terms of dollars. I strongly 
urge the Administrators of the FAA to 
take this fact into consideration when 
contemplating any change in the present 
setup of flight-service stations. I take 
this opportunity to express my sincere 
appreciation to all the personnel who 
took part in that rescue. I especially 
compliment the personnel of the Laramie 
fight-service station for a job well done. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
RESCUED PILOT ASSERTS HE WANTS To LIVE 
/N WYOMING 
LARAMIE, Wyo.?Dutch Van Dox could have 
died in a lonely area northwest of Laramie 
Tuesday night after his plane went down. 
but the veteran pilot said he's returning to 
Wyoming to stay if he ever gets the chance. 
"They have men up here (in Wyoming)," 
said Van Dox, after a rescue crew brought him 
into Laramie. The rescue party spent all 
Tuesday night and most of Wednesday morn-
ing pushing through deep snow in an effort 
to get to the plane and its 44-year-old pilot. 
Van fox, who lives in Caracas, Venezuela, 
said he was on vacation when he had to land 
the light plane he was flying in the rugged 
country 18 miles northwest of Laramie after 
missing an approach at the Laramie airport. 
He said he had to take the plane down in 
the first clear spot he could find because his 
airspeed indicator had frozen. He said with-
in minutes after he brought the plane into 
"a nice soft landing," the snow was 2 inches 
deep on the wings. 
Van fox had nothing but praise for the 
3137 
ground search crew, the Federal Aviation 
Agency control tower, and pilots of Western 
and Frontier Airlines, all of whom were in-
strumental in his rescue. 
"In my 20 years of flying, I've never ran 
across such professionals in their businesses," 
he said. Van Dox said if it hadn't been for 
the professional way the FAA relayed fixes on 
his position, "I'd be dead right now." 
Van Dox said soon after his landing he 
picked up radio contact with an airliner 
which helped fix his position. 
"Later, a Western pilot helped fix my posi-
tion," he said. "It was a DC-3 flown by a 
fabulous guy. I hope to meet him someday. 
The pilot picked me up on his way to Casper, 
then came back down on his way back, and 
stayed in the area close to 2 hours marking 
me for the people on the ground." 
He said the two airline pilots worked to-
gether to fix his position for the search crews. 
He said he had radio contact and kept 
warm by running the motor of his plane Until 
the fuel ran out. 
"Then it got awful cold," Van Dox said. 
Temperatures in the Laramie area dropped 
to zero during the night. 
Van Dox said, "The FAA in Laramie is the 
finest group of men the FAA has ever 
had?and that goes for the citizens of Wyo-
ming, too." 
"I met men today who stomped around all 
night in the deep snow looking for me, and 
they were hardly out of breath when they 
? 
found me," he added. 
"If I ever get a chance for a job in the 
States, I'm heading for Wyoming," he said. 
"I feel wonderful now. I'm awestruck at 
the way people in Wyoming do things. I just 
wish the rest of the world had the integrity 
of people I've met since I've been here." 
Van Dox said he is currently on vacation 
and has contacted his wife in Venezuela. He 
said he plans to get the airplane and be on 
his way when the weather clears enough to

Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President, 
one of the major jobs the Senate should 
face this year is consideration of its 
procedures. We must make sure this 
body can function in a manner adequate 
to meet the great challenges that face it 
and the grave responsibilities it owes the 
American people. 
The distinguished senior Senator from 
Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY] has sub-
mitted a concurrent resolution to estab-
lish a Joint Committee on the Organiza-
tion of Congress. Senator MONROXEY is 
truly a leader in the field of congressional 
organization, as is witnessed by the La-
Follette-Monroney Act of 1946. It is an 
honor to join him in sponsoring his pro-
posal, Senate Concurrent Resolution 2. 
The Kangas City Star, one of our Na-
tion's most noted and respected news-
papers, recently published a comprehen-
sive editorial in support of the concurrent 
resolution. I believe that all members 
of Congress will find the editorial in-
teresting and thought provoking. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the editorial, entitled 
"One of Congress Big Jobs: Congress," 
be printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

round a potbellied stove"--Senator MIKE 
ONSONEY, 1Deniocrat, of 'Oklahoma. 
By rough calculation, Congress, sitting 
round that potbellied stove, will transact 
$100-billion business this year. We share 
ith Senator MONRONEY the puspicion that 
he lawmakers could find a more efficient and 
oney-saving method to do what they have 
o do. For there certainly was no literary 
xagg;eration when the Oklahoman carried 
Is colorful language a bit further, mixed his 
etaphors and said: 
"We who are the comptrollers of the 
orltSs biggest business are figuratively using 
high slant-top desk, an old-fashioned re-
?lying stool, a big ttick ledger and a quill 
? en." 
But alas, in the last several years we have 
eare the issue of congressional modernize-
ion discussed for the benefit of Congressmen 
ho seem to have a deaf ear, We have, in 
act, Mentioned it ourselves on occasion and 
? e must confess that, along with other corn-
? entators, political scientists, and some law-
akrs, we have prec ous little to show for 
?ut efforts. We trust that Senator MONRONEY 
Ill be more successful. 
We say this with sc me optimism, in fact. 
or on this matter of congressional reorgani-
tio:a, Senator MowscoeTEY IS an old warhorse. 
a Member of the House he was cosponsor 
f the Larollette-Monroney Act of 1946, the 
ast serious attempt o -a the part of Congress 
dc something about its own House (and 
ts Senate, for that matter). We sense that 
he Senator is charging: forth to battle. We're 
ith him. 
As we understand it, MONRONEY, in an-
?lancing his intention to seek congressional 
odernization, was speaking less of such 
?hilosophical problems as seniority and the 
libuster, and more of certain procedural 
nachronisms that ha"e been frozen into the 
apitol Hill status quo. The obstacle to his 
uccess will be the traditional affection for 
he seatus quo on the Hill. 
Nor does his proposal rule out the possi-
1114 of some change; in the seniority sys-
em and the filibuster rule. On the issue of 
eniarity, at least, the chief impetus seems 
o be coming from the House, where Repre-
entative RICHARD WILING, Democrat, of 
issouri, and the Democratic study group 
ave been at work. ',lie House liberals ob-
iousiy are opening up a hornet's nest and 
ithout some aid and comfort directly from

? uch hope for their cause this year, justified 
? S it may be. 
But the Monroney movement needs only 
he :moperation of his fellow lawmakers. 
me, we could imagine, are rather bitter 
ver his indictment of the Capitol Hill club. 
evertheless, most man with experience in 
ither House ought to understand what their 
olleague is talking about. Indeed, we should 
hink that they would be the first to voice 
heir discontent with the frustrations that 
nevitably must be a pert of the congressional 
steer. 
In effect, Senator MoilsoefEY proposes that 
? joint, bipartisan committee should make 
yearlong study of legislative procedures. 
e would assume that such a committee, 
Ithough it should 'ae careful of getting 
rapped in the old lib s?al-conservative fight, 
ould nevertheless Include the seniority sys-
em and the filibuster within its field of 
ction. But primarily, MONRONEY has sug-
este I. that: 
Ths committee stru( ture should be studied 
o see whether certair, committees are over-
oaded or, perhaps, no longer necessary in 
he legislative process. Presumably this 
ould include some attention to matters of 
taff and the relationship in size between the 
inority and majority staff. At least, we 
opo that it would.

SIONAL RECORD ? SENATE February 19 
while jresierving the right of the people to 
petitloe their representatives on Capitol Hill. 
Con dress should consider the possibility of 
using eom niters and other modern aids In 
proces ing the immensely complex Federal 
budge 1. ( Dra this point, we might add that 
in 1946, when Representative MONRONEY 
succeetted n his earlier congressional reorga-
nizati9n, tie budget was a mere $60 billion. 
This yrar, it may top $100 billion. And all 
of this if ie may be permitted si comparison 
of our own, sometimes seems to be computed 
by the lav makers, on an abacus.) 
Majority vote, rather than the current 
unanimous consent, should be enough to let 
committee, meet while the Senate is in ses-
sion. 
Commiti ees should meet as early as De-
cembe; 1, to start filling the pipeline with 
bills f9r Congress to consider when it meets 
in January. At present, both Houses must 
sometimes wait for weeks for the committees 
to give the n something to do. 
So4thi ag should be done about the Tues-
day-to-Thursday system that permits legis-
lative leoltilays on almost every 'Monday and 
Friday 
Certain details in private bills, now han-
dled by Congress, should be turned over to 
the exrcutive branch or the courts. 
The present mandatory adjournment date 
of July 15- -rarely observed?should be moved 
to August 15. And mandatory should mean 
mandatory "except in time of declared' war," 
Under the Constitution, each House 
would have to write its own new rules and 
thus Dia effect, the committee would operate 
as tvi9 colamittees. We should think that 
the two ccmmittees, as an example of time-
saving ans efficient techniques, might join 
in their hearings at least in the beginning. 
We wcfnald hope that testimony would be 
heard Iron; other lawmakers, from students 
of governn,ent and from members of the ex-
ecutiv4 br mob. Frankly, we would expect 
this joint committee to be in session for 
many days. Its assignment would be one of 
the ni4)st important in the 53th Congress. 
This is not to say that Congress has always
failed ,to Co its job. Indeed, we move into 
the 8th Congress with the generally fine 
record of the 88th looming large in the his-
tory b oks. It was a legislative class that 
wrote laws of immense importance, on 
subjects r inging from civil rights to tax 
reduction eo education. 
Neveerthe less, the 88th Congress left much 
undone that ought to have been done and 
probalily t id some things that should not 
have Jaren lone. The quality of legislation is 
not the best of criteria for judging the ef-
ficiency o:' the congressional mechanism. 
Some ?rill' ant words can be spoken around 
a 
a potbried stove and an accountant sitting 
at a sant .top desk can turn in a perfect 
ledger boor. 
The larg:!, issue is whether Congress, as the 
vital notio aal institution that it is, is doing 
its job in the most efficient manner possible. 
On another level of reform, there are the 
issues of seniority, of the filbuster, of the 
power of committee chairmen to halt legis-
lation, an; the like. These--excepting the 
?vhich exists only in the Senate?
are thp natters of prime concern to the 
Democratic liberals of the House, But they 
will be ask mg their colleagues to sit in judg-
ment tn tf aditional procedures and to stand 
up an be counted for or against what is, 
in effert, toe establishment. 
Moerooresz is asking for nothing more than 
a little con unonsense in writing the rules for 
Capitol. 111.1. It strikes us that his proposal 
to estqblisn a study committee should have 
the si*poi t of both parties and should be 
acceptple on each side of Capitol Hill. He 
seeks ?ply eo free Congress of :its own built-in 
inadequacies and to free its Members of the 
terrible demands of unnecessary legislative 
wheels`ainr ing on their time. 
The word, if our reading is correct, Is effi-
Approved For Release 
ciency. Perhaps even efficiency?or modern-
ization, as you will?would not take all the 
bugs out of the legislative mechanism. But 
it certainly would help. 
The new Congress will have many things 
to discuss and will have little time on its 
hands. But we suggest that high on its 
agenda should be the problem of Congress 
Itself. The Members of the 89th Congress 
would serve thele Nation admirably if they 
would give the Monroney proposal a try. In 
fact, we would say that a genuine modern-
ization of Congress, this year or next, would 
find for the 89th s, real place on the roster 
of our most illust-ious legislative assemblies. 
AWARD TO SENATOR SYMINGTON 
BY INTERNATIONAL CORRE-
SPONDENCE SCHOOLS 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President, 
my distinguished colleague, the senior 
Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON], 
was honored recently as "Home Study 
Man of the Year" by his alma mater, 
International Correspondence Schools, 
of Scranton, Pa. 
This news may come as quite a surprise 
to those of us more familiar with the 
fact that he was a member of the class of 
1923 at Yale University. However, it is 
also a matter of record that when my 
colleague went to work in a foundry, 
right after college, his boss?who knew 
of his Yale background?ordered him to 
"Go to a good correspondence school and 
learn something about making a living." 
It was then that he enrolled with the 
ICS. 
Today, STUART SYMINGTON'S second 
alma mater boasts over 7 million alumni, 
including a former Secretary of the 
Navy, Dan Kimball; and a former Secre-
tary of Commerce, Luther Hodges. The 
ICS now has a worldwide student body 
of nearly 200,000 adults, in more than 50 
countries. They could find no better 
record to emulate, should their career be 
public service or private industry, than 
that of STUART SYMINGTON. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the award be printed 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the award 
was ordered to be: printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

vantage. 
The only ?proposal that does not have 
this defect Is HA, 21, the com-
prehensive, voluntary insurance pro-
grain first intr4uced 3 years ago. 
I-I.R. 21 enceurages,yedple to take care 
of their own problems, and H.R. 21 can 
solve the present problem without fas-
tening a permanent new bureaucracy on 
the taxpayers of "this country. 
Today's retired people face problems 
unique in Our history. They experienced 
two World Wars and a great depression 
during the best years? of their lives and 
their postwar earnings were subject to 
the burden of heavy taxes and soaring 
Inflation. They are living longer than 
any previous AmeriCan generation, and 
they are doing so in large measure be-
Cause of the tremendous progress that 
has been made in American medical 
knowledge and techniques. Paradoxi-
cally, it is this same program in the field 
Of medicine, that places a heavy and 
often insurniountabie burden on their 
slender resources, because modern medi-
cal care is costly beyond anything we 
have experrenced in the past. They 
need hell?. 
The next generation of retired persons 
Will have much greater opportunity to 
prepare for retirement. 
In the first place, they know they can 
e.XPect longer lives and Must make pre-
paration. They williae people who spent 
most of their productive years in times 
of prosperity. They will be protected by 
the pension plans that are now being de-
veloped in ?most industries on a scale 
hitherto unmown. And they will-have 
available to, them hictlieds of prepaying 
medical care insurance, company pro-
grams for the medical care of retired 
employees, and greatly improved in-
surance programs especially designed for 
the retired person. All of these things 
are now developing, proving the in-
genuity of the free enterprise system and 
Its ability to solve the problems of our 
people. 
In the face of these facts, why adopt a 
program that would burden the already 
Inadequate Socia' Security System with 
a tremendously costly, permanent hos-
pital program, finance4. by a regressive 
payroll tax, as H.R. 1 would do? 
- Why adopt a program that envisions a 
Complicated Federal.-State relationship 
with uncertain benefits, depending upon 
the willingness of the States to increase 
their taxes ox to divert funds from exist-
ig prPgYaQs. that,. already are in-
uatelY ftnanced? H.R. 377 would 
thM. 
? All three would mean tremendous an-
nual expenditures. Only H.R. 3727 in-
eludes any incentive to people to find the 
means of helping themselves, and this 
feature of. the bill is at cross-purposes 
with all the rest. How effective will it be 
to provide a tax deduction for prepaid 
medical care insurance if the individual 
is assured the Government will take care 
of him anyhow? 
H.R. 21 will accomplish more for less 
money because it relies on the genius of 
free enterprise and because it does not 
require the establishment of any new 
Federal or State agency or even the en-
largement of any agency. And as the 
years go by, as medical care insurance 
becomes more comprehensive and more 
readily available and as our older peo-
ple become better able to discharge their 
obligations, H.R. 21 will become less and 
less necessary. It is a crutch we can 
throw away when we no longer need it; 
not a brace we must wear for life. 
The money and influence of the AFL-
CIO, the Democratic Party, and the De-
partment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare have been used to publicize the 
King-Anderson bill. The AMA must be 
spending millions on publicity for the 
Curtis-Herlong bill. The fact that the 
ranking minority member and several of 
his colleagues on the Committee on Ways 
and Means have prepared a bill has been 
widely noted in the press and certainly is 
newsworthy. Meanwhile, H.R. 21, the 
easiest and best solution to the problem, 
which has gained broad acceptance and 
support wherever it has been presented 
to doctors, senior citizens, and others 
during the past 3 years, receives little 
consideration. 
I repeat, it will be a sad day for this 
country if we insist on trying to solve this 
temporary problem by building another 
bureaucratic monster. Let us take the 
simple, direct, effective route provided in 
H.R. 21. 
TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN L. 
ROSENBLOOM 
(Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr. 
CLEVELAND) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, today it is 
my sad duty to-announce the passing of 
the late Benjamin L. Rosenbloom, one of 
our former Members, who served the 
First Congressional District of West Vir-
ginia, so ably, fearlessly, and with such 
distinction from 1921 to 1925 in the 67th 
and 68th Congresses. 
Mr. Rosenbloom passed away last Mon-
day in a Cleveland hospital at the age of 
85 after a long illness. 
An outstanding Republican, Mt. 
Rosenbloom was a close personal friend 
of mine. He was a leader while in the 
Congress in securing laws on stream pol-
lution, guaranteeing bank deposits, and 
governing aliens. Often we had the op-
portunity over the years of my service in 
this body to compare notes of the many 
changes that have taken place. 
Mr. Rosenbloom served in the West 
Virginia State Senate before coming to 
the Congress in 1921. During his con-
gressional campaign, he compiled a paper 
During this this period, Mr. Rosenbloom 
also found time to serve as Wheeling city 
councilman, mayor, and newspaper pub-
lisher. Along with his busy lifetime of 
public service, he served as grand exalted 
ruler of the Wheeling, W. Va., Elks Lodge. 
In the 1930's, he founded a weekly news-
paper called Tides which was hest known 
for its outspoken editorial policy. He 
was quite outspoken on the subject of 
prohibition. At the time he mounted his 
crusade in the State senate, he was the 
only member of that body opposing the 
drys. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rosenbloom was a 
leader in his time. He maintained his 
keen interest in government long after he 
left the Congress. I am proud Benjamin 
L. Rosenbloom came from West Vir-
ginia?particularly proud that he came 
from the district in West Virginia I eln 
privileged to represent. I believe we all 
are better people because of him and his 
lifetime of service to his State and Nation. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 
(Mr. WOLFF (at the request of Mr. 
Aninws) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, I echo the 
sentiments of the President on the im-
portance of education: 
Nothing matters more to the future of our 
country, not our military preparedness?for 
armed might is worthless if we lack the 
brains to build a world peace; not our pro-
ductive economy?for we cannot sustain 
growth without trained manpower; not our 
democratic system of government?for free-
dom is fragile if citizens are ignorant. 
The need for better educational facili-
ties and materials is current; the need 
for a more comprehensive education plan 
to secure adequate education levels for 
all Americans is current. These current 
problems should and must be met now. 
Our great country craves and needs bet-
ter educated citizens if it is to continue 
as a prospering, vibrant society. 
The public education of our children 
is primarily the responsibility of the 
States and local communities. The Fed-
eral Government has never sought to 
preempt this responsibility, and I want 
to exercise continued vigilance that this 
policy is adhered to. However, when 
spiraling costs place education beyond 
the means of our burdened local and 
State governments, the Federal Govern-
ment has both the authority and respon-
sibility to assist them. Local taxes in 
support of education and the sundry 
other responsibilities have reached the 
saturation point. The local resident is 
inundated with a myriad of local taxes 
which utilize real property holding as 
the tax base. There is a need to spread 
this burden; there is a need of providing

EDITOR, THE LONG-ISLANDER: The con-

uals, some of whom are legislators, to cir-
cumvent and curtat the activities of police-
men in the sworn duties of the profession, 
.(1..e.) protecting life and property, detec-
tion of crime, arrest of offenders et al, is 
having a serious and menacing effect. 
Police work is a never-ending, ceaseless ef-
fort that requires the utmost dedication in 
the war on crime. The police officer must 
feel appreciated, must feel he is backed by 
the citizenry in general as well as his super-
iors. Charles Murphy one of the most saga-
cious politicians in the heyday of Tam-
many Hall for all his Governor-bus-
ing, Senator-making proclivity refused to 
Interfere with the orderly processes of the 
police department. 
Today, however, politicians and officeseek-
ers, in order to curry favor with group, are 
willing to scrap the duties of the police 
officer or so hamstring their operations as 
to make the job too onerous. The writer 
was amazed to note in North Carolina pa-
pers advertisements for candidates for New 
York City Police Department. 
Suffolk County has not as yet felt this 
reluctance of police candidates to take the 
job of law enforcement but as we grow, it 
could be faced with the same problems. Our 
choice then would be to lower the high 
standards now required with a resultant loss 
of top materials; or, seek recruits in the 
hinterlands of the Nation. 
Let us hope that zealous newspaper editors, 
television and radio commentators, together 
with political officeseekers, do not over-
subscribe to the liberal views on the Dec-
laration of Independence to such excess that 
they will undermine the very foundation 
of the beloved ConwAtution. Rapine, riot and 
revolution in every corner of the globe, have 
followed in the breakdown of law and order. 
On this the eve of President Johnson's 
message on anticrime to Congress, he must 
stress that we jealously guard, protect, and 
justify the rights and duties of the police 
officer in his hexculean task, against no 
matter the power .or prestige of those who 
would oppose. Public opinion must pre-
vail. Let us stand beside not behind the 
men who wear the blue.

CLEVELAND) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. BOW. Mr Speaker, it is distress-
ing to me, as I am certain it must be to 
millions of Americans, to see the Con-
gress moving toward enactment of a 
massive, permanent Government medical 
care program in an effort to solve what 
is really a temporary problem. 
For various sound and understandable 
reasons, the majority of Americans who 
are retiring today, or have retired in the 
past few years, have not been able to 
make adequate preparations to discharge 
obligations which may arise when seri-
ous illness strikes. For equally sound 
reasons, this is a temporary problem 
which will not affect so large a propor-
tion of retired citizens in the years ahead 
nor affect any of them as seriously. 
I listened with interest to a television 
program in which the senior Senator of

By CIA to Sabotage Cuban Sugar 
NEW YORK, March 26 
(UPI) ? Enterprising U.S. 
agents chemically sabotaged a 
shipment of Cuban sugar 
bound for Russia just before 
the Cuban missile crisis in 
1962 but President Kennedy 
intervened to prevent delivery 
of the tainted sugar, the New 
York Times reported today. 
White House intervention 
foiled the Central Intelligence 
A g e nc y's "Caribbean melo-
drama" but incurred the wrath 
of the Soviet government in 
the process by holding in a 
Puerto Rican port thousands 
of sacks of sugar taken off a 
Russia-bound freighter, the 
Times said. The case remains 
in the Puerto Rican Common-
wealth courts where it ended 
up after a bitter diplomatic 
exchange ad legal maneuver-
mg. 
According to the Times, 
CIA agents tainted the sugar 
with a chemical agent which 
was nonpoisonous but which 
spoiled the sugar's quality and 
gave it a foul taste. The idea 
I was to plant suspicion in So-
viet minds about the quality 
land purity of Cuban sugar. 
Mr. Kennedy intervened be-
cause he feared injury to So-
viet consumers and was wary 
of setting a "dreadful prece-
dent in chemical sabotage," 
the Times said. It reported 
the case came to light during 
the present controversy over 
South Viet-Nam forces using 
U.S. supplied nonlethal gas in 
their anti-Communist guerrilla 
war. 
A British freighter, under 
lease to the Soviets, made its 
way into San Juan harbor on 
Aug. 22, 1962, after damaging 
a propeller on a reef. It car-
ried the sugar and other car-
go, the Times said. 
A total of 14,135 of the 
80,000 bags of sugar aboard 
were placed in a Puerto Ricae 
custom:: warehouse where the 
U.S. agents applied the chemi-
cal substance to it, the news-
paper said. 
The Times said that in early 
September Washington or-
dered that the impounded sug-
ar should not be allowed out 
of Puerto Rico for any reason. 
A man known as Terry Kane 
and some associates from Mi-
ami went to court to contend 
that the sugar should be per-
manently seized by Puerto 
Rico in settlement of debts 
owed by the Cubans. The 
court issued such a writ, the 
paper said. 
The action prompted a se-
ries of angry diplomatic notes 
from Moscow. Washington re-
plied that the Russians should 
seek legal redress. The Rus-
sians went to Federal court in 
Puerto Rico on Oct. 14, two 
days before Soviet missiles 
were discovered in Cuba. 
The court ruled that a So-
viet importer, not the Cubans, 
owned the sugar and it could 
not be used as a settlement of 
a Cuban debt, the Times said. 
.!"uerto Rico appealed. In July, 
1963, a Federal appellate 
court in Boston ruled the Fed-
eral courts had no jurisdic-
tion and the case then re-
turn e d to Commonwealth 
courts where it remains unset-
tled. 
The Times also said that 
during the time the British 
freighter was in port in Puerto 
Rico a mysterious fire broke 
out in its hold.

HOLLYWOOD (NANA) - I 
asked Connie Bennett a question 
which in the old days would 
have caused her to chew me up 
and spit out the pieces. They 
are saying that you have had 
your face lifted. in it true?" 
"Absolutely not, calmly 
replied the veteram star, who is 
back in Hollywood meineg her 
Pont film in 12 years, "Madame 
X." "Look," she said, "arowd 
my forehead and behind my 
ears. I have no scars." 
Actually my question was a 
sort of compliment. Connie, who 
was a big star before I went to 
Hollywood, looks so young that, 
as she told me herself, "some-
one said to me yesterday: 'My 
god) Vfim did your face?" To

which someone else replied 
Connie told me, "God did he; 
face." 
"Marlene Dietrich asked me 
in London," Mi. Bennett 
continued, "Do people keep-
asking you if yeas have had 
lure lift? Well, they hadn't 
then, so I said no. 'They are 
always asking me,' mid Mar. 
lone, 'and I just show them 
around my forehead and my 
ears." That's a laip several 
people would like to take. "Not 
Mat I would mind having a face 
lift," continued Connie, "but my 
husband (Brig. Gee. John 
Conker) likes the face I happen 
to have." 
And whlle I was asking 
awkward questions, I asked 
Ronald Reagan. Why did 
Goody Knight attack you?" 
(Over Ronnie switching a few 
yews ago from Democrat to 
Repittlican. Ete former= 
nor of California, who 
plans to run again, referred to 
rival Ronnie as an ex-left 
winger ) "Since when has being 
a Democrat meant you were a 
left winger?" Ronnie asked me. 
His attractive wife, Nancy, said 
something about Goody a 
tired old man. "But," a 
Reagan, whose name has been 
mentioned prominently as 
R epublic an candidate for 
Governor the neat time around, 
"I era not entering a brick-
throwing contest." A pity. It's 
fascinating watching bricks 
thrown, as long as they are not 
thrown at you, 
Shll midis questions, I said 
In Robert Taylor, "It is as 
fashienable for attars to nal for 
office, how about running for 
President?" "I," said the movie 
matinee Idol Of the late 108 and 
'40s, "I rim rumba for the 
office of earthed dogcatcher." 
But I want through. "How 
about those coffee commercials 
you do with your wife on 
television? In the old days you 
couldn't get even a mond-rank 
star to do a commercial." I 
remember Claudette Colbert 
leavings show because she was 
asked to say a few kind words 
personally 
get 
about the product "Ws the 
money," rmlied Robert. "R's 
too good to re(use." 
To revert to the Producers 
Guild'n lovely bash for Alfred 
Hitchcock, there was the usual 
gam when Cary Great, who 
never attends such affairs, 
arrived to pay hanage to the 
old master of horror. But at 
that moment I was more 
nterested in the fabulous 
diamond necklace nestling 
around the neck of Maureen 0'. 
madly, I asked Maureen,r1 
tiara. With my eyes 
you go to Europe TAM you 
finish your picture at 
Universal?" ('"rhe Rare 
Breed," with Jimmy Stewart.) 
"More is ordy one place I go to 
When I fink* my pictures in 
Hollywood," the lovely redhead 
replied. "Oh, of course,. said I, 
"Memo!" She has been in love 
for a long time with that 
Mexican millionaire business-
man. "I dem% lame anyone who 
as good enough to him Ms 
boots," she told me. "I hope the 
good Lord will make it posable 
for on to many one day, then 
no one from this town will ever 
see me again." I must have 
looked hint, became Maureen 
added hastily, "You are always 
welcome to visit me. In fact, 
you can slay any lime now in 
the home I own in Mexico 
City." If there are some films 
beheg made In the neighborhood, 
I will take her up on the offer. 
They tell me that Nassau has 
retained to near normal ahem 
the departure of the Beatles for 
Europe. During their two weeks 
of location for their second 
movie, you couldn't hire a 
room, or a speedboat or a long-

haven't yet come up with a title. 
Prille6/15 Soraya paid an 
unexpected tint to Nassau, 
after visiting her good friend 
Max Schell in Lanka. Producer 
Walter Shenson, who also asks 
=nf, asked her, "Do Y.

SUNDAY, MARCH 28th ONLY 
WOODY 
HERMAN 
and his 16 sic ORCKSTRA 
RESERVE NOW' 
HOLLYWOOD (NANA) - I 
asked Connie Bennett a question 
which in the old days would 
have caused her to chew me up 
and spit out the pieces. They 
are saying that you have had 
your face lifted. in it true?" 
"Absolutely not, calmly 
replied the veteram star, who is 
back in Hollywood meineg her 
Pont film in 12 years, "Madame 
X." "Look," she said, "arowd 
my forehead and behind my 
ears. I have no scars." 
Actually my question was a 
sort of compliment. Connie, who 
was a big star before I went to 
Hollywood, looks so young that, 
as she told me herself, "some-
one said to me yesterday: 'My 
god) Vfim did your face?" To 
pleaSlIre lovers

FRANK SINATRA 
CLUITWILIWTOENT MRS 
TECHIMIN MANSIMPHIN INAMER BROSZ 
which someone else replied 
Connie told me, "God did he; 
face." 
"Marlene Dietrich asked me 
in London," Mi. Bennett 
continued, "Do people keep-
asking you if yeas have had 
lure lift? Well, they hadn't 
then, so I said no. 'They are 
always asking me,' mid Mar. 
lone, 'and I just show them 
around my forehead and my 
ears." That's a laip several 
people would like to take. "Not 
Mat I would mind having a face 
lift," continued Connie, "but my 
husband (Brig. Gee. John 
Conker) likes the face I happen 
to have." 
And whlle I was asking 
awkward questions, I asked 
Ronald Reagan. Why did 
Goody Knight attack you?" 
(Over Ronnie switching a few 
yews ago from Democrat to 
Repittlican. Ete former= 
nor of California, who 
plans to run again, referred to 
rival Ronnie as an ex-left 
winger ) "Since when has being 
a Democrat meant you were a 
left winger?" Ronnie asked me. 
His attractive wife, Nancy, said 
something about Goody a 
tired old man. "But," a 
Reagan, whose name has been 
mentioned prominently as 
R epublic an candidate for 
Governor the neat time around, 
"I era not entering a brick-
throwing contest." A pity. It's 
fascinating watching bricks 
thrown, as long as they are not 
thrown at you, 
Shll midis questions, I said 
In Robert Taylor, "It is as 
fashienable for attars to nal for 
office, how about running for 
President?" "I," said the movie 
matinee Idol Of the late 108 and 
'40s, "I rim rumba for the 
office of earthed dogcatcher." 
But I want through. "How 
about those coffee commercials 
you do with your wife on 
television? In the old days you 
couldn't get even a mond-rank 
star to do a commercial." I 
remember Claudette Colbert 
leavings show because she was 
asked to say a few kind words 
personally 
get 
about the product "Ws the 
money," rmlied Robert. "R's 
too good to re(use." 
To revert to the Producers 
Guild'n lovely bash for Alfred 
Hitchcock, there was the usual 
gam when Cary Great, who 
never attends such affairs, 
arrived to pay hanage to the 
old master of horror. But at 
that moment I was more 
nterested in the fabulous 
diamond necklace nestling 
around the neck of Maureen 0'. 
madly, I asked Maureen,r1 
tiara. With my eyes 
you go to Europe TAM you 
finish your picture at 
Universal?" ('"rhe Rare 
Breed," with Jimmy Stewart.) 
"More is ordy one place I go to 
When I fink* my pictures in 
Hollywood," the lovely redhead 
replied. "Oh, of course,. said I, 
"Memo!" She has been in love 
for a long time with that 
Mexican millionaire business-
man. "I dem% lame anyone who 
as good enough to him Ms 
boots," she told me. "I hope the 
good Lord will make it posable 
for on to many one day, then 
no one from this town will ever 
see me again." I must have 
looked hint, became Maureen 
added hastily, "You are always 
welcome to visit me. In fact, 
you can slay any lime now in 
the home I own in Mexico 
City." If there are some films 
beheg made In the neighborhood, 
I will take her up on the offer. 
They tell me that Nassau has 
retained to near normal ahem 
the departure of the Beatles for 
Europe. During their two weeks 
of location for their second 
movie, you couldn't hire a 
room, or a speedboat or a long-
dis t one e photalens. They 
haven't yet come up with a title. 
Prille6/15 Soraya paid an 
unexpected tint to Nassau, 
after visiting her good friend 
Max Schell in Lanka. Producer 
Walter Shenson, who also asks 
=nf, asked her, "Do Y. 
o continueith your 
movie career?" "I plaeatO make 
another film soon," she replied. 
And that will be aS for queen 
lions and answers today.
