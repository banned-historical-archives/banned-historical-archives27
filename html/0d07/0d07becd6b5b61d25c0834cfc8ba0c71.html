 North Vietnam has formally designated a presi-

 Hanoi has picked a convenient figurehead as president and a relative
 unknown as vice president. Neither the appointment of 81-year-old Ton Due
 Thang nor that of Nguyen Luong Bang, a long-time party stalwart, provides
 any firm clues to the real power structure in Hanoi. Although there is little
 evidence as to the relative standing of the top leaders in North Vietnam,
 there are strong indications that Communist military policies of the past year
 will continue. The armed forces' newspaper, for example, has called for a
 protracted war strategy and has urged economy of manpower and the
 maintenance of a well-trained reserve force in the North. In keeping with
 this, military activity in South Vietnam has been generally light, but an
 upsurge in Communist actions may come around 27-28 September, accord-
 ing to a number of reports.
 In Laos, on the other hand, government forces have run into stiff
 enemy resistance, especially along the northern edge of the Plaine des Jarres.
 Although General Vang Pao's weary troops have still managed to make some
 slight gains, they now are facing substantial numbers of dug-in North
 Vietnamese, and sharp Communist counterattacks can be expected after the
 rains stop late next month.
 The major upcoming event in the Communist world is the 20th anniver-
 sary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China on 1 October. Peking
 is moving forward with preparations for the celebration, but unexpectedly is
 discouraging the kind of hoopla that accompanied the 10th anniversary. This
 restrained attitude may be a result of internal disorders in the provinces, as
 well as of a number of economic problems, both of which have required
 considerable attention by the Chinese leadership. National Day on 1 October
 has traditionally been the occasion for a major leadership turnout, and
 evidence is beginning to accumulate that Mao Tse-tung, who has been widely
 rumored as incapacitated, will indeed appear as he has for all the previous
 anniversaries.

 VIETNAM
 North Vietnamese Policies
 North Vietnam announced on
 24 September that the two top
 government positions have been
 filled.   The 81-year-old former
 vice president Ton Duc Thang was
 moved up to the presidency, where
 he will serve as a convenient
 figurehead.   Thang was replaced
 as -vice president by an important
 and long-time party stalwart, Nguyen
 Luong Bang.
 Bang's appointment may have
 implications for the eventual shape
 of Hanoi's leadership, but what
 these may be is not readily ap-
 parent.   He was one of the found-
 ers of the Vietnam Communist Party,
 a member of its first central com-
 mittee,  and since 1964 has been
 head of the party control depart-
 ment, which handles party disci-
 pline.   In this capacity, he pre-
 sumably has worked closely with
 many of North Vietnam's top lead-
 ers, but he cannot be firmly as-
 sociated with any one group or
 individual.
 Communist reactions to the
 latest US troop withdrawal plans
 and President Nixon's United Na-
 tions speech were predictably
 negative.   North Vietnam and the
 Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
 ment issued formal statements
 ridiculing Washington's moves.
 They charged that the troop re-
 ductions were but "a drop in the
 bucket," designed only to dampen
 domestic opposition to the war
 while, in fact, the US was "in-
 Page  2
 tensifying" the fighting.   They
 reiterated that their "ten points"
 provide an honorable solution to
 the war and demanded a serious
 US response to them.   The Commu-
 nists may well have judged that
 a strong propaganda counterattack
 was called for to head off any
 impression that the next move is
 up to Hanoi.
 Meanwhile, there are further
 indications that the regime in-
 tends to carry on with military
 policies of the past year, at
 least for the short term.   An edi-
 torial in Hanoi's armed forces
 newspaper on 17 September called
 for the continuation of a pro-
 tracted war strategy designed to
 frustrate allied efforts in South
 Vietnam and to maintain a credi-
 ble Communist military threat in
 the field.   The editorial men-
 tioned several measures aimed at
 enhancing North Vietnam's ability
 to sustain a prolonged effort,
 including economy of manpower
 and equipment, and maintenance of
 a well-trained reserve force in
 the North.
 the Communists have do-
 livered the same protracted war-
 fare message to their forces in
 the South.           A party resolution
 appears
 to call for a strategy of low-
 key but persistent enemy mili-
 tary operations in tandem with
 political and propaganda opera-
 tions at least through early 1970.

 With its emphasis on political
 organization, the resolution ap-
 pears to represent the most sys-
 tematic effort to date to prepare
 Communist forces in the South for
 the possibility of a negotiated
 settlement.
 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 South Vietnamese reaction
 to the announcement of the second
 US troop reduction was mixed but
 generally cautious.   Several sena-
 tors as well as the army news-
 paper endorsed the decision,
 stating that it strengthened Sai-
 gon's hand at the Paris talks
 while it reflected honor on the
 Vietnamese armed forces.  A
 strongly southern-oriented paper
 said the troop reduction and the
 short halt in B-52 strikes appeared
 to be "an invitation offered to
 an adversary" for serious nego-
 tiations.
 Some vernacular papers sug-
 gested that the troop cuts re-
 sulted from pressure on President
 Nixon by Americans who believed
 that doves in Hanoi would be
 strengthened by such a gesture.
 The prestigious Chinh Luan ex-
 pressed concern that tie US might
 purposely be withdrawing troops
 faster than the Vietnamese could
 take up the slack in order to
 press Saigon either to broaden
 the government with leftists or
 to be more forthcoming at the
 Paris talks, even if this resulted
 in "dishonor to the people and
 army of South Vietnam."

 Military Developments in
 South Vietnam
 The level of Communist mili-
 tary activity remained generally
 light throughout most of South
 Vietnam this week, in part be-
 cause of heavy seasonal rains in
 the northern provinces.   Small-
 scale engagements in the vicinity
 of the Rockpile in northernmost
 Quang Tri Province, an enemy at-
 tack on elements of a US combat
 operation south of Da Nang, and
 localized, small-unit attacks on
 remote friendly positions in III
 and IV corps accounted for gener-
 ally light allied casualties.
 Many of the Communist com-
 bat units apparently have not
 abandoned plans to climax this
 year's fall offensive with further
 attacks.   Major Communist forces
 continue to prepare for combat in
 the northern provinces of I Corps.
 The equivalent of three enemy reg-
 iments together with supporting
 units is concentrated in the
 southern highlands near the Bu
 Prang Special Forces Camp in west-
 ern Quang Duc Province.   Further-
 more, most of the enemy's forces
 in northern III Corps are still
 in position to strike at key tar-
 gets north of Saigon.
 Since the Communist's fall
 campaign commenced on 11-12 Au-
 gust, it has become clear that it
 has fallen short of many of its
 intended goals as forecast in
 captured documents, prisoner in-
 terrogations, and intelligence re-
 ports.   Although specific goals
 varied from region to region, the
 drive generally has aimed at dis-
 rupting the pacification programs
 and the gradual "Vietnamization"
 of the war, while continuing to
 inflict a high rate of casualties
 on the allies.   The Communists,
 however, have not been able to
 seize the initiative in any area
 and, perhaps because they have
 not committed many of their ma-
 jor main force units in the cam-
 paign, have not scored a single
 military victory.
 Meanwhile, numerous intel-
 ligence reports allude to impend-
 ing enemy activities to take place
 within the next few weeks, possibly
 in the form of another highpoint.
 Agent reports indicate that di-
 versionary activity is being
 planned against Special Forces
 camps and other allied positions
 in the remote reaches of Kontum
 and Pleiku provinces, while the
 major enemy action in the region
 would be against allied targets
 in the Bu Prang area of southern
 II Corps.   Several agents, ralliers,
 and prisoners cite the date of
 27-28 September as the target date
 for the next upsurge in enemy mili-
 tary action.

 BURMESE EX-LEADER TRIES TO FORM OPPOSITION
 Former prime minister U Nu,
 hoping to capitalize on the gen-
 eral unpopularity of Burma's mili-
 tary government, is trying to
 develop a resistance movement to
 overthrow General Ne Win.   U Nu's
 chances of success are slim, how-
 ever, largely because he has no
 capacity for effective organiza-
 tion, but also because of the
 strong control exercised by the
 military regime.
 Deteriorating economic con-
 ditions under seven years of mili-
 tary rule have resulted in a gen-
 eral malaise, but there is no po-
 litical vehicle for mobilizing
 discontent into a united opposi-
 tion.   Burma has only a single
 party, and no others are legally
 permitted.   Ne Win, moreover, has
 been encountering increasing bick-
 ering within the ruling military
 Revolutionary Council over the
 question of permitting some ci-
 vilians to participate in the
 government.   The Council, however,
 appears to remain united in its
 commitment to Burma's home-grown
 socialism.
 U Nu left Burma for India
 last April, ostensibly on a re-
 ligious pilgrimage, and in August
 he moved to Bangkok, from which
 vantage point he announced he
 would work toward the ouster of
 Ne Win and the return of the coun-
 try to civilian rule.
 The former prime minister
 remains a popular national figure
 and might be widely welcomed if
 he were to return to Burma.   Many
 civilian leaders, however, have
 unhappy memories of his lack of
 political organization as prime
 minister, and his recent allusions
 to using force against Ne Win have

 gone to Ne Win to assure him of

 At home,  the publication of Nu's

 LAO GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FACING HEAVIER RESISTANCE
 Government forces last week
 continued to make some slight
 progress in trying to advance
 farther north of the Plaine des
 Jarres. Enemy resistance has
 stiffened, however,  and there
 are signs that North Vietnam is
 dispatching reinforcements into
 north Laos.
 General Vang Pao's weary
 troops have had only limited s c-
 cess in repeated efforts to se-
 cure the high ground north of the
 Plaine, where substantial numbers
 of North Vietnamese forces are
 dug in.   In the northwest sector
 of the Plaine and in the key area
 near the Route 7/71 junction,  gov-
 ernment units have been checked
 by several small but sharp enemy
 counterattacks.   The government
 wants to hold this area as long
 as possible to impede enemy re-
 inforcements from North Vietnam.
 On the more positive side,
 a small government element has
 advanced to within five miles of
 Muong Soui, meeting light enemy
 resistance.  Northeast of Khang
 Khav, government guerrillas oc-
 cupied a large, abandoned cave
 complex believed to be the former
 Laos.

 PREPARATIONS FOR CHINA'S NATIONAL DAY PROCEEDING IN LOW KEY
 The regime's preoccupation
 with pressing internal problems
 has resulted in a subdued ap-
 proach to the National Day cele-
 brations on 1 October.   Peking
 has set the mood for the rest
 of the country by discouraging
 the hoopla that might be expected
 to accompany the 20th anniversary
 of the founding of the republic.
 In part, the restrained mood
 stems from the fact that only a
 frELgile tranquility has been im-
 posed inside China.
 Peking probably does not want
 to jeopardize the newly imposed
 order by staging major rallies in
 Peking and provincial capitals,
 events which by their very nature

 bring crowds into the streets
 and tend to raise emotions.
 Diplomatic sources report
 that Peking intends to keep this
 year's celebrations a "family
 affair," with few invited for-
 eign guests.
 Day celebration, and a failure to
 show up this time would give sub-
 stance to reports that he is seri-
 ously ill.   The Chinese, in trying
 to counter such rumors, have been
 publicizing recent decisions they
 say were made by Mao.
 Despite the low-key approach
 Provincial radiobroadcasts              to the celebrations, Peking will
 have taken Peking's cue and are                undoubtedly exploit the occasion
 urging restraint in celebration                for its maximum propaganda value
 planning.  A recent Anhwei broad-              to help promote the commonly
 cast, for example, stated that                 heard themes of national unity
 National Day should be observed
 in a "down-to-earth" manner and
 that unnecessary expenditures
 should be avoided.
 National Day traditionally
 has been the occasion for a major
 leadership turnout.   Rumors that
 Mao is incapacitated have become
 widespread lately, and he has not
 appeared in public since 19 May.
 Mao has been absent for long pe-
 riods before, however, and has re-
 appeared each time to confound
 speculation about his health.
 He has never missed a National
 and preparedness against war.
 The regime has taken the unusual
 step of releasing separately 29
 National Day slogans, giving par-
 ticular emphasis to those slogans
 concerned with war preparations.
 This probably reflects Peking's
 growing concern over the possi-
 bility of expanded conflicts with
 the Soviet Union and also serves
 to dramatize for the population
 the seriousness of the current
 war preparations drive and the
 need to economize and increase
 production.

 Moscow has taken a small step toward re-entering the propaganda war
 with Peking. Over the past weekend TASS and some Soviet radiobroadcasts
 began issuing critical but still relatively mild. commentaries on China. This
 suggests that Moscow is becoming impatient with the lack of a positive
 Chinese response to the Kosygin overture and the Soviet propaganda black-
 out.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko's address to the UN General Assembly last
 week was in most respects unexceptional. His anti-Western remarks showed
 some restraint, however, and lie presented a more positive view than usual of
 the UN's peacekeeping potential. He gave the impression that the USSR
 intended to be forthcoming on strategic arms limitation talks but did little to
 dispel the uncertainty about Moscow's long delay in responding to US
 overtures on this subject.
 The Soviets also offered a draft convention banning the production,
 development, and stockpiling of chemical and biological weaponry. This
 ensures a hot debate at the General Assembly, as a number of other
 proposals for UN resolutions on the subject have been presented at the
 Geneva disarmament talks. The Soviet initiative will gain considerable sup-
 port, but its lack of inspection arrangements will be criticized.
 East Germany has ratified the Nonproliferation Treaty, bringing the
 number who have done so to 21. To bring the treaty into force, 22 more
 ratifications are required, including those of the US and the USSR.
 The Czechoslovak party central committee convened on 25 September
 to resolve the status of Dubcek and perhaps of as many as 60 of its 183
 members. Indications are that party first secretary Husak has imposed his
 will and there will be no major political trials, although the way will be
 cleared for a widespread purge of liberals.
 A selective purge has been threatened in Yugoslavia by President Tito,
 who has sharply condemned indiscipline at all levels of the party. The
 Yugoslav leadership is seriously concerned about widespread disregard of
 central policy directives at local levels.
 In Italy, the Chamber of Deputies has reconvened, and the government
 is preparing to face some serious questioning on how it intends to deal with a
 series of one-day, nationwide strikes.

 GROMYKO'S SPEECH TO THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 Soviet Foreign Minister Gro-
 myko's speech at the UN General As-
 sembly session on 19 September was
 one of even tone, devoid of propa-
 ganda bombast.   He spent much ef-
 fort trying to identify the poli-
 cies of the USSR with the peaceful
 mission of the UN.   In the process
 he seemed to emphasize more than
 usual the need for expanded UN
 peacekeeping efforts, and he pre-
 sented the Assembly with proposals
 apparently designed to give some
 force and substance to his remarks.
 After paying homage to the UN
 for averting the outbreak of a new
 world war, Gromyko noted that peace
 remains precarious and unstable.
 He implied that the troubles in
 Vietnam,  the Middle East,  and else-
 where were the result of a flout-
 ing of UN principles.   With respect
 to the German problem and European
 security, Gromyko laid down the ab-
 solute condition that there can be
 no advancement toward solution un-
 til the existence of East Germany
 is recognized.
 Gromyko set out the main tasks for
 examination and action by this ses-
 sion of the Assembly.   He said he
 was submitting a draft paper to the
 Assembly covering these matters,
 which he declared must be addressed
 to all states, whether UN members
 or not.
 Gromyko saved his punch on arms
 limitation and disarmament for last.
 Alluding to previous milestones in
 limiting the arms race, he said
 that further measures were needed
 to match Soviet advocacy of univer-
 sal and complete disarmament and
 a halt to the arms race.   He point-
 edly chastised "the enemy" for not
 decreasing steps toward a strate9ie
 weapons build-up.   He also said,
 however, that several important
 measures of nuclear control "are
 knocking on the door."  He ended
 by submitting for discussion a con-
 vention banning the development,
 production, and stockpiling of chem-
 ical and biological weapons and call-
 ing-for the destruction of existing
 stocks.
 Any mention of Soviet diplo-
 matic activity toward a settlement
 of the Vietnam situation was avoided.
 It is noteworthy,  too,  that the
 Soviet Union refrained from express-
 ing its usual support for seating
 Communist China in the UN.
 Under the rubric of "consoli-
 dating international security,"
 Gromyko's message was in most
 respects a standard one.   There was,
 however, the suggestion--in his re-
 peated urgings of a greater effort
 by the UN to meet the world's prob-
 lems and in his presentation of spe-
 cific recommendations--that the USSR
 wants to enlarge its opportunities
 for negotiation and detente

 LABOR POSING CHALLENGE TO ITALIAN GOVERNMENT
 A series of one-day strikes
 are posing a first test for the two-
 month-old, minority Christian Demo-
 cratic government of Mariano Rumor.
 The nationwide strikes began
 on 10 September with the 1.05 mil-
 lion metal workers employed by pri-
 vate industry.   The metal workers'
 contract was scheduled to run to
 31 December but the unions de-
 nounced it last month in order to
 advance the date for negotiation of
 a new one.   Discussions for the
 metal workers'  contract, which will
 probably set the pattern for other
 labor contracts, began on 8 Septem-
 ber but were quickly broken off.
 Other important sectors involved in
 24- and 48-hour strikes because of
 contract renewal negotiations this
 fall include chemical,  construction,
 and textile industries.   In all,
 the contracts cover at least 3.5
 million industrial workers,  about
 one half Italy's industrial labor
 force.
 With the reconvening of the
 Chamber of Deputies this week,  the
 government faces inflammatory inter-
 rogations on the strike situation.
 Thus far, the authorities have con-
 tained extremist provocations and
 only marginal violence has occurred.
 The government's major imme-
 diate concern is to help obtain a
 labor settlement conducive to con-
 tinuing Italy's economic growth,
 which since World War II has been
 exceeded among industrial nations
 only by West Germany and Japan. Man-
 agement, in both private and na-
 tional industry, is prepared to
 grant wage increases of some 25 per-
 cent over the next two years.   It
 is more reluctant to grant demands
 for such union prerogatives as the
 right to assemble on plant premises
 during working hours and the right
 to negotiate piece-work rates.
 The unions' power in Italian
 plants will increase if present de-
 mands are granted.   Union leaders
 as well as many politicians are
 stiffened in backing labor demands
 by the fear of being outflanked on
 the left by anarchist "worker power"
 elements, which reportedly inspired
 recent serious wildcat strikes

 SOVIET GRAIN
 Although weather conditions
 will continue to affect the mag-
 nitude of the grain harvest during
 the next few weeks,  it now seems
 likely that this year's harvest
 will be considerably smaller than
 that of last year.   A spokesman
 for the Soviet Ministry of Agri-
 culture, apparently alarmed by a
 recent slowing of already late
 harvesting work, has found it
 necessary to assert defensively,
 "We can firmly declare that there
 will be no repetition of 1963 and
 1965."   Both of these were dis-
 astrous years for Soviet grain
 production.
 By 15 September grain had
 been threshed on only 68 percent
 of the sown area, significantly
 less than the 90 percent normally
 harvested by this date.   The prob-
 ability is increasing that har-
 vesting work in Kazakhstan and
 Siberia will be overtaken by snow
 and winter storms.
 Unfavorable weather dealt
 its first blows to this year's
 grain harvest last winter when
 a combination of intense cold,
 hurricane-force winds, and in-
 adequate snow cover destroyed an
 unusually high proportion of the
 winter grain crop and reduced
 the potential yield of much of
 the rest of it.   Efforts to com-
 pensate for the loss of winter
 crops by increasing spring sow-
 ings also ran afoul of the weather.!
 Spring came late and sowing was
 completed 10 or more days later
 than usual.   Cool weather also
 retarded plant growth in most ma-
 jor grain producing areas through   1
 CROP  MEDIOCRE
 late spring and, in the European
 USSR, well into July.
 As early as mid-June the cen-
 tral committee of the Communist
 Party and the Council of Ministers
 evinced concern over harvest pros-
 pects by issuing a joint decree,
 aimed at facilitating an unusually
 large temporary mobilization of
 trucks and people from nonagri-
 cultural sectors to aid in bring-
 ing in the harvest.   Despite urn-
 usual efforts, harvesting began
 late and has progressed slowly be-
 cause of unfavorable weather con-
 ditions.
 During the week ending 15 Sep-
 tember, when an acceleration of.
 harvesting work was desperately,
 needed, 12 percent less grain area
 was threshed than during the pre-
 ceding week, apparently because
 the weather took yet another ad!
 verse turn.   On the 15th, grain
 remained unthreshed on about one-
 third of the area.
 The USSR has not sought to
 buy grain from the West this year,
 possibly because world grain prices
 are expected to decline further.or
 because of large domestic stocks
 accumulated in recent years and
 the anticipated availability of
 surpluses in some East European
 countries.   There is some specu-
 lation that the USSR has requested
 Bulgaria and Hungary, which havq
 not yet offered the West wheat From
 their good harvests, to hold their
 surpluses for other Communist coun-
 tries that rel   on the USSR for
 grain.

 SOVIETS CONTINUE BUYING WESTERN CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY
 The Soviet Union is continuing
 to buy large quantities of chemical
 equipment and technology from the
 free world, especially from West-
 ern Europe and Japan.  Largely be-
 cause of Soviet ineptness, however,
 the USSR is realizing less benefit
 from these purchases than Soviet
 planners had anticipated.
 The total value of contracts
 signed since 1957 for the import
 of chemical equipment is $1.4 bil-
 lion.   Orders in 1967-68 were val-
 ued                    at about $250 million.   These
 purchases represented one fourth
 of the total value of Soviet orders
 for free world machinery and equip-
 ment of all types, except ships
 and marine equipment.
 Soviet failure promptly to
 erect plants purchased from the
 free world along with other short-
 comings in construction and opera-
 tion has contributed to a decline
 in capital productivity in the So-
 viet chemical industry over much of
 the past decade.   Nonetheless, such
 plants are making a fairly signifi-
 cant contribution to Soviet chemi-
 cal output.  Many of the plants are
 for the production of synthetic ma-
 terials and fertilizers, areas in
 which Soviet technology has lagged
 far behind that of free world
 countries.
 The slow progress of the So-
 viet machine building industry in
 providing up-to-date equipment for
 the chemical industry is forcing
 the USSR to continue seeking free
 world chemical equipment and tech-
 nology.   Orders for such equipment
 are expected to continue at a high
 level at least through 1972, and
 annual purchases probably will
 average at least $100 million.
 Although Western Europe and
 Japan probably will continue to be
 the major suppliers, the US share
 of Soviet orders almost certainly
 will grow.  US know-how and/or
 equipment is being considered for
 15 of 20 chemical plants currently
 under negotiation by the USSR.   If
 contracts result, the US in most    25X1
 cases will supply technical data
 and other Western countries will
 provide the e ui ment.

 LAST AND WEST GERMANS DISCUSS MUTUAL PROBLEMS
 Recent talks between East
 and West Germany on transporta-
 tion and postal matters mark the
 first official contacts between
 the two in several years.
 The circumstances and timing
 of the meetings make it appear
 that the East Germans agreed to
 the talks at Moscow's behest.
 Pankow's action was almost simul-
 taneous with the Soviets'  response
 to an Allied demarche calling for
 four-power discussions on Berlin
 and Soviet promotion of East-West
 German talks on questions of mu-
 tual interest.   The East Germans
 appear to be mainly interested in
 collecting money rather than in
 solving inter-German problems.
 Nevertheless,  Pankow has left the
 door open for future discussions
 that could resolve some issues
 having political,  as well as eco-
 nomic, significance.
 After two years of stalling,
 the East Germans agreed to a meet-
 ing with West German Transport
 Ministry officials in East Berlin
 on 16 September.   The meeting was
 cordial and businesslike and the
 East Germans agreed to reopen a
 short West German railroad spur
 that cuts through East Germany.
 The East Germans closed the line
 in 1967 when Bonn refused to pay
 an exorbitant charge for past
 use.   The West Germans agreed to
 pay approximately a third of the
 original sum demanded plus a
 stipulated amount for future use.
 Both sides agreed in prin-
 ciple to permit inland waterway
 traffic to transit each other's,
 territory and continue into third
 countries.   At present, East Ger-
 man barges are prevented from
 exiting West Germany and continM-
 ing into Western Europe, and West
 German barges may not cross over
 into Poland or Czechoslovakia
 from East Germany.   Details of
 the new agreement are to be worked
 out next month.
 West German Postal Ministry
 negotiators who met with their
 East German counterparts on 19
 September in East Berlin failed
 to achieve any agreement on Bonn's
 compensation for Pankow's serv-
 ices.   At issue is the question
 of future annual payments of 30
 million West marks.   The West
 Germans for their part hoped to
 establish an agreed system for
 balancing inter-German postal and
 telecommunications payments and
 to improve services.   The discus-
 sion was stalemated when Bonn in-
 sisted on improvements before
 making payment and the East Get-
 mans demanded payment first.
 The West Germans proposed
 that the next meeting be held in
 the latter part of October, pre-
 sumably to prevent the negotia-
 tions from becoming an issue in
 the West German elections.   Such
 timing would also dissociate ne-
 gotiations from the East German
 request for admission to the Uxi-
 versal Postal Union during its
 meeting in Tokyo in early October.

 Israeli jets continued to strike at Egyptian targets across the Suez Canal
 during the past week, but the Egyptians still mounted military forays. Israeli
 jets also hit guerrilla bases around the Dead Sea on 25 September, but
 fighting along the Jordanian front has consisted primarily of fedayeen
 mortar attacks and artillery duels between the Jordanian and Israeli armies.
 The UN announced this week that five of the eighteen truce observa-
 tion posts along the Suez Canal have been temporarily closed. Danger to
 observers from firing incidents and encroachment by military forces were
 cited as reasons for the closures.
 Turkish national elections are less than three weeks away, and official
 circles are increasingly concerned over renewed student violence. The govern-
 ment is determined to keep the lid on student activists to avoid increased
 tension during the election period. Student extremists, however, may try to
 exploit recent student deaths to encourage the government to overreact, thus
 inviting the army to intervene.
 Greek Foreign Minister Pipinelis, who has returned to Athens after
 three months in Switzerland recuperating from a heart attack, is renewing his
 efforts to move the regime toward a constitutional government.
 Ahmadabad in western India remains under army control after a week
 of unusually severe Hindu-Muslim riots. There are no signs yet that violence
 will spread to other regions of the country, but the high tension necessitated
 a 24-hour curfew in Ahmadabad on 26 September. Prime Minister Gandhi
 flew there on the 25th, cutting short the eastern part of her tour of India.
 In East Pakistan, a violent student-government confrontation again
 appears possible. The compromise on the eve of Education Day last week is
 being widely regarded as a defeat for the government. In an effort to regain
 some credibility, the regime has summoned six student leaders to answer
 charges regarding offenses allegedly committed during the day's activities.
 The Nigerian civil war remains stalemated. In the predominantly
 Yoruba Western State, a series of clashes over the past ten days between
 farmers, who were protesting high taxes, and security forces has resulted in
 more than 50 deaths. The situation in the west is embarrassing to the federal
 government, but does not represent a threat to Nigeria's ability to continue
 the war.

 MIDDLE EAST CONTINUES TO SIMMER
 Israel's chief of military
 intelligence, General Yariv, re-
 cently explained to the US defense
 attache Israel's rationale for its
 military action against Egypt.
 Yariv made two points:   first,
 Israel intended to keep up the
 military pressure on Egypt; and,
 second, the fall of Nasir would
 be a happy byproduct of such pres-
 sure.   Yariv stressed the point
 that, although Israeli military
 operations since 9 September had
 been a shock to Egypt, both in
 materiel losses and casualties,
 they were "not enough" to accom-
 plish Israel's objectives.   He
 said that further "selective" ac-
 tions were in the offing, partic-
 ularly helicopter assaults.   Yariv
 said Nasir still was the major and

 In Cairo, Nasir is having

 military dismissals and civilian

 The US Embassy in Amman reports

 the situation.
 In the north the dissidents
 are mainly Toubou tribesmen who
 have traditionally opposed all
 authority.   A year ago, the Tou-
 bous' defiance finally forced
 Tombalbaye to call for help from
 the French.   A sizable military
 operation eventually restored Ft.
 Lamy's tenuous hold over the vast
 Tibesti area, but this month the
 government's control was chal-
 lenged anew when Toubous attacked
 a joint Chadian-French force.
 In the eastern provinces, the
 government's security forces have
 since 1965 been engaged continu-
 ously with armed bands of dissi-
 dents drawn from both the seden-
 tary and nomadic Muslim tribes of
 the area.  Many of these bands owe
 allegiance to a shadowy organiza-

 Front of Chad.   As in the north,
 administrative abuses have fed,this

 now may be getting better organized

 that the insurgents in either area
 have enlisted any significant ex-

 of a leftist military regime in
 Sudan last spring and the overthrow
 of King Idris in Libya early this

 Muslim states might seek to exploit
 the current situation in Chad by
 assisting the insurgents.

 NEw LIBYAN REGIME UNLIKELY TO MOVE AGAINST OIL COMPANIES
 Libyan dependence on oil ex-
 ports in the face of keen compe-
 tition from other oil-producing
 nations makes immediate strong
 actions against foreign oil com-
 panies in Libya unlikely.   The
 new regime will probably acceler-
 ate the policy of the former gov-
 ernment to increase the country's
 share of oil profits, however,
 which could affect the financial
 flow to the US.
 The Libyan petroleum opera-
 tion makes a large contribution
 to the US balance of payments po-
 sition.   Ninety percent of the
 oil industry there is American
 owned and operated, with a total
 investment of about $1.2 billion.
 In 1968 the US surplus with Libya,
 almost exclusively from the oper-
 ation of US oil companies,  ap-
 proached $700 million.
 The quantity of Libyan oil
 imported by the US, however,  con-
 stitutes only an insignificant
 share of total US oil consumption.
 At present about 93 percent of
 Libyan crude goes to Western Eu-
 rope.   West Germany is the largest
 single importer.   Libyan oil ac-
 counts for about one third of im-
 ported supplies in West Germany,
 Italy, and the Netherlands,  and
 25 percent of the British demand
 for crude oil.
 Foreign oil concessionaries
 were assured at the outset of the
 military take-over that oil oper-
 ations would not be hampered and,
 to date, Libyan oil production
 and exports have not been cur-
 tailed or seriously interrupted.
 Nationalization and operation of
 the oil industry by Libya at this
 time are unlikely both because of
 a lack of skilled technicians to
 maintain and operate the industry
 and because of oil marketing prob-
 lems?   it is likely, however,
 that the new regime will increase
 the involvement of the Libyan
 state oil company, LIPETCO,  in
 oil production through joint part-
 nership agreements.
 Although petroleum produc-
 tion began late in Libya as com-
 pared with other Middle Eastern
 countries, Libya skyrocketed to
 fourth among world oil producers
 and could rank third to the US
 and the USSR by next year.   Oil
 revenues are Libya's primary
 source of income, amounting in"
 1968 to $770 million of the total
 $966 million gross domestic prod-
 uct.   Libya is dependent upon oil
 revenues to finance 60 percent of
 its food supply and for all non-
 oil development activity.   Oil
 revenues have also been the source
 of annual Libyan aid of about $84
 million under the Khartoum agree-
 ment, which called for oil-rich
 Arab states to aid Egypt and
 Jordan following the Arab-Israeli
 hostilities in June 1967.

 GUINEA GAMBLES ON CONTRADICTORY POLICIES
 On 2 October President Sekou
 Toure's radical regime will cele-
 brate its 11th independence an-
 niversary along with the inaugu-
 ration of a $183-million, West-
 ern-financed mining project.
 Celebration of this larqe capi-
 talist investment in the economy
 of socialist Guinea illustrates
 the conflicting pressures that
 are forcing Toure to adopt pol-
 icies which, in the long run,
 will only add to Guinea's politi-
 cal instability.
 Since independence, Toure
 has pursued a policy of strong
 central control of the country's
 political and economic life
 through a single political party,
 the Marxist-influenced Democratic
 Party of Guinea.   Rational eco-
 nomic planning has been sacrificed
 to political expediency, however,
 and has resulted in the failure
 of Toure's economic policies.   The
 living standard of the average
 Guinean is little better today
 than it was in 1958.
 To help solve its economic
 problems, the government in 1964
 signed a partnership agreement
 with a consortium of Western com-
 panies to develop large bauxite
 deposits in western Guinea.   Pro-
 duction is to begin in 1972.
 Guinea,  as owner of 49 percent
 of the joint development company,
 expects initial profits to in-
 crease its yearly net foreign ex-
 change earnings by about one
 fourth.   Toure apparently believes
 that such partnership agreements
 will largely solve Guinea's eco-
 nomic problems and that he thus
 will not be required to reform
 the economy, where unprofitable
 state enterprises and a noncon-
 vertible currency are retained
 for political reasons.
 To gain time until production
 begins, the government this year
 negotiated with Western -and Com-
 munist creditors the rescheduling
 of its major foreign debts and
 also sought help from the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund  (IMF).   In
 return, Guinea promised to follow
 an IMF austerity program, advice
 previously considered interference
 in its internal affairs.
 While economic necessity has
 pushed Guinea toward cooperation
 with the West, political expe-
 diency has produced increasingly
 radical domestic policies.   Toure's
 reaction to popular unrest over
 economic failures has been more
 authoritarianism disguised as re-
 dedication to revolutionary prin-
 ciples.   To distract popular at-
 tention and to keep opponents off
 balance, a succession of alleged
 imperialist plots have been ex-
 posed--five this year alone.   Fol-
 lowing exposure of one such plot
 in March,Toure moved against mod-
 erates in the government and army
 in an attempt to neutralize them.
 The question is how long
 Toure can reconcile the conflict-
 ing pressures generated by his
 dual program.   The bauxite proj-
 ect is of such importance that
 Toure is unlikely to let radical
 excesses jeopardize it.   Once
 set in motion, however, the "radi-
 calization" process acquires a
 momentum which Toure may find

 BRAZILIAN TRIUMVIRATE WORKING ON SUCCESSION AND TERRORISM
 The government is concen-
 trating on finding a successor to
 ailing President Costa e Silva
 and on curbing terrorism.
 The military's deliberations
 on selecting a replacement for
 the President continued during
 the week, the leading candidates
 reportedly being Generals Sar-
 mento, First Army commander;
 Medici, Third Army commander;  and
 Albuquerque Lima, director gen-
 eral of army supply.   Medici is
 the choice of the Costa e Silva
 followers and probably of the
 majority of generals.
 The 63-year-old Medici might be
 reluctant to accept the presi-
 dency, particularly for a long
 term, because of his health and
 because of a hesitancy to replace
 his close friend, Costa e Silva.
 He would probably do so, however,
 if he believed this to be the only
 way to preserve military unity
 and the country's internal secu-
 rity.
 In any case, the army's de-
 cision must be ratified by the
 armed forces joint high command,
 and consideration may still be
 given to another candidate, such
 as General Albuquerque Lima, who
 has heavy support from younger
 officers and who is waging a
 strong campaign for the top post.
 fical pronouncement by the Presi-
 dent's doctors on his condition,
 or on his own decision to resign.
 The triumvirate's delay probably
 springs from a desire to select
 the candidate with the highest
 possible degree of military sup-
 port, as well as from the minis-
 ters' wish to have the President
 recover sufficiently to give his
 blessing to the solution.   Al-
 though Costa e Silva's close sup-
 porters are trying to hold off
 his replacement, the decision is
 likely to come in early October.
 The triumvirate fears that further
 delay might increase the insta-
 bility in both political and mil-
 itary                                      25X1
 spheres.   The type of pres-

 illustrated by an editorial in
 Rio de Janeiro's progovernment
 newspaper "0 Globo" calling for
 a rapid replacement for the Pres-
 ident, who it said would never
 be able to return to office.
 Urban terrorism remains the
 government's other most serious
 problem.   On 19 September six
 young men attacked the Brazilian
 police unit guarding the US Con-
 sulate General in Sao Paulo,
 wounding two policemen and burn-
 ing their car.   One suspect in
 the case has been apprehended.
 Security forces have also made
 some progress in finding the per-
 sons responsible for Ambassador

 CUBA PUBLICIZES NEW ANTIHIJACKING LAW
 Cuba's new antihijacking
 law, published with much fanfare
 on 19 September, provides for
 the punishment, by prosecution
 or extradition, of any person
 who hijacks aircraft or ships
 or otherwise violates immigra-
 tion regulations.   Various stip-
 ulations in the law, however,
 preclude an easy solution to
 the hijacking problem.
 The decision to issue the
 law probably resulted primarily
 from a desire to placate world
 opinion.   The recent spate of
 airplane hijackings in the Mid-
 dle East and Latin America--par-
 ticularly those involving Mex-
 ican and Ecuadorean aircraft
 on 26 July and 6 September,
 respectively--has created an
 international atmosphere of
 hostility to which Havana appar-
 ently felt obliged to react.   Al-
 though the latter two incidents
 caused Cuba much embarrassment,
 in neither case did Havana con-
 sent to demands to return the air
 pirates.
 The new law, however, indi-
 cates that Cuba is willing to
 arrange for the extradition of
 hijackers on a basis of recip-
 rocal, bilateral treaties.   Ha-
 vana hopes to undercut the OAS
 policy of diplomatic isolation of
 Cuba and would welcome treaty
 negotiations with selected indi-
 vidual Latin American countries
 as a negation of that policy.
 The law is heavily larded
 with anti-US propaganda.   It
 claims that the "US and Latin
 American lackey governments
 have promoted and encouraged the
 forces diverting and hijacking Cu-
 ban air or maritime ships."  The
 measure is written from the point
 of view that Cuba is a victim, not
 a proponent, of hijackings. Co-
 lombia's foreign minister has al-
 ready rejected the possibility
 that his government would sign an
 agreement with Cuba on air piracy.
 Ecuadorean Foreign Ministry spokes-
 men have reserved comment until
 after the measure is studied in
 detail.
 A major loophole in the law
 is Cuba's reservation of the right
 to grant asylum in -selected cases.
 The decision to grant or refuse
 asylum would be made by Cuban im-
 migration authorities.   Thus, Ha-
 vana will not be legally bound to
 return any hijacker despite any
 extradition arrangements that are
 negotiated.
 Another key facet of the liw
 is Cuba's insistence on addressing
 the problem of all illegal move-
 ment in or out of the country
 rather than just air piracy.   Spe-
 cifically mentioned was the refuge
 that the US Navy base at Guantanamo
 provides to Cuban "fencejumpers,"
 of which there were over 1,000
 last year.
 Despite the law's shortcomings,
 the mere fact that Havana chose. to
 publish it may discourage some po-
 tential hijackers.   Those persons
 running from personal problems may
 be less inclined to force a plane
 to Havana now that the Castro gov-
 ernment has gone on public record
 as being generally unfavorably dis-
 posed toward air piracy.

 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT FACES CONTINUED LABOR UNREST
 Labor unrest continues to be
 a problem for the Ongania govern-
 ment.                   Its roots are primarily
 economic, but political factors
 are involved.   The fourth general
 strike this year, now scheduled
 for 1 and 2 October,  is likely to
 increase the hostility between
 the government and workers, and
 new violence may occur.
 The principal economic issue
 involved is the government's in-
 sistence on maintaining its eco-
 nomic stabilization program in
 the face of labor's demands for
 a greater share in the country's
 wealth.   Officials maintain that
 despite contrary claims by union
 leaders, there has not been a
 major decline in most workers'
 real wages during the past three
 years,  and that in some cases
 there has actually been an in-
 crease.
 The distance between the two
 positions became manifest early
 this month, when talks on wage
 increases for 1970 began.  Union
 leaders called for hikes of 40
 percent and up, while employers
 generally limited their offers to
 5-10 percent.   Management negoti-
 ators claimed that they could not
 offer more because the government
 had prohibited large price ad-
 vances from matching wage in-
 creases.
 Earlier this month, the wage
 is-sue and other factors led to
 labor violence.   Workers struck
 the railroad that links Buenos
 Aires with Rosario, the nation's
 second largest city,  and other
 northern areas to protest the
 dismissal of employees who had
 taken part in general strikes
 earlier this year.   Extreme left-
 ists in the union urged that the
 strike be continued indefinitely,
 and called for support from other
 unions.
 A sympathy strike by the CST
 unions in Rosario on 16 and 17
 September paralyzed the city, and
 clashes between demonstrators and
 police resulted in three deaths'
 and some $8 million in property
 damage.  Army troops were called
 in to protect public services and
 railroad property, which suffered
 the greatest damage.
 A government decree placing
 the striking railroad workers,
 and any others who joined them,
 under military jurisdiction lim-
 ited the success of a nationwide
 railroad strike called in sym-
 pathy with the Rosario line em-
 ployees on 16 September.
 Although the government ap-
 parently is willing to meet some
 of the Rosario workers' demands,
 the strike is not over, and if
 the authorities take disciplinary
 actions against the union members
 it could flare up again.

 REFUGEE AND TRADE PROBLEMS TROUBLE EL SALVADOR
 Despite agreement on a num-
 ber of important issues, relations
 between El Salvador and Honduras
 have not improved substantially.
 Political pressures for a tougher
 anti-Honduran line appear to be
 building in El Salvador.   At the
 same time, political considera-
 tions are limiting the ability of
 the Honduran Government to make
 concessions.
 The  Salvadoran Government is
 coming under increasing public
 pressure to find some way to force
 Honduras to open its portion of
 the Pan-American Highway to Salva-
 doran transit trade.   Salvadoran
 industrialists have demanded that
 the government close its borders
 to Guatemala,  Nicaragua, and Costa
 Rica to force them to put pressure
 on Honduras.   President Sanchez
 resisted strong cabinet pressure
 to take this action, but indicated
 that such a step might be taken in
 two to three weeks if the problem
 could not be solved through nego-
 tiation.  Sanchez  is also deeply
 concerned about the growing mood
 of frustration and anger  stemming
 from the continued exodus of Sal-
 vadorans from Honduras.
 The Hondurans have tended to
 follow a fairly conciliatory pol-
 Page 31
 icy.   They readily agreed to re-
 deploy their troops away from the
 border, to release Salvadoran in-
 ternees, and to open telecommuni-
 cation links with El Salvador.
 The refugee issue and reopening
 of the highway, however, are po-
 litically hot potatoes.   President
 Lopez,, worried about his popular
 image, has been reluctant to op-
 pose public opinion and has not
 used his prestige to end discrim-
 ination against Salvadoran resi-
 dents or to end the boycott of
 Salvadoran products.
 `Uhe Honduran Government has
 said that it will not reopen the
 highway until the OAS agrees to
 set up machinery to process Hon-
 duran war damage claims and calls
 upon E1 Salvador to begin border
 negotiations.   The government has
 also indicated that it would en-
 able all documented Salvadoran
 residents to become naturalized
 and would facilitate the docu-
 menta-:ion of Salvadorans illegally
 in Honduras if they have Honduran
 families or have "roots" in the
 country, but that all other Sal-
 vadorans would be expelled.   In
 addition, the government intends
 to control future immigration
 carefully.

 not a good time.   The major im-
 pediments to a workable independ-
 ence for the tiny colony--Guate-
 mala's unresolved claim to the
 area and Britain's unwillingness
 to grant a security guarantee--
 loom as particularly difficult
 obstacles during the Guatemalan
 campaign already under way for
 the presidential election next
 March.
 The nationalistic rhetoric
 of the campaign could easily push
 Guatemala toward a hawkish and
 totally irrational position.
 President Mendez and the govern-
 ment's presidential candidate are
 aware of the implications of fo-
 cusing on the Belize issue, but
 cannot afford to exhibit less
 "patriotism" than the other poli-
 ticians who have already taken
 strong stands.   The Mendez admin-
 istration
 is clearly
 determined not to be the govern-
 ment that "sells out" the long-
 standing national claim to the
 poor and sparsely inhabited ter-
 ritory.
 SECRET
 Page  32   WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Premier Price is unwilling
 to back down on his promise to
 gain independence in 1970, and he
 is holding the British to their
 commitment to grant an independ-
 ence conference at British Hon-
 duras' request.   Price may use
 the Commonwealth Parliamentary
 Associations Conference scheduled
 to be held in Trinidad in October
 to present a formal request for
 independence.   In his latest pub-
 lic speech, Price pointedly de-
 scribed his policy as in no way
 dependent on or affected by the
 wishes of Guatemala, whose terri-
 torial dispute he regards as
 strictly with the British.   He
 also regards Britain'as morally
 bound    ..to see us through a
 territorial dispute that is not
 of our making and to insure us
 against any form of violence that
 might beset us."
