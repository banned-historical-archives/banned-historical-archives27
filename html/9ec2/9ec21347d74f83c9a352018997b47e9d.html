 Program.  During his career with FBIS,         has been an outstanding
 analyst of China and of Sino-Soviet and Sino-American affairs.  tie is
 widely recognized in the Intelligence Community and academia as an
 authority in these fields as well as in the methodology of media

 in origii-al sources in (:hinese, .iapanese, Russian and other languages.
 2.  the topic           as chosen for his project will draw on his
 various talents and experience in order to address a crucial issue facing
 the communist countries.  this issue--how a communist system can
 reconcile the demands of modernization with the constraints of political
 control of intellectual activity--is already a live one in China as that

 (D) PROPOSED PROGRAM
 Summary
 I propose a two-year project to examine the difficulties communist
 parties have in controlling fields of intellectual activity that
 are critical to success of modernization.  Increasingly, states
 committed to Marxist-Leninist ideologies are unable to harmonize
 the premises of their political doctrines with conclusions from
 the modern natural and social sciences that are antithetical to
 Marxism but which they must nevertheless promote to compete in the
 modern world.  Ultimately, these regimes face the critical dilemma
 of having to choose between loosening long-imposed bonds on
 intellectual activity at the expense of political control, or, for
 the sake of maintaining political control, constraining the
 development of modern science and technology necessary for their
 competitive position and security in the modern world.  Either of
 these alternatives has lasting consequences.  Understanding the
 nature of the dilemma is therefore of major importance to the
 Intelligence Community.
 For a concrete example of this dilemma, the project will focus on
 the efforts to reform China's communist system promoted by Deng
 Xiaoping since the late 1970's.  I will investigate the efforts of
 the Chinese Communist Party to define a boundary between tolerated
 intellectual diversity and forbidden ideological deviation so that
 it can establish modern disciplines of natural and social science
 inquiry as a necessary part of modernization, on one hand, and
 preserve the intellectual validity of Marxism-Leninism as the
 regime's legitimating political ideology, on the other.
 Because the dilemma is systemic in nature, all communist regimes
 face the potentially revolutionary challenges it presents in one
 degree or another.  Accordingly, the project will explore parallel
 experiences in other communist countries, and especially in the
 Soviet Union.

 Proposal
 I propose to spend two years, from April 1987 to March 1989,
 examining the course of intellectual reform in the natural and
 social sciences in China as an example of the dilemma of
 intellectual modernization facing the communist world in general.
 The project will trace the evolution of China's burgeoning
 intellectual establishment, analyze the dynamics and limits of
 intellectual reform and its impact on China's Marxist political
 ideology, and evaluate the significance of all these issues for
 China's policy making processes.
 This examination will draw on the flood of Chinese technical and
 scholarly publications that have become available openly since
 1978, on discussions with authorities in the Intelligence
 Community and in academe who have studied particular aspects of
 intellectual reform in China in recent years, and, to the extent
 possible, on interviews with Chinese natural and social scientists
 themselves.
 By way of comparison, the project will examine parallel issues as
 they have emerged in the USSR and Eastern Europe.  The Soviet
 experience is particularly rich for comparative purposes, both
 because of the USSR's longer history and more advanced
 development, and because the Soviets are themselves beginning to
 discuss new reforms of their own system.  This part of the project
 will draw on primary Soviet publications, on the expertise of
 academic and Community authorities in this country, on the small
 body of pathbreaking secondary literature on the subject, and as
 far as possible, on interviews with Soviet natural and social
 scientists in the USSR.
 The project will culminate in a book-length report, a shorter
 precis of the book's analysis and conclusions, and a
 methodological key to help understand future episodes of political
 debate on intellectual reform in China and other communist
 countries.  I believe that all of these will prove of value to the
 Intelligence Community in seeking to understand the dynamics and
 implications of the oscillating periods of "freezing" and "thaw"
 in intellectual activity both in China and elsewhere in the
 communist world.
 The Problem
 Though virtually all intellectual disciplines have traditionally
 been ideologically sensitive in communist countries, the
 implications of the natural and social sciences have been
 notoriously acute.  This is because these disciplines govern
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/01 :CIA-RDP89-011478000100090051-8
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/01 :CIA-RDP89-011478000100090051-8
 knowledge and ideas that are integrally part and parcel of
 successful modernization and at the same time present inherent
 challenges to the intellectual tenets and assumptions of
 Marxism-Leninism.  Because Marxism-Leninism as the "science" of
 human affairs claims to be consistent with the sciences, leaders
 and party theoreticians in the communist countries have sought to
 accommodate the tenets and findings of the modern sciences in at
 least three ways:
 o by distorting those aspects of the modern sciences that
 conflict with or raise questions about Marxism's premises;
 o by modifying the tenets of Marxism itself; or
 o by ignoring or obscuring the contradictions between the
 two.
 There has been ample evidence of all three types of behavior in
 China's scholarly, technical, and theoretical journals in recent
 years.  The recurring political debates over seemingly obscure
 academic issues in China underscore the difficulties that the
 reformers associated with Deng Xiaoping have had in promoting
 broader and deeper intellectual inquiry in these modern
 disciplines without undermining the legitimacy of the regime's
 political doctrines.
 There have been, for example, heated debates over the need to move
 beyond the 19th and early 20th century framework of Marx, Engels
 and Lenin and establish a new "Marxism-Leninism with Chinese
 characteristics."  These debates reflect, in part, efforts by the
 PRC's party theoreticians to assimilate 20th century natural and
 social scientific ideas--ranging from relativity and quantum
 mechanics in physics to genetics and sociobiology in the life
 sciences to Keynesian economics to the humanistic existentialism
 of Sartre.
 At the same time, there has also been an evident readiness to
 disavow the findings of scientists in the West in some areas.
 Some journal articles, for example, have gone to particular
 lengths to raise questions about experimental results that support
 the probablistic Copenhagen school interpretations of quantum
 mechanics, favoring instead deterministic "hidden variable"
 interpretations that are more consistent with the determinism of
 Marxism.  With respect to other intellectual disciplines, like
 Freudian psychology, there appears to be a schizophrenic readiness
 to accept the practical utility of some theories while rejecting
 their theoretical basis and implications for politics and society.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/01 :CIA-RDP89-011478000100090051-8
 The costs of all of these responses to the dilemma are high.  The
 erection of what Chinese intellectuals call "forbidden zones"
 around some areas of intellectual inquiry blunts the regime's
 modernization programs by crippling true research and alienating
 scientists and intellectuals in critical disciplines from the
 regime's goals.  Conversely, liberalization of the guidelines for
 intellectual inquiry opens the door to challenges to the
 intellectual validity of the regime's ideology, raises questions
 about the Chinese Communist Party's claim to authority, and so
 enhances disaffection within the party's ranks.  The consequence
 of this dynamic has been that intellectual debates have frequently
 become political controversies.
 China's party leadership has vacillated between equally
 self-defeating alternatives of intervention in intellectual
 affairs to prescribe boundaries on legitimate inquiry on one hand
 and reassurances of intellectual fxeedom on the other.  The
 notorious campaign against "spiritual pollution" of 1983-1984 and
 the pronouncement of a new, lasting "hundred flowers" era earlier
 this year exemplify the two extremes of this cycle.
 The impact of this cycle on the program of reforms sponsored by
 Deng Xiaoping has been plain.  The dramatic changes in China's
 economic and social life brought about by Deng's reforms obscure
 an underlying pattern of twists and turns in party attitudes
 toward some intellectual and social products of the reforms.
 These shifts in party attitude in turn have undermined confidence
 in the reforms among the party rank and file, intellectuals, and
 the populace at large.  If the experience of reform in other
 communist countries is any guide, failure by the Chinese Communist
 Party to resolve this cycle in favor of free intellectual inquiry
 on behalf of national goals will ultimately doom the reforms.
 This cycle of freezing and thaw in intellectual activity has taken
 a discernible toll elsewhere in the communist world.  Even though
 the sciences have commanded heavy emphasis in the Soviet
 educational system and the USSR has claimed world-class
 achievements in some areas, many fields of science in the USSR lag
 considerably behind the West.  There are many reasons for this
 lag, such as excessive bureaucratic control and intervention, an
 excessive emphasis on applied over basic sciences, and the effects
 of relying on reverse engineering of Western technology as a means
 to modernize.  One of the most important reasons, however, is that
 . there are political disincentives to pursuing innovative research
 in areas that are subversive to the regime's ideological doctrines.

 Approach and Results of the Project
 The project will consist of four main components:
 (1) A survey of the growth of China's intellectual establishment.
 This would focus mainly on the Academy of Sciences and the Academy
 of Social Sciences, reviewing the elaboration of the institutes
 within them and assessing as far as possible their interaction
 with China's party and state structures.
 (2) A detailed examination of the Chinese approach to disciplines
 that appear to offer conclusions potentially threatening to the
 tenets of Marxism-Leninism:
 ? Modern sciences: quantum theory, relativity, statistical
 physics, and cosmology; modern biology, including molecular
 and evolutionary biology; psychology, cognitive science,
 and cybernetics.
 ? Social sciences: economics, political science, sociology,
 and anthropology (disciplines that previously were denied
 existence as avenues of intellectual inquiry independent
 from Marxist political economy) and the traditionally
 tolerated disciplines of history and philosophy.
 (3) An analysis of debates among Chinese party and academic
 theoreticians on what exactly constitutes "Marxism with Chinese
 characteristics" and what should be preserved from Hiarx, Engels,
 Lenin, Stalin and Mao and what should be discarded as obsolete,
 especially in response to the challenges of the modern natural and
 social sciences.
 (4) A comparative analysis of these questions in China with their
 parallel treatment in the Soviet Union.  Many of these same issues
 have been and continue to be controversial in the USSR for many of
 the same reasons.  A substantial body of primary and secondary
 material exists on the Soviet case for comparison.  The purpose of
 this comparative effort will be not only to provide insights into
 the specific Chinese example but, more importantly, to serve as a
 springboard to understanding the aspects of the problem that are
 common to all communist countries.
 The project would produce three reports:
 ? A booklength analysis of these problems, presenting the
 conclusions and supporting evidence in detail for those in
 the Community who are interested in understanding them in
 depth;

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/01 :CIA-RDP89-011478000100090051-8
 ? A precis of the book-length study that will summarize its
 findings and judgments for a broader readership in the
 Community; and
 ? A methodological appendix that will provide Intelligence
 Community analysts with keys to understanding the dynamics
 of these critical debates and their implications for
 politics and policy.
 Contribution to Analytical Competence
 The project will allow me both to strengthen my expertise in an
 area that I have long specialized in and to extend it to areas
 that I have not previously dealt with extensively--Soviet politics
 and ideological affairs.  In doing both of these things, the
 project will significantly enhance my performance as a senior
 analyst in the DDS&T, a new position allotted to FBIS Analysis
 Group to encourage integrative analysis that illuminates questions
 that cut across the boundaries of the individual communist
 countries.
 With respect to my work on China, I?have covered a broad range
 foreign policy topics in my Agency career, but my specialty has
 been Chinese domestic politics.  With equal measures of
 fascination and frustration over the years I have watched periods
 of intellectual liberalization and repression alternate in China.
 Significant developments, like the campaign against "spiritual
 pollution" in 1983, have burst into China's leadership politics
 after a long periods of gestation in China's intellectual circles.
 The pressures of current analysis and reporting permitted neither
 time nor latitude to do more than guess at the implications of
 such controversies and sniff tentatively at which way the
 political wind appeared to be blowing.  This two-year project will
 allow me to undertake the intensive research and synthesis
 necessary to become deeply acquainted with the issues,
 personalities and dynamics of these intellectual debates, so that
 I will be able to anticipate them before they evolve into
 political controversies and to understand the import and
 implications of new controversies and their possible impact on
 Chinese development, politics, and policies.
 More broadly, the project will afford me the opportunity to begin
 work on an important question in the political life of other
 communist states, and especially in the USSR.  I anticipate that
 the understanding I gain from the project concerning parallel
 controversies in the Soviet Union will be useful in future work on
 the politics of reform and ideological change in the USSR and
 Soviet relations with other communist states and parties.

 Finally, the project will allow me to bring to bear in my
 professional career an expertise that has thus far remained
 avocational.  I spent the greater part of my college years at
 Princeton working toward an eventual career in theoretical
 physics.  While I ultimately dropped those plans and studied
 Chinese history instead, I have retained a strong interest in the
 sciences, following developments in physics, geology, and biology
 over the years.
 Relevance to National Intelligence Needs
 How the communist states struggle to modernize, how these states
 respond to the pressures of competing in the modern world, and how
 they adapt to what they recognize as a scientific and
 technological revolution in progress in the rest of the world are
 questions of paramount and enduring importance to the Intelligence
 Community.  This project offers specific analyses of these issues
 with respect to the two largest and most powerful communist
 countries and conclusions of general scope that will shed light on
 these critical problems elsewhere in the communist world.
 With respect to China specifically, the PRC's role in world
 affairs in general and its relationship to the United States in
 particular will be shaped decisively by the outcome of the reforms
 underway under Deng Xiaoping's tutelage.  Understanding the goals
 and limits of these reforms and the political obstacles to their
 implementation is relevant in both the short and long term to the
 needs of U.S. policymakers and the Intelligence Community with
 respect to the PRC.
 These same concerns apply with even greater urgency to the USSR.
 As the new Soviet leadership debates reforms of its own,
 understanding the political dynamic of intellectual and scientific
 reform will be criticial to estimating prospects for Soviet
 success.  I believe therefore that this project will contribute to
 Community analysis of both countries.
 Future Plans
 After completing this project, I would like to return to my
 present senior analyst position in FBIS.  I would like to build on
 the insights and conclusions drawn from this project by continuing
 to work on problems that cut across the national boundaries of the
 communist countries and affect the communist world generically,
 while at the same time looking more deeply into intelligence
 questions concerning both my traditional specialty, Chinese
 domestic politics, and the contemporary Soviet Union and Eastern
 Europe.

 Appendix II:
 The project will draw heavily on the broad range of journals
 published in China, especially from those under the auspices of
 the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Social Sciences.  Many of
 the materials relevant to the project remain untranslated.  FBIS
 retains large holdings of many of these journals, which I will
 supplement with from what I can find in collections at the Library
 of Congress, Harvard University, Columbia University, the Hoover
 Institution, and Berkeley and with what I can purchase directly in
 China.
 There are, in addition, a number of secondary books and journal
 articles relevant to the project that I expect to consult at
 various stages.  The following topical bibliography includes some
 of these by way of illustration.
