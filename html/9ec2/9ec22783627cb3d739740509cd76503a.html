					 	aries"]
					 	[Text)    	It  was  obaerved  at  the  25th  Congress  of  the  Communist  Party  of
					 	the  Soviet  Union  that  the  pc~licy  of  the  current  leaders  of  China  is
					 	openly  directed  against  the  ma~ority  of  the  socialist  states.    	"Further-
	   	=			   	more,"  General  Sacretary  of  the  CPSU  Central  CommiCCee  Comrade  L.   	Y.
					 	Brezhnev  said  in  the  Accountabillty  ReporC  of  the  Central  Committee  to
	   	-			   	the  party  congress,   	"it  stands  right  alongafde  the  position  of  the  most
	    	_			   	extreme  regctionaries  in  the  world,   	from  the  militarists  and  enemiea  of
					 	detent~  in  the  Western  countries  to  the  racists  of  9outh  Africa  and  the
	   	~			   	fascist  rulers  of  Chile.    	This  policy  is  not  only  completely  devoid  of
					 	socialist  principles  and  ideals;   	in  actuality  it  has  become  an  im-
					 	portant  reser~e  for  imperialism  in  its  struggle  against  socialism."
					 	Bei~ing's  feveriah  attempts  to  stop  detente,  prevent  disarmament,  and
					 	sow  mistrust  and  hostility  among  different  atates  and  its  endeavors
					 	to  provok~  a  world  war  and   	itself    	come		out  ahead  present  a  great
					 	danger  to  all  peace-loving  peoples.
					 	The  Bei3ing  leaders  use  the  Maoist  notion  of  "three  worlds"  as  the
					 	theoretical  substantiation  of  their  foreign  policy  activities.    	This
					 	conception  was  first  proclaimed  in  1974,  but  since  then  it  has  been
					 	somewhat  revised,  above  all  to  strengthen  its  anti-Soviet  orientation.
					 	According  tn  this  idea  sll  the  countries,  regardless  of  their  social			  	-
	   	-			    	orders,   	are  divided  into  "three  worlds."    	In  the  first  the  Bei~in~			     	_
	   	_			    	"theoreticians"  put  the  "superpowers":    	the  USSR  and  the  United  States.
	   	-			    	The  second  i.s  the  industrially  developed  countries   	(both  capitalist			    	_
					 	and  socialist),  and  the  third,   	of  which  Beijing  claims  leadership,   	is
				  	~     	all  the  developing  countries,   	including  those  with  the  most  reactionary,
					 	anticommunist  regimes.
					 	The  purpose  of  the  idea  of  "three  worlds"  in  its  current  form  is  to
	    	_			    	~ustify  the  policy  followed  by  the  Maoist  leadership  of  total  hostility

				     	jText]    	Dcspite  the  desires  of  the  world's  people  �or  establishment  of
				     	lasting  peace  on  earth,  militarists    	in  the  United  States  are  drawing  up

				     	aggresaive  actions  at  any  point  on  ~he  globe  ur.~er  any  conditions.
				     	In  recent  times  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  the  foreign  military  press
				     	and  in  new  regulations  and  manuals  of  the  armies  of  the  principal  capi-
				     	talist  counCries  has  been  devoted  to  the  problem  of  waging  combat  actions		     	-
				     	at  night.    	The  primary  reason  for  this  is  that,  with  the  appearance  of
				     	new  weapcrns,  night  no  longer  causes  a  decrease  in  the  level  of  combat
				     	action.    	Thus,  U.   	S.  Army  manuals  staCe  directly  that  modern  night  vision
				     	instrumenta  allow  gr~und  f~rces  to  wage  combat  actions  under  any  condi--
	    	_				tions,   	delivar  accurate  fire  strikes,  organize  cooperat3on  and  contro~,
	    	-				and  provide  aupport  to  large  and  small  units  at  night  in  pxactically  the
	    	'				same  fashion  as  during  the  day.							 	,
				    	However,   	the  use  of  night  vision  instruments  cannot,   	in  the  opinion  of			    	=
				     	foreign  specialists,   	eliminate  all  the  difficulties  that  arise  in  con-
	    	,				nection  with  the  physio~..ogical  and  psychological  characteristics  of  t?~e
				     	human  organiam.    	A~  :.~giit  the  human  being  has  a  heightened  susceptibility
				     	to  fatigue  and  aural  and  light  signals,   	the  outlines  and  dimensions  of
				    	ob~ects,  and  distances  ar~  perceived  in  distorted  form.    	As  a  result,
	    	-				a  faeling  of  uncertainty  and  even  fear  arises,   	the  reaction  to  danger  is
	    	-				diminiahed,   	the  nervous  syatem  relaxes,  and,   	f ighting  effectivenesa  is			    	_
				    	lowered.    	Therefore,  Western  military  epecialists  believe  that  victory
				    	in  night  battle  will  go  to  the  side  that  is  best  equipped  and  trained
	    	_				for  actions  in  conditions  of  complete  darkness  and  poor  visibility.    	In
				    	their  opinion,   	this  training  will  achieve  its  purpose  if  it  is  carried
				    	on  syatematically  at  night  using  the  latest  night  vision  instruments  and
				    	illumination  equipment.

				   	~killful  use  of  night  vision  instruments  ~nd  means  of  illumination~
				   	In  some  c~sea  when  the  enemy  antitank  defenae  is  comprratively  weak
				   	or  has  been  reliably  neutralized,   	a  motorized  infantry  company  at-
				   	tacka    	the  enemy  in  combat  vehicles.    	When  this  aetack  procedure  is
	 	.			 	used,   	it   	is  recommended  that  before  ~he  niRht  battle  rhe  company  com-
				   	mander  carefully  study  the  terrain  and  c:hoose  a  sector  for  the  break-
				   	through  which  does  not  h~ve  any  insurmountable  obstacles.    	All  the
	 	_			 	combat  vehic~es  ahould  be  equipped  with  night  viaion  insCrumenta  and
				   	the  drivers  must  be  tr.ained  for  actions  at  night~
				  	The  troops  should  prepare  themselves  and  go  onto  the  attack  aecretly.
				   	If  it   	is   	impossible  to  achieve  surprise,   	the  attack  is  carried  out
				  	with   	ill~~minntion  of  Che  terrain;   	it  is  recommended  that  f irst  of
				  	all   	the  enemy  be  blinded  and  his  night  vision  instruments  knocked  out.
				   	Illumination  eq~ipment  should  be  used  continuously  and  evenly.    	The
	 	-			 	illumination  is  distributed  both  in  time  and  by  place  in  the  battle
				   	formation  of  the  forward  platoons  of  the  company.    	In  this  case~  3uat
				  	as   	in  daytime,   	there  are artillery  preparations~  passages  are  made
				  	throuRh  minefields  and  other  engineering  obatructions,  and  the  attack
				   	is  carried  out  with  aupport  from  tanks~   	infantry  combat  vehiclea~  and
				  	sometim~s  also  fire  aupport  helicopters.
				  	The  success  of  night  battle  depends  greatly  on  choosing  che  correct
				  	axis  of  attack.    	To  do  this,   	spe~ialists  believe,   	it  is  essential  not
				  	only  to  completely  uncover  the  enemy's  defense,  but  also  to  study  Che
				  	possibilities  of  a  concealed  approach  to  the  line  of  attack  using
				  	woods,   	brush,  and  folds  in  the  terrain,  conaidering  that  the  enemy
				  	also  has  modern  niRht  vision  instrume~ts.
				  	The  company  commander  carefully  analyzes  all  information  from  recon-
				  	naissance  and  personal  observation  and  then  outlines  the  sector  of
				  	the  breakthrough,   	the  primary  axis  of  attack,  and  concealed  approgches
	 	-			 	to  the  line  of  attack.    	With  supporting  artillery  he  coordinates  the
				  	lines  for  opening  and  transferrinR  fire  and  the  targets  that  are  to

				   	equipment,   	is  to  improve  the  flight  tr~ining  of  Che  crews.    	As  the
				    	foreign  preas  reporCa,   	trainers  have  been  used  more  and  more  widely
				    	in  recent  yeara   	in  flight  training  in  the  U.   	S.  Air  Force~  naval
				   	aviation,   	and  army  aviation.    	Trainers  are  used  to  improve  quality~
				   	reduce  the  time  and  costs  of  crew  preparation~  and  cut  the  accident
				   	rate  in  line  units.															     	`
				   	Foreign  military  specialists  believe  that  an  improvement  in  crew
				   	training  can  be  achieved  through  simulation  and  practicing  all  stages
				   	of  flight  o~i  trainers.    	This,   	in  turn,  makes  it  posaible  to  teach
				   	personnel  the  skills  of  controlling  the  aircraft  and  its  weapons  and
				   	to  maintain  these  skills  in  periods  when  not  actually  flying.    	When
				   	pilots  are  trained  with  moc~ern  trainers,   	it  is  possible  to  use  such
				   	regimes  as  automatic  assignment  of  initial  exercise  conditions
				   	(altitude,   	distance~  velocity,   	target  aspect  angle,  and  the  like)~
				   	stepped-up  transition  to  the  starting  line  for  the  next  stage  of

		  	'		 	The  reduction  in  costs  of  flight  personnel  training  uaing  trainers
				   	resulta  from  the   	fact  that  nne  hour  of  training  on  a  trainer  costs
				   	less  than  in  an  airplan~  or  nelicopter  and  the  monthly  flying  time
				   	of  crews  can  be  reduced.    	It  was  reported  in  the  foreign  press  that

						(Excerpt]    	In  recent  years  the  United  StaCes  and  the  oCher  capitalist
						countries  have  done  a  good  deal  to  modernize  existing  means  of  rescu-
						ing  crew  members  of  military  airplanea  and  helicopters  and  to  devise
						new,  more  effective  means.    	The  reason~   	say  foreign  specialisCa,   	is
						Chat  despite  the  fact  that  aviation  units  and  subunita  are  receiving
						increasingly  sophisticated  flying  craft~   	loases  of  aviation  equipment
						and   	flight  personnel  are  increasing  year  after  year.    	For  example~
						in  the  U.   	S.   	Armed  Forces  alone  there  were  367  flight  accidents  in
						1975  resulting  in  the  destruction  of  239  airplanes  and  helicopters.
						In  addition~   	the  experience  of  so~-called  local  wara  demonstrated  that
						existing  means  for  reacuing  ttie  crew  membera  of  aircraPt  that  are  shot
						down  are  inadequate  to  modern  needa.
						Considering  all  these  factora,   	as  well  as  the  great  cost  of  aviation
						equipment  and  the  difficulty  and  length  of  time  required  to  train
						flight  peraonnel  to  fly  modern  airplanes  and  helicopters,  military
						specialists  in  the  United  States  and  the  other  members  of  the  aggrea-
						sive  NATO  bloc    	are  giving  great  attention  to  devising  means  of  pilot
						r~scue.    	These  devices  are  subdivided  into  two  primary  groups,  those
						for  abandoning  the  aircraft  and  those  Por  saving  pilots  who  have
						abandoned  their  aircraft.    	The  former  group  includea  parachutes  and
						ejection  seats.    	The  second  group  is  further  divided  into  three  aub-
						groups:    	survival  and  life  support  means  (inflatable  life  jackets,
						protective  suits~  boats,  supplies  of  food  and  water,  medications~  and			  	=
						other  special  packagea);  signal  devices   	(emergency  radio  sets  and
						radio  beacona,  optical,   	light,   	and  smoke  aignalling  devices);  and
						means  to  deliver  pilote  from  sircraft  that  have  been  shot  down  to  the
						position  of  friendly  troops.    	In  the  opinion  of  foreign  specialista,
						the  increasing  costs  of  building  and  introducing  these  devices  will
						be  repaid  because  they  will  save  the  lives  of  experienced  pilots  who

				    	is  provided  by  antisub  airplanea~   	submarines~   	surface  ahipe,   	and  heli~
			    	,		copters.    	American  apecialists  believe  that  tiie  main  problem  for  a  sub~
				   	marine  that  intends  to  attack  the  aircraft  carrier  with   	torpedoes
				   	will  be  its  speed,    	But  increasing  the  speed  of  the  submarine  itself  in
				    	order  to  occupy  a  position  for  the  attack  increases  the  likelihood  that
				    	it  will  be  detected  by  eacort  forces.
				    	In  all  stagea  of  activiCy  of  the  carrier  group~   	close  and  distant
				    	zones  of  antisub  aefense  are  usually  organized.
				    	The  close  screen~  which  is  provided  by  close  escort  ships  and  carrier-
	  	_			  	based  helicopters~   	is  usually  circular~    	Where  there  are  not  enough
				    	escort  ships  their  place  can  be  taken  by  antisub  helicopters~  and  if
				    	necessary  an  atomic  submarine  may  be  included  in  this  force.    	The  pri-
				    	mary  mission  of  the  close  screen  forcps  is  to  prevent  an  enemy  sub~
				    	marine  from  carrying  out  a  torpedo  attack.    	In  the  opinion  of  many
				    	foreign  specialists~   	submarines  should  be  detected,  attacked~  gnd  des-
				    	troyed  mainly  on  the  crossing  route  of  the  carrier  group  by  mixed  avi-

	  	-			  	(shore  and  carrier  based),deck-based  helicopters~  atomic  submarines~
				    	and  surface  ships.
				    	When  an  aircraft  carrier  group  is  deployed  for  a  crossing  at  fairly
	  	-			  	high  speed   	(more  than  20  knots),   	the  escort  is  reinforced  in  the  for-			   	-

				     	a  magnetic  detector  are  used  for  more  precise  determination  of  the
				     	submarine's  position.    	Radiosor.ic  buoys  may  be  set  down  along  a  closed			   	-

			   	-	  	course  of  the  submarine.    	When  using  a  magnetic  detector  planes  fly  at			   	-
				     	the  minimum  safe  altitude   	(about  30  meters).
				     	In  the  search  for  submarines  helicopters  usually  follow  encirclement
	    	_			 	tactics  in  which  they  occupy  positions  in  a  small  circle  that  covers
				     	the  presumed  location  of  the  sub  and  then,  maneuvering  in  spirals,
	    	-			 	converge.    	They  examine  the  region  using  dipping  sonars,  periodically
				     	hovering  at  altitudes  of  4-6  m  above  the  surface  of  the  water  at  the
				     	places  where  ehe  sonars  have  been  dipped.
				     	In  the  opinion  o.f  foreign  specialists  antisub  helicopters  have  the
				     	following  advantages  over  surface  ships:    	greater  speed  in  examining
				     	a  region,   	the  possibility  of  surprise  appearance  above  a  submarine				   	-
				     	and  establishing  contact  before  the  sub  can  evade  detection,   	and  the
	    	-			 	ability  to  track  a  fast-moving  target  for  a  long  time.    	Among  the
				     	shortcomings  is  the  difficulty,  and  sometimes   	impossibility,  of  using
				    	helicopters  in  bad  weather.
				    	Wtten  surface  ships  search  for  submarines  it  is  considered  that  the
	    	_				sonar  transmissions  of   	the  surface  ship  can  be  detected  under  the
	    	_				water  at  a  much  greater  d~.stance  than  the  ship  can  detect  its  target
				     	(submarine),  and  thus  the  submarine,  upon  learn.ir.ig  that  it  is  being
				    	hunted,   	can  take  steps  in  time  to  e~ade  a  meeting  with  the  escort
				     	forces.    	Therefore,   	foreign  naval  specialists  think  it  is  wise  for
	    	-				only  the  close  screen  forces  to  use  sonar  sets  and  comple~es  in  the
				    	active  mode.    	It  is  recommended  that  the  surface  ships  o~  the  distant

				  	The  Mediterranean  Sea  is  the  connecting  link  among  three  continents~
	  	-			 	Europe~  Africa~   	and  Asia.    	Tnternationally  important  sea  and  air  routes

				  	of  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  and,   	through  ehe  Suez  Canal,  with
				  	the  countries  of  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Indian  Ocean  region.    	It  is
				  	near  the  rich  oi1  deposits  of  the  Middle  East,  which  repreeent  70  per-			   	-
				  	cent  of  the  explore~  reserves  of  the  capitaliet  world.    	According  to
				  	reports  in  the  foreign  presa~   	each  year  more  than  20b  million  Cona  of
				  	petroleum  is  transported  across  the  Mediterranean  Sea.    	Wt~en  the  Suez
				  	Canal  was  closed  many  petroleum  pipelines  were  brought  directly  to
				  	Mediterranean  ports.
				  	U.   	S.   	imperialist  circles  consider  the  Mediterranean  Sea  region  and
				  	the  territory  ad~acent  to  it  as  a  good  base  of  operations  for  posaible
				  	direct  acts  of  aggression  against  the  USSR  and  other  socialist  countries.
	 	'				Durin~  World  War  II  American  ships  in  the  Mediterranean  landed  troops

				  	France.    	In  1945  the  U.   	S.   	naval  command  left  a  emall  force  of  ships
				  	in  the  Mediterranean  to  support  American  troops  in  Italy.    	The  head-
				 	quarters  of  thia  force  was  ~~cated  on  a  destroyer  mother  ship  based  in
	 	"				Naples.    	In  August  1947   	this  mother  ship  was  replaced  by  a  cruiser.
				 	On  1  July  1948  U.   	S.   	naval  forces  in  the  Mediterranean  were  officially
				 	reorganized  as  the  Sixth  OperaCional  Fleet.
				 	The  U.   	S.   	Sixth  Fleet  took  final  form  in  1950.    	It  includes  surface
				 	ahips~   	submarines,   	and  subunits  and  units  of  naval  aviation  and  marinea.

	   	-			 	weapons  to  targeta  at  up  to  1,800  kilometere  from  the  aircraft  car-

				    	of  American  military  specialists,   	is  itr,  high  mobility  which  makes  it
				    	poasible  for  the  task  force  to  move  up  to  600  miles   	(about  1~100
				    	kilometers)   	in  24  hours.

				    	craft  carrier  groups  operate  aeparately  about  400  miles  from  one
				    	another.    	Each  day  planes  from  the  carrier  perform  about  120  takeoffa

				   	Judging  by  material  in  the  foreign  press~   	70  percent  of  the  airplanea			     	-
