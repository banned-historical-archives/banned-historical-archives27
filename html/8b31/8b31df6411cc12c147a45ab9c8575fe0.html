 1.   THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN CHINA
 With the July plenum of the Chinese Communist
 Party's Central Committee, Peking has moved to set
 its internal house in order.   The plenum marked the
 end of a period of transition following the death of
 Mao and the resolution of a number of troubling
 political problems--a significant advance after a
 period of considerable behind-the-scenes wrangling.
 A sense of direction and purpose has been imparted to
 Chinese political institutions and current problems are
 almost certainly not as acute as those that have
 agitated Peking and the provinces in the past several
 years.
 The second "rehabilitation" of Teng Hsiao-ping,
 perhaps China's most experienced administrator,
 establishes a triumvirate of leading officials who
 seem generally agreed on broad policy issues, the
 other members of this group being Party Chairman Hua
 Kuo-feng and Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying.   But
 problems of the distribution of power among China
 leaders have still not been settled. Some degree of
 additional contention is likely; it is impossible to
 remove the consequences of 10 years of bitter political
 struggle overnight or to adjust to the loss of two such
 towering leaders as Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai easily.
 Teng seems likely to replace Hua as Premier later this
 year; he may already be in day-to-day charge of the
 running of the country.   A Teng "administration" will
 probably be fleshed out at the 11th party congress--
 which may well take place before Secretary Vance's
 visit to China--and above all at a National People's
 Congress, which will endorse a governmental program and
 economic strategy, probably this autumn.
 Economic and Party Building
 The outlines of this program and strategy are al-
 ready clear.   Generally they are those set forth in 1975,
 when Teng was last in power, and which were discussed in
 some detail during the leftist-inspired criticism campaign
 against Teng in 1976.   This program has two central
 features:   strengthening the party machinery, and
 pragmatically building the economic infrastructure
 25X1

 Approved For Release 2005/0
 so as to "catch up with the West by the end of the
 century "  Neither of these tasks is easy, and both
 are obviously long-term undertakings.   Much of the
 preliminary spade-work in setting the parameters of
 the program has already been undertaken, at a series
 of "work conferences," even in advance of the recent
 plenum.   None of these meetings appears to have been
 characterized by the deep political divisiveness that
 was a hallmark of the period from the end of the
 Cultural Revolution through the death of Mao, but they
 have revealed differences of emphasis among China's
 leaders and interest groups which could contain the
 seeds of new--although probably controllable--disagree-
 ments.
 Party Problems
 Strengthening the party machinery implies a return
 to the authoritarian methods and values of the early
 1960s, or even of the 1950s, when the Soviet "command"
 style was in vo ue.   Discipline is being emphasized,
 and the somewhat ramshackle post-Cultural Revolution
 party structure tightened.   The fact that the upper
 echelons of the party are now more philosophically and
 ideologically compatible than was the case when the
 "gang of four" and their close supporters were on the
 scene should facilitate this process:   factionalism,
 both in Peking and in the provinces, has been reduced.
 In fact, China's 29 provinces are in better shape
 than at any time since the end of the Cultural Revolution
 in 1969.   All of the provinces have a clearly designated
 chief, a situation that had not obtained in six years.
 Nearly all of the provinces have undergone some re-
 shuffling in their leadership groups since the fall of
 the "gang of four" in order to strengthen the provincial
 leadership and make it more responsive to direction from
 Peking.   Most of the new officials in the provinces are
 veteran officials who share Peking's concern for disci-
 pline and firm party control and are associated for the
 most part with Teng or Hua.   Teng's supporters are more
 numerous.
 Historically, however, emphasis on discipline and
 tight control has invariably produced countervailing
 Approved For Rele4
 25X1
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2005/
 pressures and restiveness among those excluded from a
 direct share of real power.  Moreover, as power continues
 to gravitate into the hands of experienced party bureau-
 crats, two major fault lines in the structure of power
 are likely to widen.   The first of these cleavages is
 the perennial left-right dichotomy.   Leftists in the
 upper levels of the party have been largely, although
 not entirely, removed.   At lower levels, however, they
 still remain relatively numerous, although a distinct
 minority and largely powerless.   in a party of over
 30 million members they must number in the hundreds of
 thousands, if not the millions, and obviously cannot be
 removed wholesale without massive purges which the Hua
 regime seems disinclined to employ.   They are likely to
 remain a source of some friction and a focus of dis-
 content.
 The second cleavage is a generational one.  With a
 renewed emphasis on "experience," younger party members
 are finding themselves increasingly excluded from
 important decision-making posts.   This problem is likely
 to be solved only by the attrition through death of the
 older,  "revolutionary" generation which took part in the
 Long March--a process already well under way.
 Economic Construction
 Even greater emphasis is being put on economic con-
 struction, which in fact seems to be the centerpiece of
 the new leadershi .   Here again a return to the methods
 and priorities o  the early 1960s  (when China was re-
 covering from the disasters of the Great Leap Forward)
 seems envisaged.  But because Peking is working on
 relatively narrow margins, as a result both of popula-
 tion pressure on the land and China's comparatively weak
 economic base relative to its size, economic choices are
 particularly difficult and allocation problems acute.
 Li Hsien-nien, the Politburo member who was in charge
 of day-to-day governmental operations prior to Teng
 Hsiao-ping's formal rehabilitation last month, has held
 surprisingly frank discussions with foreigners in recent
 months, describing wrangling over allocation of budgetary
 and other resources.
 Nevertheless, in a number of areas basic decisions
 appear to have been made, an  in others at least temporary
 25X1

 25X1
 compromises which may leave no interest group completely
 satisfied seem to have been reached.  Without such
 decisions it probably would have been impossible to have
 held last month's plenum.   It is, for example, clear
 that great emphasis will now be placed in development of
 and training in science and technology--an area which
 has languished since the onset of the Cultural Revolution
 over a decade ago, but one which is obviously of central
 importance in any determined and long-term effort to
 modernize and develop the Chinese economy.
 Emphasis on this area clearly implies a greater
 willingness to acquire advanced technology and ancillary
 know-how from abroad, and in fact leading Chinese officials
 have stressed China's needs and interests in this regard,
 especially in recent weeks.   There are, however, almost
 certainly residual political constraints on how far Pe ing
 can pursue a program of imports from abroad, and these
 constraints are reinforced by limited absorbtive capacity
 in some technological fields as well as by a relative
 shortage of hard currency.   In 1975 Teng Hsiao-ping seemed
 prepared to relieve the latter problem through oil sales
 abroad, but growing industrialization has already begun
 to sop up a significant portion of surplus Chinese oil
 supplies.
 The outcome of debate over the relative weight to
 give agricultural development as against industrial
 development is somewhat less clear.   Since the failure
 of the Great Leap Forward, primary emphasis has been on
 agriculture, but in 1975 Teng Hsiao-ping appeared to
 argue for relatively greater attention to industry,
 especially in such basic fields as steel and coal pro-
 duction.   Discussion of this issue in the spring and
 early summer was somewhat muffled, but Teng, who un-
 doubtedly was influential behind the scenes even before
 his "rehabilitation," can be presumed to have repeated
 his earlier arguments.  A shift toward a somewhat greater
 emphasis on industry seems to be     in  place, but  agri-
 culture almost certainly still remains in first place.
 The agricultural field is one with which Hua Kue-feng
 has been closely associated.

 Civilian Versus Military
 Even more difficult allocation problems almost
 certainly continue to exist with regard to the civilian
 and military sectors of the economy.   Public debate on
 this issue was quite sharp throughout the first half of
 this year, highlighting the third major line of cleavage
 in the Chinese body politic--that between civilian and
 military institutional interests.   Differences on this
 issue may well have been exacerbated by the fact that
 the military establishment played a large part in over-
 throwing the "gang of four," and therefore felt itself
 to be in a position to demand a greater portion of the
 budgetary pie.   Some temporary accommodation probably
 was reached prior to the July Central Committee plenum,
 although it is unlikely that the issue has been settled
 permanently.   This compromise seems to-call for alloca-
 t-igns to the military at a rate proportional  to current
 budgetary distributions, although this "current" rate
 may already reflect a small decrease in the sums allotted
 e militar
 This issue has already involved the top leaders of
 the regime, and is likely to continue to do so.   Hua
 Kuo-feng was an early advocate of maintaining a cap on
 military spending, particularly in the period immediately
 following the fall of the leftists last autumn.   Prior
 to the recent plenum, however, Hua was to a considerable
 degree dependent on military support as a primary source
 of political strength, and probably not in a good position
 to press his case.   Li Hsien-nien, the regime's chief
 economic expert, has long been an advocate of balanced
 economic growth, which requires primary budgetary attention
 to the civilian sector.   The position of Teng Hsiao-ping
 is somewhat more equivocal.   He too is an advocate of
 balanced growth, but in 1975 he drafted an ambitious
 program of military modernization which combined a degree
 of administrative pruning (and consequent savings) with a
 considerable outlay for conventional weapons.   Teng seems
 to have the confidence of a considerable portion of the
 military establishment, and thus is ina good position to
 work out any necessary compromises.   Significantly, the
 recent plenum restored him to the post of PLA chief of
 staff, thereby placing a civilian in a crucial military
 slot.

 Military Fissures
 Although most military leaders can be assumed to
 desire a relatively large budgetary allotment for the
 PLA and to jealously guard the prerogatives of the
 military establishment in general, this pivotal in-
 stitution is as divided as is the civilian sector.
 Differences in viewpoint divide severely professional
 soldiers from those who believe the military has a role
 to play in politics, and those who stress technical com-
 petence and weapons modernization from those who emphasize
 morale and motivation of the individual soldier.  Personal
 rivalries, some of them exacerbated by the factionalism
 of the Cultural Revolution--a problem that also obtains
 in the civilian party--also exist.   Of the four active
 full members of the Politburo from the military, two
 strongly supported him.   One of these, the commander
 of the Canton Military Region may have played a crucial
 role in Teng's "rehabilitation."
 Political Legitimacy
 None of the problems outlined above
 most are the legacy of the long years of
 turmoil that began with the Cultural Rev
 is new, and
 political
 olution.   In
 fact, at the recent plenum, the new leadership moved
 some distance toward solving the new and central problem
 that was a direct outgrowth of the death
 of Mao and of
 the purge of the  "gang of four"--that of
 its own
 political legitimacy.   Hua Kuo-feng has
 been able to
 claim that Mao annointed him for the succession before
 his death, but this claim has in large part rested on a
 single rather ambiguous remark Mao made in the last
 year of his life. The party Central Committee--a body
 elected while Mao was still alive, albeit purged of
 its leftist membership--has now confirmed him in the
 post of party Chairman, an act which finally legitimizes
 the semilegal "coup" of last October.  Moreover, Hua
 has considerable control over the Maoist legacy through
 his role as editor of the "collected works" of the Great
 Helmsman.   The usefulness of this role can be seen in the
 recent emphasis which propaganda has placed on statements
 of the late leader which date from earlier, more construc-
 tive phases of his political career, rather than on
 those dating from his erratic and dogmatic last years.

 Much of the baggage of those later years is an
 embarrassment to the current Chinese leadership, with
 its relatively pragmatic outlook and its emphasis on
 economic construction rather than mass agitation.
 For purposes of unity and continuity--and possibly
 to avoid charges of de-Maoification--attention is
 given to certain aspects of the Mao legacy.   However,
 comparatively little was said about the late leader
 at the recent plenum, a circumstance that is likely
 to be repeated at the upcoming Party Congress, when
 ertwhile victims of the Cultural Revolution are likely
 to be elected in fairly large numbers to the new
 Central Committee.   The plenum did, however, handle
 the ambiguous Maoist legacy with considerable adriot-
 ness in its treatment of Teng Hsiao-pings's  "rehabilita-
 tion."  The meeting chose formally to reinstate Teng
 to all his former posts, rather than simply declaring
 the leftist-inspired purge of Teng in 1976 null and
 void; it thus avoided a direct repudiation of the late
 leader, who was on record endorsing the purge.
 The Power Equation*
 The action of the plenum does not completely dis-
 pose of problems connected with the controversial Ten g,
 however.   Teng's return to power--for an unprecedented
 second time, and at a pace faster than that apparently
 envisaged by Hua Kuo-feng last spring--speaks eloquently
 of the wide support he enjoys in the middle and upper
 levels of the party and military bureaucracies.   Momen-
 tum seems to be running with Teng; his power appears to
 be growing, while that of Hua has relatively declined.
 If Teng gains the premiership at the upcoming National
 People's Congress, he will succeed to a post now held
 by the Chairman himself.   Indeed, Hua is now both Chair-
 man and Premier precisely because Teng, who seemed
 certain to gain the latter and possibly to succeed to
 the former post, fell to leftist pressures a year and
 a half ago--a fact which few in China seem to have for-
 gotte

 Of the four Politburo members who comprised the core of
 opposition to Teng's early return to power, three at
 least played a part in his downfall in early 1976.   They
 all appeared to fear the consequences of Teng's return
 for their own positions .   Hua himself of course also
 had ample reason to delay.
 Through the first half of 1977, Hua played this
 difficult situation with considerable adroitness.
 Despite public and private agitation for Teng's early
 return, he managed to have the issue postponed at a
 party "work conference" last spring and subsequently
 attempted to repeat Mao's classic tactics of balancing
 between opposing forces by patronizing the Teng oppo-
 sitionists throughout the late spring.   Hua was unable
 to capitalize on this situation, however.   Ministerial
 and provincial appointments appear to go almost ex-
 clusively to individuals with close ties to Teng.                                   The
 current, abbreviated Politburo Standing Committee con-
 sists of Hua, Yeh Chien-ying, and Teng--the latter two
 both party elders with similar outlooks who have shared
 similar experiences over many years.   The upcoming Party
 Congress is almost certain to add Li Hsien-nien, a man
 of similar background, in the fourth position; while
 other, younger men will probably also be added.   There
 is still a strong likelihood that Hua will be at least
 partially hemmed in by strong minded party elders who
 have closer ties among themselves than with the new
 s3hai.rman .
 1          -
 The problems inherent in this situation are po-
 tential.   In the shorter run the results of the recent
 plenum suggest cohesion rather than division.   The fact
 that a way has been found -to bring Teng back into the
 leadership in a manner that does minimal damage to Hua
 and perhaps to others who opposed the controversial
 administrator's return indicates that compromise rather
 than the confrontations of the recent past has a strong
 attraction to China's present leaders.  Moreover, there
 are still a number of factors working in.Hua's favor.
 The actuarial tables are one such factor  Hua is
 significantly younger than the party leaders who surround
 him   His political suppleness is also helpful, as is
 the apparent fact that he has not made strong and implacable

 enemies.   Above all, the country is weary of incessent
 political infighting, a sentiment shared by much of
 the party's leadership.   Several of these points were
 touched on by Yeh Chien-ying in his 1 August Army Day
 speech.   Yeh, who is not only formally the number-two
 man in the regime but is genuinely respected by nearly
 all elements in the complicated political equation, has
 shown special concern for political stability and unity.
 He appears to have spent much of the past year attempting
 to heal political wounds both in the military and in the
 party.   Yeh is 79, however, and in uncertain health.
 There is no replacement for him of similar stature on
 the horizon.
 Impact on Foreign Affairs
 Neither the uncertainties of the past 10 months
 regarding the distribution of political power nor the
 transformation of domestic policy have had significant
 effect on Chinese foreign policy, although, as noted
 above, both imports of foreign technology and foreign
 trade in general are likely to increase.  opposition
 to the Soviet Union is the strongest and least blemished
 .-aspect of the Maoist legacy.   From time to time over
 the past several years there have been hints in Chinese
 propaganda and elsewhere that at least some Chinese
 leaders would welcome a less bellicose policy toward
 Moscow; if such a group exists, it has had no observable
 effect on Chinese policy in the past ten months.   In
 some respects relations with the Soviets have actually
 declined since Mao's death.   In fact, any change in
 attitude toward Moscow, which would have considerable
 internal as well as international repercussions, may be
 an issue of such divisiveness and volatility that no
 Chinese leader wishes to address it at this time.   China's
 attitude toward the United States during this period has
 apparently been almost entirely a function of its per-
 ception of US foreign policy, particularly with respect
 to the USSR and to China itself.   There are some indica-
 tions that the Chinese may have wished to set their
 domestic house in order the better to deal with any
 decisions that may have to be made in the wake of
 Secretary Vance's visit.   They may also have wished
 formally to restore Teng Hsiao-ping, who was the
 principal Chinese negotiator in the Sino-US talks of

 tinuity to the discussions.   Finally, it is possible

 II.   THE HUA-TENG RIVALRY
 The death of Mao Tse-tung in September 1976 has
 left the Chinese leadership with an unresolved succession
 problem centering on the distribution of power between
 Hua and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Hua could not have claimed Mao's mantle had Teng
 not been ousted from power in January 1976 largely
 through the efforts of the left.   Thus, the purge of
 the "gang of four" in October 1976 not only challenged
 the legitimacy of the move against Teng but, by ex-
 tension, cast doubt on whether Hua rightfully belonged
 at the top.   There were indications that after the
 purge'of the leading leftists, Teng's supporters began
 to move almost immediately to lay the groundwork for
 his return.   Hua's supporters were equally quick to
 launch a defensive propaganda effort aimed at separating
 Hua's rise from Teng's fall by making it appear that
 Mao had tapped Hua well before Teng's troubles began.
 Hua, aware of the threat to his position posed by
 a rehabilitated Teng, worked adroitly to diminish that
 threat.   In the immediate aftermath of the purge of the
 "gang of four" Hua appeared to be a captive of the
 party's right wing, including the military, which had
 remained loyal to Teng.   Since then, however, Hua has
 worked to develop a centrist position more independent
 from pro-Teng rightists such as Defense Minister Yeh
 Chien-ying and Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien and to cul-
 tivate the image of a man in the center of the political
 spectrum who saw beyond personal political rivalries
 to the major policy questions facing China.   At the
 same time, he did not actively oppose Teng's return
 but did seek to delay it long enough to consolidate his
 own position, in part by attempting to build up others
 in the leadership with centrist credentials who shared
 his reservations about Teng.
 These efforts, however, fell short of achieving
 the intended results, and Hua still lacks the kind of
 independent, influential power base enjoyed by Teng.
 It is Teng's position, not Hua's, that has been
 25X1

 strengthened by recent appointments to posts in the
 provinces and national government.   Moreover, the
 restoration to Teng of all of his former positions
 at last month's Central Committee plenum gives Teng
 a wider array of important posts in the military,
 party, and government than any other top leader in-
 cluding Hua.   The question of the premiership, a
 post Hua now holds, remains open.   But the flow of
 events suggests that Hua will not be able to retain
 this position, which had been earmarked for Teng by
 Chou En-lai as early as 1972.
 Hua continues to serve in a crucial capacity as
 a compromise "first among equals" and, as Mao's
 designated heir, is a bridge between the Maoist past
 and the legacy of Chou--upon which the current leader-
 ship is drawing to legitimatize its policies of rapid
 national development.   The question now at hand is
 whether present political arrangements will prove
 durable enough to allow Teng and Hua to coexist over
 an extended period.   The manner in which the restora-
 tion of all of Teng's former positions last month was
 carefully balanced with the confirmation of Hua as
 party chairman attests to the sensitivity of having
 both in the leadership at once.
 Important segments of the leadership apparently
 were willing to risk any divisiveness Teng's return
 could cause to gain his needed administrative skills
 and wide-ranging experience.   Teng is already in strong
 position and this time there is no towering figure like
 Mao or Chou to keep him in check.   Over the longer run,
 it seems likely that more and more power will end up in
 Teng's hands and that Hua will have an uphill fight to
 retain a significant political role.

 III.   CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY*
 There has been no major change in Chinese foreign
 policy since the death of Mao and the overthrow of the
 ''gang of four''  last year.   China remains preoccupied
 with its opposition to the USSR, and this has led Peking
 to stress state-to-state relations at the expense of
 revolutionary rhetoric.   In fact, Chinese foreign policy
 has taken on a distinct ''enemy of my enemy is my friend'
 cast as Peking retains relations with Chile, stresses
 close ties with Iran, and invites out-of-office anti-
 Soviet politicians such as Franz-Joseph Strauss and
 Edward Heath to China for what are state visits in all
 but name.
 From China's point of view, this past year on balance
 brought a somewhat more favorable outlook to its foreign
 policy than the year before.   In Northeast Asia, relations
 with North Korea remain close and Peking has not let the
 lack of progress on the Treaty of Peace and. Friendship
 with Japan affect its important economic ties to Tokyo.
 In Southeast Asia, China appears more optimistic than
 a year ago about its relations with Vietnam.   The Chi-
 nese are also encouraged by trends in South Asia set in
 motion by the advent of a less Soviet-leaning government
 in India.
 Peking's continued successful cultivation of better
 state relations with Yugoslavia--to go with its cordial
 ties to Romania--is a marked gain in Eastern Europe.
 After two years of reverses in Africa, Peking is ex-
 ploiting Soviet troubles to restore and expand its in-
 fluence.                                 The Chinese were encouraged by African regional
 cooperation in quelling the Shaba invasion and by the
 assistance some European states extended to Zaire.
 Although China's influence in the Middle East is
 quite limited, Peking is encouraged by Soviet losses in
 Egypt and the Sudan.   Always interested in Western Europe
 as a counterweight to the USSR, Peking now looks forward
 to increased trade both to firm up bilateral relationships
 and to gain industrial imports and technology.
 Problems persist in Chinese foreign policy, however.
 There is continued stagnation in Peking's political relations

 States are handled in separate papers, which follows.

 with Japan.   China has an abiding suspicion of Viet-
 namese ambitions in Southeast Asia.   The Chinese have
 lost some influence in Ethiopia and are engaged in an
 embarrassing ideological quarrel with Albania.   They
 are also worried about the possible effects of Euro-
 communism on NATO.   Despite these difficulties, the
 Chinese view the world setting as having moved a bit
 toward its advantages.
 Peking's new leadership continues to put state
 interests ahead of the demands of ideology.   China
 believes the US is the only nation with adequate re-
 4ources to meet the Soviet challenge, and it will con-
 tinue to woo the states of the industrialized ''Second
 World''  of Western Europe and Japan and the economically
 underdeveloped Third World to attempt to contain the
 expansion of Soviet influence.   Nevertheless, ideology
 will make itself felt in such spheres as continued
 support--mainly oral--for Communist insurgencies in
 Southeast Asia and persistent claims to ideological
 supremacy.
 East Asia
 Fear of opening up avenues for the expansion of
 Soviet  influence and of finding itself on the road to
 -confrontation with the US has led China to prefer
 stability on the Korean peninsula.   China must per-
 force give strong public support of Kim Il-song's
 position on reunification and the withdrawal of US
 forces from South Korea.  Privately Peking indicates
 .a desire for stability in East Asia and it apparently
 ,counsels restraint to the North Koreans.   Chinese-
 North Korean relations are close, but in large part
 North Korea's  ''tilt''  toward China is by default.
 Kim would prefer a more balanced relationship among
 North Korea,  China,  and the USSR.   The Soviets,  al-
 though they are Pyongyang's major trade partner and
 economic aid donor, do not appear in the mood to in-
 crease significantly their assistance, despite North
 Korea's urgent need for it.   Peking's attitude to
 events in Korea, however, will continue to be constrained
 by fear of Soviet gains there at Peking's expense.
 Concern about Soviet intentions also conditions
 Peking's relations with Japan, but in the case of Tokyo

 there is an important economic element.   China uses
 every opportunity to inveigh against the development
 of closer Japanese-Soviet relations.   Peking used
 the recent difficult Japanese-Soviet negotiations
 over an interim fishing agreement to propagandize
 against Soviet ''hegemonism'' and constantly at-
 tempts to stir the pot by harping on (and supporting)
 Japan's claim to four northern islands now under So-
 viet control.   Lately the Chinese have supplemented
 these political maneuvers by initiating contact with
 the Japanese defense establishment.   Former high-
 ranking and, in some cases, recently retired Japa-
 nese military officers have been received by vice
 Premier Chen Hsi-lien, a leading member of the party's
 military commission.   Peking tacitly endorses the US-
 Japan mutual security treaty and the continued US
 military presence in Japan.
 Peking's major device to alter Japan's attempt
 to balance its stand between the USSR and the PRC is
 the proposed Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friend-
 ship.   China's firm insistance on including an anti-
 Soviet   ''hegemony clause'' in the treaty continues
 to be the main obstacle to its conclusion.   The So-
 viets have pressed the Japanese to reject the clause.
 Tokyo has temporized on the issue, much to Peking's
 irritation.
 An additional problem in Sino-Japanese relations
 is Tokyo's recent conclusion of an agreement with
 South Korea on development of oil resources on the
 continental shelf.   The agreement conflicts with
 Chinese claims in the area, and Peking denounced it
 with unexpected vehemence.
 The Chinese, however, have not allowed their dif-
 ferences with Japan to affect significantly their
 overriding interest in fostering good relations.   Japan
 is likely to remain China's number-one trade partner
 and an important source of industrial imports.   Peking
 is interested in concluding a long-term trade agree-
 ment that would exchange Chinese oil and coal for in-
 dustrial goods.   Due primarily to economic considera-
 tions, prospects for an early conclusion of such an
 agreement are slim.

 Peking seems more hopeful about prospects in
 Southeast Asia than it was a little more than a year
 ago.   Then it feared the Vietnamese might serve as
 the agency of Soviet influence throughout the region.
 Events since then seem to have persuaded the Chinese
 that the Vietnamese are determined to set an independent
 course between Peking and Moscow.   While China would
 prefer Vietnam to be less involved with the USSR, the
 new Chinese leadership appears willing to seek good
 relations and not to focus on the problems between
 -them.   Peking also supports improved relations between
 Washington and Hanoi.
 Peking nonetheless does not want to see Hanoi
 become a rival in its own right for influence in the
 region.   Despite irritation with Thailand for its
 dealings with Taiwan, the Chinese still prefer stability
 under the present Thai regime to instability which might
 be exploited by the Vietnamese.   At the same time, Peking
 maintains links with the Thai Communist insurgents, partly
 for fear they will be coopted by Vietnam.
 China's relations with the Cambodian regime, al-
 though occasionally embarrassing, remain close.   Peking
 last year encouraged Phnom Penh to develop links with
 its ASEAN neighbors, but is now apparently resigned to
 the Cambodians' policy of isolation.
 The emphasis in China's policy toward the ASEAN
 nations generally is on good state-to-state relations.
 Indonesia has yet to restore relations with China,
 but may do so in the coming year.   Singapore will await
 Indonesia's move before opening diplomatic relations.
 The Chinese remain relaxed on the question of US forces
 in the Philippines over the past 10 years.   Burma has
 been a special case in China's Southeast Asia policy
 because of Peking's relatively strong support of Com-
 munist insurgency there.  Although that support has
 been cut back, Peking is unwilling to abandon that
 insurgency, despite highly visible efforts to improve
 state relations with Rangoon through the recent ex-
 change of high-level visitors.

 has recovered from its ''Angola shock'' and become more
 self-confident and assertive.   Slight deterioriation
 in Chinese relations with Tanzania and Zambia has been
 halted and ties with both countries appear firm and
 cordial.   The Chinese have attempted to take advantage
 of recent Soviet setbacks in Sudan and Somalia and
 are urging greater anti-Soviet cooperation among
 wealthy conservative oil states and other Arab and
 African governments.
 China links the recent Soviet setback in the Sudan
 to that in Egypt as setting an anti-Soviet trend among
 the Red Sea states; and looks for strengthened regional
 cooperation.   To back this up, the Chinese have pro-
 vided modest military assistance to Egypt and made
 promises to the Sudan.   But the Chinese position in
 the Middle East is essentially uninfluential and is
 keyed to the cultivation of good state relations, most
 notably with Iran.   Peking continues to voice support
 for the Palestinians and provides some assistance and
 training, apparently in an effort to avoid leaving the
 field to the Soviets.
 Peking's relations with the less pro-Soviet elements
 of the Rhodesian liberation movement seem to be improving
 after a year of confusion.   The Chinese, however, are
 conscious of their limited ability to influence the
 course of events in Africa.   Peking relies mainly on
 political methods to counter the USSR, supplemented by
 modest economic and military aid programs.   Peking be-
 lieves-that only the US--which they say has not done
 enough--has the resources effectively to counter the
 USSR.
 Europe
 Peking considers Western Europe a major element in
 maintaining a power balance against the USSR.   China
 favors greater European unity against the Soviets, an
 expanded West European defense effort, and continued
 US involvement in the region through a strong NATO.
 China also looks toward Western Europe as a source of
 industrial imports and technology and is eager to con-
 clude a trade agreement with the European Economic Com-
 munity.   A Chinese banking delegation recently visited
 major West European financial centers in order to

 25X1

 study institutions and practices which might be useful
 in Peking's drive to increase trade.
 Peking's response to Eurocommunism has been some-
 what ambivalent.   China derives satisfaction from the
 nationalist element in Eurocommunism which puts the
 West European parties at odds with the USSR.
 Nevertheless, Peking remains suspicious of the Euro-
 communist parties'  continuing ties to the USSR,  and
 apprehensive that their participation in governments
 in France and Italy would weaken NATO.   In Chinese
 ideological terms the Eurocommunist parties are defi-
 nitely revisionist and Peking has spurned all over-
 tures to enter into party-to-party contact.   Such con-
 tact would be particularly embarrassing to Peking now
 when a burgeoning quarrel with Albania is undermining
 Chinese pretensions to ideological leadership.
 In Eastern Europe the Chinese preoccupation with
 the Soviet Union has led to some remarkable develop-
 ments.   In its eagerness to seek allies among those
 whose relations with Moscow are cool, Peking has made
 extra efforts to continue and further develop good
 relations with Belgrade, and Tito himself will visit
 Peking at the end of August.   The irony of Tito's
 visit is that he was made China's whipping boy for
 Soviet revisionism in the early 1960s when Peking and
 Moscow first split.   Having decided that Tito makes a
 better partner than a bete noir, China has complicated
 its already strained relations with Yugoslavia's long-
 time enemy, Albania.                                China would not like its ideo-
 logical dispute with Albania to grow, but because
 Albania is unlikely to drift toward the Soviets in a
 fit of anti-Chinese pique there is no pressing need
 for Peking to attempt to make up to Tirana.
 China's policy toward Romania remains one of
 vigorously encouraging Ceausecu's independent foreign
 policy. The cordial Sino-Romanian relationship, how-
 ever, stands in marked contrast to China's frigid
 relations with the rest of the Warsaw Pact members.
 The Chinese view of South Asia grew significantly
 brighter in the past year.   The defeat of Indira Gandhi,

 whom the Chinese considered pro-Soviet, raised Chi-
 nese hopes that India might move further toward a
 truly nonaligned foreign'policy.   The Chinese have
 since privately expressed their pleasure with Prime
 Minister Desai's refusal to lean toward the USSR as
 his predecessor did.   They are not so happy, however,
 with his view that the longstanding Sino-Indian border
 dispute must be resolved by Chinese initiatives be-
 cause the Chinese were the ''aggressors'' in the 1962
 border war.   Peking sees Desai as blinded by an his-
 torical Indian desire to seek hegemony in the region.
 But this is an improvement, in the Chinese world view,
 seeing India as a tool of Soviet hegemonism.
 The change of government in Pakistan did not stir
 a. ripple in Sino-Pakistani relations.   Both sides were
 quick to signal their intentions to continue close
 cooperation.   And in Bangladesh, the Chinese have in
 the past year gradually moved to solidify their special
 position through military and economic assistance.
 Relations with Nepal and Sri Lanka remain cordial, and
 in Afghanistan the Chinese seem resigned to wielding
 little influence.
 China pays relatively little attention to Latin
 America.   Peking concentrates primarily on cementing
 and expanding its state relations in the area, hoping
 to make gains at the expense of the Soviets and Na-
 tionalist Chinese.   Relations with Cuba remain strained.

 IV.   SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 Just as it was with Mao, hostility toward the
 USSR is the driving for ce of his successor'
 s  foreign
 ~- --~--
 policy.
 --The Chinese still sense that they are confronted
 with a long-term Soviet effort to "encircle"
 China, in the first place politically but to
 some extent militarily.
 --They recognize that unlike the US--the receding
 threat--the USSR has a permanent territorial
 presence in the area, in Siberia and most notably
 the Soviet Far East.   Thus the political tensions
 generated by Chinese self-interest in resistance
 to Soviet containment efforts will not be easily
 or quickly reduced.
 Peking's strategy for dealing with the USSR as
 China's "main enemy" is to apply Mao's dictum "to organ-
 ize all the forces that can be organized" internationally
 to oppose Soviet foreign policy actions.
 --Peking asserts that it will maintain friendly re-
 lations with practically any government which
 opposes the USSR, regardless of its political
 system.   This pragmatic principle has been the
 central factor in Peking's turn toward the US
 and other shifts:
 -In Europe,  toward NATO countries;
 -In the Middle East, toward Iran and Sudan and
 even farther toward Egypt;
 -In the Far East, toward Japan; and
 -In Latin America, toward Chile after the Soviets
 were expelled by the post-Allende government.
 --The turn toward the US was perceived necessary
 to keep China from being sandwiched between both
 superpowers and to exploit contradictions be-
 tween them.

 Thus the main purpose of the rapprochement with
 Washington continues to be to use as much as possible
 the international influence and military potential of
 the US as a counterweight to the USSR globally.
 --Mao's successors require such a counterweight
 primarily to offset the strategic threat the
 USSR poses to China's national security.
 --They believe that the US role in NATO, by sus-
 taining a strong force on the USSR's western
 front, worries Moscow sufficiently to act as
 a deterrent to Soviet pressure on the eastern
 front against China.
 --Primarily because the Soviet threat is per-
 ceived to be a long-term matter, the successors
 view the turn toward the US as a matter of
 basic strategy rather than as a temporary,
 tactical expedient to speed Washington's dis-
 engagement from Taiwan.
 For Moscow, the most sensitive aspect of Peking's
 hostility is the possibility that it will lead to some
 form of cooperation with Washington in threatening or
 thwarting Soviet interests.
 --The Soviets would interpret normalization as an
 effort by Washington to firm up a Sino-US entente
 against the USSR.
 --In addition, the Soviets would be concerned that
 full normalization might downgrade Taiwan as a
 contentious issue between the US and the PRC.
 --However, the Soviet leaders probably would avoid
 responding to normalization by any intemperate
 action which might intensify US-USSR frictions
 and facilitate a US decision to provide Peking
 with military-related technology and equipment.
 The fundamental issues in dispute between Moscow
 and Peking remain as far from resolution as ever.   These
 are Chinese fear of Soviet encirclement coupled with a
 sense of military inferiority, historical disputes cen-
 tering on territory, and the ideological struggle.  As

 seven or eight ranking Politburo members).   It is
 reasonable to assume however, that the larger the
 circle of successors is drawn, the more chance there
 is for advocates of some form of improvement of rela-
 tions with Moscow to be found.
 --Thus much may depend on the stability of the
 top leadership.
 --The return of rehabilitated Teng Hsiao-ping to
 the innermost circles indicates continuation
 of China's anti-Soviet tilt.
 The Chinese have not tried to use any hint of an
 improvement in relations with the USSR to create pres-
 sure on Washington to speed up the normalization of
 Sino-US relations on Peking's terms.
 --In fact, Mao's successors have refused to play
 this game.   They seem to have feared that the
 Soviets would take comfort from it and that the
 US itself might be impelled to move closer to
 the USSR.
 --Far from takin  actions with the intention of
 worrying Washington about a shift in the bal-
 ance of the Sino-Soviet US triangle, they have
 made a special effort to refute Moscow's claim
 of improvement in Sino-Soviet relations.
 --By indicating to Washington that they in fact,
 have not moved closer to the USSR, they in-
 directly have suggested that there is no reason
 for the US to do so.

 The Chinese hope the US and NATO will conduct an
 active policy of containment against the USSR.
 --They have opposed not only US "retreats"  (e.g.,
 Angola), but also the SALT and MFBR negotiations
 and the provision of the USSR with grain and
 advanced scientific technology.
 --They view Was_hington'sstatements on the issue
 of human rights as a desirable source of US-USSR
 friction, but they would respond with vehemence
 if US officials were publicly to criticize
 China's policy on the matter.
 --They particularly have welcomed Washington's
 reduced emphasis on the dominant importance of
 Soviet-American relations and the increased
 degree of competitiveness in American policy
 toward Moscow.
 --However, they prefer even stronger medicine--i.e.,
 an escalation to a cold war atmosphere and a
 virtual economic blockade of the USSR.
 The Chinese are less concerned about the possi-
 bility of an imminent Soviet attack than they were in
 1969 and 1970.
 --Armed clashes up to company-level in size such
 as those which took place in 1969 have not re-
 curred.
 --They say that they will settle the border issue
 with the USSR "through negotiations" and will
 not resort to the use of force--an indication
 that they fear provoking the Soviets into mili-
 tary retaliation.
 The prospect is for a continuation of high-profile
 polemics, stalemate in the border talks, but possible
 resolution of some border-river shipping problems.
 --On the last point, both sides already have in-
 dicated that resolution of "technical matters"
 concerning shipping does not mean agreement on
 ownership of disputed river islands or a change
 in the overall hostile relationship.

 V.   CHINA'S VIEW OF THE US
 In Peking's calculations, four motivational fac-
 tors are probably at work in its relation with the
 United States.   First, the US provides a strategic
 counterbalance to the USSR and, in a general sense,
 a connection with Washington tends to relieve Soviet
 pressures on China.   Second, through negotiations
 with the US, China hopes to position itself so that
 an eventual resolution of the Taiwan problem on terms
 favorable to Peking can be achieved.   Third, trade
 with the US and the importation of certain items of
 high technology from US sources are of economic benefit
 to China.   Fourth, the connection with Washington tends
 to make China a "respectable" member of the international
 community and makes it easier for Peking to play a
 significant role on the international stage.
 The first of these elements is clearly the most
 important.   For Peking, the problem of Soviet inten-
 tions toward, and of Soviet pressure on, China involves
 basic considerations of the security of the state.
 Peking believes that Moscow is attempting to "surround"
 China and to choke it into submission; the US connection
 makes this effort much more difficult for the Soviets
 and, to the degree that Moscow must factor in a possible
 US response in its strategic calculations regarding China,
 direct pressures on the Chinese are reduced.   Moreover,
 China recognizes that, because the Sino-US connection
 tends to disturb Moscow, certain aspects of Moscow's
 relationship with the US in consequence become more
 difficult and complicated and, to the extent that
 Moscow must therefore focus its attention on Washington
 rather than Peking, China is a net gainer.   The Chinese
 assume that the US, viewing the triangular relationship
 from its own perspective, attempts to exacerbate Sino-
 Soviet relations.   As Chinese Foreign Minister Huang
 Hua recently remarked, it remains to be seen who can
 play the game better.
 The second motivational factor--Taiwan--is of
 lesser importance but still a major consideration for
 China.   For nearly two decades Peking has been unwilling
 to incur the costs and risks of an attempt at military
 "liberation" of Taiwan.   It has, however, shown a

 25X1
 Approved For Rel
 continuing--and perhaps growing--measure of concern
 that continuation of the present situation will
 eventually result in legal as well as physical
 separation.   It may view the generational changes and
 economic development of Taiwan as gradually "drifting"
 the island away from the mainland.   It is momentum
 along these lines that Peking seeks to arrest, through
 an agreement with the US, to strengthen its legal
 position with respect to Taiwan and to weaken Taiwan's
 long-run viability.   This should not suggest that
 the Chinese do not hope ultimately to acquire control
 over Taiwan--they do.   But this is a matter for the
 longer term; the primary Chinese objective  (relative
 to Taiwan)  in maintaining and if possible advancing
 the relationship with Washington is to ensure that
 this longer term aim remains valid.
 In entering into the relationship with the US,
 moreover, the Chinese appear to have assumed a cer-
 tain flexibility with respect to the Taiwan issue on
 the part of Washington.  This seems to have been an
 important element in the calculations China made in
 1971-72, when the US connection was first being estab-
 lished.                        It did not motivate the Chinese decision to
 pursue the relationship with Washington in the same
 sense that strategic considerations did, but it did
 make decisions based on those strategic considerations
 easier.   This assumption has also colored the Chinese
 assessment of the state of the relationship with
 Washington.   Peking has appeared to consider US
 "adherence to the principals of the Shanghai communique"
 --a code phrase for movement on the Taiwan issue--to
 be an indicator of the relative interest Washington
 places in its relationship with China.
 The third motivational factor--economic benefit--
 does not appear to have been a central element in
 Chinese thinking, but its importance may well be
 growing.   From the early stages of the relationship,
 Peking has seen the US as a potential source of ad-
 vanced technology, some of which is not readily
 available from other suppliers, such as Western
 Europe or Japan.   Given the recent movement of China's
 internal policies toward greater emphasis on economic
 construction, this factor is likely to become more
 Approved For Release 2              -
 25X1
 25X1
 Approved For Re
 important in Chinese thinking over time.   But
 economic considerations do not seem to drive Chi-
 nese policy to nearly the extent that strategic and
 political considerations do.   In its attitude toward
 Washington, Peking has fairly consistently permitted
 political considerations to govern purely economic
 considerations.
 The final motivational factor--gains in interna-
 tional "respectability" resulting from a closer con-
 nection with the US--is probably of declining impor-
 tance to China.  Most gains in this area have already
 been achieved.   This factor may still be a considera-
 tion, however, as China looks at Southeast Asia.
 Peking wants to increase its influence there, and it
 doubtless believes that local governments in the region
 will find its efforts to gain influence less threatening
 if China can at the same time maintain relatively warm
 relations with Washington.
 In the context of these general considerations,
 China views US policy in three ways.   The first focuses
 on US international policy and strategic posture in
 general, particularly as these affect the US competition
 with the USSR.   As Peking defines this issue, US will-
 power in international affairs seems to be of paramount
 importance.   The Chinese tend to see this problem in
 stark, rather simplistic, terms:   is the US prepared to
 stand up to Soviet pressures anywhere and everywhere?
 The second focuses on the bilateral relationship be-
 tween China and the US.   Here Taiwan is the issue,
 important but secondary to the PRC's strategic view.
 In this area Peking attempts to judge how important a
 factor Washington considers China to be in international
 affairs.   Finally, Peking also views Washington through
 an ideological lens.   Viewed from this angle, the US
 is a capitalist power whose interests are basically
 inimical to China's.
 The first two of these viewpoints have been
 dominant as China has looked at the US since the Carter
 administration came to office.   There is a wealth of
 evidence indicating that for the past six months Peking
 has been attempting to assess with precision US foreign
 policy objectives and priorities on international issues

 in general and as they apply to the Soviet Union and
 China in particular.   It is clear that this effort
 has not been easy for the Chinese, and that they have
 had trouble sorting out what they seem to consider to
 be a set of mixed signals.   In general, the Chinese
 appear to be heartened by indications that Washington
 is prepared to allow the dialogue with Moscow deteriorate
 rather than reach a series of quick (and as the Chinese
 would view it, deleterious) agreements with the USSR.
 They seem mildly impressed with new US arms procurement
 efforts, although they remain skeptical about some as-
 pects of US efforts in this area, and they have quietly
 applauded some aspects of US policy in the Middle East
 as well as the US approach to the problem of the Horn
 of Africa.
 Against these "positive" indicators, the Chinese
 have appeared to array a number of what they consider
 to be more negative aspects of US policy.   They continue
 to be skeptical about US willingness to "stand up" to
 what they believe to be Soviet expansionist activities,
 citing in particular the US attitude toward the recent
 invasion of Zaire.   They are equally skeptical about
 the human rights campaign, which they feel fritters
 away US attention which should be devoted to "more
 serious" problems, masks US unwillingness to come to
 grips with the "realitities" of Soviet power, and
 complicates US relations with a number of other
 countries.   They consider the US position on the Indian
 Ocean and US policy toward southern Africa also to be
 unrealistic.  Moreover, they have noted that firmer US
 public attitudes toward the USSR have not resulted in
 corresponding public pressures to pursue rapprochement
 with China, and they may suspect that there may have
 been a growth of undifferentiated anti-Communism among
 the US public.
 In the area of bilateral Sino-US relations, the
 Chinese also consider the signals to be mixed.   In
 particular, they seemed to consider most of the in-
 dicators of US China policy in the early days of the
 administration to be negative.   Peking was almost
 certainly distressed that Washington set machinery
 for recognition of Cuba and Vietnam in motion while
 saying and doing little about Sino-US normalization.

 They were unquestionably concerned and upset about
 frequent references to US interest in the security of
 Taiwan on the part of leading US officials.  Against
 these early "negative" signals the Chinese have ob-
 viously placed more positive indicators, such as US
 reiteration of its continued adherence to the Shanghai
 communique and, more recently, Secretary Vance's
 speech of late June and the President's subsequent
 press conference.  The fact that Chinese officials
 immediately noted in private conversation each of the
 early administration references to the Shanghai com-
 munique underlines the careful attention Peking has
 been giving to the signals emanating from Washington.
 None of the negative readings of US policy seem
 to have caused Peking to alter its basic and well-es-
 tablished judgments regarding Washington:
 --That the US was a declining power slowly with-
 drawing from forward positions in Asia, and
 therefore no immediate threat to China.
 --That US strength was still considerable, but
 because Washington was on the "defensive"
 internationally it had many interests in
 common with China, particularly in opposing
 Soviet expansionism.
 There are some indications that this assessment was
 reviewed and endorsed at a leadership meeting last
 spring, when a decision may have been made to continue
 to adhere to Peking's "three principles" regarding
 Taiwan.   Further review may have taken place immediately
 before and during the recent plenum of the party Central
 Committee, at which time a further decision may have
 been taken to downplay Peking's previous insistence that
 it would be "necessary" eventually to use force to
 resolve the Taiwan issue.   Such decisions, while
 important, are essentially tactical; a fundamental
 decision reassessing the entire basis of Chinese policy
 toward the US is likely to be undertaken only if Peking
 were to conclude that relations had turned distinctly
 sour and that they were proving to be unproductive.

 In this general framework, the Chinese response
 to the Carter administration has gone through three
 fairly distinct phases.   The first was a matter of
 "getting a fix" on the new administration; in this
 period the attitude of the Chinese was generally one
 of some bemusement, but they did watch carefully for
 signs of how the administration would handle the
 Soviets.   The second phase focused primarily on
 "setting the record straight" and responding to US
 expressions of concern about the security of Taiwan.
 Chinese statements, public and private, in this period
 were quite rancorous, and frequently stressed the idea
 that only through force could Taiwan be "liberated."
 The central Chinese aim in this period appeared to be
 to disabuse Washington of any idea that Peking might
 subscribe to a non-use-of-force statement regarding
 Taiwan. Chinese remarks during this period were
 notable not only for their vigor and relative belli-
 cosity, but also for an apparent disregard of their
 possible effect on US public opinion in general and
 on Congressional opinion in particular.
 The third phase was a much more positive one, irn
 which references to the "necessity" to use force faded
 away.   This phase began shortly before Secretary Vance's
 speech on Asian policy, but became much more apparent
 following that speech.   In this latest phase Chinese
 propaganda has frequently, and positively, highlighted
 statements or actions by leading members of the US
 administration.
 This last, positive phase has rapidly shaded off
 into a scene-setting exercise designed to provide a
 context for Secretary Vance's visit.   Chinese officials
 25X1
 have commented at length on the visit.
 Much of this discussion has been clearly meant to
 "position" China for a variety of outcomes to the visit.
 Thus, most officials have stressed that Peking does not
 expect major and immediate results from the Secretary's
 trip; this permits easy adjustment if the visit proves,
 from the Chinese point of view, to be relatively un-
 productive.   Moreover, Chinese officials both at home
 and abroad have frequently referred to the future
 prospects of Sino-US trade, generally taking a positive

 line on this subject.   This has been particularly
 +_-rutz of nffinialq in
 icia s a roa
 have E-573--H-
 en a somewhat different tack, noting
 that if the Secretary merely addressed issues such as
 trade without tackling the central issue of Taiwan
 little improvement in trading patterns could be expected.
 On this central issue all Chinese have been con-
 sistent in that they have stressed that China will ad-
 here to its "three principles"--breaking of diplomatic
 relations with Taipei, withdrawal of all US forces
 from Taiwan, and abrogation of the mutual defense
 treaty with the Nationalists.   These officials, how-
 ever, have also been consistent in noting that Peking
 would have no objection to continuing trade and other
 unofficial relations with Taiwan, and most have sug-
 gested that Peking would be receptive to US proposals
 that might help to improve bilateral relations.
 Significantly, none has ruled out the possibility of
 continuing arms sales to Taiwan.   One in fact suggested
 that Peking might see the maintenance of Taiwan's mili-
 tary strength "as an element in the deterrent forces
 countering expansion of Soviet influence in the area."
 Several have also suggested that the PRC could show
 considerable flexibility in countenancing the method
 in which the US makes the treaty a dead letter.   These
 hints and assurances, of course, are designed to induce
 the US to approach the negotiations in Peking in a
 positive frame of mind.   Indeed, Chinese officials in
 China and abroad have expressed the hope that the
 Secretary will bring "concrete proposals" for improving
 relations, implying that the next move is up to
 Washington.
 the Chinese have made two public state-
 ments of significance in recent weeks.   The first, by
 then senior vice premier Li Hsien-nien, was clearly a
 response to the Secretary's speech on Asian policy;
 this statement was notable because it stated Peking's
 "three principles" publicly for the first time; it also
 carefully eschewed any reference to the use of force in
 "liberating" Taiwan.   The second statement was contained
 in a recent speech by Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying,

 the second-ranking member of the Chinese hierarchy.
 Following routine remarks on Peking's determination
 to "liberate" Taiwan, Yeh noted that Peking hoped to
 work with "compatriots on Taiwan" to this end.
 This hint--it is no more than that--at the
 desirability of negotiations with Taipei has been
 echoed by other less authoritative Chinese sources,
 and in fact as the theme that force was "necessary"
 to resolve the Taiwan question has faded, the notion
 of the desirability of direct negotiations with the
 Nationalists seems to have begun to appear.   The
 pattern has only just begun to develop, but if it
 continues it would-resurrect a theme that was particu-
 larly prominent in the 1971-73 period, when the Sino-US
 relationship was first developing.
 However "reasonable" the Chinese wish to appear
 prior to the Secretary's trip, they are likely in the
 event to prove difficult and stubborn negotiators.   It
 is significant, however, that they chose to hold their
 party plenum, which restored the veteran Teng Hsiao-
 ping to prominence, prior to the Secretary's visit.
 Several officials abroad have suggested that Peking
 wished Teng to lead the Chinese negotiating team;
 this seems a plausible ancillary reason for an event
 which took place primarily as a result of domestic
 considerations.   Nevertheless, the Chinese may well
 have thought it important to have their domestic
 house in order prior to deliberations on important
 foreign affairs issues.

 VI.   THE CHINESE ECONOMY
 The political upheavals and natural disasters in
 1976 contributed to poor economic performance and fur-
 ther delayed drafting an already overdue Fifth Five-
 Year Plan for 1976-80.   Both Mao Tse-tung and Chou
 En-lai died and Teng Hsiao-ping was disgraced.   Mao's
 widow and her colleagues  (the so-called "gang of four")
 were arrested and charged with economic disruption and
 attempting a coup.   In addition, massive earthquakes
 caused enormous loss of life  (possibly half a million
 dead)  and great damage to industrial capacity.
 Official reporting for 1976 is particularly dif-
 ficult to interpret because of a lack of hard data and
 the tendency by the new regime to dramatize the dif-
 ficulties caused by the "gang of four".   Nevertheless,
 our estimates for 1976 indicate a slight gain in agri-
 cultural output and a small decline in industrial pro-
 duction.   The net result was no growth in GNP.
 Last year's performance contrasts sharply with the
 estimated average rates of growth achieved during the
 preceding decade--6 percent for GNP, 10 percent for
 industry, and 2 percent for agriculture.
 Industry and Transportation
 After a good start in the first quarter of the
 year, industrial output dropped as a result of political
 unrest and later of earthquakes.   The earthquakes in the
 Peking-Tientsin-Tang-shan area in late July were par-
 ticularly devastating.   Some 20 to 30 percent of the
 industrial output in this area--which accounts for about
 10 percent-of the national total--may have been lost.
 The greatest impact probably was on the coal industry.
 China's largest coal mining complex--which produced
 some 6 percent of national coal output and up to a third
 of China's coking coal--was seriously damaged.
 Steel output declined by several million tons in
 1976, in part because of the effect of earthquakes and
 in part because of labor problems associated with polit-
 ical infighting and demands for higher wages.

 The earthquakes in the Tang-shan area, together
 with several major earthquakes in Southwest China, also
 had a significant impact on transportation through tem-
 porary disruption of rail lines and the heavy demands
 on the transport system to carry goods to the devas-
 tated areas.   Political factionalism was also rampant
 in the transport sector, and overall performance was
 probably down in 1976.
 Output of crude oil increased by 13 percent in
 1976, the second year of relatively slow growth.   In
 contrast, the 10-year average was some 20 percent.   The
 decline in 1976 was probably in part due to production
 problems and in part related to failure to get commit-
 ments from Japan for increased imports and to smaller
 than expected domestic demand.
 Agriculture
 Agriculture performance in 1976 was a disappoint-
 ment to China's new leadership.   Total output of grain
 probably was 280 to 285 million metric tons, about the
 same as in 1975.   Per capita output has increased only
 marginally in the last 10 years.
 Until late 1976, China drew down grain reserves to
 avoid spending hard currency for new grain imports.   As
 the extent of the damage to fall-harvested crops became
 known, however, purchases of wheat were accelerated.
 Between November 1976 and June 1977, 11.5 million tons
 were ordered for delivery through July 1978.   Thus,
 after dropping off in 1975-76, grain imports in 1977
 will move back up to 6.7 million tons.
 Foreign Trade
 China's foreign trade fell by about 10 percent to
 $12.9 billion in 1976, the first decline since 1968.
 Imports fell by almost 20 percent due in part to Peking's
 efforts to redress previous large trade deficits; ex-
 ports held roughly the same, although oil exports were
 lower than in 1975.   As a result, China's hard currency
 trade balance moved into surplus, easing pressure on
 its balance of payments.

 US trade with China continues its sharp decline
 from the 1973-74 peak when agricultural sales made the
 US China's number-two trading partner.   Last year, US
 exports fell more than 50 percent.   There were no US
 agricultural exports and there was a sharp drop in ex-
 ports of metals and machinery.   US imports increased by
 27 percent.   For the first time since trade reopened,
 the balance was in favor of China.   US exports may fall
 another 25 percent in 1977 while imports will rise by
 about the same percentage.
 The decline in trade reflects both economic and
 political factors.   Balance of payments considerations
 and domestic economic and political disruption led to
 cutbacks in China's overall imports last year.  More-
 over, until diplomatic relations are established, Peking
 will likely continue its policy of limiting purchases
 from the United States when alternate suppliers are
 available.  Ample world supplies have limited the US
 share of China's large agricultural purchases this year
 to some small sales of cotton.   Interest in US technol-
 ogy, however, remains high.  An American firm will
 supply the technical process in a recent contract for
 a West German petrochemical plant sale.   Oilfield equip-
 ment sales continue and Peking has inquired about addi-
 tional US fertilizer plants.
 Economic Prospects for 1977
 Economic prospects for 1977 are mixed.   Chinese
 officials regard 1977 as a year of readjustment to re-
 store economic order and complete a draft of the long-
 delayed Fifth Five-Year Plan  (1976-80).
 In industry, official claims have emphasized month-
 to-month gains.  With continued recovery, sizable gains
 over 1976's poor performance can be expected.   At the
 same time, Peking has moved rapidly to restore order in
 the railway sector, and performance in the first quarter
 was the highest on record.
 In agriculture, prospects are not good.  Dry weather
 in the North China Plain reduced winter wheat output--
 perhaps by 10 percent or more below the 1976 crop.   This
 is not a major catastrophe--it could be made up by a

 good fall harvest--but it has aggravated the current
 tight supply situation.
 In foreign trade, 1977 will be a year of adjust-
 ment with only moderate growth.   Imports of grain, oil-
 seeds, fertilizer, and steel will be higher.   Exports
 will probably make modest gains even though lack of
 demand for China's heavy crude continues to hamper pe-
 troleum sales.  A new round of industrial plant pur-
 chases will not begin before late this year and may be
 delayed if additional agricultural imports become
 necessary.
 A Broad Consensus on Economic Policy
 China's new leadership began its term in October
 with economic issues high on the agenda.   The present
 leaders, including the recently rehabilitated Teng
 Hsiao-ping, have revived the long-term modernization
 program announced by the late Premier Chou En-lai in
 January 1975 as the basic blueprint.  Agricultural
 modernization will continue to be given top billing
 in the allocation of resources.   With a limited amount
 of cultivable land, China must increase yields by de-
 veloping more productive seed strains and by increas-
 ing the use of modern inputs such as chemical ferti-
 lizer and insecticides.
 In industry, Peking will devote more resources to
 raising the level of technology and restoring balance,
 particularly in heavy industry.   The leadership has
 focused on improving industrial management.and resolv-
 ing such long-term problems as structural imbalances
 in the steel industry and inadequate investment in
 mining.   Elimination of these imbalances and capacity
 shortages will require some continuing imports of West-
 ern industrial plants and other equipment.
 The new leadership is aware of the importance of
 scientific and technical work to its plans for moderni-
 zation.                                  It views most Cultural Revolution reforms in
 education and research--which centered on worker,
 peasant, and soldier participation--as hindering rapid
 economic progress.   These reforms will be carefully
 modified, and qualified nonparty intellectuals will

 probably be placed in responsible leadership positions
 in the universities and research institutes.   There
 will be renewed stress on raising academic standards,
 and the importance of political studies will probably
 diminish.
 Peking will look more closely at the modernization
 of its national defenses.   The pace of military moderni-
 zation has been the subject of considerable debate over
 the past several months.   the civilian leaders would
 prefer, at a minimum, a period of military belt-tightening
 until problems in industry can be solved.  A meeting of
 the minds on these important issues has been and will
 continue to be difficult to achieve, however.
 Major Obstacles to Economic Development
 Two major problems stand out as obstacles to success-
 ful completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan:   the inability
 of the central government to exert effective control over
 provincial and county resource allocation, and labor un-
 rest caused by worker dissatisfaction with wages.
 A report prepared by the State Council by Teng
 Hsiao-ping in 1975 sharply cirticized the inability of
 lower level officials to carry out industrial planning;
 widespread violation of state plans was cited as evi-
 dence of the need for greater control over local resource
 allocation.   Reaching a consensus on the proper degree
 of increased central control will require long and dif-
 ficult bargaining with local officials who will resist
 surrendering any of their authority.
 Dissatisfaction among industrial workers has been
 brewing for more than a decade over the lack of a signif-
 icant wage increase.   Government promises of wage reform
 have never been fulfilled.   Since 1974, strikes, slow-
 downs, and absenteeism have occurred with growing fre-
 quency.
 The new government apparently has decided to take
 some action on the wage issue.   In recent weeks, a bonus
 system tied to worker productivity has been tried in
 selected factories, and a wage increase for certain
 groups of workers is said to be scheduled for later this

 year.   Peking, however, cannot afford to raise wages
 by much.  At the same time, government refusal to act
 on the wage problem could seriously endanger planned
 increases in productivity and dim growth prospects.

 VII.   THE NATIONAL DEFENSE POSTURE OF THE PRC
 China has the lar est conventional armed forces
 in the world  over 4 million men--and a small, but
 growing strategic nuclear force.
 China presently has no capability to pose a
 direct military threat to the US, but could attack
 US interests and bases in the Far East.   Peking
 identifies the Soviet Union as its most dangerous
 adversary, and has arrayed about half of its armed
 forces in a defensive posture to meet the Soviet
 threat.   Another third of China's forces is located
 along the coast where Peking continues to perceive
 a threat.   Most of the remainder is located in central
 China as a reserve force.
 China's conventional forces are best situated
 and prepared to fight a nonnuclear, defensive war
 against the Soviets.
 --To counter the Soviets'  superior firepower and
 mobility, the Chinese intend to employ distance
 and terrain favorable to their defense.   They
 do not intend to give up territory easily, but
 hope to wear down the Soviets as they attempt
 to drive through successive lines of in-
 creasingly stronger forces.
 --They have a reasonable chance of stalemating
 any Soviet conventional offensive before it
 reaches Peking and the North China Plain.
 --Chinese forces deployed along the coast could
 repel any amphibious invasion that the Soviets
 could presently mount.
 If China's strategic forces failed to deter a
 Soviet nuclear attack, China's nuclear warfi hting
 capability would be no match for that of the Soviets.
 Even so, with sufficient warning, Chinese nuclear
 forces could destroy enough of the Soviet urban
 support base in the Far East to make it difficult
 for surviving Soviet forces to sustain military
 operations.
