 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 NEW SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE .        .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page   1
 The communique following the recent plenum of the
 central committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the
 restaffing of the State Economic Commission under
 M.G. Pervukhin suggest that the Khrushchev leadership is
 still dominant in the USSR.  The communique's reiteration
 of the policies laid down at the 20th party congress and
 the naming to the economic commission of specialists who
 have long been serving as part of the Khrushchev-Bulganin
 team suggest that no change in the top leadership is
 imminent.  An over-all review of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 is to be conducted by the specially constituted, high-
 level planning group.  This review apparently signals
 the beginning of strenuous efforts to adjust Moscow's
 plans to meet recently increased economic pressures.
 SUEZ AND SINAI .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page    2
 The Arab states, apparently convinced that the with-
 holding of oil from the West has been the tactic which
 played the biggest role in forcing Britain and France to
 withdraw from Suez, are now continuing to apply the same
 pressure to obtain a complete Israeli evacuation of Sinai
 and the Gaza strip.   Israel is showing increasing re-
 sistance and is in turn asking the Western powers for
 guarantees before it makes a final decision on the evac-
 uation question.  The British and French, meanwhile,
 continue to seek a role in the canal clearance operations
 as a means to retain some on-the-spot leverage.
 INDONESIA ..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page
 The bloodless coup by elements of the Indonesian army
 in Sumatra is now aimed at forcing the collapse of the
 government of Premier All Sastroamidjojo.                  The government's
 continued existence is jeopardized by the threatened de-
 fection of a large portion of its political support..
 Agitation for the appointment of former vice president
 Hatta as premier is growing, but there is some doubt
 whether President Sukarno would agree to such a move.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 CABINET CRISIS IN SYRIA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  1
 Conservative efforts to prevent a complete assumption
 of power by the leftists have apparently delayed the
 formation of a new cabinet following the resignation of
 Prime Minister Asali on 22 December.   Pressure on the con-
 servatives mounted, however, with the announcement of a
 court-martial of Syrians involved in an alleged Iraqi-
 sponsored coup.                                                                          25X1
 GREECE AND TURKEY SHIFTING TACTICS ON CYPRUS ISSUE .  .  .     Page   1
 Greece and Turkey appear to be shifting their tactics
 on the Cyprus problem.   Greece will press for an immediate
 debate  in the UN and will probably emphasize "independ-
 ence" rather than "self-determination."   The Turks are
 now urging partition as the only solution they could
 tolerate.  London intends to retain sovereignty over
 Cyprus for the foreseeable future and will adhere to its

 CHOU EN-LAI ANNOUNCES FORTHCOMING TRIP TO THE USSR .  .  .     Page   4
 Soviet relations with the Satellites probably will
 be a principal topic of discussion during Chou En-lai's
 trip to Moscow in January.  The Chinese have been
 strongly sympathetic toward Satellite aspirations for a
 greater degree of freedom within the bloc.  Peiping
 wishes, however, to avoid a public quarrel on the issue,

 Concern over unfavorable tendencies in the political
 orientation of the Soviet people has prompted Moscow to
 warn Soviet citizens of the need for greater vigilance

 vigilance campaigns are being prepared.  These demands for
 watchfulness seem to be primarily an effort to justify
 the use of force in the Hungarian uprising, which is said
 to have been instigated by the "reactionary" West.
 GOMULKA'S POSITION AND PROSPECTS .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 Polish party first secretary Gomulka is faced with
 an increasingly stronger party opposition and growing
 popular discontent,                                       The
 responsibilities of office and the resulting need to
 balance political realities carefully have forced him to
 resort to temporizing tactics in an effort to fulfill
 high popular expectations while at the same time attempting
 to forestall Russian counteraction.  His task is made all
 the more difficult by the weakening of central authority
 and the loss of party unity which accompanied his rise to
 power.
 HUNGARIAN REGIME SEEKS CO-OPERATION OF PUBLIC   .
 The Hungarian regime, no longer forced to combat
 violence and general strikes, has stepped up its propa-
 ganda campaign to convince the overwhelmingly hostile and
 suspicious population that it is working for the popular
 welfare and is worthy of popular confidence.  Attempting
 to minimize the terror tactics of the newly constituted
 security forces and to ignore the presence of Soviet
 troops, press and radio statements promise daily that
 life can be better than ever if everyone will now join
 an all-out effort to rebuild the nation's shattered
 economy.  The Soviet occupation will have to be maintained
 for the foreseeable future and popular hostility is un-
 likely to diminish unless major concessions are granted.

 The East German regime is making alternate threats

 while playing on the theme that excesses and misguided
 actions by these groups were responsible for the anti-
 Soviet developments in Poland and Hungary.   Some intel-

 The implementation on 15 December of the Bolivian

 phase--has aroused widespread unrest and may bring about
 the downfall of the administration.  Discouraged by the
 wavering support of labor leaders, moderate President
 Siles has threatened to resign, and the cabinet reportedly
 tendered its resignation on 18 December in protest against
 left-wing political attacks in congress.

 Indignation in Britain over recent Soviet actions in

 not appear, however, to have abandoned its view that
 exchange visits by individuals and groups offer the
 principal hope for a long-term improvement in Anglo-
 Soviet relations.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE BALTIC STATES:      CHRONIC TROUBLE SPOT FOR USSR  .  .  .     Page 1
 Lithuanian party boss Antanas Snechkus admitted in
 mid-December that the Hungarian revolt had encouraged
 "bourgeois nationalists" in Lithuania to attack the
 Communist Party.  Early in November, anti-Soviet rioters
 in several cities demanded the withdrawal of Russians
 from Lithuania, and in December, the local parties ex-
 pressed concern over student unrest in Latvia and Estonia.
 Such developments indicate that anti-Communism and re-
 sistance to Soviet rule are still strong and perhaps
 growing,16 years after the incorporation of the Baltic

 Communist China probably will not achieve the high
 targets for agriculture of the Second Five-Year Plan
 (1958-1962),- unless the regime invests more than is now
 scheduled.  Peiping's planning relies heavily on the
 farms to produce the surpluses needed to pay for the
 ambitious industrialization program.  To date, the
 pressure of a growing population on land resources and
 the unwillingness of the regime to invest heavily in
 agricultural machinery and fertilizer have made increas--
 ingly difficult the realization of such surpluses.

 Spain is threatened by growing inflation as a result
 of pay raises averaging 40 to 45 percent decreed in

 an inflationary spiral develop, the ensuing economic dis-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 The communique on the de-
 cisions of the recent plenum of
 the central committee of the
 Soviet Communist Party and the
 restaffing of the State Economic
 Commission under M. G. Pervukhin
 .suggest that the Khrushchev
 leadership is still dominant.
 Khrushchev himself did not
 figure personally in the public
 statements emanating from the
 plenum and there has been, no
 mention of serious political
 problems which the meeting may
 have discussed.  The communique's
 reiteration of the policies
 .laid down at the 20th party
 congress and the naming to the
 planning commission of special-
 ists who have long been serving
 as part of the Khrushchev-Bul-
 ganin team suggest that no
 dramatic change in the top
 leadership is imminent.
 Rise of Pervukhin
 The appointment of M. G.
 Pervukhin* as chief of the
 commission is in line with
 earlier indications that he
 has been steadily improving
 his position over the course
 of the past two years.   In
 contrast, the planning organi-
 zation under the former chief,
 M. Z. Saburov, has been direct-
 ly criticized by Khrushchev
 on several occasions.
 The central committee re-
 ferred a re-examination of in-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 December 1956
 at this level, such specialists
 are undoubtedly represented
 just below these chairmen and
 deputies.
 The central committee
 plenum reaffirmed  the policy
 framework adopted at the 20th
 party congress within which
 the planning group should
 operate.  The primacy of heavy
 industry and the goal of catch-
 ing up with the West in per
 capita production in the short-
 est possible "historical time"
 were restated.   Emphasis was
 placed on greater decentrali-
 zation and efficiency to make
 possible the simultaneous
 achievement of all goals, while
 increased functionalism was
 stressed as necessary for the
 achievement of industrial con-
 struction and housing goals.
 These points have'been fre-
 quently stressed by Bulganin
 and Khrushchev.  The committee
 will probably have to devise
 solutions more far-reaching
 than these, however,to resolve
 the difficulties.
 Prior to the central com-
 mittee meeting, there were in-
 dications that the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan would be modified to
 provide for significantly in-
 creased hoi4sing construction,
 and possibly for stepped-up
 consumer goods production.
 The Arab states have in-
 dicated a growing sense of
 their bargaining power during
 the past week.  They appear to
 regard the British and French
 withdrawal as "their" victory,
 won by the withholding of oil
 from the West, and are now try-
 ing to apply the same tactics
 The pressure for an in-
 creased housing program came
 at a time when it was clear
 that other elements of the
 1956 economic plan would not
 meet goals.  Production goals
 for coal, metals, cement and
 timber will not be met, indi-
 cating a trend which could lead
 to a strain on the raw material
 base for industrial expansion.
 Thus, there was counterpressure
 to maintain construction ac-
 tivities serving industry and
 raw materials extraction.  Con-
 struction was singled out for
 much discussion in the central
 committee communiqud, and a
 remedy for slowing down the
 rate of new construction starts,
 while concentrating on projects
 already under way, was advanced.
 The central committee's
 decision to forego an immediate
 increase in housing and con-
 sumer good's goals in favor of
 an  over-all review of the
 plan was accompanied in the
 report by a note of satisfac-
 tion with present progress,
 Output of consumer goods will
 be more than 9 percent greater
 than in 1955, and this year's
 record harvest ensures further
 significant progress in 1957
 to obtain a complete Israeli
 evacuation of Sinai.
 Although Egypt apparently
 has agreed to allow salvage
 work on the canal to begin,
 there were signs that Cairo had
 been strongly tempted to delay
 the operation.  Nasr may well

 still use the threat of new
 delays to press the West for
 a commitment on the Israeli
 withdrawal.  Earlier last week
 the Jordan cabinet announced
 it would urge that Arab oil
 remain cut off from the West
 until Israel gives satifaction.
 Syrian officials said the pipe-
 line from Iraq to the Mediter-
 ranean could only be re-opened
 promply if the United States
 would set a terminal date for
 Israel's occupation of the
 Gaza strip.
 The Israelis reacted to
 this Arab pressure by further
 glowing down the snail's pace
 of their withdrawal and by re-
 peating, with added emphasis,
 their statements of determina-
 tion to keep Egypt from return-
 ing to the Gaza strip,   Prime
 Minister Ben-Gurion has said
 his government must-settle its
 policy on this issue by early
 January, when Israeli troops
 will have withdrawn as far as
 El Arish, the last town west
 of the Egyptian-Israeli border
 in Sinai, and to a belt of
 territory along the Gulf of
 Aqaba.
 The British and French,
 following their evacuation on
 22 December, have continued to
 press the UN for maximum Al-
 lied participation in the canal
 clearance operations, with
 "adequate safeguards" for their
 crews.  General Wheeler, the lo-
 cal head of the UN. salvage opera-
 tion, reportedly has contracted
 for two British and one French,
 as well as four German vessels,
 London and Paris are seeking
 by this means to avoid being
 completely excluded from Egypt
 and to maintain some on-the-spot
 influence.  Two top aides of UN
 secretary general Hammarskjold
 were scheduled to arrive in.
 Cairo on 27 December for further
 talks on clearance problems.
 In what appears to be a
 countermove to Egypt's delaying
 tactics, French and Israeli
 engineers, according to an an-
 nouncement from Tel Aviv, have
 begun to survey a route for an
 oil pipeline to run from the
 Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterra:-.
 nean. France is reported to be
 willing to finance part of the
 construction.  Announcement of
 the move at this time is prob-
 ably intended in part to indi-
 cate to Nasr that the Suez
 Canal's importance may diminish
 in the future and thus lead him
 to be more conciliatory now.
 The Soviet press again
 played down its direct cover-
 age of Middle East events, but
 continued to encourage Egyptian
 obstructionism.
 Although a TASS report of
 22 December charged that Israel
 was campaigning for the annexa-
 tion of the Gaza strip, Soviet
 propaganda was noticeably re-
 strained in reacting to Ben-
 Gurion's announcement on Gaza,
 An Israeli official has told
 the American embassy in Tel

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 December 1956
 The situation in Sumatra
 arising from the bloodless coup
 by Indonesian army elements
 has been complicated by the re-
 ported arrest of Colonel Sim-
 bolon, the rebel leader, by Lt.
 Col. Ginting, who recently re-
 placed,him as the official ter-
 ritorial commander in north
 Sumatra.   Ginting pledged that
 "relations with the central
 government will carry on as be-
 fore," but it is doubtful he
 can command the loyalty of all
 troops and police in the area,
 and armed clashes are a possi-
 bility.  Discontent in the
 Celebes and in Borneo reported-
 ly has increased as a result
 of the Sumatran coup, and in
 south Sumatra, the army is said
 to have seized control of the
 area's finances.
 The cabinet of All Sastroa-
 znidjojo is in serious trouble.
 The announced aim of the coup
 was the, replacement of the pres-
 ent cabinet by an "honest" gov-
 ernment which would give greater
 attention and financial support
 to non-Javanese areas, take
 action against high-level cor-
 ruption, and generally assume
 a more decisive approach to
 pressing domestic problems.
 One small party has already
 withdrawn from the cabinet, and
 SECRET
 the two large Moslem parties--
 the Masjumi and the Nahdlatul
 Ulama--reportedly will with-
 draw unless President Sukarno
 calls for the cabinet's resigna-
 tion.  Moreover, Foreign Minis-
 ter Abdulgani.. has been offi-
 cially charged with corruption
 and is facing prosecution.
 Sentiment among army and
 political leaders is growing
 in favor of a "presidential
 cabinet" led by former vice
 president Hatta.   The demand
 for such a cabinet, to which
 members would be appointed
 without regard to party member-
 ship, lends itself to Sukarno's
 own ideas of a "guided democ-
 racy"   and a de-emphasis  of-
 political parties.   Whether he
 would accept Hatta as prime
 minister, however, is somewhat
 doubtful in view of their dif-
 ferences on basic issues.
 Hatta has told the Ameri-
 can ambassador that Sukarno
 himself should assume responsi-
 bility for setting up a presi-
 dential cabinet, an indication
 that Matta and hi~z; supporters
 may intend to force Sukarno
 either to make such a move him-
 self or to turn the government
 over to them.

 GREECE AND TURKEY
 SHIFTING TACTICS ON CYPRUS ISSUE
 Greece and Turkey appear
 to be shifting their tactics in
 seeking a solution to the Cyprus
 problem.   Athens has announced
 its intention to press for an
 immediate UN debate when the
 political committee reconvenes
 on 3 January and has indirectly
 indicated that it will emphasize
 independence rather than self-
 determination for Cyprus.   Tur-
 key has now abandoned its in-
 sistence on maintaining the
 status quo on Cyprus and is
 urging partition as the only
 solution which would bar the
 ultimate union of the island
 with Greece.
 The Greek government,
 in deciding to promote Cypriot
 independence, is apparently
 motivated by a desire to get
 the support in the UN of India
 and some other countries which
 seem to suspect that "self-
 determination" for Cyprus is
 merely a cover for annexation
 by Greece.  The Soviet bloc
 would favor independence for
 Cyprus,  particularly since the
 Communist-front party on the
 island is the strongest and
 best-organized political force.
 The bloc can be expected to op-
 pose any negotiated settlement
 and may propose a demilitarized
 Cyprus under UN supervision.
 The Greek decision to.
 press for a quick showdown . with
 Britain in the UN reflects Athens'
 conviction that London will not
 negotiate significant modifica-
 tions
 of its latest constitu-
 tional
 plan for Cyprus.   By
 urging
 quick action in the
 UN,
 Athens
 might also reassure
 the
 Greek
 public  that no deal
 was
 made with the British during
 the recent visit to Athens of
 British colonial secretary
 Lennox-Boyd.  Prime Minister
 Karamanlis apparently hopes the

 concerned to recommend some
 Cyprus solution.   Karamanlis
 says Greece could accept any
 solution approved by the UN.
 Ankara stated in a memo-
 randum on 20 December that
 agreement in principle was
 reached with London during
 Lennox-Boyd's visit to Turkey.
 The Turks promised a favorable
 reaction to the proposed Rad-
 cliffe constitution for Cyprus
 in return for Britain's ac-
 ceptance of the concept of
 partition, described by the
 Turks as "integral self-deter-
 mination."
 Britain, however, has
 shown no indication of changing
 its policy of retaining sover-
 eignty over Cyprus as long as
 strategic considerations require.
 Since the abortive Suez adven-
 ture,  London's determination to
 avoid a withdrawal from the
 island has probably been rein-
 forced.   The British cabinet
 has already considered and
 rejected the idea of partition,
 and Lennox-Boyd probably raised
 the subject in Parliament only
 to placate the Turks.
 Athens and Cypriot leaders
 have already condemned partition
 as a solution of the dispute,
 and violence has increased on
 Cyprus in response to the new
 British constitutional plan.
 The shipment of Soviet
 arms-- including aircraft--into
 Afghanistan in the past several
 months raises the possibility
 of an eventual large-scale armed
 clash between Afghanistan and
 Pakistan over Pushtoonistan.
 The extent of the Soviet
 arms build-up in Afghanistan
 is not yet clear, although sub-
 stantial quantities of ground
 forces equipment--probably in-
 cluding a few tanks--are be-
 lieved to have been delivered
 in October and November.   Even
 more significant is the develop-
 ment of the air force, which
 seems to have been given priority
 by both the Russians and the
 Afghans.
 In addition to the field
 at Mazar,  the Russians are to
 construct a new military air-
 field at Begram, 30 miles north
 of Kabul                               25X1
 the USSR
 may also undertake construction
 of new airfields at Tashkurgan
 and Kunduz, and possibly also
 in the Khost-Matun area near the
 Pakistani border.

 probably feels that possession

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 December 1956
 CHOU EN-LAI ANNOUNCES FORTHCOMING TRIP TO THE USSR
 Chou En-lai announced in
 Karachi on 24 December he would
 postpone his scheduled visit to
 .Afghanistan and go instead to
 Moscow and larsaw.   This news
 overshadolaed Chou's Pakistan
 trip, which produced no star-
 tling developments.                   Chou re-
 ceiyed a warm public welcome,
 but his conversations with offi-
 cials were apparently confined
 largely to an exchange of plat-
 itudes.
 The final communique empha-
 sized the "strengthening of
 friendship" between Pakistan and
 Communist China,  although noting
 that there was a "divergence of
 views on many problems" between
 the two countries.
 The USSR's relations with
 other Orbit countries will prob-
 ably be a principal topic of
 discussion during Chou's visit
 to Moscow in January.   The Chi-
 nese premier will be able to re-
 port the unfavorable Asian re-
 action to the Soviet armed inter-
 vention in Hungary.   Tailoring
 his remarks to his Asian audi-
 ences, Chou frequently during
 his tour gave assurances that
 Peiping itself would try to
 avoid "great-nation chauvinism."
 Chou may point out to the Soviet
 leaders that Communist China has
 lost prestige in the eyes of      i
 important Asian neutrals because
 it had to express support for
 the use of Soviet troops in
 Hungary.
 Chou is likely to inform
 the Soviet leaders that Com-
 munist China favors a relatively
 liberal and more flexible Soviet
 policy in Eastern Europe.   The
 Chinese have shown great sympathy
 for Polish efforts, and for the
 early Hungarian efforts, to at-
 tain a greater degree of freedom
 within the bloc.   Chinese com-
 mentaries have indirectly crit-
 icized Soviet actions to a
 degree unprecedented for Peiping,
 and have described "great-nation
 chauvinism" as the "main thing"
 to be avoided in relationships
 among bloc countries.
 While Peiping's stand on
 Eastern European developments,
 including. its avoidance of com-
 ment on the Soviet-Yugoslav
 dispute,  probably did not come
 as a complete surprise to the
 Soviet leaders,  they apparently
 are disappointed with the Chi-
 nese position.                                                               The Russians
 will almost certainly seek from
 Chou a private commitment to
 support Soviet efforts to pre-
 serve Moscow's leadership of the
 Eastern European Satellites.
 Despite China's effort to
 dissociate itself from the
 harder aspects of Soviet policy
 toward the Satellites, the Chi-
 nese leaders clearly wish to
 avoid a public quarrel on the
 question and have emphasized the
 need for unity within the bloc.
 Any Sino-Soviet communique
 emerging from Chou's visit would
 probably profess recognition of
 equality among Communist states,
 but express the need to strength-
 en bloc unity and "proletarian
 internationalise."
 During his visit, Chou will
 probably be briefed on the re-
 cent discussions of the Soviet
 central committee plenum con-
 cerning economic policies and
 the effect,  if any,  these pol-
 icies may have on the Soviet aid
 program to Communist China.
 Chou will also visit Warsaw
 in mid-January--the first visit
 by a non-Soviet leader since the
 Conulka government was estab-
 lished.  The visit will formalize
 Peiping's approval of I'darsaw's
 new relationship with Moscow.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 December 1956
 In private, however, Chou
 will probably inform the Poles
 that continued Chinese support--
 which reportedly was first given
 to former party leader Ochab in
 Peiping last September--will
 depend on Polish adherence to
 the principle of bloc solidar-
 ity under Soviet leadership, a
 principle which Peiping has
 called the "highest duty" of
 Communist states.
 SOVIET PROPAGANDISTS STRESS VIGILANCE THEME
 Concern over unfavorable
 tendencies in the political
 orientation of the Soviet peo-
 ple has prompted Moscow to warn
 Soviet citizens of the need for
 greater vigilance against the
 enemies of the USSR.   Warning
 that "ifnperialist reactionaries"
 employ any means to undermine
 socialist power, propaganda
 media have begun to exhort the
 populace to be on guard against
 "every manifestation of bour-
 geois ideology."  Emphasis in
 the press thus far has been
 on improving ideological work
 to "clearly demonstrate the
 advantages of the socialist.
 system," and there are as yet
 no indications that repressive
 measures typical of Stalinist
 vigilance campaigns are being
 prepared.
 These demands for watch-
 fulness seem to be primarily
 an effort to justify the use
 of force in the Hungarian up-
 rising, which is said to have
 been instigated by the "reac-
 tionary" Western powers seeking
 to reinstitute capitalist re-
 pression and destroy the social
 SECRET
 gains of the Hungarian people.
 It has been repeatedly alleged
 that the imperialists fomented
 the revolt in order to prepare
 a new war.

 The Soviet armed forces
 on 22 December were called on
 to "pay extraordinary attention

 draw the necessary conclusions."
 A recent article in the Soviet
 navy's official newspaper stated
 that "the government and the
 armed forces must take into
 account the provocations and
 intrigues of the enemies of
 peace,  The state interests of
 the socialist motherland demand
 that Soviet fighters increase
 their military preparedness and
 vigilance still more."
 In addition to warning
 that the imperialists are pre-
 paring for a new war, the So-
 viet press has recently pub-
 lished stories alleging espio-
 nage activities directed against
 the whole Soviet bloc.   By
 creating an atmosphere of

 GOIAULKA'S POSITION AND PROSPECTS
 25X1
 25X1
 Polish party first secre-
 tary Gomulka is faced with an
 increasingly stronger party
 opposition and growing popular
 discontent, according to recent
 reports.   The responsibilities
 of office and the resulting
 need to balance political real-
 ities carefully have forced him
 to resort to temporizing tactics
 in an effort to fulfill high
 popular expectations while at
 the same time attempting to
 forestall Russian counteraction.
 .His task is made all the more
 difficult by the weakening of
 central authority and the loss
 of party unity which accompanied
 his rise to power.
 Goinulka will find it dif-
 ficult to continue his program
 in the face of the opposition
 which threatens from every
 quarter, and he may not last
 long in the attempt.   The coming
 spring will undoubtedly be a
 critical period.   By that. time
 popular hopes will probably have
 been deflated by the realities
 of the continuing economic
 hardships.  F             -1
 In addition to
 trying for a rapid improvement
 in the economic, situation, he
 is now replacing and reforming
 party cadres and consolidating
 his position within the army
 and security forces.
 Next to the difficult
 economic situation, the party
 itself is probably Gomulka's
 most pressing immediate problem.
 He has no personal following,
 no patrons in the Kremlin, no
 "apparatus," and almost no as-'
 sociates of tested loyalty and
 reliability.  The "palace
 revolution" that brought him
 to power has made the position
 of most of  the regional and
 lower-level party functionaries
 untenable.   Many have resigned;
 others have been forced out by
 popular pressure or in the
 gradual replacement of cadres
 now under way.
 Not associated with the
 new leadership faction which
 suddenly materialized at the
 top, and already compromised by
 the de-Stalinization movement,
 they are now swelling the ranks
 of the dissident group known
 as the "Natolins."  This group,.,
 lacking clear leadership at
 the moment, is looking to the
 Soviet Union,  from which  it
 is  reportedly receiving in-
 creasing support.                                                                    It  probably
 hopes this will enable'it  to
 turn from obstructionist tactics
 to counterrevolution.  The con-
 tinued suppression and gradual
 neutralization of this faction
 in the face of subversive sup-
 port from the Kremlin will
 challenge to the utmost Gomulka's
 hold on the state security and
 party control forces.
 C'Tol,iulka is also confronted
 by increasing disaffection among
 his formmier supporters., partic-
 ularly journalists,  students and
 intellectuals who are dismayed

 by his go-slow tactics.and who
 resent as an act of bad faith
 measures that appear repressive.
 These groups, together with the
 workers, consider themselves
 the self-styled leaders in the
 democratization movement and
 feel that Gomulka owes to them
 everything he is  today.   Demands
 among them f?r greater journal-
 istic freedom, for further
 liberalization  of the election
 system and for more rapid imple-
 mentation of worker self-govern-
 ment are kept from-getting out
 of hand more by awareness of
 the Hungarian example and its
 aftermath than by effective
 regime control.   They seem to
 be biding their time with Go-
 mulka until a more favorable.
 alternative-can be realized.
 The Kremlin leadership
 .has its own reasons to be op-
 posed to Goanulka; he has started,
 in the name of an "independent
 road to socialism," a series
 of innovations which, like a
 cancer, will certainly make
 damaging inroads if not stopped
 in time.
 Among these innovations,
 cessation of jamming, agree-
 ment to permit religious educa-
 tion in primary and secondary
 schools, and de-emphasis on .
 collectivization of agriculture
 accompanied'by abolition of the
 delivery quota system are per-
 haps the greatest threat to the
 Soviet system.   Another in-
 novation is modification of the
 election system to a degree
 which could permit election to
 the Sejm on 20 January of-an
 increased number of delegates
 who favor greater independence
 from the Soviet Union.
 Poland has also become
 a divisive element in the social-
 ist camp by.seeking support from
 China and Yugoslavia for its
 independent road.   Further,  the
 Soviet leadership must harbor
 a bitter personal animosity
 toward Gomulka for the humiliat-
 ing defeat it suffered in at-
 tempting to dictate to the Pol-
 ish central committee on 19-20
 October.
 Recent Soviet moves which
 have tended to support Gomulka,
 such as the agreement on station-
 ing of troops in Poland, sug-
 gest that the Soviet leader-
 ship considers it has no prac-
 tical alternative at the moment.
 Fear is growing in official
 Warsaw circles, however, that the
 USSR may withhold economic aid
 in order to aggravate the in-
 ternal situation and bring
 about a better opportunity to
 reassert Soviet control.   Thus,
 the Kremlin seems to be counting
 on internal difficulties to
 bring Gomulka down, confident,
 meanwhile, that the inescapable  25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 December 1956
 is unlikely to diminish unless
 major political concessions--.
 which would threaten the
 regime's authority--are granted
 during the coming year.
 With industrial production
 at a virtual standstill for
 twos months, with about half of
 the nation's coal miners no
 longer available for mining
 work, and with major damage to
 be repaired in several cities,
 the country is faced with a
 long and grueling battle for
 recovery.   The regime has ad-
 mitted that during the first
 quarter of 1957 light indus-
 trial production will be at
 only 50 to 60 percent of capac-
 ity,  that sporadic shortages
 of some food supplies will
 continue for another half year,
 and that coal production this
 year is already approximately
 40 percent short of the planned
 goal.
 Fuel shortages have forced
 the closing of several fac-
 tories, with the workers sent
 home on half pay.  Further
 unemployment is expected, and
 regime economists foresee up to
 200,000 workers  without jobs
 by the beginning of 1957.
 Economic aid from the USSR
 will allegedly supply on credit
 the country's bread grain needs
 until the end of May.   But,
 with trade-debts piling up and
 exports at a standstill, some
 form of over-all large-scale
 aid will be needed.   Press re-
 ports from Budapest claim that
 the Hungarian government had
 been planning to ask for a
 $100,000,000 loan from the
 International Bank for Re-
 construction and Development,
 even though not a member.
 The Kadar regime, although
 continuing its use of martial
 law, curfews and arrests of op-
 position figures, is attempting
 to appear as conciliatory as
 possible.   It has de-emphasized
 its police methods, has stressed
 the alleged legality of its
 tactics, has continued to per-
 mit the formation of ostensibly
 nonparty youth groups, news-
 papers, and trade unions, and
 apparently has avoided strict
 regime censorship of some
 news media.   Negotiations with
 minority party figures are
 reportedly in progress and
 radio Budapest recently prom-
 ised that the government would
 be "extended" in the near
 future.
 Although the people have
 been deprived of their top
 leadership and are no longer
 united in active and violent
 opposition to the regime,
 basic hostility probably re-
 mains as high as ever.   Spor-
 adic strikes, occasional anti-
 regime demonstrations and an
 all-pervading popular apathy
 can be expected to plague the
 regime throughout the coming
 year.
 EAST GERMAN CRACKDOWN ON INTELLECTUALS AND STUDENTS
 The East German regime is
 making alternate threats and
 promises to intellectuals and
 university students, while
 playing on the theme that ex-
 cesses and misguided actions by
 these groups  were responsible
 for the anti-Soviet developments
 in Poland and Hungary.   Some
 intellectuals have been arrested
 and a few university students
 expelled as a warning to poten-
 tial dissident elements.
 Important party and government
 officials are joining the
 press and radio in the campaign
 to combat the spread of
 "dangerous" ideas.

 tendencies similar to those
 evidenced by Hungarian intel-
 lectuals had been observed
 among some East Germans, he
 warned that under no circum-
 stance would his regime toler-
 ate such leanings.
 Some prominent intellec-'
 tuals connected with publica-
 tions denounced by Ulbricht
 for printing "defeatist arti-
 cles" by Hungarian intellec-
 tuals have now been arrested,
 probably as a warding to others
 to hew more closely to the
 party.line.  Writers and intel-
 lectuals are clearly not to be
 permitted to spearhead a drive
 for liberalization in East
 Germany, as they did in Poland
 and Hungary.
 Recent pronouncements in
 the party press by leading
 Communist officials reflect
 the regime's growing concern
 over widespread ideological
 deviations among students,
 particularly their unwillingness
 to accept the orthodox Russian
 interpretation of the recent
 developments in Eastern Europe.
 The party's problems are now
 compounded, since it must com-
 bat not only Western ideas but
 also the concept of a develop-
 ment of national Communism
 within the Soviet bloc.  The
 government is especially sensi-
 tive to hostility among young
 peopled
 A letter from the party
 central committee signed by
 Ulbricht illustrates the re-
 gime's approach to the problem.
 Clearly threatening expulsion
 or worse for those who do not
 conform, it warned, "At our
 universities and colleges only
 those may study who are faith-
 ful and loyal to the worker-
 peasant power."  The letter
 cited the necessity for close
 ties between students and
 workers, and then continued,
 "He who attempts to maintain
 or restore capitalism--even
 though he may try to'disguise
 capitalism with hypocritical
 slogans...is trying to stem
 the course of the wheel of
 history and will fail in the
 attempt,"
 Minister of State Security
 Ernst Wollweber, long-time Com-
 munist thug and hatchet man,
 got into the act with an arti-
 cle in the party newspaper on
 21 December, warning, "We will
 not tolerate so-called 'free'
 discussion that leads to anti-
 democratic and antisocialist
 ideology."   He said enemy agents
 in universities, encouraged by
 the Hungarian revolt, had been
 arrested.
 In an effort further to
 isolate East German students
 from forbidden ideologies, in-
 cluding national Communism,
 the government has sharply
 curtailed visits of foreign
 delegations and athletic teams,
 partic"ularly, from West Germany
 and Poland.
 BCLIVIAN MONETARY PROGRAM MAY PROVOKE CRISIS

 of austerity measures which
 in their initial phases bear
 particularly hard on the
 Bolivian worker, who understands
 neither the economic exigencies
 behind stabilization nor its
 ultimate aims.
 The new administration of
 moderate President Siles Zuazo
 appeared to have won substantial
 advance co-operation for the
 plan from labor and political
 leaders of the government
 Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement  (MNR).   The first
 days of the program's opera-
 tion were punctuated, however,
 by sharp price increases, spo-
 radic rioting and serious
 violence in the mining districts
 over labor's loss of subsidized
 food purchases.   Influential
 labor leaders, whose backing
 may be vital for the program's
 eventual success, wavered in
 their support.   Juan Lechin,
 president of the senate and head
 of the powerful Bolivian Work-
 ers Central (COB), threatened
 to denounce the reform as prej-
 udicial to the                      workers'  in-
 terests and convened a series
 of meetings starting 21 Decem-
 ber to-determine the COB's
 future attitude toward the
 program.
 Discouraged by such ad-
 verse reactions,  Siles has con-
 sidered stepping down from
 office in favor of leftist
 Vice President Chavez, and the
 cabinet reportedly tendered
 its resignation on 18 December
 in protest against a left-wing
 congressional attack.   Chavez,
 who is now in New York for the
 UN General Assembly meetings,
 has subsequently assured US
 officials of his support of
 the stabilization program.
 Ever since Siles' inaug-
 uration last August, however,
 there has been a widening rift
 between the left and moderate
 wings of the MNR..   As the
 power base of the left wing
 of the party,  the COB considers
 itself a co-partner in direct-
 ing government policy.   Its
 leaders control congress, the
 vice presidency, and four
 cabinet posts.
 In the event the stabili--
 zation program becomes the issue
 provoking a struggle for power
 within the MNR, the COB and
 other leftist elements could
 possibly command--in addition
 to rank-and-file union affili-
 ates--the great majority of
 the armed worker and peasant
 militia.  The militia is numeri-
 cally superior to the combined
 armed forces and police, and
 in fighting ability is believed
 to be an almost equal match
 for them--particularly since
 the loyalty of the police and
 armed forces to the government
 might be affected by an open
 split in the MNR.
 Although the concerted
 opposition of labor could
 probably wreck the stabiliza-
 tion plan, leftist labor and
 political leaders may be re-
 luctant to force the downfall
 of the government over this
 issue.   As in the past,  labor
 leaders may be expected to
 threaten violent action in a
 continuing effort to extract
 special concessions for the
 worker, but they are probably
 not eager to assume the respon-
 sibilities of office themselves
 in a deteriorating economic
 situation, which apparently       25X1

 27 December 1956
 Indignation over recent
 Soviet actions in Hungary has
 brought an almost complete re-
 versal of British public at-
 titudes toward the desirability
 of expanding contacts with the
 Soviet Union.  Virtually all
 trade union and student exchange
 trips have been caazceled. Sever-
 al unions with considerable
 Communist sentiment and which
 had earlier led the drive for
 expanding contacts with the
 bloc have dropped plans to ex-
 chang:; delegations.  On the na-
 tional level, the General Coun-
 cil of the Trades Union Congress
 (TUC) on 29 November urged its
 187 affiliates to abandon any
 such glans.   The TUC was capi-
 talizing on the changed climate
 of opinion to give voice to its
 own skepticism of the value of
 the exchanges, which it had
 questioned even before the dis-
 turbances in Eastern Europe.
 The Foreign Office has
 modified its position in such
 a way as not to preclude a re-
 sumption of its policy of pro-
 moting contacts.   Britain will
 avoid exchanges that might be
 accompanied by great publicity,
 such as a scheduled visit of
 the Sadler Wells Ballet to
 Moscow.   The Foreign Office
 states that it intends to avoid
 a "rigid" attitude and will
 consider exchanges that would
 benefit Britain from a technical
 or intelligence point of view.
 While thus accommodating
 to public opinion, the governr
 ment does not appear to have
 abandoned its view that expanded
 exchanges of individuals and
 groups offer the principal hope
 for a long-term improvement in  25X1
 Anglo-Soviet relations.  One
 visit still on the calendar is
 that of Prime Minister Eden to
 Moscow in May 1957.
 Algeria
 Terrorism increased during
 the Christmas season despite
 repeated French claims that
 military action has eliminated
 all large bands.   In addition,
 a countrywide week-long general
 strike at an indefinite date
 has been decreed by the Nation-
 al Liberation Front.
 Minister Resident Lacoste
 in Algeria has scored a victory
 over local French settler ex-
 tremists.   He influenced the
 mayors in the departments of
 Oran and Constantine not to
 subscribe to resolutions drawn
 up by their Algiers Department
 colleagues calling for their
 resignations if the government
 dissolved settler-controlled
 municipal and departmental
 councils in order to permit
 greater Moslem participation.
 Councils are being dissolved,
 but even so, Lacoste still
 has been unable to get a singze

 influential Moslem to partici-
 pate in his reform program.
 About 15 January, Premier
 Mollet is expected to decree
 equal civil rights, election
 of a unicameral body from-which
 a prime minister chosen by Paris
 would select a cabinet respon-
 sible to the assembly, and a
 reconstitution of local councils
 to provide equal French and
 Moslem representation.   This
 plan will probably be unaccept-
 able to the rebels, who demand
 recognition of the principle
 of Algerian independence.
 Morocco and Tunisia
 Greater co-operation be-
 tween France and Morocco and
 Tunisia appears probable de-
 spite disagreement over the
 status of French troops and the
 extent of Paris' contribution
 to the local budgets.   In Rabat,
 Foreign Minister Balafrej and
 another cabinet minister re-
 portedly have convinced the
 sultan that a compromise with
 France is necessary because of
 the serious economic situation.
 The dominant Istiglal party has
 not yet accepted this thesis,
 and the sultan will delay ap-
 pointing  an  ambassador  to
 France until Paris-makes some
 concession to avoid arousing
 the party members.
 The climate of the Tuni-
 sion-French negotiations has
 improved principally as a
 result of Tunisia's realization
 that it must depend on France
 for funds.  Bourghiba was un-
 usually friendly recently while
 presiding at a French cultural
 gathering.  Agreement has been
 reached for the French govern-
 ment to purchase outlying French
 farms, and Paris has made some
 financial advances to permit
 Tunis to pay its current ex-
 penses.
 The Laotian cabinet on 22
 December refused to approve a
 communique" signed by Prime
 Minister Souvanna Phouma and
 Pathet Lao chief Souphannouvong
 which called for the immediate
 inclusion of several Pathet Lao
 leaders in the cabinet but of-
 fered no effective guarantees
 for restoration of the govern-
 ment's control over the disputed
 provinces and for integration
 of Pathet forces into the royal
 army,  Although unwilling to
 accept a sellout to the Pathet
 Lao, the cabinet still wishes
 to reach a settlement and has
 agreed to accept two Pathet Lao
 leaders in the cabinet with
 minor portfolios, if an accept-
 able agreement can be reached
 on the dissolution of the Pathet
 Lao and for the immediate im-
 position of government control
 over the Pathet forces and the
 two northern provinces.

 This latest development
 poses a dilemma for the Pathet
 Lao, which, although willing to
 make sweeping concessions "in
 principle," has heretofore
 shown great reluctance to agree
 to specific terms which threat-
 ened its control over the two
 provinces.  On the other hand,
 if the Pathets fail to meet the
 cabinet's conditions, the
 Souvanna Phouma government prob-
 ably will fall, terminating
 the agreements already negotiat-
 ed.   In this connection, Sou-
 vanna on 22 December reportedly
 reaffirmed his intention to
 resign if no solution to the
 Pathet problem is found.
 In the event an acceptable
 agreement is reached, the gov-
 ernment reportedly plans to
 place the issue before the
 National Assembly during the
 first week in January.  A two-
 thirds majority will then be
 required to approve the
 "broadening of the cabinet"
 to include the Pathet Lao
 officials.

 Hanoi and Haiphong, especially
 among intellectuals and mer-

 Ho Chi Minh's press decree
 of 15 December tightened the
 already stringent regulation
 of publications and provided
 the basis for the Hanoi Admin-
 istrative Committee's immediate
 suspension of the new literary
 periodical People's Culture.
 In the five issues of this
 periodical since it began
 publication several months ago,
 there were apparently several
 articles which drew attention
 to the repression of individual
 creativeness in the arts by
 the Communist bureaucracy.   In
 announcing the suspension,
 Hanoi radio declared that every
 issue caused "readers to be-
 come discouraged, pessimistic,
 and dubious of our regime and
 leadership... and had a disas-

 dation of North Vietnam."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SCANDALS PLAGUE RHEE ADMINISTRATION
 Three scandals, two in-
 volving assassinations and one
 corruption, have lately embar-
 rassed the Syngman Rhee admin-
 istration in  South  Korea.   The
 handling of the cases suggests
 that Rhee is reluctant at this
 time to protect officials guilty
 of misconduct, and this attitude
 may presage at least a partial
 cleanup within  the corruption-
 ridden Liberal Party.
 Two trials now hold public
 attention in South Korea.   In
 one, the assailant of Vice
 President Chang Myon has said
 he was aided in his assassina-
 tion attempt by the South Ko-
 rean National Police.   In the
 other, Lt. Gen. Kang Mun-bong,
 one of South Korea's ablest
 generals and a close friend of
 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff Chong Il-Kwon, ap-
 pears likely to be convicted
 of complicity in the year-old
 slaying of CIC chief Maj. Gen.
 Kim Chang-yong ("Snake" Kim).
 To date there is no reli-
 able evidence to link senior
 administration officials to the
 wounding of Chang.   However,
 the long-standing hostility
 between Rhee and his vice presi-
 dent has caused the incident
 to be embarrassing to the ad-
 ministration.   The Democratic
 Party has alleged that his
 assailant had visited Seoul
 police headquarters several
 times prior to the shooting.
 It is possible certain police
 officials, anxious to curry
 favor with Rhee,  encouraged the
 attempt on Chang's life.
 On top of these develop-
 ments, in late November two
 Liberal Party politicians, in-
 cluding Assembly vice speaker
 Hwang Sang-su, were forced to
 resign high assembly posts
 after being linked with the
 smuggling of a consignment of
 watches from Hong Kong.   The
 incident prompted Rhee to an-
 nounce that he would sever all
 connections with persons whose
 conduct is detrimental to the
 national welfare, without re-
 gard to past services.
 While Rhee has shown no
 sign of disrupting legal proc-
 esses in the smuggling and
 Chang Myon cases, he may desire  25X1
 to limit the scope of the
 "Snake" Kim investigation.
 case appears to. be adversely
 affecting army morale and is
 undermining popular confidence

 President Rhee's stated
 intention not to protect those
 guilty of personal misconduct
 will probably not preclude ex-
 tralegal activities on behalf
 of  the"LiberaI  Party.

 INDIAN REACTION TO NEHRU'S VISIT TO UNITED STATES
 The Indian public and press
 appear pleased with Prime Min-
 ister Nehru's reception in the
 United States and feel that
 there will be a definite im-
 provement in Indian-American
 relations.
 There is no reason to be-
 lieve this favorable reaction
 will last for long, however, or
 that Nehru himself has changed
 his basic beliefs that military
 pacts are bad and that India
 must remain friendly with both
 the USSR and Communist China.
 The Kashmir question, to be
 raised in the United Nations in
 January, is likely to produce
 renewed Indian criticism of the
 United States.
 More than 100 members of
 the Indian parliament sent a
 message to Nehru on 21 December
 expressing "deep appreciation
 for his great achievements in
 cementing friendship between
 India and the United States."
 That was only to be expected
 when two minds so earnestly ded-
 icated to the cause of peace and
 human progress discussed world
 problems in an informal atmos-
 phere."  Another paper commented
 on the meeting:   "It comes at a
 moment of history when the
 policies of the United States
 and India, which had seemed to
 follow divergent paths, have at
 last coincided and found a firm
 basis of co-operation with the
 UN."
 Other Indian papers com-
 ment:                                                                 "Of all that has been
 published about the visit, the
 most arresting statements are
 in Nehru's address to the UN
 General Assembly.   Nehru's
 speech should convince all alike
 that the future of the UN should
 not be judged by comparing its
 apparently meager achievement...
 the future of world peace depends
 on world opinion which will give
 the UN the strength it needs for
 throwing all its weight effec-
 tively against the aggressor."
 The Indian press has car-
 ried extensive reports of the
 Eisenhower-Nehru talks, as well
 as of Nehru's New York visit.
 Commenting on the Eisenhower-
 Nehru joint communique, one
 paper observed:   "Never perhaps
 has so much been said in so few
 words...the utter sincerity of
 the declaration is so apparent.
 The only discordant note
 struck was by the Indian Commu-
 nist Party organ Swadinhata,
 which stated that the Eisenhower-
 Nehru communique showed a strong
 departure from Nehru's former
 "strong, healthy, independent,
 self-sufficient principles."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SU$ "GARY
 THE BALTIC STATES:   CHRONIC' TROUBLE
 Lithuanian party boss
 Antanas Snechkus admitted in
 mid-December that the Hungarian
 revolt had encouraged "bourgeois
 nationalist elements, and their
 accomplices" in Lithuania to
 raise their heads, and attack
 the Communist Party.   Early in
 November anti-Soviet rioters
 in several cities demanded the
 withdrawal of Russians from
 Lithuania, and local party
 concern over student unrest
 in Latvia and Estonia was
 expressed early this month.
 These and other recent develop-
 ments in the Baltic states in-
 dicate that fundamental anti-
 Communism and resistance to
 Soviet rule are still strong
 and perhaps growing 16 years
 after Lithuania, Latvia and
 Estonia were incorporated into
 the USSR.
 Seizure
 of Baltic States
 The Soviets
 gained an initial
 foothold in the
 Baltic area in Octo-
 ber 1939 when "mutual
 assistance" pacts
 were concluded with
 the three' neutral
 republics.   By May
 1940, the Kremlin
 had evidently decided
 to take complete .
 control in the Baltic
 republics and
 military occupation
 was completed in
 mid-June.
 The Kremlin
 demanded that the
 parliament of each
 republic be dissolved
 and a new government
 elected.  Elections
 held in July achieved
 the obvious results.
 In early August,
 each nation asked
 ALAND
 ISLANDS
 and received admission into
 the Soviet Union.   The princi-
 pal Western powers have never
 recognized this development,
 however, a fact which many
 sources believe to be an
 important element in continued
 Baltic resistance to Soviet
 rule.
 Soviet Control
 The Kremlin has done little
 to modify the harsh policies
 it put into effect on the
 admission of the Baltic states
 into the USSR.   The post-Stalin
 thaw apparently has not been
 as rapid there as in other
 areas of the Soviet Union, and
 the basic features of Soviet
 control remain unaltered.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Baltic regimes have
 traditionally been headed by
 Moscow-trained natives like
 Snechkus in Lithuania and
 Yanus Kalnberzin in Latvia,
 who have tossed their Communist
 parties since 1940.   In both
 party and government, key posi-
 tions on the second echelon
 have usually been held by
 Russians.   Between 1944 and
 1953, for example, there was
 an  almost unbroken succession
 of Russian second secretaries
 of the party in each republic.
 In addition,  Slavs have
 always comprised a strong mi--
 nority"in the Baltic central
 committees, and principal
 cabinet portfolios have often
 been held by specialists from
 Moscow.   These regimes are
 maintained in power by the
 presence of large numbers of
 Soviet troops, augmented by
 internal security troops, whose
 continued presence is justified
 by the alleged need to defend
 the Baltic Sea approaches to
 the Soviet Union.
 The keynote of Moscow's
 Baltic policy has been the
 Sovietization' of all spheres
 of life.   Primary attention
 has been directed to the
 socialization of industry,
 collectivization of agriculture,
 and Communist education of the
 populace, which, according to
 1956 Soviet statistics, numbers
 5,800,000.   Implementation of
 this policy often entails purges
 and mass deportation of re-
 calcitrants.   The most extensive
 deportations took place in 1940,
 after the Soviets occupied the
 area, and in 1944, when it was
 "liberated" from German
 occupation.  While no reliable
 figures are available, the
 more than 100,000 persons were
 deported in these periods.
 Banishment of natives to
 Siberia reportedly continued in
 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1953.   The
 last major purge occurred in
 early 1950, when the Estonian
 party underwent a thorough
 cleansing in order to eliminate
 "bourgeois nationalism" and to
 correct the serious mistakes
 in the "allocation and training
 of cadres" which had resulted
 in the "admission to party
 ranks of kulaks and other
 hostile elements."
 The only significant shift
 in Baltic policy occurred in
 June 153 following charges at
 party plenums that distortions
 of the Lenin-Stalin nation-
 alities policy had been allowed
 in the past.   As a result,  the
 Russian second secretaries
 were replaced by natives.
 Similar plenums with similar
 results were also held in the
 Ukrainian and Georgian
 Republics;  this de-Russification
 policy may have been the result
 of the machinations of Beria,
 who was seeking to bolster
 his own position, or may have
 been undertaken by the entire
 leadership in order to preclude
 adverse reactions to Stalin's
 death by making concessions
 to local national sentiment.
 By early 1954 the trend
 had been reversed in the
 Baltic states, and Russians
 again began to appear in lead-
 ing party and government posts.
 By January 1956 the post of
 party second secretary had re-
 verted to Russians in both
 Latvia and Lithuania.
 Effects of Soviet Policy
 Moscow's acquisition of
 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
 satisfied some of the Kremlin's
 major strategic requirements.
 It secured a portion of the
 western boundary against land-
 based attack and increased the
 USSR's acces to maritime trade  25X1
 routes.   It also added to the
 Soviet Union three states
 whose economies and cultures
 were already well developed.
 Twelve years of uninter-
 rupted Sovietization (1944-56),
 however,   have   served  to

 strenmthen the basic anti-
 Communism of a majority of
 the native population.   Economic,
 recovery in the postwar period
 han been slow and. while the
 living standard in the Baltic
 area is evidently still some-
 what higher than in the rest
 of the USSR, several reports
 suggest that,fin contrast to
 the USSR,  it has not surpassed
 its prewar level.
 Russification in all
 spheres of life also causes
 considerable resentment.  Russian
 has replaced native tongues as
 the official language of govern-'
 ment, and heavy doses of Commu-
 nist propaganda are administered
 daily in an attempt to convince   iI
 the population of the superior-
 ity of the Soviet system.   Par-
 ticularly in the cities, both
 military personnel and the
 thousands of Russian civilians
 who poured into the area after
 the deportations receive
 preferential treatement even in
 insignificant matters,  such as
 preferential seating in theaters.
 The net result has been to make
 many natives feel like second-
 class citizens in their own
 countries.
 Current Situation
 The Baltic area has been
 closed to foreigners since
 1940 and, as a result, little
 firsthand information has been
 obtained concerning the after-
 math of de-Stalinization there.
 It is evident that tensions
 lessened and fear of the secret
 police diminished noticeably.
 As a result of recent amnesties,
 small numbers of former inmates
 of slave labor camps have
 begun to drift back into  h
 area.
 t e situation
 erwise remains much the
 same as it was prior to Stalin`
 death.
 Stubborn passive resist-
 ance'continues in rural
 districts.   Party plenums held
 in each republic during 1956
 demanded an improvement in
 political work among the rural
 population.
 low party member-
 ship on collective farms is
 regarded as a serious and
 continuing problem.
 there  25X1
 are still many peop    who who prefer
 to "live in an illegal situation"
 rather than to take advantage
 of the 1955 amnesty for those
 who collaborated with the
 Germans.
 The outbreak of rioting
 in November provided the first
 indication of open resistance
 in the Baltic area in many
 years, and the admission by
 Snechkus of disturbances in
 his bailiwick conceded for the
 first time that events in the
 Satellites have had serious
 repercussions within the USSR.
 It may be,  however,  that
 Snechkus'  treatment of the
 disturbances is of greater
 significance than the events
 themselves.   His statement
 that it is the youth and stu-
 dents who are most susceptible
 to the lies of the bourgeois
 nationalists implies that years
 of Communist indoctrination
 have not succeeded in winning
 Lithuanian youth over to
 Communism.
 Repressive action against
 dissident elements in the Bal-
 tics may be in preparation.
 Snechkus asserted that it was
 impossible to "remain passive"
 while the youth were being im-
 bued with false and idealized
 views of bourgeois life.   If
 an attempt is made to overcome
 resistance through repression,    25X1
 however,  it does not seem
 likely to enjoy any more success
 than have similar moves in the
 past.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Communist China probably
 will not achieve the high tar-
 gets for agriculture of the
 Second Five-Year Plan (1958-
 1962), unless the regime invests
 more than is now scheduled.
 Peiping's planning relies heavily
 on the farms to produce the
 surpluses needed to pay for the
 ambitious industrialization pro-
 gram.  To date,the pressure of
 a growing population on land
 resources and the unwillingness
 of the regime to invest heavily
 in agricultural machinery and
 fertilizer have made increas-
 ingly difficult the realization
 of such surpluses.  The regime
 began in 1955 a major effort to
 socialize agriculture in order
 to increase state control over
 crop output.

 Agricultural output in Com-
 munist China constitutes an
 estimated 45 percent of the
 gross national product, and 80
 percent of the population lives
 on farms.  China's agricultural
 production--and its population--
 are greater than that of any
 other country in the world.  The
 land is worked very intensively.
 Whereas 168,000,000 Americans
 are supported by 866,000 square
 miles of cultivated land, China's
 600,000,000 are fed from some
 428,000 square miles of agri-
 culturally productive land.

 standpoint of mechanization and'
 collectivization, since paddy
 farming is not easily improved
 by mechanization or by merging
 small plots into larger fields.
 The problem of increasing farm
 production is not one of im-
 proving labor productivity, but
 one of increasing land produc-
 tivity.
 Some increase in yields is
 possible through the relatively
 inexpensive measures of greater
 use of natural fertilizer,
 better seeds and insecticides,
 and through selective stock
 breeding and small-scale irriga-
 tion and flood control.  Any
 major improvement in the balance
 of population and food supply,
 however, will probably come
 about only with large-scale
 outlays, particularly for chem-
 ical fertilizers.
 A major problem facing the
 regime is maintaining production
 incentives.  To prevent discon-
 tent among. the millions of
 peasants who have lost and are
 losing property through collec-
 tivization, it is necessary to
 demonstrate that socialism in-
 creases their income.   While the
 progress of collectivization
 seems to have been to the gen-
 eral satisfaction of the leader-
 ship, some fairly serious side
 effects have been
 admitted.   The nor-
 mal sideline produc-
 tion of the farmers
 in off seasons ap-
 pears to have been
 neglected.   This has
 decreased the income
 of the peasants and
 reduced the amount of
 raw materials avail-
 able for some light
 industries and ex-
 port trade.  Also,
 the numbers of fowl
 and livestock have
 declined under the
 collectivization pro-
 gram.
 61211         Socialization Program
 The' regime has
 almost completed a campaign
 to socialize agriculture, begun
 in 1950, which gives Peiping
 a mechanism for extracting the
 surpluses it needs for its
 investment program.   The process
 of socialization began with the
 land reform program which,
 theoretically at least, took
 land from the."landlord" and
 "rich peasant" classes and re-
 distributed it among land-poor
 peasants.  Next, "mutual aid
 teams" were established in
 which neighboring families pooled
 their labor, animals and imple-
 ments for certain tasks at
 certain seasons.  The peasant,
 however, remained an individual
 agent.
 The third and fourth phases
 have involved, the establishment
 of agricultural producer co-
 operatives.  Producer co-ops
 proceed from "lower" or "semi-
 socialist" to the fourth stage
 of "advanced" or "fully social-
 ist."  In the lower form, land
 and property are pooled and the
 individual is paid a share of
 the produce both on his labor
 and on the value of his capital
 contributions.   In the advanced
 form,, land and property are
 collectively owned and each
 member is paid exclusively ac-
 cording to the amount of work
 he performs.

 An advanced co-op encom-
 passes between 100 and 300 peas-
 ant households.   As socializa-
 tion progresses, these co-ops
 presumably will be combined
 into much larger units until
 they become bona fide collective
 farms.   For example,  the model
 Peace Collective Farm outside
 Peiping has 2,400 peasant
 households.
 The fifth and last stage
 of socialization, according to
 Peiping's doctrine, is technical
 reform.  The regime is not
 likely to make spectacular gains
 in this field for some years to
 come.
 In July 1955 the inter-
 vention of Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 resulted in a tremendous ac-
 celeration of the drive toward
 the fully socialist form.   It
 is now planned that 90 percent
 of China's peasants will be in
 advanced co-ops by the spring
 of 1957.
 Agricultural Plans
 Communist plans for agri-
 cultural production are set
 forth in three programs:   the
 First Five-Year Plan (1952-
 1957), the Second Five-Year
 Plan (1958-1962) and a long-
 range Twelve-Year Draft National
 Program for the Development
 of Agriculture (1955-1967).
 Production targets for the
 First Five-Year Plan have
 shuttled up and down.   The cur-
 rent target, as spelled out at
 the eighth party congress in
 September 1956,  is the same
 as the original target.   It
 calls for a 17.6-percent in-
 crease in food crop production
 between 1952 and 1957 (164,-
 000,000 to 193,000,000 metric
 tons) and for a 26-percent in-
 crease in cotton output (1,300,-
 000 to 1,630,000 tons) for the
 same period.   Peiping claimed
 in late November that food
 crop production had already
 reached the 1957 goal.
 The Second Five-Year Plan
 calls for a near doubling of
 1952 food and cotton produc-
 tion by 1962.   Under the twelve-
 year program, food crop produc-
 tion in 1967 is to reach 450,-
 000,000 tons, a 175-percent..i.n-
 crease over 1952, and cotton
 output is to reach 4,000,000
 tons.
 While primary reliance is
 being placed on increasing
 yields, ambitious plans for the

 several long-term multipurpose
 water conservancy projects,
 In the near future, however,
 most of the benefits in the
 field of water conservancy will
 come from projects on the local
 level.
 Plans to produce heavier
 and more complicated iarm.equip-
 ment,                    such as tractors, reapers
 and combine harvesters, are in
 an early stage, and production
 of such items will remain in-
 significant for some time.
 Three tractor plants are being
 built--in Loyang, Tientsin and
 Nanking--which should begin to
 meet an important part of China's
 needs after 1958.   Most of
 China's heavier equipment has
 been imported from other bloc
 countries.
 More important than mecha-
 nization in Communist plans. is
 the provision for better hand-
 and animal-drawn implements.
 For example,  the traditional
 plow used by the vast majority
 of Chinese peasants does not
 plow deeply or turn the earth
 properly.   Some 1,300,000 two-
 wheeled plows were delivered to
 peasants in the first half of
 1956.
 Increased use of chemical
 fertilizers probably holds the
 greatest single promise for in-
 creasing agricultural production;
 in China.   Natural fertilizer
 is in short supply.   Probably
 as little as 1.0 percent of the
 amount of chemical fertilizer
 which could be profitably ap-
 plied is now in use, and the
 prospect is that only a small
 fraction of chemical fertilizer
 requirements will be met for
 many years.
 Agriculture, forestry and
 water conservancy received only

 7.6 percent of capital con-

 First Five-Year Plan.   Official
 statements on the Second Five-
 Year Plan indicate that agri-
 cultural investment, although
 double the First Five-Year
 Plan figure, is still sub-
 ordinate to heavy industrial
 investment, and that to assure
 planned investment rates, the
 regime is relying chiefly on
 an even more intensive effort
 by the peasants and on better
 control over production.
 Prospects
 According to Communist
 doctrine,          production increases
 will be effected through social-

 can be achieved by merging small
 individual plots of land into
 larger fields, centralizing
 management, better planning on
 land utilization, and organizing
 labor for land and capital im-
 provements.   Set against these
 probable gains are the disrup-
 tive effects of collectivization
 on the countryside,  the fact
 that agriculture gets a small
 portion of total investment, and
 a nationwide shortage of qualified
 cadres to manage the collectives.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SU1V7?ARY
 27 December 1956
 SPAIN:   INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
 Spain is threatened by
 growing inflation as a result
 of pay raises averaging 40 to
 45 percent decreed in November
 for industrial and agricultural
 workers.   Government control
 measures thus far seem inadequate
 and, should an inflationary
 spiral develop,  the ensuing eco-
 nomic upsets and popular unrest
 could endanger Franco's position.
 Siace the autumn of 1955,
 Spanish officials have expressed
 concern over the increasing
 danger of Inflation, the steady
 rise in living costs, and the
 critical shortages of basic
 foods.   The problem was inten-
 sified by the unusually severe
 winter last year and by wage
 boosts in the spring and fall
 of 1950.
 The increases given to in-
 dustrial workers in April, as
 the first round of a general
 pay raise to help offset the
 rise in living costs, failed to
 satisfy labor's demands and
 were followed almost immediately
 by a protracted strike in the
 northern industrial centers.
 The government has shown its
 apprehension of further worker
 unrest by decreeing a substan-
 tial wage boost for agricultur-
 al as well as industrial workers
 effective 1 November to replace
 the modest "second-round" in-
 crease originally planned for
 October.
 I..1' lat i onary Threat
 in 1956 are the pub-
 lic and private in-
 vestment boom, wage
 increases exceeding
 Inflation has
 been encouraged since
 1954 by an increased
 domestic demand,  sup-
 ported by an expan-
 sion of bank credit
 and the total money
 supply.   Factors con-
 tributing to this
 condition since early
 the growth in productivity, and
 foreign exchange shortages re-
 sulting from the effects of
 last February's freezing weath-
 er on Spain's agricultural ex-
 ports.
 The damage from the cold
 wave is expected to curtail
 citrus crop export earnings at
 least until 1959, thus limiting
 essential imports from Western
 Europe.  Compensatory expansion
 of other Spanish exports has
 aggravated the inflationary
 situation by reducing supplies
 of these commodities on the
 home market.   An additional in-
 flationary factor will be the
 anticipated tripling of counter-
 part expenditures for American
 base construction in the cur-
 rent fiscal year and through
 fiscal 1958.
 Budget Deficit
 Government borrowing to
 finance economic development
 programs has resulted in a
 growing over-all budget deficit.
 It was estimated in early Octo-
 ber that the deficit for 1956
 might be as much as  513, 000, 0()0,
 some 66 percent above the 1955
 figure,"  Even this estimate does
 not take into account the ad-
 ditional wage boosts decreed by
 the government on 26 October
 for some 8,000,000 industrial
 and agricultural workers.   These
 raises, which average 40 to 45
 percent and range as high as
 75 percent, are equivalent to
 over $820,000,000 this year,

 or more than 10 percent of the
 national income.
 These wage increases, with
 the additional family, seniority
 or production bonuses expected
 to accompany them, will probably
 satisfy the workers' demands for
 higher pay, but unless there is
 a concomitant increase in produc-
 tivity, a rise in the price
 level is inevitable,  The impact
 on price levels is already sub-
 stantial, and complaints over
 the steadily rising cost of liv-
 ing can be expected to multiply.
 Effective government action
 to counter this inflationary
 threat is unlikely.   There are
 serious political and adminis-'
 trative obstacles to instituting
 adequate controls over the do-
 mestic economy, and Spain's bal-
 ance-of-payments difficulties
 cannot be alleviated--as can its
 neighbors'--by the automatic
 credit extension which the Euro-
 pean Payments Union provides
 its members,   The $30,000,000 of
 rationing to reinforce price
 controls, or of resorting to
 indirect monetary and fiscal
 controls to reduce demand.  The
 The possibilities of in-
 creasing supply to control in-
 flation are limited by Spain's
 precarious trade balance,  The
 government has failed to facili-
 tate the flow of foreign exchange
 by creating a favorable climate
 for private foreign investment,
 which continues to face exten-
 sive restrictions on foreign
 ownership of industrial and
 commercial enterprises in Spain
 and on the transfer of earnings
 abroad,
 Adequately enforced con-
 trol measures, particularly if
 attended by steps to revamp the
 nation's tax system in order to
 provide more revenue, would be
 opposed by the propertied
 classes, which are the backbone
 of the regime.   Financial,  land-

 to solve its inflationary prob-             threat to high profits and as

 Steps taken thus far on.a
 national basis will probably be
 limited in their practical
 effects.  On 9 November the cab-
 inet re-established a central
 price control board to fix food
 prices and issue directives to
 provincial and municipal author-
 ities.   It also provided for an
 advisory board and a judicial
 agency to prosecute price con-
 trol violators.  On 23 November
 the cabinet put clothing, house-
 hold goods, and construction
 materials under price control.
 The government,  however,
 shows no sign of instituting
 a possible prelude to an eventual
 socialist state.   In addition,
 any prospect of competition from
 foreign firms in Spain as a re-
 sult of the liberalization of
 restrictions on outside capital
 would play on the xenophobic
 fears of all these classes.
 Increasing Instability
 Foreign Minister Martin
 Artajo told the American embassy
 on 19 November that the price
 rise was periling Spain's eco-
 nomic stability.  Failure of the
 government to take the strong
 steps required will probably,,
 in the absence of economic
 assistance from abroad, set off
