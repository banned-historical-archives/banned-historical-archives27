 LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
 To the Congress of the United States:
 I am submitting herewith, for the period July through December
 1955, the eighth semiannual report on operations under the Mutual
 Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle Act), the administra-
 tion of which is one of my responsibilities.
 The present report is primarily a factual description of the volume,
 commodity composition, and geographic pattern of East-West trade
 in 1955, together with a review of the Sino-Soviet bloc's efforts to
 expand its economic relations with the less developed countries.
 During the preparation of this report, the Permanent Subcommittee
 on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations
 held extensive hearings on East-West trade controls and related as-
 pects of the Battle Act. The hearings were focused on the revision of
 the controls which became effective in August, 1954, and which was
 reported in previous Battle Act reports. The Subcommittee's report
 was published on July 18, 1956.  Its findings and recommendations
 are currently being studied and will be the subject of comment in my
 next report to Congress.

 CHAPTER I
 PATTERNS OF TRADE
 Trade Volume
 Total trade (exports and imports) between the free world and the
 Sino-Soviet bloc I amounted to $4.46 billion in 1955, as shown below
 and in Figure I, compared with $3.6 billion in 1954, an increase of
 24 percent:

 Exports to the bloc rose from $1.76 billion in 1954 to an estimated
 $2.03 billion in 1955, a 15 percent increase (Figure II). Imports from
 the bloc moved upward from $1.83 billion in 1954 to an estimated
 $2.43 billion in 1955, or by 32 percent.  The rise of free world exports
 to the bloc was not, therefore, as large as the increase in imports
 from the bloc, a reversal of the situation in 1954.
 The expansio1 of free world exports to the bloc was due substantially
 to increased exports to the European satellite countries, with ship-
 ments to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland providing the largest
 gain. Free world imports advanced from almost all the bloc countries,
 with imports from the U. S. S. R. showing the greatest absolute in-
 crease, followed by Communist China, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.
 The progressive rise in free world trade with the bloc was paralleled
 by an increase in trade within the free world community.  The
 sustained growth of economic activity in the United States and
 Western Europe, and the continued general improvement in economic
 conditions throughout the world, were the principal reasons for the
 accelerated trade development.  The bloc's share of free world
 trade underwent only a fractional percentage change, increasing
 from about 2.3 percent in 1954 to approximately 2.6 percent in
 1955.  Afghanistan, Egypt, Finland, Hong Kong, Iceland, Iran,

 Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and Tibet), North Korea, Outer Mongolia, and North Vietnam.

 Turkey, and Yugoslavia, however, in 1955 carried on more than 10
 percent of their foreign trade with the bloc.
 Sino-Soviet bloc trade in 1955 remained at about the same propor-
 tion as in 1954-roughly 80 percent intrabloc and 20 percent with the
 free world. Communist China, as a single country of the bloc, had a
 similar distribution of trade.  The development of Sino-Soviet bloc
 trade was reviewed in Chapters I and III of Soviet Deterrents to In-
 creased Foreign Trade, the Seventh Semiannual Mutual Defense
 Assistance Control Act (Battle Act) Report which covered the first
 half of 1955.
 At the end of the 1946-55 decade, the total volume of trade con-
 ducted among the "centrally planned" or Communist economies was
 more than 2.5 times higher than before World War II, while their trade
 with the rest of the world was less than half its prewar level, according
 to the United Nations World Economic Survey, 1955. The most signi-
 ficant expansion in foreign trade was in the Soviet Union, where the
 total volume in 1954 was more than four times as large as before the
 war. The greatly increased trade among the bloc countries has been
 part of a general process of integration within the area as a whole.
 The most decisive influence in this integration has been the establish-
 ment and development of a separate, virtually self-contained, trading
 area.
 Western European Bloc Trade
 Western Europe was the major nonbloc trading area in the foreign
 commerce of the European Soviet bloc during the entire postwar
 decade.  The most striking postwar development in the commodity
 pattern of trade of the Eastern European countries has been the
 increase in their exports of machinery and equipment.  In contrast,
 exports of foodstuffs from most of these countries have declined,
 compared with the prewar period.
 The trade of the European Soviet bloc with Western Europe con-
 tinued to expand in 1955 at approximately the same rate as in 1954.
 But in 1955 the actual increase was higher in Western European
 imports from Eastern Europe, a movement that was directly con-
 trary to the situation the year before when Western European exports
 to Eastern Europe were larger.  In addition to the traditional com-
 modities that the European Soviet bloc exported to Western Europe-
 wheat and other foodstuffs, coal, petroleum, and timber-increasing
 quantities of manufactured goods, including machinery and equip-
 ment, were delivered to a number of Western European markets.
 There were also substantial sales of pig iron and cotton to the West.
 The exceptionally large imports of butter and meat into the Eastern
 European countries from Western Europe which occurred in 1954 were
 greatly reduced in 1955.  Imports of grain continued, however, and

 in two cases (Communist East Germany and Poland) were expected
 to continue in spite of the good 1955 harvest. The total of Eastern
 European imports from Western Europe continued to grow rapidly,
 partly because of a substantial increase in deliveries of machinery and
 equipment. Other major imports were chemicals, crude wool, copper
 wire, and rubber.
 The Western European countries which showed the biggest gains in
 trade turnover with the Sino-Soviet bloc on an absolute basis in 1955
 were the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and
 France. The Federal Republic of Germany's trade increased by $154
 million, the United Kingdom's by $147 million, and France's by $70
 million.
 Leading commodities by value in the export trade of the Federal
 Republic of Germany were the following: chemicals, $44.2 million;
 iron and steel products, $17.4 million; ships (marine and coastwise),
 $16.3 million; copper wire, $12.7 million; and non-electrical machinery,
 $10.7 million.  The value of these commodities, which comprised
 nonembargoed items, does not, however, include trade with Commu-
 nist East Germany.
 In the United Kingdom's export trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 the principal commodities by value were.: uncovered wire and cables
 of copper, $28.8 million; reexports of crude rubber (including synthetic
 and reclaimed), $20.5 million; wool tops, $20.1 million; reexports of
 sheep and lambs wool (raw), $14 million; and textile machinery and
 accessories, $12.9 million (all nonembargoed items).
 Principal commodities by value in France's export trade were:
 wheat (soft), $29.9 million; iron and steel semis and finished steel
 products, $30.4 million; chemicals, $11.5 million; wheat flour, $8.9
 million; meat of cattle, $7.4 million; and beet sugar (unrefined),
 $5.3 million (all nonembargoed items).
 Finland and Austria also showed significant trade increases of $35
 million and $37 million, respectively.  Yugoslavia's swelled by over
 $58 million, a fivefold spurt that was generated by the restoration of
 political and economic relations between the U. S. S. R. and Yugo-
 slavia, the principles of which were contained in the Belgrade declara-
 tion of June 2, 1955.  Denmark's trade with the bloc, however,
 decreased by $27 million or about 25 percent.
 COCOM Trade With the Bloc
 The overall trade of the 15 COCOM 2 countries with the Sino-
 Soviet bloc (see Appendix E, Table 2) went up from $1.8 billion in
 1954 to .nearly $2.3 billion in 1955, or by slightly more than $486
 million.  COCOM exports to the bloc were about $150 million higher

 in 1955 than in the previous year, rising rom 88   mil ion in    to
 above $985 million in 1955.
 Communist China's Trade With the Free World
 The trade of Communist China with the free world increased in
 1955, with transactions totaling $805.8 million compared with $669.4
 million in 1954.  The 16 countries that constitute the Organization
 for European Economic Cooperation (see Appendix E for list of
 OEEC members) accounted for 28 percent of this trade, and Japan
 for about 14 percent.
 Communist China's exports to the non-Communist countries in
 1955 were valued at approximately $493 million,' a rise of $117 million
 over 1954.  Exports from nonbloc countries to Communist China
 amounted to about $313 million in 1955, compared with $294 million
 in 1954, $287 million in 1953, and $273 million in 1952.
 In 1955 the value of direct Western European exports to Commu-
 nist China went up by nearly 25 percent over 1954, but this increase
 was more than offset by a decline in exports from Hong Kong. Since
 exports from Hong Kong consisted largely of transshipments of
 Western European products, these statistics reflect primarily changes
 in the methods of shipment rather than in levels of trade.  Japan's
 exports to Communist China, after showing a sharp increase in the
 second half of 1954, remained at the same level throughout 1955.
 Industrial goods were the major items exported to Communist
 China from Western Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong. Chemical
 products, including fertilizers, dyes, drugs, and industrial chemicals,
 accounted for the largest proportion of the total shipments; exports
 of textile fibers and fabrics, metals and manufactures, also composed
 significantly large percentages of the total.
 Exports to Communist China from Asia (excluding Japan and
 Hong Kong), Oceania, and the Near East, on the other hand, con-
 sisted largely of agricultural products.  Raw cotton constituted the
 bulk of exports from Pakistan and Egypt, while exports from Ceylon
 consisted chiefly of crude rubber. Rice was Burma's principal export
 (see pp 29-30), while Indonesia and Malaya supplied mainly copra and
 coconut oil; Australia, wool and wool tops; and India, gunny bags and
 raw cotton.
 Communist China's exports to the non-Communist countries, in
 the order of percentage of total, were foodstuffs (including rice, other
 cereals, vegetable oils for food use, eggs, fruits, vegetables, pulses, and
 tea) ; oilseeds and other agricultural raw materials (textile fibers,
 essential oils, skins and pelts, tung oil, and miscellaneous crude
 materials) ; and a variety of miscellaneous goods (mainly ores, minerals,

 U. S.-European Soviet Bloc Trade
 United States exports to the European Soviet bloc in 1955 were
 valued at $7.3 million, a rise of 18 percent compared with the $6.1
 million export total in 1954 (see Appendix E, Table 4b).  The 1954
 and 1955 totals included, however, $4.7 million of food grains, insec-
 ticides, and drugs shipped to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and East
 Germany under the President's Flood Relief Program for the Danube
 Basin.  United States exports to the U. S. S. R. and its European
 satellites, exclusive of these gift shipments, had an aggregate value
 of $5.7 million for the year 1955, approximately 100 percent more
 than the total of $2.9 million for 1954. These export levels were con-
 siderably below the 1947 and 1948 totals, when United States ship-
 ments to the European bloc totaled, respectively, $339.9 million and
 $123.2 million.
 Of the principal commodities exported by the United States to the
 U. S. S. R. and its European satellites in recent years, wool rags con-
 stituted the major export item for the year 1955, representing some
 30 percent of total exports.  Corn (not seed corn) accounted for
 about 20 percent.  Hides and skins and inedible tallow followed in
 that order.
 United States imports from the European Soviet bloc totaled $55.5
 million in 1955, increasing 31 percent over 1954 imports of $42.4
 million.  The major items imported in 1955 included $19.8 million of
 canned specialty hams, bacon, and sausage casings; $8.4 million of
 furs and manufactures; $6.5 million of benzene; $2.3 million of ferti-
 lizers and materials; $2.0 million of photographic goods; $11 million
 of glass products; and $1.3 million of bristles.
 On November 3, 1955, the Department of Commerce announced
 that it was considering establishment of a roster of selected nonstra-
 tegic goods which could be exported to the European Soviet bloc
 under general license (i. e., not requiring individual validated licenses).,
 This proposed relaxation was designed to promote the aim urged by
 President Eisenhower at the Summit Conference at Geneva in July:
 "To create conditions which will encourage nations to increase the
 exchange of peaceful goods throughout the world."
 The U. S. and the Communist China Trade Embargo
 As outlined in previous Battle Act reports, the United States im-
 posed a total embargo on exports to North Korea immediately follow-
 ing the invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950.  Exports to Com-
 munist China and Manchuria were placed under a total embargo on
 December 3, 1950, with the entry of the Chinese Communists into
 the Korean War.  The embargo has been rigidly enforced and is still
 4 The list of some 700 items in over 57 general commodity categories was released on April 26, 1956.  This
 simplification in licensing procedure in respect to the European soviet bloc only will be discussed in the
 Ninth Battle Act Report, which will review East-West trade developments during the first half of 1956.

 in effect.  Imports from Communist China and North Korea are also
 prohibited unless licensed by the Treasury Department; and no
 licenses are issued for imports from these areas.
 There have been no United States commercial exports to Com-
 munist China or North Korea since the institution of the export ban,
 except for shipments of two passenger cars to China with a total value
 of $6,000 for the use of a diplomatic mission of a friendly foreign
 country, and for the export of $2,530 of magazines and other generally
 available publications to China.  In the third quarter of 1055, the
 Department of Commerce approved export applications to Communist
 China for the shipment of a passenger car valued at $1,000 and of
 automotive replacement parts valued at $60, both for the use of
 diplomatic missions of friendly countries.  The shipment of magazines
 and other unclassified publications was made in the fourth quarter
 of 1955, under a general license system which permits exports of un-
 classified scientific and educational information to all destinations.
 Latin America's total trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc in 1955
 reached a new high level estimated at approximately $340 million, an
 increase of about 34 percent over the $254 million reached in 1954.
 Aggregate annual trade between the United States and Latin America
 is 20 times larger, however, totaling about $7 billion.
 Argentina and Brazil continued in 1955 as the main Latin American
 trade partners with the bloc countries.  Trade between the bloc and
 Argentina, which had accumulated a large credit balance with the
 Soviet Union, amounted to $193 million in 1955.  The value of
 Brazil's trade with the bloc was $85 million, an increase of $42 million
 or about a 100 percent advance over 1954.  Uruguay, which ranked
 third in Latin American-bloc trade exchange in 1954, was displaced
 in 1955 by Cuba as a result of an increase in U. S. S. R. purchases of
 Cuban sugar.
 Latin American exports to the bloc in 1955 rose to an estimated
 $169 million compared with $142 million in 1954, an increase of 20
 percent.  Most of this expansion represented the increase in exports
 by Cuba and Brazil.  The shipment by Cuba of 500,000 tons of sugar
 to the U. S. S. R. valued at $37.4 million as well as increased exports
 of Brazilian goods, especially coffee, were offset in part by a drop of
 $13.3 million in Uruguay's exports to the bloc.  This decline of about
 50 percent in Uruguay's exports was due to a substantial reduction
 in purchases by the Soviet Union.
 Latin American imports from the bloc climbed to $171 million, in
 1955, an increase of 53 percent above the 1954 level of $112 million.
 In 1955 most Latin American countries increased their purchases
 within the bloc area.  Of particular significance were expanded

 imports by Argentina-$120 million in 1955 as against $83 million
 in 1954; and by Brazil-$38 million in 1955 compared with $19 million
 in 1954.  A large proportion of these imports consisted of manufac-
 tured products and industrial raw materials.
 Although Latin American trade with the bloc countries in 1955
 accounted for only 2 percent of that area's trade with the world, the
 same share as in the previous year, the importance of the bloc's trade
 rose for individual countries. Such trade in 1955 represented. 9 percent
 of Argelttina's and 3 percent of Brazil's, Cuba's, and Uruguay's total
 foreign trade, respectively.  In 1954 the proportions were Argentina,
 8 percent; Brazil, 1.3 percent; and Cuba about 1 percent.  Uruguay's
 bloc trade, on the other hand, declined from 5 percent of its entire
 world trade in 1954 to 3 percent in 1955.
 Miscellaneous Trade
 Australia did almost $18 million less trade with the Sino-Soviet
 bloc in 1955 than in 1954, a decline of 25 percent. This decline was
 due mainly to a sag in exports to the U. S. S. R. which followed the
 deterioration in political relations between the two countries, pro-
 duced by the dramatic disclosure in April, 1954, that the Soviet
 Embassy in Canberra was operating a spy network.
 Japan's and Turkey's trade with the bloc went up, respectively, by
 $56 million and $60 million.  Chapter IV of this report surveys bloc
 trade with the less developed areas of the world.
 Trade Agreements
 About 65 percent of the trade of the Sino-Soviet bloc with the free
 world in 1955 was carried on with countries with which it had bilateral
 trade agreements.  A total of 174 trade and payments agreements
 were in effect last year between the bloc and the free world (see Ap-
 pendix D).  In addition, there were five agreements signed in 1955
 which were not to become effective until 1956.  Of the aggregate
 179 agreements,' 29 established a formal basis for trade where only
 informal commercial and barter arrangements had existed previously.
 Only six of the new pacts were concluded with Western European
 countries, most of which have had trade agreements with bloc nations
 since the early postwar period.  The remainder were concluded with
 less developed countries, 13 in the Near East, 8 in Southeast Asia,
 and 2 in Latin America.
 ' The agreements include all East-West government-to-government trade and/or payments agreements,
 as well as semiofficial agreements, which covered trade during some part of 1955.  The majority of the semi
 official agreements were concluded with the East German trade administration by special trading agencies
 of free world countries not recognizing the Communist regime; In practice, these agreements do not differ
 substantially from government-to-government agreements.  Most of the trade agreements establish quan-
 tity or value quotas which, while not binding, are indicative of the level of trade In given commodities for
 which a government is prepared to issue import or export licenses.  The quotas may usually be Increased
 or otherwise revised following consultation of the contracting parties.

 On this side of the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia was very active in the
 trade agreement field, concluding a total of eight agreements. It fully
 restored its economic ties with all the European Soviet bloc countries,
 terminated in 1948 following the break with the Cominform..  The
 preliminary $194 million credit agreement concluded between Yugo-
 slavia and the U. S. S. R. on September 1, 1955, was Belgrade's most
 noteworthy arrangement. Yugoslavia, under this agreement, obtained
 credits amounting to an estimated $110 million for the construction of
 fertilizer and connected plants, the reconstruction of three small mines,
 and other designated projects; $54 million for the purchase of coal, oil,
 and cotton in the Soviet Union; and $30 million in gold or equivalent
 foreign currency for the Yugoslav National Bank. All credits were
 reported to be for 10 years with interest payments of 2 percent.  In
 November, Poland granted a $20 million credit to Yugoslavia to cover
 delivery of food processing and mining equipment, and rolling stock.
 Greece concluded 7 agreements with the European Soviet bloc
 countries, running Yugoslavia a close second; Turkey, Iceland, and
 Argentina each made 6 agreements, and Colombia 1.  Burma con-
 cluded five new pacts with bloc countries and renewed a 1954 agree-
 ment with Communist China.  Both the Sudan and Syria signed
 four.  New agreements concluded by the Sudan and Colombia were
 the first that these countries had negotiated with the bloc.
 Among the more outstanding agreements reached was that between
 the U. S. S. R.. and Austria, following the conclusion of the peace
 treaty. Bulgaria signed four new accords, the largest number of any
 bloc country.  Communist North Vietnam's new agreement with
 France was its first official trade arrangement with the free world.
 The number and the scope of all these trade agreements show the
 intent and advance of the bloc's trade program.

 CHAPTER II
 THE PERIOD OF TRADE CONTACTS
 AND EXCHANGES
 The Geneva Meetings
 The Seventh Battle Act Report (pp. 1-2) summarized the un-
 successful efforts made by the United States, the United Kingdom,
 and France at the Summit Conference in Geneva in July, 1955, and
 at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in the Swiss city during October-
 November, to reach an agreement with the U. S. S. R. on the pro-
 gressive elimination of barriers which interfered with peaceful trade.
 The U. S. S. R. negotiators, as pointed out, expressed a willingness
 at the autumn meeting to discuss only the removal of free world
 controls on strategic goods.  No positive response was made by the
 Soviet delegation when the Western representatives offered to con-
 sider sympathetically any proposals which the former might present
 which would contribute to the mutually beneficial development of
 peaceful trade. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France
 proposed that the Soviet Union lessen the difficulties for Western
 traders to visit and reside in the U. S. S. R.; that the U. S. S. R. give
 more adequate protection to Western industrial property rights,
 including patents; and that the U. S. S. R. make available more
 production and trade statistics.  The Western delegates emphasized
 that the strategic export controls covered only a small portion of trade,
 and that wide opportunities for peaceful commerce were freely avail-
 able to the U. S. S. R., provided Moscow discarded its policy of
 self-sufficiency.
 In a positive and conciliatory move on October 31 to promote
 peaceful trade, Secretary of State Dulles announced that the United
 States Government would "progressively" simplify certain operating
 procedures in exports to the European Soviet bloc (see p. 6).  In a
 statement made two weeks later, Soviet Foreign Minister V. M.
 Molotov refused to address himself to the problem of expanding
 peaceful trade and instead called for the elimination of the West's
 strategic trade controls.  He said :
 "* * * lately various measures of discriminative nature have been
 and are practised in the trade with the Soviet Union and some other

 states on the part of some Western states and on the part of the
 United States of America foremost.
 "The removal of this discrimination and of the barriers and obstacles
 set up lately on the path of international trade is useful and advan-
 tageous for both sides, both for East and West.
 "Without the elimination of these barriers the contacts between
 East and West cannot normally develop."
 Farm Delegations Visit U. S.
 Contacts between the free world and the European Soviet bloc
 increased during the last half of 1955.  The desire expressed at the
 Summit Conference for greater contacts between peoples of the East
 and West brought about a number of exchanges of delegations.  The
 Soviet Union also encouraged visits of private citizens, although its
 own nationals sent abroad continued to be controlled delegations
 rather than individuals exercising the right to travel freely. The
 Soviet change in attitude toward the admission of both delegations and
 individuals to the U. S. S. R. resulted in an increase in the number of
 United States private citizens as well as public officials permitted to
 enter the Soviet Union.
 The Soviet Government, to a certain extent, used the exchange
 program as a vehicle for stimulating trade with the United States.
 For example, a 12-man delegation, headed by Acting Agriculture
 Minister Vladimir A. Matskevich, visited the United States in August,
 studying farming techniques, especially corn-hog production.  The
 Soviet agriculturists showed a warm interest in buying large self-
 propelled wheat harvesters, wheel-type tractors of all sizes, and hay
 balers.  During its stay in the United States the delegation purchased
 15 bulls to improve commercial breeds of cattle in the U. S. S. R.
 Late in November a second group of five Soviet agricultural ex-
 perts led by ilia Emelianov, Deputy Director of the Scientific and
 Technical Operations Department of the Ministry of Agriculture,
 came to the United States to purchase a reported $1 million worth
 of hybrid seed corn and the machinery to plant, cultivate, and har-
 vest it.  The president of a midwestern hybrid corn company, who
 had visited the Soviet Union and Rumania earlier, extended the
 invitation to the Soviet specialists.
 Rumania was the first Soviet satellite to send a trade delegation to
 the United States.  A three-man group, including Deputy Minister
 of Agriculture Dr. Virgil Gligor, arrived in New York on November
 27 for a month's visit, at the invitation of the same company that
 had invited the second Soviet team.  The purpose of the Rumanian
 mission was precisely that of the second Soviet group-the purchase
 of hybrid seed corn and machinery.   The delegation announced on
 its arrival that Rumania desired to resume trade with the United

 States and was prepared to spend $500,000 to $1 million in cash for
 seed corn and 10 sets of farm equipment.  Assurances were given
 that additional purchases would be made if the seed and machinery
 proved satisfactory.
 Soviet Trade and U. S. Senators
 Nikita S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Soviet Communist
 Party, in an interview on September 12 with five United States
 Senators, said that the U. S. S. R. wanted to import United States
 machinery and agricultural products.  He implied Moscow would
 offer manganese and other strategic materials in exchange for American
 goods, and thought an expansion of Soviet-United States trade would
 promote better relations between the two countries.  With Premier
 Nikolai A. Bulganin nodding vigorous approval, Mr. Khrushchev
 denounced United States strategic trade controls and urged that they
 be abolished.  Then he boldly and bluntly asserted: "We value
 trade least for economic reasons and most for political purposes as a
 means of promoting better relations between our countries."  The
 political and economic purposes inherent in Soviet trade policy were
 described and analyzed in Chapter III of the Seventh Battle Act
 Report.
 ECE Trade Meeting
 From September 26 to October 14, while the "Geneva spirit" of
 conciliation was still fresh, representatives of 26 countries met in
 Geneva at the fourth session of the Committee on the Development
 of Trade of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
 (ECE) to discuss obstacles to the growth of East-West trade.  Eight-
 een Western European countries, the U. S. S. R., and its European
 satellites sent delegations.  The United States and Canada also
 participated.  In addition to the country delegations, the Council of
 Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA), which was established in
 January, 1949, to broaden "economic cooperation" between the
 U. S. S. R. and the Eastern European bloc countries, sent its Secretary-
 General, A. A. Pavlov of the Soviet Union, to establish an informal
 relationship with the ECE Secretariat.
 The Committee discussed the items on its agenda in an atmosphere
 which was harmonious.  In addition to a general discussion of the
 magnitude of trade between the East and West, the possibilities of
 further expansion in this trade, and trade relationships between par-
 ticular countries, the Committee also considered specific problems
 affecting the enlargement of trade between East and West, as for
 example, arrangements for the settlement of trading accounts.
 During the meeting 120 bilateral trade talks took place, but these
 were generally restrained and unproductive.  At these talks trade

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 experts exchanged specific lists of commodities in which they were
 prepared to deal.
 In the course of the deliberations of the Committee, the Soviet bloc
 countries reiterated the charge that the major barrier to trade expan-
 sion was discrimination in Western commercial practices.  One ex-
 ample cited by the bloc countries of a discriminatory practice was the
 Western trade liberalization program, which was asserted to be a
 violation of the most-favored-nation principle because its benefits
 are not extended to all countries. Strategic trade controls were not
 mentioned directly, but were referred to by most Eastern European
 delegates as "noncommercial" policies which limited exports by West-
 ern countries. The bloc countries stated that these policies destroyed
 the mutual confidence necessary for world trade and violated the most-
 favored-nation principle.  However, their expressions of these views
 were generally brief and presented in a manner which was in keeping
 with the harmonious atmosphere of the conference.
 None of the deterrents to increased peaceful trade between the
 West and the Soviet bloc: was eliminated as a consequence of the Com-
 mittee's deliberations, since the Committee has no power to alter the
 trade policies of governments. The major result of the meeting was
 possibly an improvement in the psychological climate relating to
 East-West trade problems and policies.
 The Soviet bloc delegates were generally in favor of a further expan-
 sion of trade between the West and the bloc, and stressed the possi-
 bilities which they believed existed for an increased exchange of com-
 modities. Several Western countries also expressed interest in greater
 trade with the Soviet bloc.  Gunnar Myrdal, Executive-Secretary
 of the ECE, described the results of the meeting as "not spectacular,"
 but cautiously predicted a continued slow increase in trade between
 the Soviet bloc and the rest of Europe.

 TRADE FAIRS IN

 Number, Cost, and Areas of Focus
 For a combination of trade, political, and propaganda reasons, the
 Sino-Soviet bloc in 1955 participated in 149 trade fairs and exhibi-
 tions in 41 countries, exceeding, as indicated below, its total partici-
 pation in the four preceding years:

 In 1954 the bloc had displayed its wares at 60 fairs in 26 countries,
 at an estimated cost of $10 million.  Expenditures in 1955 were about
 $38 million, nearly four times the amount spent the previous year.' An
 impressive feature of this significant broadening and more systematic
 bloc participation in fairs was the substantial increase in the number of
 exhibits, from 125 in 1954 to 288 in 1955, or a rise of about 130 per-
 cent.
 Although Western Europe is the major trading area in the free
 world for the bloc, the financial outlays by the bloc in 1955 for trade
 fairs in Western Europe were somewhat less than for fairs in the less
 developed countries of Asia and the Near East, where the bloc is
 expending an ascending proportion of its trade energies and resources
 (see Fig. III). To the accompaniment of heavy radio, newspaper,
 and magazine publicity, costly and frequently lavish exhibits were

 for trade fair participation.

 presented in 16 of the newly developing countries, including India,
 Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, and Syria.  More money was spent by
 the bloc on trade fairs in India than in any other non-Communist
 country.  The bloc also participated extensively in fairs in Yugo-
 slavia, Turkey, Greece, Austria, The Netherlands, and Sweden; and
 on a smaller but yet noteworthy scale in Argentina, Iceland, and
 French Morocco.  There were reports in December that the bloc
 would expand its participation in trade fairs in 1956, and that its
 exhibits would be larger, better planned, and more impressive than
 in previous years.

 Motives
 Chapter I of the Sixth Battle Act Report describing "Moscow's
 Economic Arm," traced the development of the Soviet bloc's use of
 trade fairs since 1952, when it first began to use exhibits as a vehicle
 in the less developed lands, and concluded that the purposes of this
 technique "were far broader than commodity sales promotion.',

 The instrument was, in brief, an all-purpose trade, political, and
 propaganda weapon.
 As the foreign economic policies and programs of the Sino-Soviet
 bloc evolved, and especially with the increase in the U. S. S. R.'s
 capabilities and its greater availability of capital goods for export,
 trade fairs became an instrument to "normalize and expand" trade
 relations.  In addition, they became a technique to implement the
 overall foreign economic policy of the bloc, and formed an integral
 part of an apparent coordinated program that included trade agree-
 ments, barter deals for farm surpluses, credits for the purchase of
 capital equipment by the less developed countries, and the establish-
 ment of resident trade representatives.
 There were indications in 1955 that the commercial policy of the
 bloc countries at trade fairs was becoming more flexible and that
 they were inclined to deviate from earlier trade practices to insure
 the business success of their participation.  In previous years there
 were cases where bloc exhibitors were generally unable or reluctant
 to provide information on prices, specifications, delivery schedules,
 replacement parts, local agents, and distributors.  It was frequently
 apparent, moreover, that they were not prepared to manufacture
 for export many of the products that were exhibited.  In 1955,
 however, some substantial contracts and trade agreements were
 concluded at trade fairs, and when it was not possible to sign com-
 mercial pacts, the foundation was laid for future negotiations.  There
 were reports that some European satellites prepared sales plans of
 exportable goods so that they could take on-the-spot orders. In a
 number of instances, items on display were offered to the host coun-
 tries either for sale or as a gift.
 Propaganda continued to be one of the primary purposes behind
 the bloc's sprouting participation in trade fairs in 1955.  Pamphlets
 were distributed at fairs and speeches were made by bloc officials
 urging the Soviet version of "peaceful coexistence," "relaxation of
 world tensions," "reunification of East and West Germany," and the
 "removal of trade embargoes."  The size of the bloc's pavilions, and
 the number and variety of the products displayed, were designed to
 impress the visitors and to spread before them the technical skills
 and the economic strength and progress achieved under Communism;
 and thus enhance the attractiveness of Communism and the prestige
 of the bloc.
 Sino-Soviet Bloc Participation
 The U. S. S. R. sent major exhibits of its industrial products to
 18 foreign countries in 1955, with some two-thirds of these exhibits
 going to countries outside the bloc.  The Soviet Union participated
 in 11 more trade fairs in 1955 than in 1954.  To the surprise of the
 host countries the U. S. S. It. withdrew from 11 important fairs last
 17

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 year.  Although no specific reasons were given, these withdrawals
 may have been due to Soviet reluctance to compete with the United
 States, which is increasing its trade fair participation, or to the
 unwillingness or inability of the sponsors of the fair to allocate
 sufficient space for the large, consolidated-type Soviet exhibit.
 The Soviet Union had an impressive display at the Geneva atoms-
 for-peace conference during the summer.  Peaceful uses of atomic
 energy exhibits were conspicuous features at trade fairs held in 1955.
 Among the prominent trade fair developments in 1955 were the
 emergence of Communist China as an important exhibitor and the
 leading role of Czechoslovakia and Communist East Germany.  The
 number of fairs in which Communist China participated rose from 3
 in 1954 to 24 in 1955.  Czechoslovakia in 1955 was the most active
 Soviet bloc exponent of utilizing fairs for trade promotion, participat-
 ing in 30 throughout the world.                                Poland was also an active exhibitor.
 Czechoslovakia and the other bloc countries concentrated their efforts
 primarily on fairs held in the less developed nations where they
 desired to improve their economic and political relations.
 Participation in international trade fairs was one of the main pro-
 motional activities of the foreign trade policy of East Germany.
 During 1955, East Germany exhibited at major trade fairs in 16
 countries outside the Communist bloc.  East German officials were
 loud in their statements about successful exploitation of expositions.
 It must be conceded that East Germany made propaganda and com-
 mercial gains.  Proof of this gain was the gold medal awarded to
 East Germany at the Damascus Fair (Syria) for the "excellent layout
 of the pavilion" and the reaction of West German manufacturers who
 expressed regret that their government was not taking a comparable
 advantage of trade fair opportunities.
 Some Representative Trade Fairs
 The bloc exhibitions that were staged with the most fanfare in the
 non-Communist countries in 1955 were those in New Delhi (India)
 and Buenos Aires. (Argentina).  The Indian Industries Fair in New
 Delhi was held in November-December, and drew an estimated at-
 tendance of 3 million.  At this fair the Soviet Union made a vigorous
 effort to promote the sale of its industrial equipment in what it con-
 sidered,a high priority market and to show what it was capable of
 producing. It exhibited machine tools, textile machinery, trucks,
 tractors, bicycles, optical goods, printing machinery, and other
 products. Czechoslovakia displayed a variety of engineering products
 and oil well drilling equipment.  The bloc exhibits were visibly
 designed to appeal to government and business executives interested
 in sources of supply for their industrial expansion programs.  Czecho-
 slovak representatives claimed that $7 million in orders were obtained.
 The Soviet press also reported that a number of business transactions
 18

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 were concluded for the sale of machine tools, tractors, and drilling rigs.
 The Soviet pavilion at the New Delhi exhibition occupied 2,000
 square meters in addition to an open area covering 2,500 square
 meters.  To give the display some additional atmosphere and to
 attract the general public, the Soviet Union introduced several non-
 commercial features, such as an illuminated panel of the Kuibyshev
 hydroelectric station, a large plant on the Volga River, then still
 under construction; a working model of a blast furnace similar to the
 unit to be erected in India by Soviet technicians as part of the well-
 publicized Bhilai steel mill project; and a television camera in opera-
 tion.
 Twelve Czech export organizations displayed over $2 million worth
 of goods, with emphasis on engineering products and aircraft, at the
 industrial exhibit in Bombay, India, in February.  Official Indian
 reaction to the Czechoslovak exhibit was very favorable, according
 to press reports.
 The size and lavishness of Soviet and other bloc country exhibits,
 as well as the wide publicity they received, could easily have conveyed
 the impression that the bloc was a major factor in India's foreign trade.
 But in fact, the entire bloc accounted for only 1.7 percent of India's
 imports and 2.1 percent of its exports in 1955.
 The Buenos Aires Fair opened on May 21, and lasted 40 days.
 The special Soviet display, which was the first exhibit of Russian
 products ever presented in Latin America, consisted of a wide variety
 of industrial goods.  Some 2.3 million persons, including large num-
 bers of people from neighboring Latin American countries, reportedly
 attended the exhibit.  The express purpose of the display, which
 occupied 20,000 square meters of space, was to acquaint the Argentine
 business community with Soviet industrial equipment available for
 import into that country.  There was some indication, too, that the
 Argentine Government was similarly interested in stimulating confi-
 dence and interest in Soviet production machinery.  In this manner,
 it hoped to support its own formal undertaking made in August, 1953,
 to encourage the import of Soviet machinery in its drive to develop
 several domestic industries.
 The Soviet exhibit at the Zagreb Fair (Yugoslavia) which was shown
 following the reconciliation with the Tito Government, was planned
 and executed on an elaborate scale.  The U. S. S. R. exhibited the
 best models of its heavy industrial equipment-turbogenerators,
 diesel engines, mining and electrical equipment, trucks, and tractors.
 For the benefit of the general public, the Soviet exhibitors displayed
 a mobile television installation.
 At the Canadian International Trade Fair held in Toronto during
 May and June, Czechoslovakia was the only bloc country represented
 and was the leading foreign exhibitor, taking more than 10 percent of
 the 212,000 square feet rented to foreign participants.  The New

 York Times, commenting on the Djakarta Fair (Indonesia) held in
 August, observed that the Czechoslovak exhibit was not only impres-
 sive but was also three times larger than the United States display.
 Although Poland's activity in free world trade fairs was on a sub-
 stantially smaller scale than that of Czechoslovakia, the Polish author-
 ities effectively used the 1955 Poznan Fair (Poland) to promote trade
 with the free world countries.  Fifteen free world and eight bloc
 countries participated in the fair, which took place from July 3 to July
 24.  The Polish exhibit was the largest, followed by that of the
 U. S. S. R.  Polish trade fair officials claimed that the participating
 countries had signed trade contracts worth $115 million.
 Sparing neither money nor enterprise, East Germany was moder-
 ately successful in reestablishing the Leipzig Fair (East Germany) as
 the major European international exposition and as a center for trade
 between East and West.  Each succeeding fair in Leipzig, following
 the resumption of the Spring and Fall expositions, attracted more
 exhibitors from East and West and more foreign visitors. Elaborate
 preparations were made for the 1956 fairs, which exposition officials
 hoped would set new attendance records and bring a larger number of
 entries, particularly from such less developed countries as India and
 Egypt.
 It became evident in 1955 that the bloc's trade fair program was
 having a positive economic impact, and was contributing to, and
 improving the prospects of, bloc trade expansion.  The trade fair
 device assisted the bloc in. furthering and strengthening its commercial
 and political relations with many countries, especially with the less
 developed communities.  As an important and useful arm of bloc
 diplomacy, the technique was employed as a means of attaining world
 influence and leadership.
 The U. S. Trade Fair Program
 The trade fair field was not the bloc's exclusive or even dominant
 preserve in 1955.  The United States Government's international
 trade fair program, which is receiving the cooperation of private
 industry, is increasing both in extent and effectiveness.  The purpose
 of the program, to quote President Eisenhower, is "to tell adequately
 the story of our free enterprise system and to provide effective
 international trade promotion cooperation."
 The first fair in which the United States participated under the
 new Government program was the Bangkok Constitutional Fair
 (Thailand), held December 7-16, 1954.  From the Bangkok Fair to
 January 1, 1956, the United States participated in 27 fairs in Asia,
 Europe, the Near East, and Latin America.2

 gency Fund for Participation in International Affairs, covering activities from August, 1954-December 31,

 CHAPTER IV
 COMMUNIST ECONOMIC DIPLOMACY
 IN THE LESS DEVELOPED AREAS
 Marx and His Apostles
 A loss developed country has been defined by Dr. Eugene Staley,
 Senior Economist at the Stanford Research Institute, as one "char-
 acterized (1) by mass poverty which is chronic and. not the result of
 some temporary misfortune, and (2) by obsolete methods of produc-
 tion and social organization, which means that the poverty is not
 entirely due to poor natural resources and hence could presumably be
 lessened by methods already proved in other countries." 1    By this
 definition the less developed group includes nearly all the countries of
 Asia and Africa, most of Latin America, and some of Europe.  The
 total population of these less developed nations is approximately 1.6
 billion, or about two-thirds of the world's population of 2.4 billion,
 according to Dr. Staley.  For the purposes of this chapter, however,
 the description of the extension of "ruble diplomacy" is confined to the
 less developed countries of the Near East, South Asia, and Latin
 America?
 In his writings, Karl Marx did not give a major role to the less
 developed areas in his analysis and prediction of the inevitable,
 fateful, and mortal revolutionary conflict between capital and labor.
 Marx thought that this crucial struggle would take place in the mature
 industrial societies and that the "backward" areas only reflected
 the economic evolution of capitalist countries.  It remained for
 Marx's apostles, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Tse-tung, to see the immense
 importance of the less developed regions and to focus attention on
 them both in theory and in action.
 Bases of Trade Drive
 The Sino-Soviet bloc economic planners apparently believe that
 the bloc now possesses the four essential internal conditions which

 by Harper & Brothers, New York, 1954, p. 13.

 1956, Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Technical Assistance Programs, 84th Congress, 2d session,
 United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1956.

 will enable it successfully to penetrate the vital areas of Asia, the Near
 East, Africa, and Latin America, where the drama of world diplomacy
 is now unfolding.  These conditions are sufficient economic resources,
 cultural bases, technical personnel, and internal order and stability.
 The U. S. S. R. has gradually been attaining the first condition,
 an adequate economic base, and at present its industrial production
 is exceeded only by the United States.  Industrial output increased
 in all Communist countries in 1955, gross production in the Soviet
 Union rising by 12 percent, according to the United Nations World
 Economic Survey, 1955, and the Economic Survey of Europe in 1955,
 the latter report prepared by the U. N. Economic Commission for
 Europe (ECE).  The composition of industrial production in the
 U. S. S. R. showed a 16 percent increase in the output of producer
 goods and a 9 percent increase in that of consumer goods.  Goals
 were exceeded for such producer goods as electrical, transport, and
 heavy engineering equipment, as well as oil, electric power, chemicals,
 and motor vehicles.  The gross output of consumer goods was approx-
 imately that planned, but overfulfillments included such important
 items as textiles, footwear, dairy products, and vegetable oil. There
 were, however, deficiencies in the Soviet economy, with the production
 of railroad rolling stock, pig iron, sulphuric acid, and other com-
 modities lagging behind announced goals.
 Agricultural production recovered significantly in most of the bloc
 countries.  The 1955 grain. harvest in the Soviet Union as a whole
 was 22 percent higher than that of 1954, which was a bad crop year.
 Contributing to the, rise in production in the Soviet bloc nations were
 improved weather conditions and more favorable policies toward
 agriculture, including substantial increases in supply of fertilizers,
 farm machinery, equipment and building materials, reduced taxation
 and delivery quotas, higher government prices for farm produce, and
 an increasing supply of industrial consumer goods to the rural areas.
 In addition to enlarging its economic resources, the Soviet Union
 increased its skilled manpower supply by expanding its training of
 engineers and other technicians who became available for service in
 the less developed countries as well as for employment on the home
 front.  With full and unhampered control over these growing re-
 sources, the U. S. S. R. can probably export machinery, raw materials,
 and skilled technicians in substantial quantity to the free world with-
 out undue strain on the achievement of internal economic investment
 targets.
 Some Aspects of the Trade Push
 Historically, the rulers of Russia have nurtured the hope and dream
 of securing a firm foothold in the Near East and South Asia.  The
 Communist rulers are no exception.  Their tactics are to exploit such
 domestic conditions in the less developed areas as surging nationalism
 22
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 and aspirations for independence, widespread poverty and social dis-
 content, and other factors in "the revolution of rising expectations."
 These problems and Communist tactics present many, complex, and
 formidable issues to the free world.
 The broad aim of the bloc in 1955 was to extend, in the less devel-
 oped countries, the areas of the Communist bloc's political, economic,
 and cultural influence.  The ultimate aim remains the same  to
 bring the entire world under Communist domination and control. An
 intensified trade offensive, reinforced by vigorous diplomacy and
 propaganda, was the principal feature of this 1955 campaign in the
 less developed nations.  The process was attraction, penetration, and
 attempts to extend the area of bloc domination, using trade, credits,
 technical assistance, and trade fairs as weapons.  At the same time,
 in an effort to sow dissension and division in the West, political
 tensions, such as the Arab-Israeli dispute, were exploited, and various
 ? countries were urged to adopt or adhere to neutral positions.
 Primary production accounts for about four-fifths of the total
 commodity output of the less developed countries.  Rice, rubber,
 cotton, sugar, jute, grain, and other raw materials produced by these
 countries, were in surplus supply and could not be readily sold in
 free world markets.  This situation encouraged barter with the
 Soviet bloc, with primary commodities from less developed areas being
 exchanged for Soviet bloc industrial products, including complete
 factories.  It remains to be seen whether this pattern of exchange
 will be of continuing benefit to the less developed nations.
 Although the quantities of commodities involved were usually
 small by world standards, they were important to individual countries
 like. Burma, Egypt, and Afghanistan.  Trade agreements concluded
 with these countries and also with India, Indonesia, and Syria called
 for deliveries of complete industrial units by the Soviet Union,
 Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Poland.  This new development
 in bloc trade, which could have a considerable impact on world com-
 merce, w8s attributed to general Communist policy considerations,
 the bloc nations' growing need for primary commodities and their
 expanding output of capital goods, the demand of less developed
 countries for capital equipment, and the agricultural surpluses that
 were accumulating in exporting countries.  These large surpluses,
 which caused depressed and fluctuating prices, made these countries
 receptive to trade overtures by the bloc.  In some cases, the bloc
 offered to pay premium prices for the commodities the less developed
 countries had difficulty in selling in Western markets.
 Trade Agreements and Credits
 Trade and payments agreements were principally responsible for
 the volume and pattern of trade between the Sino-Soviet bloc and
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 countries outside the Communist area, as outlined in Chapter I.
 Of the 174 trade agreements in effect at the end of 1955, a total of 67
 were between the bloc and the less developed countries in the Near
 East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Six of these pacts--U. S. S. R.-
 Burma; Czechoslovakia-Ceylon; Poland-Burma; Poland-Paraguay;
 and Communist China with Egypt, and Syria--were concluded
 during the second half of the 'year.  During the same six-month
 period, Syria signed new agreements with the U. S. S. It., East Ger-
 many, and Poland; and Ceylon made an accord with Poland, all of
 which were to come into force in 1956. In the Near East, Egypt had
 the most trade agreements-7; and in South and Southeast Asia,
 India led with 8, followed by Indonesia with 7.  The bloc countries
 appeared, in general, to have provided goods of acceptable quality
 and to have fulfilled the terms of trade contracts.
 Perhaps the most dramatic aspect of bloc economic diplomacy has
 been its extension of the Soviet version of "economic and technical
 assistance" on a substantial and increasing scale.  None of the bloc
 assistance included grants except for small contributions to the United
 Nations technical assistance programs.  While some credits were
 granted prior to 1955, the U. S. S. R. and Czechoslovakia expanded
 their programs materially last year, concentrating their efforts in the
 less developed countries.  Total credits covered by agreements con-
 cluded during 1955 with such countries amounted to nearly $600
 million, the preponderant portion of which went to Yugoslavia,
 Egypt, Afghanistan, and India.  The Soviet Union accounted for
 over two-thirds of the total credits, the terms of which involved
 interest rates as low. as 22% percent, extended repayment periods,
 and in some cases compensation in local currency or products.
 The Soviet bloc boycotted the United Nations technical assistance
 programs until the summer of 1953, on the grounds that they were
 designed to make the less developed countries "raw material ap-
 pendages" of the United States and other Western powers.  On
 July 15, 1953, the Soviet Government announced that it would con-
 tribute 4 million rubles (equivalent to $1 million at the official ex-
 change rate) to the U. N. technical assistance fund.  The contribution
 was officially pledged at the technical assistance pledging conference
 four months later.  At this conference Poland pledged $75,000,
 Byelorussia $50,000, and the Ukraine $125,000, while Czechoslovakia
 announced that it would participate in 1954.
 These actions indicated that the new policy was a concerted move
 on the part of the entire Soviet bloc, and coincided significantly with
 developing bloc emphasis on trade and technical assistance to the
 less developed countries.  The motives generally ascribed to this
 development included recognition by the U. S. S. R. of the adverse
 propaganda effects of its nonparticipation; the intention of using the
 United Nations for further extension of Communist influence into

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 less developed countries through sending Soviet technicians abroad
 and granting scholarships in Soviet universities; and the aim of
 making the less developed nations more receptive to the conclusion
 of trade agreements and obtaining raw materials from them.
 Trade and Propaganda Themes
 The bloc's efforts to penetrate the less developed areas were ac-
 companied by honeyed declarations by Soviet Communist Party
 Chief Khrushchev and his associates that the bloc's relations with
 these countries rested on the principles of peaceful coexistence,
 equality, respect for the rights of small peoples, noninterference in
 the internal affairs of states, nonaggression, and mutual advantage.
 The main inducements in these protestations of friendship and com-
 mon interest were expanded international economic cooperation,
 the prospect of a vast market in the bloc, the lure of rapid industrial-
 ization and economic development, and the attainment of national
 independence and social progress. Assurances were given that Soviet
 technical assistance programs were "disinterested," meaning business-
 like with no political strings attached; while the programs of the
 United States were, Soviet statements declared, contingent upon
 support of American "aggressive militarism."  These statements
 portrayed "capitalist firms" as trying to flood every market with
 their own goods in contrast to the bloc's policy of exporting to them
 only the products that were difficult to produce domestically. Bloc
 officials emphasized that their loan terms were more favorable than
 those of the free world countries and would not subordinate the less
 developed areas as would the conditions imposed by the capitalist
 countries.
 In their trade, technical assistance, and propaganda programs, the
 bloc countries concentrated to some extent on "monument" or display
 projects (such as paving the streets of Kabul), which had a special
 psychological appeal to the recipient countries.  The bloc also ex-
 pedited the conclusion of agreements, and technicians usually arrived
 to start work on a project within a month or so after assistance was
 accepted.  Technical services not only helped to promote the sales
 of bloc equipment but also extended and strengthened the bloc's
 influence. To date, evidence suggests that the recipients of bloc
 assistance are satisfied with the quality of work and rate of progress,
 and the neutral and "uncommitted" nations do not appear to view
 the bloc's current economic and technical aid as a serious threat to
 their independence.
 Moves in the Near East
 In 1955 the entire Sino-Soviet bloc focused its efforts on the Near
 East.  The offensive, which has extended into North Africa, has
 embraced trade, military assistance, economic and technical aid, and
 25

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 cultural exchanges.  With a population of over 100 million, the Near
 East produces 20 percent of the world's output of crude oils and
 natural gasoline, and its proved crude petroleum reserves are about
 two-thirds of the world's total.  It is an area in ferment and one of
 great and growing economic, political, and strategic importance.  The
 unsettled political situation and the rising tide of Arab nationalism
 present tempting opportunities for Communist exploitation and
 maneuvering.
 Total trade between the bloc and the Near East and Africa showed
 a marked rise of $85 million in 1955, and the upward trend is expected
 to continue.  There was a conspicuous shift in Near East trade from
 the free world to the bloc during 1954-55.  Trade between the area
 and North America and Western Europe declined during this period.
 Difficulties in marketing major staple crops were responsible in some
 degree for the shift in trade patterns and the increase in barter agree-
 ments (surplus products for machinery) with the Communist world,
 according to the U. N. survey, Economic Development in the Middle
 East, 1954 and 1955.  Unable to find profitable markets for their
 products in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada, the
 Middle East countries redirected their commerce to the bloc.
 Like other Near East countries (with the exception of Israel),
 Turkey and Iran, both members of the anti-Communist Baghdad
 Pact, steadily developed trade with the bloc.  Turkey's trade turn-
 over with the bloc went up by $60 million in 1955, a pronounced
 increase.  Between 1953-55, Turkey's imports from the bloc countries
 more than trebled in percentage of its total import trade, rising from
 5.5 percent to 18.3 percent.  Turkey, whose exports to the bloc are
 uncontrolled items (mainly tobacco, cotton, feeding stuff for animals,
 and nuts), in 1955 shipped a total of $68.6 million worth of goods to
 the bloc compared with $55.1 million in 1954.  Exports to the bloc
 rose from 16.5 percent of Turkey's total world exports in 1954 to 21.8
 percent in 1955.
 Israel demonstrated no apparent desire to reorient its trade toward
 the bloc, preferring to expand trade with Finland, Yugoslavia, and
 Turkey.  Syria, on the other hand, showed an eagerness to do busi-
 ness with the bloc, concluding a trade agreement with the Soviet
 Union in November calling for the delivery of Syrian cotton, dried
 fruits, pil-bearing seeds, tobacco, artificial silks, and other products
 in return for industrial machinery, farm implements, trucks, and
 other items.
 Egypt became the focal point of Sino-Soviet bloc interest and ac-
 tivity in 1955.  The bloc was encouraged in these operations by

 sions that Egypt would accept trade, economic aid, and technical
 assistance from Communist countries if it were in the national
 interest.
 Egypt's trade with the bloc increased by almost $59 million in
 1955, the bloc purchasing about 27 percent of Egypt's total exports.
 During the period 1953-55, Egypt doubled its percentage of total
 exports to the bloc.  The seven trade agreements that Egypt had
 concluded by the end of 1955 with the bloc countries were partly
 responsible for this trade expansion.  Communist China shared in-
 creasingly in the enlarged trade, a development that reportedly
 stemmed from the talks between Premier Nasser and Communist
 Chinese Premier Chou En-lai at the Asian-African Conference held
 in Bandung, Indonesia, in April, 1955.
 Cotton is the mainstay of Egypt's economy.  It is by far the
 largest source of the country's national income and foreign exchange.
 Traditionally, exports of raw cotton account for over 80 percent of
 Egypt's total exports.  World cotton markets in mid-1955 were
 uneasy and depressed by huge surpluses, and there were fears in
 Cairo that cotton prices would drop lower.  Taking advantage of the
 free world's cotton surplus and Egypt's anxieties, and determined to.
 establish a bridgehead on the Nile, the bloc countries concluded
 agreements with Egypt for cotton and rice in exchange for industrial
 products and armaments.
 In mid-July, 1955, Egypt signed a trade and payments agreement
 with Czechoslovakia. On August 22 a three-year trade pact was con-
 cluded with Communist China. A cotton-for-petroleum transaction
 was negotiated with the U. S. S. R., and in November a trade agree-
 ment was signed with East Germany.  As a result of the various
 agreements, the bloc's share of Egyptian cotton exports which had
 averaged about 13 percent from 1946 to 1954, increased to 21 percent
 in the first half of 1955 and to 40 percent in the second half of the
 year. Some bloc countries allegedly paid more than world prices for
 Egypt's long staple cotton.
 In September, Premier Nasser, who a month before had received
 an invitation to visit the U. S. S. R., announced that he had accepted a
 Soviet-sponsored deal for a reported $100 million to $250 million
 worth of Czechoslovak arms, with payment to be made in cotton.
 Prior to the official disclosure of the barter arrangement, which had
 been rumored for several weeks, Egyptian officials had declared that
 if their country could not obtain arms from the West, Egypt had no
 alternative but to accept Soviet arms offers.  On October 20 the,
 Soviet steamship Stalingrad arrived at Alexandria with the first
 consignment of arms from Czechoslovakia.  The consignment con-
 sisted of 133 crates, and was believed to be the first shipment of arms
 from any Communist country to an Arab nation.

 The "B & K" Tour of South Asia
 In November and December, Premier Bulganin and Mr. Khrush-
 chev made a triumphal "goodwill" tour through India, Burma, and
 Afghanistan.  The month-long journey, which began from Moscow
 on November 17, was regarded in the Soviet Union as a massive stride
 toward the fulfillment of the ambition of generations of Russian
 leaders to establish spheres of influence in South Asia.  The ostensible
 purpose of the pilgrimage was to return the earlier visits to Moscow
 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Burmese Premier
 U Nu; but the real aim was to consolidate neutral Asian nations to
 offset the Western-sponsored Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
 (SEATO), through strengthening "friendship" and promoting trade.
 Attempts to link India, Burma, and Afghanistan commercially to the
 bloc, such as the agreement to construct a steel mill in Central India
 (see Chapter I of the Sixth Battle Act Report), preceded the visit
 of the two Soviet officials.
 The economic highlight of the two-phase Indian tour was the joint
 communique issued on December 13, announcing the conclusion of
 a trade agreement calling for the purchase by India of 1 million tons
 of Soviet steel and various types of oil drilling, mining, and other
 equipment over a three-year period beginning in 1956.  In return,
 the U. S. S. R. agreed to buy raw materials and manufactured goods
 in amounts equal in value to India's purchases in the Soviet Union.
 To provide for the expected shipments, steamship lines, using Soviet
 and Indian vessels, would be established between the ports of both
 countries.  India and the U. S. S. R. agreed to exchange delegations
 at the earliest possible date to discuss terms and conditions and to
 enter into economic agreements to guarantee that the volume of trade
 between them would be increased to maximum levels. It was expected
 that the actual implementation of the trade agreement would coincide
 with the beginning of India's second five-year plan in April, 1956.
 The "B & K" visit was the climax of Soviet efforts to cultivate India,
 and it yielded the U. S. S. R. considerable propaganda returns. Other
 developments that gained support for the Soviet Union were: the Soviet
 offer to share experiences in the peaceful uses of atomic power and in
 the construction. of industrial enterprises; the arrival of shipments of
 equipment for the steel mill, and teams of experts; the offer of assist-
 ance in every branch of oil exploration, production, and refining; and
 the arrival of equipment for a 30,000-acre state farm which had been
 promised to Prime Minister Nehru on his visit to Moscow in June.
 Total trade turnover between the Sino-Soviet bloc and South Asia
 and the Far East increased by about $120 million in 1955.  India's
 trade with the bloc increased by over $18 million.  By the end of the

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 year, India had eight trade agreements with the bloc, but this trade
 accounted for only 1.7 percent of India's imports and 2.1 percent of
 its exports. The bloc's trade with Indonesia, which had seven agree-
 ments, increased by about $50 million in 1955.  Ceylon's trade, how-
 ever, declined by $36 million.
 Rice as a Weapon
 Rice is the main crop and staple food in almost all the countries
 of Asia.  In seeking to influence Burma, the principal Communist
 weapon is the purchase of rice, a commodity which Burma has in
 substantial surplus and has to export in quantity to remain econom-
 ically stable. The rice trade accounts for 70 to 80 percent of Burma's
 export earnings, and government revenue depends heavily on this
 trade. With Burma experiencing difficulty in disposing of its rice in
 its traditional markets, the increasing rice purchases by the Sino-
 Soviet bloc in 1955 became the entering wedge by which the bloc
 countries could make the Burmese economy more dependent on them.
 In 1955, Burma's trade with the bloc rose by over $23 million
 (preliminary), exports to the bloc constituting 12 percent of Burma's
 total exports as compared with less than 1 percent during the period
 1950=54.  Burma in 1955 concluded five new trade agreements with
 bloc countries and renewed a 1954 agreement with Communist China.
 Rice, minerals, rubber, timber, and cotton were exchanged for indus-
 trial products and some consumer goods, under these agreements
 signed with the U. S. S. R., Czechoslovakia, Communist China, Com-
 munist East Germany, Hungary, and Poland.  The most important
 item was rice.  Burmese rice exports increased from 1.5 million tons
 in 1954 to 1.7 million in 1955, of which the bloc took 23 percent.
 The bloc importers used the rice not only for their own consumption
 but also for Northern Vietnam and North Korea, and resold some to
 free world countries.
 . When Premier U Nu visited Moscow late in October, he praised the
 U. S. S. R. for having saved his country from economic crisis by pur-
 chasing its surplus rice, and expressed a desire to exchange rice for
 Soviet factories, machinery, and technicians.  He had announced on
 February 22, 1955, that the Soviet Union would soon buy 200,000
 tons of Burmese rice and would supply Burma with industrial
 equipment in return.
 On December 7, "B & K" advanced in their "rice offensive" when
 they concluded an economic agreement with Burma, providing for
 Soviet assistance in Burma's agricultural development, major irriga-
 tion works, and the establishment of industrial plants.  The U. S. S. R.
 also promised construction and equipment of a technological institute
 in Rangoon as a gift to the Burmese people.  Under this agreement,
 the Soviet Union would be paid in Burmese rice for the agricultural

 and industrial aid or accept deferred payment if there was not sufficient
 rice.
 Rattling the Ruble
 Soviet "technical aid" activities in Afghanistan have followed and
 have been related to the drive for expanded trade.  The trade offen-
 sive would appear to be stimulated by long-range strategic interests
 of the U. S. S. R. rather than in any immediate advantage to be
 derived from imports from Afghanistan.
 By mid-November, 1955, Moscow's economic wooing of Afghanistan
 had produced 500 Soviet technicians who were working there helping
 to erect oil storage tanks, grain elevators, and other capital projects,
 according to press reports.  "Spectacular successes" were reported
 by news correspondents.   Vigorous trade promotion efforts had
 pushed the bloc's share in 1955 to probably half of Afghanistan's
 total foreign trade.  Soviet activities in the country are buttressed
 and supplemented by the satellites, especially Czechoslovakia, which
 is building a cement factory.  In November there were press reports
 that Afghanistan was expected to accept.a Czechoslovak offer of
 arms, following an announcement by the Afghan radio station that
 Afghanistan had accepted an invitation to send a military mission to
 Czechoslovakia to inspect the latest types of military equipment.
 Premier Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev ended their tour of South
 Asia with a visit to Kabul, the Afghan capital.  The capstone of the
 visit was the announcement on December 18 that the U. S. S. R.
 would extend to Afghanistan a $100 million long-term credit to be
 used for the development of agriculture, the construction of hydro-
 electric stations, irrigation projects, motor repair workshops, and the
 reconstruction of the Kabul airport.  The two countries also agreed
 to expand friendly political and cultural relations.  During the visit
 the Soviet leaders presented a 100-bed hospital as a gift to Afghanistan
 and 15 buses to the city of Kabul.  The large-scale aid was interpreted
 as part of a Soviet design to reinforce its position in Afghanistan and
 insure continued Afghan neutrality, thereby counterbalancing United
 States friendship with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan.
 Ruble Rhythms in Latin America
 Only three Latin American Republics---Argentina, Uruguay, and
 Mexico--maintain diplomatic relations with the  Soviet Union,
 although several other countries maintain relations with various of
 the other Soviet bloc nations.  Latin American trade with the Sino_
 Soviet bloc in 1955 represented, as was noted on pp. 7-8, only 2 percent
 of that area's trade with the world.  Since 1953, however, the efforts
 of the bloc to increase its trade with Latin America have met with
 some success.  United States traders and businessmen do not dis-

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 count the significance of the bloc's commercial infiltration, with its
 prospects of keener economic competition as well as its usefulness to
 Communist parties in the area.
 As the "peace offensive" developed during 1954 and 1955, Latin
 America felt the Soviet pressures for coexistence and for closer eco-
 nomic and cultural relations.  No direct offers of technical assistance
 were extended, however.
 Diligent efforts were made by the bloc in 1955 to increase the num-
 ber of bilateral trade agreements with Latin American countries and
 to broaden their scope.  At the meeting of the United Nations
 Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) held in Bogota in
 August, Polish and Czechoslovak observers appealed for larger trade
 between Latin America and the Iron Curtain countries, and stressed
 the possibilities of new and stable markets for Latin America's ex-
 ports.
 As of December 31, 1955, there were 18 trade agreements in effect
 between Latin American Republics and European Soviet bloc
 countries.  The U. S. S. R. followed in the. wake of its satellites in
 establishing its own network of direct agreements.  The 18 trade
 pacts, which contain liberal credit clauses, call for an exchange of
 approximately $500 million worth of goods annually, an impressive
 figure compared with the $200 million trade volume in 1.954 and the
 $70 million in 1953.  In general, the Latin American exports under
 these agreements are restricted to a relatively few commodities:
 Argentina, linseed oil, hides, and m.eat; Brazil, coffee, cotton, cacao,
 and wool; Uruguay, frozen meats and wool; and Mexico, coffee.
 The bloc countries supply, in exchange, agricultural machinery,
 industrial equipment, oil, raw materials, rails, cement, and plate
 glass.  As mentioned on p. 7, larger bloc purchases of sugar and coffee
 in 1955 served to increase Latin American exports to the bloc by
 20 percent.
 There were reports in the autumn of 1955 that the Soviet bloc
 countries were not fulfilling completely their trade commitments with
 Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, and other countries, and as a
 result substantial credit balances had accumulated for the Latin
 American countries.  Unofficial estimates revealed that the gap be-
 tween the promise and performance of Argentina's trade agreements
 with the Soviet bloc in 1954 was about 54 percent, while that of
 Brazil was 42 percent.  Although both parties to these pacts failed
 to deliver according to expectations, fulfillment by the Latin American.
 countries was generally better than that by the bloc nations.  Deliv-
 eries to Argentina not only fell far short of assurances, but the quality
 of finished machine tools and similar products was inferior to and
 out of date by 5 to 15 years compared with United States goods,
 according to complaints.
 Argentina and Uruguay were the prime targets of the bloc in its
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 1955 economic drive.  At the end of the year, during which its trade
 with the bloc increased sharply, Argentina was a party to six trade
 agreements with the Communist countries.  The most important one
 in effect was that signed with the U. S. S. R. on August 5, 1953, which
 originally provided for $150 million in trade, plus a Soviet credit of
 $30 million for the purchase of capital equipment.  Under a 1955
 trade protocol, the $30 million credit was reduced to $4 million, none
 of which was utilized by Argentina.
 Late in 1955, the new Argentine Ambassador to Moscow declared
 that his country's relations with the Soviet Union would help to
 stabilize Argentina's trade so long as Argentina could find outlets
 in the vast U. S. S. R. market.  He said Argentina, in turn, planned
 to purchase Soviet manufactured products for its industry.
 In July there were unconfirmed reports that the U. S. S. R. had made
 tempting trade proposals to Brazil, whose finances were in a shaky
 condition.  The offer reportedly included an initial purchase of 1,000
 tons of coffee and 20,000 tons of sugar.  The amount of coffee in-
 volved was negligible, amounting to one-tenth of 1 percent of Brazil's
 average crop.  Sugar sales would be more important, however, be-
 cause Brazil's high prices for sugar were pricing it out of world markets.
 During the Brazilian presidential campaign in the late summer and
 fall of 1955, the three principal candidates stated their intentions of
 establishing at least commercial relations with all countries.  The
 increasing agitation for trade and diplomatic relations with the
 U. S. S. R. and its satellites was motivated by economic rather than
 political factors, with Brazil seeking new markets and satisfactory
 prices for its products, especially coffee.
 In December, the Soviet Ambassador to Mexico visited Ecuador
 where he was received by the President and Foreign Minister at an
 official luncheon.  Since the visit the Ecuadorian Government has
 denied published rumors that a technical aid agreement and an offer
 to provide Ecuador with arms were discussed.
 At the close of 1955 there was growing interest throughout Latin
 America in widening trade with the bloc, but Communist blandish-
 ments were still viewed with cautious skepticism.
 Challenge and Reaction
 On January 1, 1956, Western statesmen could look back on a
 period during which the Sino-Soviet bloc had intensified its economic
 and political offensive in the uncommitted and less developed areas of
 the world.  A new phase of the cold war had emerged, with the bloc
 appearing to rely not so much on military threats, political subversion,
 and propaganda invective as on "peaceful competitive coexistence"
 embracing "economic and technical aid" to the less developed nations.
 Free world officials had watched the evolution of Soviet policy from

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 the time it gave only vague impressions of support for the economic
 welfare of the newly developing countries, without any actual con-
 tribution toward their development, to the adoption of foreign trade as
 an "organic part of the Socialist economic system" and an "integral
 element of the Soviet foreign policy." 8   An item in the Soviet press
 in July, 1955, reporting for the first time a Main Administration for
 Economic Relations, an autonomous organization which operates
 directly under the U. S. S. R. Council of Ministers and which ap-
 parently has responsibility for overall coordination and direction of
 Soviet economic and technical assistance policies, did not go unno-
 ticed.  The setting up of this administration may reflect the new
 importance the Soviet Government attaches to economic aid pro-
 grams.
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) declared in a
 communique issued on December 16 after its annual meeting in Paris,
 that the Soviet Union's tactics in the Near East and its growing mili-
 tary strength offered "a new challenge to the free world."  The mutual
 security programs of the United States are meeting this challenge by
 improving the economic growth and military security of our partners
 in the free world.  The Ninth Semiannual Report on the Mutual
 Security Program, covering operations from July 1, 1955, to December
 31, 1955, said:
 "Building on past progress, the United States continued to help
 free people throughout the world strengthen their individual and
 collective efforts to safeguard their independence and at the same time
 move ahead with effective measures for economic self-improve-
 ment. * * *  Mutual security programs for joining our efforts with
 the efforts for economic improvement being undertaken by newly
 developing countries also went forward during the six-month period."'

 TITLE I-WAR MATERIALS
 SEC. 101. The Congress of the United States, recognizing that in a
 world threatened by aggression the United States can best preserve
 and maintain peace by developing maximum national strength and by
 utilizing all of its resources in cooperation with other free nations,
 hereby declares it to be the policy of the United States to apply an
 embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunition, and implements of
 war, atomic energy materials, petroleum, transportation materials of
 strategic value, and items of primary stragetic significance used in the
 production of arms, ammunition, and implements of war to any nation

 States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all
 countries under its domination.
 This Act shall be administered in such a way as to bring about the
 fullest support for any resolution of the General Assembly of the
 United Nations, supported by the United States, to prevent the ship-
 ment of certain commodities to areas under the control of govern-
 ments engaged in hostilities in defiance of the United Nations.
 SEc. 102.  Responsibility for giving effect to the purposes of this
 Act shall be vested in the person occupying the senior position author-

 provisions of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949.  Such per-
 son is hereinafter referred to as the "Administrator."
 SEc. 103.  (a) The Administrator is hereby authorized and directed
 to determine within thirty days after enactment of this Act after full
 and complete consideration of the views of the Departments of State,
 Defense, and Commerce; the Economic Cooperation Administration;
 and any other appropriate agencies, and notwithstanding the pro-
 visions of any other law, which items are, for the purpose of this
 Act, arms, ammunition, and implements of war, atomic energy ma-
 terials, petroleum, transportation materials of strategic value, and
 those items of primary strategic significance used in the production
 of arms, ammunition, and implements of war which should be embar-
 goed to effectuate the purposes of this Act: Provided, That such deter-
 minations shall be continuously adjusted to current conditions on the
 basis of investigation and consultation, and that all nations receiving
 United States military, economic, or financial assistance shall be kept
 informed of such determinations.
 (b) All military, economic, or financial assistance to any nation
 shall, upon the recommendation of the Administrator, be terminated
 forthwith if such nation after sixty days from the date of a deter-
 mination under section 103 (a) knowingly permits the shipment to
 any nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the
 United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and
 all countries under its domination, of any such item which he has deter-
 mined under section 103 (a) after a full and complete investigation
 to be included in any of the following categories: Arms, ammunition,
 and implements of war, atomic energy materials, petroleum, transpor-
 tation materials of strategic value, and items of primary strategic
 significance used in the production of arms, ammunition, and imple-
 ments of war: Provided, That the President after receiving the advice
 of the Administrator and after taking into account the contribution
 of such country to the mutual security of the free world, the impor-
 tance of such assistance to the security of the United States, the
 strategic importance of imports received from countries of the Soviet

 bloc, and the adequacy of such country's controls over the export to
 the Soviet bloc of items of strategic importance, may direct the con-
 tinuance of such assistance to a country which permits shipments of
 items other than arms, ammunition, implements of war, and. atomic
 energy materials when unusual circumstances indicate tliat, the cessa-
 tion of aid would clearly be detrimental to the security of the United
 States: Provided.furifhcr, That the President shall immediately report
 any determination made pursuant to the first proviso of this section
 with reasons therefor to the Appropriations and Armed Services
 Committees of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, the
 Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the President
 shall at least once each quarter review all determinations made previ-
 ously and shall report his conclusions to the foregoing committees of
 the House and Senate, which reports shall contain an analysis of the
 trade with the Soviet bloc of countries for which determinations have
 been made.
 SEC. 104. Whenever military, economic, or financial assistance has
 been terminated as provided in this Act, such assistance can be re-
 sumed only upon determination by the President that adequate meas-
 ures have been taken by the nation concerned to assure full compliance
 with the provisions of this Act.
 SEC. 105. For the purposes of this Act the term "assistance" does .
 not include activities carried on for the purpose of facilitating the
 procurement of materials in which the United States is deficient.
 TITLE II OTHER MATERIALS
 SEC. 201. The Congress of the United States further declares it to
 be the policy of the United States to regulate the export of commodi-
 ties other than those specified in Title I of this Act to any nation or
 combination of nations threatening the security of the United States,
 including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all countries
 under its domination, in order to strengthen the United States and
 other cooperating nations of the free world and to oppose and offset
 by nonmilitary action acts which threaten the security of the United
 States and the peace of the world.
 SEC. 202.  The United States shall negotiate with any country re-
 ceiving military, economic, or financial assistance arrangements for
 the recipient country to undertake a program for controlling exports
 of items not subject to embargo under Title I of this Act, but which
 in the judgment of the Administrator should be controlled to any
 nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the
 United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and
 all countries under its domination.
 SEC. 203.  All military, economic, and financial assistance shall be
 terminated when the President determines that the recipient country

 APPENDIX B
 Trade Controls of Free World Countries
 This appendix summarizes the national trade control measures of
 the countries cooperating with one another in the multilateral control
 system. Descriptions of the trade controls of other friendly countries
 have been contained in similar appendices to previous MDAC reports,
 and, since their control procedures have in most cases not undergone
 substantial revision, they are not repeated in this appendix.
 As indicated in previous reports, much of the detailed information
 on security trade controls has a security classification.  Thus these
 descriptions must, in a public report, be presented in somewhat general
 terms.  The descriptions are concerned primarily with the basic
 export license and customs control procedures originally established
 for directing foreign trade to particular currency areas, for conserving
 goods in short supply, and for other economic or financial reasons.
 Security trade controls have been generally exercised through these
 basic .procedures, supplemented, to increase their effectiveness, by
 import certificate-delivery verification (IC/DV) procedures, shipping
 controls, transit trade controls, and transaction or financial controls.
 The descriptions which follow describe the main features of these
 national control systems as they stood June 30, 1956. The countries
 are arranged in alphabetical order.
 License Requirements
 The basic legislation from which the present import-export control system in
 Belgium has developed was a law of June 30, 1931, modified by the law of
 July 30, 1934, which authorized in broad general terms the regulation of
 Belgium's foreign commerce to promote the general economic well-being of the
 country.  The convention with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on May 23,
 1935, amending the economic union convention of 1922, established also a com-
 bined Belgo-Luxembourg Administrative Commission (the Commission Ad-
 ministrative Mixte Belgo-Luxembourgeoise) and in this way provided a central
 agency for coordinating the import and export licensing procedures of Belgium
 and Luxembourg.  Pursuant to the 1935 convention, when the appropriate agency
 of either government desires to modify or expand regulations pertaining to
 import and export controls, the recommendation is discussed with the appro-
 riate agencies of the other government; their agreement having been reached,
 the new policies are communicated to the Mixed Commission which then trans-

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61SO0527AO00100180118-8
 mits identical instructions to the Belgian Central Office of Licenses and Quotas
 and the Luxembourg Office of Licenses.  This procedure insures close coordina-
 tion of the import and export licensing operations of the two governments in
 order that the general economic welfare of both may best be served.
 A royal decree dated January 17, 1955, provides that the import and export
 of all merchandise is subject to licensing control.  However, the Ministers
 can, within the limits of their authority, suspend this measure as to certain
 merchandise designated by them.  They can also limit this suspension to
 merchandise coming from or destined to countries which they determine.
 The control over exports effected by the requirement of export licenses is
 reinforced by special controls applied at the time of the actual export of the
 licensed merchandise.  Submission to these special controls is required as a.
 previous condition to the obtaining of certain licenses, these special additional
 controls being applied by reason of the special nature of the merchandise to be
 exported or to assure the direct delivery of the merchandise to its foreign
 destination.
 Applicants for export licenses must make a declaration that they are familiar
 with the conditions upon which licenses are issued and the regulations relative
 to exchange controls, and that they accept these conditions and regulations
 without reserve.  The applicant also acknowledges that the licenses are not
 transferable and that any irregularity in his application or utilization of the
 license subjects him to possible refusals of any new export license applications
 and may expose him to prosecution for a criminal offense.  Exporters of prod-
 ucts whose final destination is controlled must sign an undertaking that their
 exports are not to be reexported.  In such cases, the exporter renounces his
 right to obtain any subsequent export licenses in all cases for which nonre-
 export declarations are required, if the present undertaking is evaded.
 Transit Controls
 The royal decree of January 17, 1955, referred to above, authorizes the Minister
 of Economic Affairs to impose a transit licensing requirement for certain items
 coming from or going to countries he may designate.  A second decree of the
 same date by the Minister of Economic Affairs requires the production of a
 Belgian transit license, or a transit authorization certificate (TAC) issued
 by certain countries, for the shipment through Belgium in transit of items
 named in the decree coming from the countries participating in the TAC scheme
 and destined for any of the Soviet bloc countries.  Luxembourg issued similar
 decrees January 20 and February 1, 1955.
 Financial Controls
 Prior authorization is required for all buying and selling transactions abroad
 by Belgian and Luxembourg residents.  The exchange control is carried out by
 the Belgo-Luxembourg Exchange Institute.
 Shipping Controls
 Belgium has taken action to prevent the carrying of strategic goods in Belgian
 ships to Communist Chinese and North Korean destinations.
 CANADA
 Authority for the control of exports in Canada is derived from the Export and
 Import Permits Act, an act of Parliament, which came into effect on June 1, 1954.
 Permit Requirements
 The Canadian approach to export control is based on two lists: (i) The Export
 Control List of strategic commodities for which export permits are required for
 practically all commercial exports to any destination, except the United States,
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61SO0527AO00100180118-8
 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 and (ii) the Area Control List of countries, the shipment to which of any goods
 requires an export permit.  The Area Control List comprises all Communist
 countries plus Hong Kong, Macao, and Indochina.  General export permits are
 in effect which enable shipments of a list of nonstrategic items to Hong Kong;
 shipments of casual gift parcels of trivial value to Communist countries; shipments
 to Canadian diplomatic missions; etc.
 Transaction Controls
 Under the act, Canada has also enacted a form of transaction control whereby
 it becomes an offense for a resident of Canada to knowingly cause or assist any
 shipment of strategic goods to be made from Canada or any other place, to
 Communist countries.
 Transit Controls
 New regulations were made effective January 16, 1955, respecting transit ship-
 ments.  These regulations stipulate that no person shall transship or cause or
 assist in the transshipment of or accept for transshipment to a country included
 in the Area Control Lisu any goods included in the Export Control List, unless a
 transit authorization certificate covering such goods and issued by the exporting
 country, or by the country of residence of the exporter, has been presented to and
 endorsed by a Canadian collector of customs or, in the absence of such certificate,
 approval for the transshipment has been given by the Minister of Trade and
 Commerce, or by a person authorized by him to do so.
 An export permit is required for all goods originating outside Canada when
 tendered for export in the same condition as when imported, without further
 processing or manufacture in Canada.  Goods in transit in bond on a,through
 journey on a billing originating outside of Canada, clearly indicating the ultimate
 destination of the goods to a third country, do not require a Canadian export
 permit.  Foreign goods passing through Canada to a third country without a
 through bill of lading require a Canadian export permit. (If such goods represent
 United States shipments of controlled goods passing through Canada to third
 countries, they must be covered by a United States export permit.)  All Canadian
 goods having an undeclared ultimate destination require export uermits.  Ship-
 ments of United States goods through Canada must be accompanied by a copy
 of the United States export declaration form.
 Export controls are administered by the Export and Import Permits Section
 of the Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce.
 DENMARK
 License Requirements
 Export licenses are required for all commodities, except certain agricultural
 products, if the goods are exported to or intended for end use in countries which
 are not members of the European Payments Union or are within the dollar area.
 For the goods enumerated in the below-mentioned Commodity Lists A and B,
 export licenses are required, irrespective of the country of destination.
 List A of the Danish export regulations consists of items of strategic signifi-
 cance.                                   For most of these items the licensing authority is the Board of Supply,
 but the Ministry of Justice controls exports of arms, munitions, military equip-
 ment, and machinery for the production thereof.  For the exportation of ships,
 the Board of Supply must obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Commerce,
 Industry, and Navigation.
 List B consists of nonstrategic goods.  Export licenses for these are issued by
 the Board of Supply, the Board of Health, the Ministry of Public Works, or the
 National Bank of Denmark according to the nature of the commodity concerned.
 Denmark applies import certificate-delivery verification procedures.

 Exchange Controls
 The National Bank of Denmark exercises strict controls over all transactions
 in foreign exchange.  Earnings in foreign currencies must be repatriated and sold
 to the bank unless special exceptions are made.
 Transit Controls
 The export controls apply to merchandise exported from the Copenhagen free
 port, including exports from transit or bonded warehouses and goods from free
 port or private warehouses.  They also apply to goods in transit through Den-
 mark, unless these are transiting on a through bill of lading and there is no change
 in ultimate destination.  In addition, Denmark has adopted the TAC scheme.
 These control measures thus prevent unauthorized diversion of embargo goods in
 transit through Denmark.
 All transit transactions financed by Denmark are subject to control by the
 national bank, regardless of whether the goods in question actually pass through
 Denmark or are forwarded directly between the countries of origin and destina-
 tion.                                       In its administration of these provisions the bank observes the same rules
 as the export control authorities with which the bank cooperates closely in this
 field.
 Shipping Controls
 An arrangement has been made by the Danish Government with Danish ship-
 ping companies to prevent the carrying in Danish vessels of strategic goods to
 Communist China and North Korea.  This arrangement is implemented through
 a licensing system operated under a voluntary agreement with Danish shipowners.
 License Requirements.
 Export licenses are required for over one-half the commodities identified in
 the French tariff nomenclature.  Governmental authority for this control is
 contained in various decrees, the latest dated November 30, 1944.  These decrees
 also permit addition to or removal from the list of controlled commodities merely
 by publication of a notice in the Journal Officiel.
 Applications for license to export, as submitted by French, exporters, are
 examined by the Ministry of Industry and Energy, by the Office des Changes
 (where monetary and financial factors are given consideration), and on occa-
 sion by appropriate technical committee and personnel in other agencies.  At the
 time the application for export license is submitted, the exporter may be in-
 structed by the Ministry of Industry and Energy to submit a sample, photograph,
 blueprint, drawing, or other detailed description of the commodity in question.
 These data are used in determining the advisability of issuing the export license
 requested.  At the port of exit, random samples of actual exports are extracted
 by customs officials and these are compared by competent technicians with the
 original data submitted with .the license application.  This procedure is designed
 to assure in as many instances as practical that the commodity exported is
 identical with the commodity for which the export license is issued.
 In the event fraudulent action on. the part of the exporter is found and can
 be legally established, the exporter is subject to confiscation of the goods in
 question and fines ranging upward to four times the value of the shipment plus
 penal servitude.  The control system in operation in France makes it possible
 to block or encourage exports to any destination of commodities requiring export
 licenses.
 Transit Controls
 On December 30, 1954, and January 12, 1955, the French Government published
 new regulations effective respectively on the 1st and 15th of January, 1955, con-

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 corning the regulation of imports, exports, and reexports of a certain number
 of products which enter France under transit status.  In essence, these regula-
 tions state that the products affected cannot be diverted to certain specified
 countries (which comprise the Soviet bloc) if their exportation begins in countries
 participating in the transit authorization certificate scheme unless the country
 of export so authorizes the change in destination.
 Financial Controls
 All transactions in foreign exchange engaged in by French residents, par-
 ticularly those in which a French resident takes title to foreign merchandise,
 require the prior authorization of the French Government.
 An "exchange commitment" (guaranteeing the return to the government of
 the exchange proceeds of a transaction) is required for all exports and reexports
 of merchandise to which a French resident holds. title.  Where the products
 concerned are subject to export license, the export license suffices for the ex-
 change commitment.
 Shipping Controls
 In order to avoid the transport on French vessels of strategic commodities to
 Communist China, the French Government has reached agreement with-the only
 French shipping firm operating on the China run that the latter will not transport
 commodities of any. description to Communist China unless these are covered
 by export license or permit indicating Communist China as the destination and
 issued by the French Government or a friendly foreign government maintaining
 the same level of controls as concerns strategic items to China as is maintained
 in France.
 The French Government has also instituted controls to deny bunkering facili-
 ties to vessels transporting strategic commodities to Communist China,
 GERMANY (FEDERAL REPUBLIC) AND WESTERN BERLIN
 License Requirements
 No commodity can be exported from the Federal Republic of Germany or
 West Berlin unless it is covered by an export declaration (Ausfuhrerklaerung)
 which is issued by the interior customs authorities.  However, certain types of
 exports require a special export declaration (Sonder-Ausfuhrerklaerung) which
 is granted by the same customs authorities only after a certificate of approval
 (Lieferungsgenehmigung) has been obtained, as appropriate, from the Bundesamt
 fuer gewerbliche Wirtschaft (Federal Office for Industrial Economy) or the
 Zentrale Genehmigungstelle (Central Licensing Agency) of the West Berlin
 Senate.  A certificate of approval is required for the following:
 (a) Exports to all countries in the free world of all commodities on the
 German "restricted list" in excess of DM1,000 (ball and roller bearings are ex-
 cluded from this procedure and therefore require a certificate of approval re-
 gardless of the value of the shipment).
 (b) All exports to the European Soviet bloc except certain nonstrategic com-
 modity groups, i. e., foodstuffs, certain types of textiles and consumer goods and
 "Small Value Shipments" (DM1,000 or less) of commodities of minor strategic
 importance.
 (c) All exports to Communist China, North Korea, North Vietnam and Macao
 except certain non-strategic commodity groups (See b).
 The German "restricted list," which is similar to but smaller than the
 United States "positive list," comprises commodities under control for security
 and short-supply reasons and includes all items covered by Title I and Title II
 of the MDAC Act.

 Exports to numerous Western countries, including peripheral countries, are
 subject to one form or another of end-use checks.  Import certificate-delivery
 verification procedures have been in operation since July, 1951.
 In conjunction with the issuance of either the export control document or the
 special export control document, the interior customs authorities observe a
 definite procedure for physical inspection of commodities being exported. Addi-
 tional control over commodities being exported from the Federal Republic is
 exercised by the border customs authorities.
 Financial Controls
 All triangular transactions between residents of Western Germany and West
 Berlin and residents of other areas are subject to either a general or a specific
 transit trade permit (Allgemeine or Einzel Transit Handels Genehmigung) issued
 by the foreign trade banks.  A specific transit trade permit is needed for all
 transactions where the final destination of the goods is in a Soviet bloc country.
 Before the granting of a transit trade permit, the transaction in question is not
 only screened with respect to the currency problems but also in regard to the
 strategic nature of the goods.  The latter screening is done by export control
 officials who have the power to prevent the transaction.
 Transit Controls
 Certain items are prohibitedfor intransit shipments on the grounds of health
 and sanitation, but the number of items so prohibited is very small and the
 prohibited list has not been changed since 1939.  German customs officials may
 inspect transit shipments at the border and remove any items prohibited under
 German law.  They then seal the containers of all other goods and such goods
 are permitted to proceed, in accordance with international agreement on transit
 traffic, without further inspection or restriction, except to insure at the exit
 border that the original customs seals remained unbroken.
 Effective January 15, 1955, the Federal Government implemented the transit
 authorization certificate scheme (TAC).  Under this procedure, transit ship-
 ments of listed strategic commodities originating in a COCOM country which
 are unloaded in the Federal Republic and destined for the Soviet bloc, but are not
 accompanied by a transit authorization certificate, will be detained pending
 proper clearance by the exporting country. The same procedure will be followed
 for strategic transit shipments which originated in a non-participating country,
 but where the principal of the transaction is a resident of a COCOM country.
 On January 1, 1956, the TAC scheme was extended to include also exports
 from certain non-COCOM countries.
 Intransit shipments arriving in the free port of Hamburg are subject to a
 customs documentary and physical check before being allowed to enter the
 free port.  When in the free port, such shipments are under the control of the
 free port authorities, and may be loaded, unloaded, or reloaded only with their
 approval.   The destination of intransit shipments arriving in the free port of
 Hamburg traveling under a "through bill of lading" can only be changed upon
 instructions of the original shipper, while the destination of intransit goods
 traveling under an "ordinary bill of lading" can be determined by the responsible
 local forwarding agent.
 Intransit shipments consigned to West German firms and remaining in the
 free port of Hamburg for shipment to a consignee outside Western Germany,
 require an intransit trade permit (Transit Handelsgenchmigung), except when
 the goods are returned to country of origin.  Such intransit trade permits are
 issued by the State Central Banks after careful scrutiny of the West German
 firm and in accordance with the same regulations applying to shipments of West
 German origin, and approval by the West German Central Export Control Office

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 West German firms must be listed in the official trade register in order to qualify
 for an intransit trade permit.
 A similar procedure is enforced in the free ports of Bremen and Bremerhaven,
 with the exception that the functions within the free port are carried out by
 federal customs authorities rather than free port authorities.  This procedure
 also applies to Cuxhaven, Emden, and Kiel, which are free ports of very minor
 importance.
 License Requirements
 Export licenses are required for all strategic commodities and for certain
 nonstrategic commodities for which export quotas have been established.  For
 nonstrategic shipments, licenses are issued by the Bank of Greece in accordance
 with directives from the Greek Foreign Trade Administration, Ministry of
 Commerce.  For strategic shipments, including those to the Soviet bloc countries,
 licenses must be obtained from the Foreign Trade Administration.  In the case
 of countries with which Greece has bilateral trade agreements (which includes
 the Soviet bloc countries), such licenses are limited to the quantities specified
 in the respective agreements.
 Transit Controls
 Transit shipments of strategic commodities must be licensed by the Foreign
 Trade Administration prior to being reexported.
 Financial Controls
 Foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Greece.
 Shipping Controls
 Effective March 17, 1953, the Greek Government prohibited Greek-flag vessels
 from calling at Communist ports in China and North Korea.  This was accom-
 plished by the Greek Council of Ministers Act No. 204 of March 17, which was
 enacted into law by the Greek Parliament on May 7.  Violators are punishable
 under the provisions of law No. 2317 of 1953, published in Greek Government
 Gazette No. 61 dated March 17.
 The Greek foreign investment law (No. 2687 of 1953) provides that foreign
 vessels transferred to the Greek flag may only be resold to countries named in
 the instrument of approval executed at the time of the transfer of the vessel to
 Greek registry.  So far, such instruments have not included Soviet bloc countries.
 With only minor exceptions, the sale to other countries of Greek-flag ships not
 covered by an instrument under law 2687 requires the prior approval of the
 Greek Government.
 Ship repairs are subject to export licensing under the procedures covering
 transit shipments.
 Current bunkering controls require licensing by the Bank of Greece with
 respect to payment in foreign exchange for the value of fuel and by customs
 authorities for removal from customs precincts.
 License Requirements
 All commodities listed in the new Tabella Esport (the Italian export list) dated
 March 29, 1956, require an export license to all destinations, except Somaliland,
 which is issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade.  All items internationally
 accepted for embargo or quantitative control are included in the Tabella Es port.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 Goods not listed in the Tabetla are exempt from license, but must be exported
 in conformity with exchange regulations, which vary according to the country
 of destination and clearing or other financial agreements.
 All exports to Communist China, Czechoslovakia, and Eastern Germany re-
 quire an export license, while licensing of exports for other Soviet bloc countries
 is covered by special regulations for each country.  Export and import licenses
 for trade with Communist China and Eastern Germany are presently granted
 only to SPEI, a special entity under the Government agency ARAR, appointed
 to administer this and which acts as agent for firms wishing to trade with these
 countries.
 Exports to the Soviet bloc also require bank validations, as virtually all trade
 with the Soviet bloc is conducted under bilateral agreements which specify the
 commodities that may be traded and the methods by which payment is to be
 made.  Normally, shipments to the East comprise only those commodities
 specified in a trade agreement with an eastern country.  In order to facilitate
 checking of eastbound shipments, trade with the Soviet bloc is funnelled through
 selected frontier customs points.
 The formulation of export control policy and the administration of the export
 licensing system are the primary responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
 This Ministry is advised by a special interministerial committee.
 Italy is employing import certificate-delivery verification procedures and car-
 ries out end-use checks for shipments to destinations outside the Soviet bloc,
 particularly for questionable transactions involving goods of a strategic nature.
 The country of origin is notified if an attempt is made to divert a shipment.
 Financial Controls
 Financial control over all export transactions is maintained through the
 licensing system and through implementation of existing exchange control
 regulations.
 Strict bilateral trade agreements with almost all members of the Soviet bloc
 have constituted, in effect, a financial ceiling on exports to Eastern Europe.
 Trade with Communist China under a unilateral compensation arrangement is
 conducted in sterling or Swiss francs.  Italian exchange control regulations
 would not normally permit payment for imports from the Soviet bloc in hard
 currencies, although sterling is occasionally used in payment for the few items
 not included in the trade agreements.  In certain instances ship charters are
 completed for sterling when circumstances warrant or it is considered convenient.
 Transit Controls
 In order to implement the international TAC agreement on transit controls,
 instructions were issued to Italian customs offices on January 2, 1955, to the
 effect that foreign commodities in transit through Italy, in order to be considered
 in direct transit, must be covered by commercial or freight documents showing
 ultimate destination of the commodities to a specific foreign country, which
 destination should be clearly noted in the origin of the shipment.  For embargo
 items directed to the Soviet bloc, this requirement may be met by the presentation
 of a transit authorization certificate.  If a shipment of this kind arrives at an
 exit customs point without the proper documentation to establish that it is in
 direct transit, customs is required to hold the commodities in storage until its
 status can be clarified.  These regulations should, in conformity with COCOM
 agreements, effectively close the loophole previously caused by the lack of control
 over shipments in direct transit.
 In the case of indirect transit shipments, a check is also made on the regularity
 of the transaction from the foreign currency standpoint.  Operators contemplat-
 ing indirect transit operations must submit an application to the appropriate

 agency (Bank of Italy, directly or through authorized bank; or Ministry of
 Foreign Trade, General Directorate for Currencies) when any item listed in
 part A of the Tabella Es port (which includes all strategic items except Inter-
 national List III) is purchased abroad.  To allow a certain flexibility, a transit
 operator may purchase the goods abroad and have them shipped to Italy before
 making application to the Ministry of Foreign Trade; however, in this case he
 must submit to the bank which holds his currency account a written commitment
 that the goods will be sent directly to Italy and not diverted.  He must also
 obtain the clearance of the General Directorate for Currencies before the goods
 can be onforwarded through Italy to another country.
 The routing of both direct and indirect transit shipments is kept under sur-
 veillance to ascertain that it is natural and normal and to avoid routing that
 may facilitate diversion.
 Shipping Controls
 The Ministry of Merchant Marine has drafted a bill which, when enacted into
 law, will give the Italian Government the power to exercise control over shipping
 traffic with countries of the Soviet bloc.  The bill contemplates quite severe
 penalties to be imposed upon owners and masters of ships failing to comply
 with regulations established by the Ministry of Merchant Marine.  Considera-
 tion of this bill by Parliament has been delayed for more than two years, however,
 and there seems to be no immediate prospect that it will be enacted into law.
 Penalties
 Penalties that may be imposed under Italian law for violations of export-
 control regulations include (1) imprisonment up to 3 months, (2) fines up to
 40,000 lire, and (3) confiscation of the merchandise involved.  These penalties
 have on occasion been supplemented by fines as high as 50 million lire ($80,000)
 for crimes committed. in connection with false customs declarations or currency
 violations in export transactions.  Persons and firms under investigation for
 illegal export transactions are denied foreign trading privileges.
 Irregularities under the customs law may be punished by fines from 2,000 to
 20,000 lire, while other infractions may incur the penalties contemplated by
 the penal code.
 JAPAN
 License Requirements
 Licenses from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry are
 required for exports of any commodity on the Japanese export control list.  No
 exports to North Korea have been permitted since the outbreak of the Korean
 War. Exports to Communist China are limited to nonstrategic items.     Exports
 of strategic items to any other Communist bloc country are strictly controlled.
 End-use checks are made also on suspicious exports of strategic items, and
 the import certificate-delivery verification procedure has been utilized since
 April 1, 1953.
 Transit Controls
 Intransit cargo is offloaded under customs supervision and is normally kept
 in a bonded warehouse or other area under the complete control of customs
 officials.
 Japan applies transit authorization certificate procedures to certain offloaded
 intransit cargo destined for the Soviet bloc exported from any country cooper-
 ating in the TAC scheme, or which was exported from any country if the principal
 in the transaction is a resident of a COCOM country.

 Financial Controls
 For balance-of-payments reasons, Japan closely controls its receipts and ex-
 penditures of foreign exchange.  These controls are not related to security meas-
 ures except indirectly in connection with trade with Communist China and the
 Soviet Union.  Trade with these areas is largely confined to barter transactions.
 Shipping and Bunkering Controls
 Japanese shipowners have been notified that Japanese vessels are not author-
 ized to carry strategic goods to Communist China from Japan or from any other
 country unless shipment has been licensed by a COCOM country.
 Administrative measures also have been adopted to prevent foreigners from
 chartering or using Japanese vessels to carry contraband goods to Communist
 China or North Korea.  The Ministry of Transportation has announced that
 applications for approval of a bareboat or time charter of a Japanese vessel to a
 foreigner must show that the charterer has guaranteed that during the period
 of the charter the vessel will not enter any port in Communist China or North
 Korea with strategic goods on board the vessel unless the shipment has been
 licensed by a COCOM country.
 The Ministry of International Trade and Industry furthermore has instructed
 Japanese oil companies not to furnish fuel bunkers to any vessel carrying strategic
 goods to Communist China or North Korea unless the shipment has been licensed
 by a COCOM country.
 License Requirements
 All exports fromthe Netherlands are subject to export controls.
 However, general licenses are granted for transactions involving most industrial
 products and for transactions of less than $250 (U. S.) involving items appearing
 on the international control lists, provided these transactions are with either
 OEEC or dollar area countries.  Under those general licenses, an exporter com-
 pletes and submits a declaration to the customs, which can then approve the
 transaction without prior reference to the licensing authorities.
 Individual licenses are required for all other export transactions.  Export
 licenses for industrial products are issued by the "Contralti Dienst voor Inen
 Vitvoer" (Central Import and Export Office) in The Hague.  With respect to
 the approval of applications for export licenses in cases involving strategic goods,
 the IC/DV system is applied extensively. In cases involving the export of strategic
 goods to countries not participating in the IC/DV system, the final destination is
 often chocked before the export license is granted. Furthermore, the exporter is,
 in most cases, afterwards obliged to prove that the goods exported by him have
 been imported into the country mentioned in the export license as the country of
 final destination.  Finally, when a shipment leaves the country, the customs
 authorities have the right to satisfy themselves that the goods to be exported are
 identical with the description given in the export license, and that the direction
 in which the shipment is being sent is not incompatible with the final destination
 mentioned in the license.
 Financial Controls
 All financial transactions by Netherlands residents involving payments to or
 received from a party abroad are subject to foreign exchange licenses. Through
 the means of these licenses, it is possible to control triangular transactions in
 which a Netherlands resident is involved as a middle man. Within the framework
 of these controls, the IC/DV system is also applied.

 Shipping Controls
 Voyage controls have been instituted which are aimed at preventing the carriage
 of certain strategic commodities by Netherlands ships to the People's Republic of
 China, North Korea, and North Vietnam except pursuant to special permission.
 Transit Controls
 Pursuant to royal decree regarding the transit control of strategic coininoditie ,
 strategic goods sent from specifically mentioned countries or shipped on the
 behalf of resident of some of these countries, which after unloading pass in transit
 through the Netherlands, are subject to control over their destination.
 License Requirements
 All commodities to be exported to any destination require export licenses.  The
 licensing authorities using existing powers can prevent the export of any item for
 security reasons.
 Norway applies import certificate-delivery verification procedures.
 Transit Controls
 Goods which are to pass through the territory of Norway may be reexported
 without license only if it is clearly stated by their conveying documents that the
 goods are going straight to the foreign destination.  If the reexport does not take
 place within 90 days, a Norwegian export license must be secured.  The destina-
 tion listed on the original documents must remain the same, and the goods may
 not be transformed in any way during their stay in the country.    The customs
 authority applies a control to that effect.  An export license is required for all
 commodities in transit to a Soviet bloc country even though the reexport takes
 place within 90 days.  There are no free port areas in Norway.
 Financial Controls
 Strict exchange controls are maintained by the government through the Bank
 of Norway.  The granting of an export license carries with it the obligation on
 the part of the exporter to relinquish the foreign exchange to the Bank of Norway
 as soon as received from the foreign buyer; a maximum of 60 days is allowed
 between export and remittance, although under certain circumstances the gov-
 ernment may grant the exporter an extension of time.  Transfers of capital from
 Norway require the prior approval of the Bank of Norway.
 Shipping Controls
 The Norwegian Foreign Office announced publicly in April, 1953, that the
 Norwegian war risk insurance group had refused to insure Norwegian vessels
 delivering strategic articles to Communist Chinese and North Korean ports.
 The Foreign Office also announced that Norwegian ships had not violated the
 United Nations Resolution of May 18, 1951, prohibiting the shipment of strategic
 material to Communist China and North Korea.  Several allegations that they
 had done so had been investigated and found to be unjustified.
 License Requirements
 Exports to all foreign destinations are subject to individual export licensing.
 Exports to the Portuguese overseas provinces are free of licensing except in the
 case of a few items.  Licenses for strategic materials are granted only after assur-
 ance has been obtained as to the effective destination of the merchandise. Licenses
 are not approved for exports of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc.

 Import and export licensing activities are exercised by the Division of Foreign
 Trade of the Ministry of Economy and by delegated other agencies.  The finan-
 cial aspects of trade control are coordinated with the Ministry of Finance through
 the Bank of Portugal.  In recent years, Portuguese exports to the Soviet bloc as a
 whole, consisting almost entirely of cork and its products, have substantially
 exceeded imports, resulting in a net exchange balapceto Portugal.
 The Portuguese overseas provinces exercise varying degrees of trade and ex-
 change control.
 Transit Controls
 Portuguese controls over goods in transit have been under study for some time
 and are expected to be amended to establish additional safeguards against unde-
 sirable diversions of strategic commodities.
 Shipping Controls
 Portugal does not exercise voyage licensing, but Portuguese vessels plying
 between Europe and Macao have been instructed not to accept cargo for Macao
 unless it is covered by a Macao import certificate.  There have been no Portu-
 guese flag shipping services to Soviet bloc ports in recent years.
 License Requirements
 Export licenses are required for most of the important export commodities,
 including all goods considered to be of a strategic nature.  The goods which
 are subject to export licenses appear on List II attached to the Turkish foreign
 trade regulations issued in September, 1953.  For the goods appearing on that
 list, export licenses are required for shipments to all destinations; the licenses
 are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce, with the exception of
 some agricultural commodities for which authority to grant export licenses has
 been delegated to other organizations.  Goods not appearing on List II may
 be exported upon the presentation of a customs exit declaration which is based
 on the exporter's application.  All exports are subject to strict foreign exchange
 regulations.
 Turkey applies import certificate-delivery verification procedures with respect
 to the shipment of strategic commodities.
 Transit Controls
 Goods which are to pass through the 'territory of Turkey may be reexported
 without license only if all shipping documents (including bill of lading and
 ship's manifest) and outer containers carry the name of the Turkish port of
 transit, the phrase "in transit to" and the name of the city and country of
 destination.  Goods entered in transit may be reexported without further con-
 trol; however, the government reserves the right to inspect transit shipments
 in cases of suspicion of irregularity.   The reexport of goods covered by "in
 transit" bills of lading, without an export license, is contingent on proof that
 the goods were not purchased with foreign exchange made available by Turkish
 authorities.
 The reexportation of all foreign goods cleared through Turkish customs is
 subject to the authorization of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce.
 The Turkish Government is authorized by law to establish free zones in Turkish
 ports, but thus far no such free zone has been established.
 Turkey has established transit authorization certificate procedures.
 Financial Controls
 Strict exchange controls are maintained by the government through the Min-
 istry of Finance and the Central Bank.  Turkish exporters are required to sell

 to a bank in Turkey the foreign exchange proceeds of exports within 3 months
 from the date of exportation and within 15 days of the date of receipt of the
 foreign exchange by the exporters.  Foreign exchange may be sold to persons
 and firms in Turkey only by banks, against permits issued by the Ministry of
 Finance.  All payments in foreign exchange, from funds available abroad to
 persons and firms in Turkey, are subject to the authorization of the Ministry of
 Finance.  Other capital transactions involving foreign exchange, by persons and
 firms in Turkey, are also subject to the authorization of the Ministry of Finance.
 License Requirements
 The export control system in the United Kingdom is similar to but not identical
 with that of the United States.  It is administered by the Board of Trade.  Al-
 though the present system grew out of measures originally promulgated at the
 start of World War II, its primary purpose now is the safeguarding of the country's
 requirements of strategic and short-supply goods, and the restriction of the flow
 of such items to undesirable destinations.  The United Kingdom security trade
 control program was instituted in 1947.
 The United Kingdom export control mechanism operates in the following
 manner:
 Export control orders which detail the items subject to control are published
 documents, and revisions are issued in the Board of Trade Journal (an official
 weekly).  The current orders provide that (1) all goods are controlled to China,
 Macao, North Vietnam, Tibet, and North Korea, (2) certain specified goods are
 controlled to all destinations, and (3) certain other specified goods are controlled
 to all destinations other than the British Commonwealth, the Irish Republic, and
 the United States of America.
 The extent of the restriction on individual items is reflected in the admin-
 istration of the control.  Strict control is maintained over items which are pro-
 hibited exportation to certain areas, as, for instance, aircraft, firearms, am-
 munition, atomic materials.  The exportation of a wide range of goods of stra-
 tegic importance, including rubber, to Communist China is prohibited, as is
 the exportation to the Soviet bloc in Europe of a somewhat narrower range of
 commodities.  The export to the Soviet bloc of many other items is subject to
 limitations as to quantities permitted to be shipped.  In addition, there is the
 great bulk of items on which control is achieved through case-by-case scrutiny
 of individual license applications.
 The United Kingdom has effectively implemented import certificate-delivery
 verification procedures.
 Transit Controls
 The United Kingdom has had in effect since November, 1951, a system whereby
 certain items arriving from other countries are subject to transshipment con-
 trol.  Individual licenses are required for all of the items on the licensing list
 before any of the goods, after being landed in the United Kingdom, can be
 transshipped to any destination other than the British Commonwealth, Ireland,
 and the United States. The present control is operated over all goods embargoed
 to the Soviet bloc.  In administering the control, the British authorities nor-
 mally grant licenses when they are satisfied that the goods will not be diverted
 to the Soviet bloc, China, etc., contrary to the wishes of the exporting country.
 The United Kingdom also cooperates fully in the implementation of the TAC
 s ihetne.

 Transaction Controls
 As one of the reinforcement measures to strengthen security controls agreed
 when the Soviet bloc embargo list was reviewed in 1954, the United Kingdom
 introduced a control on merchanting transactions operative from January 7,
 1955.  This control prohibits the disposal by persons in, or ordinarily resident
 in, the United Kingdom of specified strategic goods which are situated outside
 the. United Kingdom to any authority of, or person in, the Soviet bloc, China,
 Tibet, North Vietnam, or North Korea, or to any other person if the person dis-
 posing of the goods has reasonable cause to believe that the goods will be imported
 directly or indirectly into the Soviet bloc, China, Tibet, North Vietnam, or
 North Korea.  The goods covered by the control are those which are subject to
 embargo for Soviet bloc countries.
 Shipping Controls
 In order to restrict further the flow of strategic goods to China and as an
 additional measure of control, a statutory order (titled the Control of Trade
 by Sea (China and North Korea) Order, 1953) was made on March 13, 1953,
 pursuant to which the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is empowered
 to control all shipping to China and North Korea.  In essence, the order applies
 to all British ships having a gross tonnage of 500 tons, limits the type of trade
 in which the ships may engage and the voyages which may be undertaken, affects
 the class of cargo or passengers which may be carried, and imposes certain con-
 ditions on the hiring of ships.  Approximately 100 items are listed in a
 schedule which is an integral part of the license issued under the order in question.
 These items are banned from carriage to China in British-flag vessels.
 While formal shipping controls were not adopted until March 17, 1953, British
 shipping circles were kept under fairly close scrutiny by the government ever
 since the adoption on May 18, 1951, by the Additional Measures Committee of
 the United Nations, of the resolution to apply economic sanctions against China
 as a result of her aggressive intervention in Korea.
 Complementary controls over the bunkering of vessels carrying strategic cargo
 (as defined in the Shipping Control Order) to China were adopted at the same
 time that the order affecting shipping became operative.  These controls are
 administered by the Ministry of Fuel and Power on an informal basis, in co-
 operation with British oil companies which deny bunkers to ships carrying
 strategic cargo to China.
 Export Controls in General
 The Department of Commerce is responsible for controls over nearly all coin-
 mercial exportations from the United States under the Export Control Act of
 1949, as amended.
 The Department of State is responsible for control over the exportation of
 arms, ammunition, and implements of war; the Atomic Energy Commission ad-
 ministers controls over the export of major atomic energy items; and the Depart-
 ment of Treasury administers controls over the exportation of gold and narcotics.
 Administration of Export Controls by Commerce Department
 The export control regulations administered by the Department of Commerce
 are contained in the Comprehensive Export Schedule published annually by the
 Bureau of Foreign Commerce (BFC) of the Department of Commerce.  Changes
 in these regulations are published once or twice a month in Current Export
 Bulletins by BFC.  These publications must be consulted to determine the ap-

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 plicable requirements for an exportation of any given commodity to a specific
 destination.
 In accordance with the export control regulations, all commercial exports from
 the United States, except to Canada, are controlled by the Department of Com-
 merce either through the issuance of a validated export license or the establish-
 ment of a general license permitting such shipments.
 A validated export license is a formal document issued to an exporter by the
 Department of Commerce which authorizes exportation within specific limitations.
 Validated licenses are required for shipments of commodities identified in the
 Positive List of Controlled Commodities to virtually all destinations.  This list
 is maintained on a current basis in the Comprehensive Export Schedule.
 A general license is a broad authorization issued by the Department of Com-
 merce which permits exportation under certain circumstances without the require-
 ment of a formal export control document.  The authority to export and the
 conditions under which each general license may be used are specified in the
 Comprehensive Export Schedule.
 In addition to the validated license requirements for commodities on the
 Positive List, a validated export license is required for the shipment of any
 commodity to the following destinations:
 (1) Communist China, North Korea,  Communist-controlled areas of
 Vietnam and of Laos, and the maritime provinces of the U. S. S. R.;
 (2) Macao;
 (3) Hong Kong, except certain specified commodities which may be
 shipped under General License GHK; and
 (4) The European Soviet bloc, with the exception of certain specified
 commodities which, since April 26, 1956, may be shipped to these areas under
 General License GLSA.
 Export controls as administered by the Department of Commerce are, in
 accordance with the Export Control Act of 1949, as amended, maintained (a)
 for short supply or (b) for security reasons.  Both export control policies reflect
 appropriately established United States foreign policy and international respon-
 sibilities.  Major policy changes and activities of the Department of Commerce
 in carrying out its export control activities are reported in Quarterly Reports
 under the Export Control Act made by the Secretary of Commerce to the Presi-
 dent and the Congress.
 The objective of security controls is to exercise the necessary vigilance over
 exports from the standpoint of their significance to the national security.  The
 controls were designed to deny or restrict the exportation of strategic commodities
 to the Soviet bloc in order to impede the buildup and maintenance of the Soviet
 war potential.  Shipments of all commodities to Communist China and North
 Korea are embargoed while shipments to other Soviet bloc destinations are either
 denied or restricted.  In addition, all proposed shipments of strategic commodities
 to all destinations, except Canada, are carefully scrutinized to assure that the
 goods will not be transshipped or diverted to unfriendly hands. The Commerce
 Department has developed procedures to prevent the frustration of our own
 export controls which would result from shipping a strategic item to a country
 which (1) ships identical or closely similar items to the Soviet bloc, or (2) would use
 the American item directly in the manufacture of strategic items for the Soviet
 bloc.
 In order to prevent the transshipment abroad of United States commodities,
 the Department of Commerce also has regulations covering the unauthorized
 movement of United States commodities after they leave United States shores.
 These regulations, generally referred to as the "destination control" provisions, are
 designed to prohibit the reexportation from the country of ultimate destination
 except upon written authorization from BFC.  These regulations also restrict

 ships, planes or other carriers from delivering United States origin goods to other
 than the destination specified on the export control documents.  In addition,
 the United States participates in the international IC/DV (import certificate/
 delivery verification) system.
 In addition to United States export controls for security reasons, it is necessary
 to administer export controls for short supply reasons in order to protect the
 domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the
 inflationary impact of abnormal demand.  Such controls are usually exercised
 by means of export programs or quotas fixed by the Secretary of Commerce.
 The easing of supply programs has led to the lifting of nearly all domestic controls
 over materials; such actions havegenerally been followed by the relaxation of related
 export controls for short supply reasons.  Thus, export controls for short supply
 reasons do not play as important a part as before in comparison with security
 controls.
 Transit Controls
 A validated export license is required for the exportation from any seaport,
 land frontier, airport, or foreign trade zone in the United States of certain stra-
 tegic goods in transit through the United States which originate in and are destined
 to a foreign country.  The commodities so controlled are the ones which are
 identified on the United States Department of Commerce Positive List by the
 letter "C".  In addition, any commodities in transit through the United States
 for Soviet bloc destinations require a validated export license.  These procedures
 are used to implement United States participation in the TAC scheme.
 Shipping Controls
 Department of Commerce Transportation Order T-1 denies any United States-
 registered. vessel or aircraft authority to carry items listed on the Positive List,
 or arms, ammunition, and implements of war, or fissionable material, to any
 Soviet bloc destination, Hong Kong, or Macao without a valida~ed license issued
 by BFC or other appropriate licensing agencies or the express permission of the
 Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation.  This order includes ship-
 ments from foreign ports as well as from the United States.
 Department of Commerce Transportation Order T-2 prohibits the transporta-
 tion of any commodities directly or indirectly to Communist China, North Korea
 or areas under their control, by United States-registered vessels or aircraft..  It
 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in
 Communist China.
 A validated license is required for delivery in United States ports of specified
 types of petroleum and petroleum products to foreign vessels, if the foreign car-
 rier has called at any point under Far Eastern Communist control or at Macao
 during the 180 days preceding the date on which such commodities are to be laden
 aboard the vessel, or will carry commodities of any origin from the United States
 destined directly or indirectly for any such point within a period of 120 days in
 the case of a vessel, or 30 days in the case of any aircraft.  This regulation also
 requires that if a carrier is registered in or under charter to a Soviet bloc country
 or is under charter to a national of a Soviet bloc country it will be necessary to
 apply to BFC for a validated license.
 American petroleum companies at certain foreign ports are prohibited without
 a Treasury Department authorization from bunkering any vessel bound for a
 Communist Far East port or Macao or which is carrying goods destined for Coin-
 munist China or North Korea.  Similar restrictions apply to the bunkering of
 these companies of vessels returning from Communist Far East ports or Macao.

 Financial and Transaction Controls
 The Foreign Assets Control Regulations, administered by the Treasury Depart-
 ment, block the assets here of Communist China, North Korea and their national
 and prohibit unlicensed dealings involving property in which Communist China,
 or North Korea, or their nationals, have any interest.  The regulations prevent
 the use of United States financial facilities by those countries and their nationals.
 These regulations also prohibit the unlicensed importation of goods of Chinese
 Communist or North Korean origin.
 Treasury regulations also prohibit Americans, including foreign subsidiaries of
 United States firms, from participating in the purchase or sale of certain important
 commodities for ultimate shipment from any country outside the United States
 to the countries of the Soviet bloc.  Attempts to do the prohibited acts are also
 covered.  These transactions controls, which are complementary to the United
 States export control laws, are administered by the Treasury Department under
 Foreign Assets Control Regulations.

 APPENDIX C
 Presidential Determinations
 Made During 1955
 On April 1, 1955, the following letter was sent to the six Congres-
 sional Committees named in the Battle Act.  At the same time,
 public notification of this determination was made through press
 release 344.
 WASHINGTON 25, D. C., April 1, 1955.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The President on March 31, 1955, determined, pur-
 suant to Section 103(b) of the Mutual Defense, Assistance Control Act of 1951
 that United States aid be continued to France, Italy, The Netherlands, and the
 United Kingdom because the cessation of such aid would be clearly detrimental
 to the security interests of the United States. The President, in his letter to
 me directing that aid be continued, has also directed that, in compliance with the
 reporting requirement of Section 103(b) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control
 Act of 1951, I inform you of his determination, to which purpose this letter, with
 attachments, is sent.
 Sincerely yours,-
 HAROLD  E.  STASSEN,
 Director of Foreign Operations.
 The following letter dated March 29, 1955, which recommended to
 the President the continuance of aid to France, Italy, The Netherlands,
 and the United Kingdom, was attached to the above transmittal.
 FOREIGN  OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION
 OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
 WASHINGTON 25, D. C., March 29, 1955.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It is my duty to report herewith certain additional
 shipments of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc from countries receiving
 United States assistance, and to recommend that you continue this assistance to
 the countries involved since in each case the cessation of aid would clearly be
 detrimental to the security of the United States.
 The countries involved are France, Italy, The Netherlands, and the United
 Kingdom.  On the advice of Vice Admiral Walter S. DeLany, my Deputy
 Director for Mutual Defense Assistance Control; concurred in by the Departments
 of State, Defense, Commerce, and Treasury; I recommend that you make a
 Determination to continue aid to these countries pursuant to Section 103 (b) of
 the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle Act).

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 Section 103 (b) forbids all military, economic, and financial assistance to a
 country that knowingly permits the shipment of items listed for embargo under
 the Act, except that the President "may direct the continuance of such assistance
 to a country which permits shipments of items other than arms, ammunition,
 implements of war, and atomic energy materials when unusual circumstances
 indicate that the cessation of aid would clearly be detrimental to the security of
 the United States."
 All of the shipments reported in this letter were "prior commitments"-made
 prior to January 25, 1952, the effective date of the Battle Act embargo provisions.
 The prior-commitment problem has been fully discussed in communications to the
 Congress on a number of occasions.  Most of the original prior commitments have
 been removed from the books, either by deliveries or by cancellation of certain
 shipments.  The remaining amount is still scheduled for shipment.  Although
 the Battle Act list revisions of August 25, 1954, haveresulted in the removal of
 some of these items from the control lists, the addition of new items to the lists
 may also result in the creation of new "prior commitments" with respect to certain
 previously uncontrolled items.
 As a result of the recent reappraisal of commodities within the U. S. Govern-
 ment and by the 15 governments, including the U. S., which cooperate in security
 trade controls, some of the items in this letter have been determined no longer to
 require embargo treatment, but since they were still on the Battle Act embargo
 list at the time of the shipments, they must be dealt with here along with items
 whose embargo status was unaffected by the August 25 revisions.
 My recommendation that aid be continued in the present cases does not grow
 out of the recent revisions of the security trade control program.  The circum-
 stances of these cases are very similar to previous cases wherein a determination that
 aid be continued was made.  All of the shipments reported herein went to Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria.  None of them was arms, ammunition,
 implements of war, or atomic energy materials.  Following is a summary of the
 shipments which were permitted and which have not been covered by any pre-
 vious Presidential Determination with respect to these four countries.
 The following Battle Act embargo items have been shipped from France to
 Poland: boring, drilling, and milling machines valued at $494,878; stainless steel
 tanks valued at $91,786; and $254 worth of nickel products.  All of these ship-
 ments were part of the French backlog of prior commitments.
 Prior-commitment items worth $43,419 have been shipped from Italy as follows:
 To Poland: $26,649 worth of rolling mill parts.
 To Czechoslovakia: $16,770 worth of bearings of types and sizes listed as
 embargo items under the Battle Act.
 Molybdenum wire, tungsten wire and tungsten wire filaments, of a total value
 of $81,981, have been shipped from The Netherlands to Poland.
 These shipments were made under a 1947 agreement between a Dutch firm
 and the Polish Government, with the approval of TheNetherlands Government,
 providing for the Dutch firm to deliver certain electrical products intended-to
 be used as component parts for light bulbs and radio tubes.

 have been shipped to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria as follows:
 To Poland: $654,438 worth of metal-working machinery and electrical and
 electronic equipment; $1,008,873 worth of locomotive equipment and spare
 parts; and 59 gallons of lubricating oils valued at $41.
 To Czechoslovakia: $16,407 worth of radio relay equipment, electronic valves
 and wire.
 To Hungary: $5,334 worth of locomotive equipment and spare parts.
 To Bulgaria: $1,154 worth of locomotive equipment and spare parts.
 The above-mentioned locomotive equipment and spare parts shipments were
 made during a period of thirteen months.  This equipment, though previously
 included on the Battle Act Title I List, Category B, is now covered by the Title
 II List.
 These countries have for almost five years cooperated closely in controlling
 strategic shipments to the Soviet bloc.  The fact that each country makes an
 important contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the fact
 that U. S. aid to these countries is largely military aid, enabling these countries
 to meet their NATO obligations and enhancing the security of the free world,
 including the U. S., leads to the conclusion that the U. S., in its own security
 interest, should not terminate aid.
 Respectfully yours,
 HAROLD E. STASSEN,
 Director of Foreign Operations.
 On June 30, 1955, the following letter was sent to the six Congres-
 sional Committees named in the Battle Act.                                                                                   At the same time,
 public notification of this determination was made through press
 release 397.

 WASHINGTON 25, D. C., June 30, 1955.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The President on June 28, 1955, determined, pursuant
 to Section 103 (b) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 that
 United States aid be continued to France, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany,
 and the United Kingdom because the cessation of such aid would be' clearly
 detrimental to the security interests of the United States.  The President, in his
 letter to me directing that aid be continued, has also directed that, in compliance
 with the reporting requirement of Section 103 (b) of the Mutual Defense Assistance
 Control Act of 1951, I inform you of his determination, to which purpose this
 letter, with attachments, is sent.
 Sincerely yours,
 HAROLD E. STASSEN,
 Director of Foreign Operations.
 The following letter, dated June 28, 1955, which recommended to
 the President the continuance of aid to France, Italy, the Federal
 Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom, was attached to the
 above transmittal.

 FOREIGN OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION
 OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
 WASHINGTON 25, D. C., June 28, 1955.
 THE PRESIDENT OF TILE UNITED STATES.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It is my duty to report herewith certain additional
 shipments of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc from countries receiving
 United States assistance, and to recommend that you continue this assistance to
 the countries involved since in each case the cessation of aid would clearly be
 detrimental to the security of the United States.
 The countries involved are France, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, and
 the United Kingdom.  On the advice of Vice Admiral Walter S. DeLany, my
 Deputy Director for Mutual Defense Assistance Control, concurred in by the
 Depaitments of State, Defense, Commerce, and Treasury, I recommend that you
 make a Determination to continue aid to these countries pursuant to Section
 103 (b) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle Act).
 Section 103 (b) forbids all military, economic, and financial assistance to a
 country that knowingly permits the shipment of items listed for embargo under
 the Act, except that the President "may direct the continuance of such assistance
 to a country which permits shipments of items other than arms, ammunition,
 implements of war, and atomic energy materials when unusual circumstances
 indicate that the cessation of aid would clearly be detrimental to the security
 of the United States."
 With the exception of a small quantity of items to service certain non-strategic
 equipment previously shipped to a bloc country, all of the shipments reported
 in this letter were "prior commitments"-made prior to either January 25, 1952,
 the effective date of the Battle Act embargo provisions or August 25, 1954, the
 date of revision of the lists.  The prior commitment problem has been fully
 discussed in communications to the Congress on a number of occasions.  Most
 of the original prior commitments have been removed from the books, either by
 deliveries or by cancellation of certain shipments.  The remaining amount is
 still scheduled for shipment.   The August list revision resulted in the removal
 from the control lists of some of these items which fall outside of certain speci-
 fications.  The addition of new items to the lists have resulted in the creation of
 new "prior commitments" with respect to certain previously uncontrolled items.
 My recommendation that aid be continued in the present cases does not grow
 out of the recent revisions of the security trade control program.  The circum-
 stances of these cases are very similar to previous cases wherein a determination
 that aid be continued was made.  None of the cases involved shipments of arms,
 ammunition, implements of war, or atomic energy materials.  Following is a
 summary of the shipments which were permitted and which have not been
 covered by any previous Presidential Determination with respect to these four
 countries:
 Prior-commitment items worth $180,087 have been shipped by France as
 follows:
 To Poland: $179,680 worth of boring machines, gas liquifying and petroleum
 equipment, automotive parts, and tires.
 To Czechoslovakia: $407 worth of tires.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/30 : CIA-RDP61S00527A000100180118-8
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic shipped to Poland as a prior commitment, one measuring
 instrument valued at $400.
 Prior commitment items worth $298,325 were shipped by the United Kingdom
 as follows:
 To Poland: $227,556 worth of mercury and vacuum pump equipment.
 To Hungary: $66,759 worth of magnets.
 To the USSR: $4,010 worth of scientific equipment.
 In addition to the prior commitments reported above, the United Kingdom
 shipped $443 worth of bearings, lubricants and valves to Communist China for
 the servicing of non-embargo equipment previously supplied.  These shipments
 were made by the United Kingdom-after prior consultation in CHINCOM, the
 international committee for the control of strategic trade with Communist China,
 in which the U. S. participates.
 These countries have for over five years cooperated closely in controlling strate-
 gic shipments to the Soviet bloc.  The fact that each country makes an important
 contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the fact that U. S.
 aid to these countries is largely military aid, enabling these countries to meet
 their NATO obligations and enhancing the security of the free world, including
 the U. S., leads to the conclusion that the U. S., in its own security interest, should
 not terminate aid.

 HAROLD E. STASSEN,
