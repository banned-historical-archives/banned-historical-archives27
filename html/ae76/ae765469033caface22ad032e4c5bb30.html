THE 24TH CPSU CONGRESS  
The Main Issues  
In the five-year interval between the 23rd CPSU Congress 
March 1966 and the forthcoming 24th Congress, the essentially 
unchanged:Brezhnev-Kosygin leadership has presided over a 
steadily deteriorating internal situation and a severe 
erosion of its authority in the international Coliumnist move-
ment, while continuing to pursue its expansionist foreign 
policy. 
Whatever Brezhnev strikes as the keynote on domestic 
developments in his main address to the Congress, the real 
keynote is "stagnation." The economy has been c;teadily 
slowing down, falling further and further behind that of 
its chief rival, the U.S.. The ever expanding technological 
gap is severe and a matter of special distress to Soviet 
scientists. The Soviet consumer has long since been 
convinced that improvement of his lot is at best mere oratory. 
Even the 'members of the Soviet privileged class, the Communist 
Party, knowing the meaninglessness of the Party's ideological 
slogans, reserve their best efforts for in-fighting for 
personal position in the Party bureaucracy. The only place 
the Soviet leaders see any significant and positive movement 
is in the demands for change made by the scientific and 
literary-artistic intelligentsia. And here the leadership's 
only concern is to snuff out this small sign of life in 
the Soviet body politic. 
In 1966, the Soviet leaders were just beginning to face 
the phenomenon of serious, open challenge to their leadership 
of the world Communist movement, occasioned by the outbreak 
of the-Sino-Soviet ideological conflict. In the intervening 
years, they have seen this situation deteriorate to a shooting 
war on the Sino-Soviet border. By August 1968 they were 
frightened into mounting a full-scale invasion of Czechoslovakia, 
provoking condemnation by the so-called "capitalist" world, 
and by important Communist parties and individuals from France 
to Venezuela to Australia. As in the case of internal dissent, 
international Communist dissent provicb some of the most telling 
criticism of the essential weaknesses of the Soviet system.

In the 1966 Congress, the leadership was still able to 
speak plausibly (but just barely so) about the solidarity of 
the world Communist movement and Soviet leadership of it. It 
will be interesting to see the verbal gymnastics required to 
maintain the fiction in 1971. 
Meanwhile, the Soviet leadership pursues a foreign policy 
of cautious expansionism, employing a variegated arsenal of 
tools -- smiling diplomacy here, gunboat diplomacy there, 
offering "innocuous" trade and aid deals here, stepping up 
KGB agent infiltration there -- all the while protesting its 
desire for peace, but doing nothing visible to advance it, 
as it might in Vietnam and the Middle East. Even in a case 
like West Germany, where the Soviets seemed to negotiate 
d?nte seriously (as a step to dislodge the U.S. from 
Europe and to tap West Germany's valuable economic and 
technological resources), they permit (or urge) East German 
boss Walter Ulbricht to keep the pot boiling by harassment 
of access to Berlin. 
Expansion of its worldly dominion has been an essential 
ingredient of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union since 
the beginnings -- not least because Marxist-Leninist dialectic 
ideology poses neverending conflict in some form with non-Communist 
entities as the natural way of international life. The forth-
coming Congress will clothe the usual Communist prophecy 
of victory for Communism and defeat for "capitalism" in 
typical:verbiage for those who would believe it. More 
knowledgeable observers will be searching behind the rhetoric 
fdr signs that the Soviet Union intends to make a genuine 
contribution to world peace.

March 1971 
Party Congresses - What Are They?  
Congresses are technically the Soviet Cohmumist Party's 
supreme ratifying body, but in actuality they have became 
purely ceremonial gatherings to give the rubber stamp of 
approval to previously agreed upon decisions. Party statutes 
require that a Congress be held every four years, but they 
seldom are. They are large affairs. The 23rd Congress, 
for example, was attended by 4,942 voting delegates and 323 
consultative delegates and by delegations from 36 foreign 
parties, in all a gathering of about 6,000 persons. At 
the fortheoming Congress, as at the 23rd Congress, the 
assemblage will approve General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev's 
report on Party stewardship, will approve Premier Alexei 
Kosygin's report on the new five-year economic development 
plan for the years 1971 through 1975, and will elect the 
leading party organs -- the Central Committee, the Presidium 
(Politburo) of the Central Committee, and the Secretariat 
of the Central Committee. Anything else? Whether or not 
any important changes in policy are to emerge remains to be 
seen. Given the present leadership's unimaginative conser-
vatism, the 24th Congress is likely to be a pretty dull affair. 
By way of contrast, some quite significant and often 
spectacular policy pronouncements have came out of some of 
the more recent congresses: 
20th Party Congress - February 1956: Khrushchev's 
"secret" denunciation oi Stalin on the Congress's closing 
day was the most far-reaching and shattering expose of the 
dictator's political leadership ever made and set off 
reverberations which eventually led to the Hungarian uprising 
of that fall. In a development closely linked with his 
rejection of much of the Stalinist legacy, Khrushchev an-
nounced doctrinal changes which promised more flexibility 
for Soviet diplomacy. Specifically, he declared that Lenin's 
dictum on the inevitability of war with the imperialists no 
longer applied. The Chinese Communists, with some justifi-
cation, Call the 20th Congress the "revisionist" Congress, 
and the seeds of Sino-Soviet discord were certainly well 
fertilized at this gathering. The 20th Congress also 
breathed new life into the old Stalinist concept of "peace-
ful coexistence" by emphasizing the possibility of a 
peaceful transition to socialism, and by discovering a 
"zone of peace" in the Third World where Moscow could seek

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
to expand its influence through more flexible diplomacy and 
cooperation with neutralist forces. 
21st Party Congress - January-February 1959: Khrushchev 
had survived the major political attack on his stewardship 
in June 1957 and managed to rout his opponents, who hence-
forth were called the "Anti-Party Group" (Molotov, Malenkov, 
et al). The political castigation of members of the Anti-
Party Group continued at the 21st Congress, but calls to 
expel some of the group's leaders were fruitless. In many 
respects, the Congress was a propaganda triumph for Khrush-
chev, who delivered the main report and outlined an ambitious 
program to overtake the U.S. in the production of certain 
key commodities at the end of the Seven-Year Plan, 1959-
1965. 
22nd Party Congress - October 1961: By this time there 
were definite signs that Khrushchev had already passed the 
peak of his rule in some respects. Problems were mounting 
in agriculture, which began to stagnate in 1958 after five 
years of rising output; proposals for further reorganization 
of the countryside had been rebuffed despite Khrushchev's 
apparent sponsorship. However, Khrushchev vigorously re-
sumed the offensive at the Congress against his internal 
political opposition and mounted a ringing attack against 
Stalin's excesses. (That was the Congress during which 
Stalin's body was removed from the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum 
and reburied in the Kremlin wall.) The Anti-Party Group 
was heavily condemned at the Congress, but variations 
in leadership attitudes toward Group members cropped up 
during the Congress speeches. Khrushchev reaffirmed the 
1956 planks of peaceful coexistence, non-inevitability of 
war, and the possibility of a peaceful "parliamentary" 
transition to socialism. The Sino-Soviet dispute flared 
up publicly when Chou En-lai walked out at mid-Congress and 
went home, but not without first having laid a wreath on 
Stalin's grave, just before the body was moved. 
23rd Party Congress - March-April 1966: The ouster 
of Khrushchev in October 1964 was followed by the repeal 
of many of his innovations in agriculture and his system 
of regional economic councils was replaced by recentralizat-
ion of economic administration. The de-Stalinization cam-
paign was halted and actually reversed as a gradual and 
selective campaign for his rehabilitation was initiated--
i.e. Stalin's "excesses" were ignored while his record as 
a wartime leader was refurbished. Otherwise, the 23rd 
Congress, the first under the Brezhnev-Kosygin team, was 
marked by few surprises. Brezhnev stressed coexistence with

the West, and orthodoxy in the face of allegedly anti-
Soviet. literary and cultural tendencies within the USSR. 
Kosygin presented the 5-year plan for 1966-1970 and reported 
that the program of industrial reorganization reform, which 
Kosygin had launched in October 1965, was burgeoning. A 
bland gathering. 
24th Party Congress - March-April 1971: A hint of what 
form the impending 24th Congress might take was given by a 
political writer, N. Kuzmin, in an article he authored for 
Kollununist (the main CPSU theoretical journal), May 1970. 
Kuzmin suggested that the 9th Congress of 1920 -- when 
Lenin defeated all the groups opposed to the existing leader-
ship would be the model for 1971. What Kuzmin over-
looked, was that at the 10th Party Congress, only a year later, 
Lenin Was compelled by events to introduce a market economy 
in the, form Of the "New Economic Policy." Could history 
repeat. itself? 
The statutory requirement for quadrennial party con-
gresses has not been observed during the last quarter 
century, and 1970 was no exception. The March-April 
1970 deadline for the 24th Congress was apparently over-
shadowed by the Lenin centennial celebration in April. 
But the primary cause for the 12-month postponement of 
this impending Congress is probably accounted for by 
difficulties in formulating the new 5-year economic = 
development plan, and its unveiling promises to be the 
main event of this Congress.

LE MONDE, Paris 
29 January 1971 
CPYRGHT PREPARATIONS FOR 24TH CPSU CONGRESS REACH DECISIVE PHASE 
Preparations for the Soviet CP's 24th Congress moved into their most 
important phase this week with the start of the party's regional conferences. 
These assemblies will choose the delegates who will attend the Congress, and 
it is here that the real issues that will be debated in Moscow will get their 
first airing. 
The party's regional conference is itself the culmination of a lengthy 
process. It all begins with meetings of the rank-and-file "base organiza-
tions," meaning the party sections in the factories, on the irollectivx  Zarms,_ 
the institutes, etc. . On this level, the party structure is based on 'voca-
tional groupings. The members of a "base organization" hear 'a report on 
the work of their leadership committee, elect a new bureau, an;d appoint 
their delegates to a district conference. The district conference is a 
geographical grouping. It too hears a report from its leader" elects new 
ones, and names its delegates to the regional conference. 
The same pattern continues at the regional conference, which elects 
delDgates to the Congress. According to the Central Committee directives 
published after the Plenum of 13 July 1969, there will be one voting dele-
gate for every, 2,900 party members, and one non-voting delegate for every 
2,900 "trainees," or candidates for party membership. This makes around 
5,000 people who will be coming together on 30 March in the Congress Palace 
in Moscow. 
The general pattern allows for a number of exceptions. It applies to 
? the entire Federation of Russia, as is. It is somewhat modifpd in the 
other federated republics. Each of them -- but not the RSFS1_-- actually 
holds its own congress a few weeks prior to the Onion Congress. Sometimes 
the delegates to the Moscow conference are chosen by these congresses. 
Delegates for the party members in the Ukraine, in Byelorussia, in 
Uzbekstan, and in Kazakistan, however, are elected by the regional confer-
ences, but this does not prevent each of these republics from holding their 
own congresses to elect their new leaders. In addition, some cities have 
special status equivalent to that of districts or even regions. Moscow 
and Leningrad are two such. With its 300 or so delegates, the capital's 
regional representation at the Congress will be second in size only to the 
one from the Ukraine. 
Waiting for the 5?Year Plan Directives  
Getting this gigantic machinery into motion was not achieved 
without some grinding of gears. Last year, on 13 April, Mr Brezh?
nev announced that the Congress would be held before the end of 
1970, and on several occasions thereafter he repeated that pledge. 
Then on 13 July the Central Committee decided that the Congress 
would be held "in March 1071." The 30 March date was not set until 
the last Plenum of the CC on 7 December.

Delay in drafting the outline for the next 5?year Plan un?
doubtedly had something to do with the delay in preparations for 
the Congress. In December, authoritative and reliable sources said 
that the directives would be published in January, but today there 
is talk of possible further delay. 
There would be nothing exceptional, for that *atter, about 
such a delay. The directives for the 8th Plan (19664.1970) were 
not approved by the OU until 19 February 1966, when he 5?Year Plan 
was already being implemented, and less than 40 days before the 
opening of the 23rd Party Congress on 29 March. 
Preparing for a Congress is.like building a pyramid in which 
the summit governs the position of every element in the base. It 
is in this sense that some have claimed that democracy operates in 
reverse within the party, since a regional conference is shaped and 
oriented primarily.by the objectives laid down by -40 political 
bureau and the Central Committee office in Moscow. 
There is a good deal of truth in this image, Iti'Ut it fails to 
take sufficient account of the diversity of undercurtents within 
the party, all of which find a prime opportunity fon;expressing 
their views during preparations for a Congress. Furthermore, no 
matter how monolithic the Soviet leadership may be, it is no less 
reasonable to assume that it does contain conflicting ambitions, and 
that each leader hopes to get his men into the party apparatus. 
Recruiting ?C2L-tialikeltupsn sgenciad. 
Symptoms of a behind?the?scenes struggle are Otill not very 
visible, it is true, at least according to what we blow about the 
meetings that have been held thus far. 
There is, however, one sign that the advantage at present 
lies with what might be termed the "conservatives:" the instruc?
tions handed out several months ago in connection with party re?
cruiting. We would point out that no "intellectual," in the broad 
sense of the term, has been permitted to join the party since last 
summer. The primary purpose of this move is to increase the per?
centage of factory workers, laborers, anc collective farm people 
in the organization. In 1966 the Soviet OP's rolls showed 37.3 
percent laborers and 16.5 percent collective farm workers. It 
would also appear that this was an effort to bar party membership, 
at least for a while, to such elements as might be least likely to 
go along quietly with orders from the top. 
The first impression one gets from what is known of the re?
sults of the preliminary meetings is one of great stability. Here 
and there, a first secretary was ousted. This is what happened 
to the first secretary of the party for the city of Sverdlovsk, 
who was "retired" at the age of 60, a move which leaves little 
doubt that he was actually fired.

At the regional conferences, the changes in leadership chan?
ges were infrequent, most of them understandable on the bases of 
administrative considerations (creation of new organizations, a 
shift from one office to another, and the like). The same sort of 
stability was also apparent in the rank and file organizations. 
The Central Committee magazine Partinaya Jizn reports that in 145 
of these groups the work of the bureau was deemed unbatisfaotory, 
and that 464 secretaries were not re?elected. These figures are 
very low, when you consider that there are more thaA 300,000 ',base" 
organizations in the party (312,000 in 1966 just before the 23rd 
Congress). 
What kind of delegates will be sent to the Congress? Ac?
cording to the statutes, they are elected by secret ballot. It 
goes without saying that the election will faithfully reflect the 
choices made previously by the higher?ups. But this choice is it?
self the subject of considerable discussion within the apparatus. 
The regional, conference actually amounts to a committee chosen to 
draw up the list of candidates. It is here, in this commission, 
that the decisions are made. Sitting on it are not only the party 
bosses for the region, but also a'number of leading non?political 
figures -- the heads of big industrial concerns, directors of the 
various institutes, chairman of leading collective farms, etc. --
whose opinions are taken into consideration. The list drawn up 
by these notables is then approved by the conference. Sometimes 
there is some sharp bargeining, not to mention shrevia horse?trad?
ing. And so it is at this level that the Congress Is "made," and 
this is where whatever small shifts in the incumbeni apparatus the 
notables feel desirable are performed. 
Economic Issues and the Stalin Matter  
Reports in the Soviet press give the impression that econo?
mic issues loom very large in the current debates. 4Each organiza?
tion's performance is assessed primarily on the bests of the way 
it has implemented the directions and resolutions of the Central 
Committee as handed down in December 1969 and July 1970. There is 
much talk of productivity, labor discipline, and even of the use of 
fertilizer and the quality of seed. At the same time, though, 
there is talk of "ideological work" and of relations within the 
party. Sometimes "shortcomings" are reported, or there are com?
plaints about the "inertia" of organizations that pass a great many 
resolutions but show very little concern with implementing them. 
On the whole, though, these criticisms are merely rehashes of those 
that appear regularly in the editorial columns of Pravda and other 
party organs. 
Nevertheless, the signs of a deeper debate are beginning to 
emerge, however indirectly. As it did on the eve of the 23rd Con?
gress, the use of Stalin's name is the touchstone by which we can 
distinguish between what might be called the conservatives and the 
progressives. The name cropped up in 196,6 in several reports from 
the meetings of the party in Georgia. This year, the Moldavian CP

newspaper, in its 16 January issue, opened fire by stating that in 
his article on "Marxism and the National Question" Stalin had pro?
vided a definition amounting to "a generalization of all Karl Marx, 
Frederich Engels, and V.I. Lenin ever said about the fundamental 
features of the nation." The reference is an important one, be?
cause it tends to restore to Stalin the role of THE communist theor?
etician which the 20th Congress had taken away from him. 
This is not surprising in Moldavia, where the first party 
secretary, Mr 1.1. Bodioul, has a long?standing reputation as a 
Stalinist. Such language, for the time being, at least, would be 
unthinkable in the central party press, but it is beyond any doubt 
that serious pressure is being brought to bear within the party, 
perhaps not so much for a return to Stalinist concepts -- which are 
in any case too outmoded for use under present?day conditions --
as for a rejection of the more or less liberal experiments tried 
since the death of' the dictator under Mr Khrushchevfs regime. This 
is the issue that is going to dominate the 24th Congress. It is 
still to early to assess the balance of forces that will clash on 
this ground, or to distinguish the positions on which the men and 
factions classified perhaps too summarily as "Stalinists" and "anti?
Stalinists" will actually cross swords.

Today's Leadership and Prospects of the Soviet System  
A remarkable consensus prevails among the better qual-
ified observers of Soviet affairs concerning the leadership 
of the country and the trend of development (or more pre-
cisely, :the non-development) in the Soviet system. Many 
have noted the advanced age of the 11-man committee known 
as the Politburo which collectively determines every major 
policy Of the country (see the attached list of Politburo 
members 1which shows all but three in their 60's or over). 
Along with their advanced age, the leaders suffer from what 
these observers variously describe as cautiousness, 
conservatism, narrowness, spiritual "sclerosis," intellec-
tual mediocrity, colorlessness, immobility, fearfulness, 
and other such infirmities. Ironically, there may be some 
tomfort.,for the rest of the world in the thought that these 
very characteristics may be a blessing in terms of peace --
for all their lack of imagination, the Soviet leaders appar-
ently appreciate the fact that a head-on military clash 
with Western military power would mean that they themselves, 
as well as whatever they stand for or try to achieve in 
their own country, -would be utterly destroyed. Apart 
from that, the future is a cheerless prospect for the 
Soviet peoples under such leadership. 
After some seven years in power, the current leader-
ship seems to have transmitted its own immobility to the 
society over which it rules. It is becoming more widely 
recogniZed throughout the world that, far from being the 
progressive, productive, modern system it claims to be, 
the whole Soviet system of economics, of politics, of 
ideology and intellectual life is obsolescent, has reached 
an impasse, and where it goes from here is the subject of 
considerable debate among informed scholars. Whether it 
will degenerate, reform, or suffer revolutionary upheaval 
are some of the alternatives. (A thoughtful essay reflecting 
on the nature of the Soviet system and its leadership by 
Zbignieii Brzezinski, "Soviet Political System: Trans-
formatiOn or Degeneration?" is attached.) 
A balance sheet of Soviet domestic and foreign gains 
and losses would show a serious minus between 1966 and 
1971. In fact, the minus is so plain that one wonders how 
the 11-man Politburo can go on endorsing the stewardship 
of Brezhnev and Kosygin. While signs are few that the 
Congress will produce any major change in leadership

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
alignments (i.e. purges or a palace coup), anything is 
possible in the conspiratorial world of high Soviet 
politics. The logic of the situation from the free world 
point of view would seem to require a change in the leader-
ship to inject an innovative dynamism in some direction 
away from dead center. "Khrushchevism" would be one 
answer -- and some respectable Sovietologists have specu-
lated that the appearance of the Khrushchev Remembers book 
in the West may have been a deliberate effort by one or 
more highly placed Soviets to force the issue and bring 
new movement into Soviet society. 
However, the logic of the situation as seen from 
the outside world is not apt to matter. It is more likely 
that the "logic" prevalent in the leadership is that of 
self-preservation, which primarily means continuation of the 
"status quo." This fundamental attitude of increasing 
reliance upon and utilization of Stalinist norms holds 
little promise for progress in Soviet policies or leadership. 
That Stalinism versus Khrushchevism may be an issue 
at this time is revealed by what could be the tip of a 
substantial iceberg of underlying contention within Party 
circles. The tip first showed itself in the semi-public 
statement of a Soviet diplomat in Prague deploring 
Khrushchevism and promising a revival of Stalinism, and 
then in the public praise of Khrushchev by the former 
Deputy Minister of Defense Grigoriy Bagramyan in his 
recently published memoirs (see the attached news accounts).

WHO'S WHO IN THE POLITBURO  
OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CPSU 
Brezhnev, Leonid Ilich (born 1906) 
A member of the USSR Supreme Soviet since 1950, Brezhnev was one 
of Khrushchev's close associates and rose to prominence as a Party 
leader in the Ukraine. By 1949 he had been elected a member of the 
Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party. In 1950, he took 
over in Moldavia as Party First Secretary when the _Moldavian Party 
was under fire for its handling of agricultural production. In the 
mid 1950's, Brezhnev did much to promote Khrushchev's Virgin Lands 
Campaign while serv,ing as First Secretary of the Kazakhstaiommunist 
Party. By May 1960, Brezhnev replaced Voroshilov as President of the 
USSR and after Khrushchev's ouster, became Party General Secretary. 
? Like Khrushchev, Brezhnev has made agriculture his personal 
responsibility. He has promoted increased capital investments and 
financial incentives to stimulate above-plan production. Yet, he 
continues to favor the brigade system of farming although he acknow-
laaged the important contribution of the farmers' private plots. 
? J. 
During the 1968 crisis over Czechoslovakia, Brezhnev was the 
central figure at all the meetings of the Soviet Politburo with the 
Czechoslovak leadership at which the Russians sought to dissuade 
Dubcek and his colleagues from carrying out their liberalization 
program. Reported to have had reservations about military inter-
vention in Czechoslovakia, he eventually sanctioned the 21 August 
invasion 
In November, 1968, Brezhnev attended in Wai-saw the Fifth Congress 
of the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party, at which he expounded 
his "doctrine of limited sovereignty" (the "Brezhnev_Doctrine") where-
by the USSR reserves the right to interfere in the internal affairs 
of a Communist State where she considers "Socialism" to be "threatened." 
The doctrine lays down that the defense of "Socialism" is the common 
international duty of all "Socialist" countries, and that the sovereignty 
of the Socialist system takes precedence over State sovereignty. The 
doctrine was reflected in the new Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty, signed 
by Brezhnev and Kosygin in Prague in May 1970. 
In domestic affairs, Brezhnev has presided over the rehabilitation 
of Stalin as a war leader and "major theoretician." This has been 
accompanied by the introduction of repressive measures against dissident 
intellectuals and national minority groups, and a general tightening 
of party, State and labor discipline. He has built up Soviet military 
strength, and appealed to Soviet patriotic feelings.

Kirilenko worked with Khrushchev in the Ukraine as a Party 
organizer and awed his promotion to high party office to Khrushchev's 
patronage. He held high posts in the Ukrainian Party organization, 
was elected to the CPSU Central Committee in 1956 and by 1966, 
became the Central Committee Secretary. Kirilenko has headed state 
delegations throughout East Europe, visited Latin America, and attend-
ed both Italian and French Party Congresses. Kirilenko is often 
lined up with the more orthodox of the Politburo members such as 
Shelest, Polyansky, et al. 
Kosygin, Aleksei Nikolaevich (born 1904) 
Kosygin, who replaced Khrushchev as Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers in October 1964, has for many years been regarded as one 
of the most experienced and able economic administrators in the 
Soviet leadership.. His connection with the Communist Part dates 
from 1927; his membership in the Politburo, from 1960. Kosygin 
went with Khrushchev on his 1960 state visit to France and since 
1964 has headed nearly every significant Soviet delegation going 
abroad. 
At the September 1965 party plenum, Kosygin introduced important 
reforms of the economic administration, seeking to combine central 
ministerial control of industry with fewer restrictions on factory 
managers. The whole of Soviet industry was to adopt the new system 
by the end of 1968. This target was not achieved, but by iid-1970 
40,000 enterprises, accounting for 92 percent of industri4 output, 
were said to have gone over to the new system. The reforM has not 
brought the hoped-for results. 
Kosygin is believed to have had reservatibns about military 
intervention by Soviet and,other Warsaw Pact forces in CzecAoslovakia 
in August 1968, although he distrusted her liberal reforms on 
ideolcgtal grounds. According to some reports he even declared 
against intervention at the crucial CPSU meeting at which the signal 
for invasion was given. 
In 1969, he paid a visit to Pakistan in an evident effort to 
counter-balance Chinese influence in Karachi. In May 1970, he called 
his first Moscow Press conference since succeeding Khrushchev in 1964 
and, accusing the USA of wanting to become the "international gendarme," 
rejected a British initiative seeking a fresh Geneva conference on 
Indo-China. He also revealed his sensitivity to Western speculation 
about possible changes in the Soviet leadership. 
Mazurov, Kirill Trofimovich (born 1914) 
Mazurov, son of a peasant, worked his way up in Belorussian 
politics, in the Republic where he was born, and by 1956 had become 
Party First Secretary. He became a member of the CPSU Central 
Committee in 1956 and a full member of the Politburo in 1965. 
At the October 1965 Supreme Soviet session, Mazurov was the one who 
presented the plans for economic reform which Kosygin had spelled out 
for a Central Committee plenum a few days earlier. Mazurov has

travelled extensiyely in East Europe and has been to Finland, 
Sweden, Belgium, and New York. 
Pelshe, Arvid Yanovich (born 1899) 
Born a Latvian, Pelshe's formative years were spent in Russia. 
(Ifter Russian annexed Latvia in 1940, Pelshe went "home" and gradually 
became a leading figure in the Latvian Communist Party, chiefly 
because of his efforts in the "Russification" of Latvia. Pelshe 
is beet known for him attacks on "bourgeoise nationalism" in Latvia, 
a subject on which he continues to be vocal. A.Politburo member 
since 1966, Pelshe has most recently been involved with the "watchdog" 
body of the Czechoslovak Communist Party now engaged in the normalization 
of that country. 
Podgorny, Nikolai Viktorovich (born 1903) 
Soviet President since 1965, Podgorny is an experience Party 
official who worked for many years in the Ukraine under Khrushchev. 
He has held various posts in the Ukrainian and Moscow Food Industry 
Ministries. He worked his way up in the Ukrainian Party to become 
its First Secretary in 1957; by 1960, he was a member of the CPSU 
Presidium (Politburo). At the November 1964 plenum, Podgorny 
reported on the dismantling of one of Khrushchev's more important 
reforms -- the merging of industrial and agricultural party organs 
which Khrushchev had divi,ded _in 1962. Podgorny's travels have 
been limited to East Europe and the Middle East. 
Suslov, Mikhail Andreevich (born 1902) 
Suslov is a leading Party theoretician and one of the most 
influential men in the Kremlin. He has been a permanent member 
of the CPSU Presidium (Politburo) since 1955 and is one of that 
bodies very few intellectuals. On the fringe of the leadership 
in Stalin's time, Suslov is still considered to be one of the most 
influential members of the Party leadership. He acts as the CPSU's 
top intermediary with Communist parties throughout the world. In 
aU of his top political posts and as head of Agitprop and editor 
of Pravda, Suslov has acted as the custodian of the Party's 
conscience, the liquidator of "deviationists" both Right and Left. 
He is the only member of the post -Khrushchev leadership to have 
made an explicit public reference to an "error" committed by Stalin. 
In recent years, Suslov is said to have suffered from recurring 
tuberculosis and a kidney complaint and to have been hospitalized 
several times. 
Voronov, Gennady Ivanovich (born 1910) 
An agricultural expert, Voronov has been a CPSU Central Committee 
member since 1952 and a full member of the Presidium (Politburo) 
since 1961. His rise to power is attributed to his known support 
for Khrushchev's agricultural policies and to his proved efficiency 
in regional management affairs. Voronov has travelled to New Zealand, 
Britain, and in East Europe. He is Chairman of the RSFSR Council

Soviet of the RSFSR openly supported the cause of specialist 
training in business management for everybody -- from Ministers 
to heads of workshops. In 1969, in another speech to the 
Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, he called for a greater role of the 
Soviets in local planning at the expense of Ministries. 
Polyansky, Dmitri Stepanovich (born 1917) 
Son of Ukrainian peasants, Polyansky had his early training in 
agriculture, was in the military in World War II, and then was 
selected for training at the higher Party School in Moscow, from 
which he was graduated in 1942. For 16 years Polyansky served in 
various regional party posts in Siberia, the Crimea, Chkalov, Krasnodar, 
and finally in the RSFSR. He has been a full member of the CPSU 
Presidium (Politburo) since 1960. Polyansky is often cited as 
the patron of'some of the pro-Stalin, anti-intellectual Soviet 
authors. 
Shelepin, Aleksandr.uikolaeyieb, (born 1918) 
Shelepin is one of the younger and more forceful members of 
the CPSU Politburo. He was one of the main beneficiaries oi the 
coup which overthrew Khrushchev in October, 1964. He became a full 
member of the party Presidium (later renamed Politburo) without 
having been a candidate-member. Shelepin had earlier served the 
party as a youth leader and as chief of the security police (KGB). 
From 1952-58, he was First Secretary of the Komsomol, responsible 
for moulding the rising generation in the party's image. Hp played 
a prominent part in reviving the anti-religious campaign amOng youth, 
becoming noted for his handling of "heretical", tendencies in the 
Komsomol -- "nihilism," hooliganism, drunkeness, etc. -- which_ 
reached their peak in 1956. "Nihilists" among students, young writers 
and intellectuals were expelled from the Komsomol on Shelepin's orders. 
In Mar 1958, Shelepin was appointed head of the Department for 
Party Organs of the Party Central Committee. In December 1958, 
he was made Chairman of the Committee of State Security, taking over 
from General Serov. 
At the December 1965 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev announced 
that the Control Committee would be reorganized and its functions 
curtailed. The reorganized body, the .P_copieri-Control Committee, was 
placed under one of Shelepin's former Deputies. Shelepin was also 
released from his post as Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of 
Ministers "in order to concentrate on work in the Central Committee 
of the CPSU," in his capacity as a member of the Secretariat, in 
which he assumed responsibility for the light and food industries. 
Shelepin's career received _a further setback when in July 1967 
he was made Chairman of the Aja-Union Central Council of Trade Unions 
(AUCCTU), a post of little political influence.

Shelepin formally relinquished his Central Committee secretaryship 
in September 1967. His political influence has also been undermined 
by the progressive removal of former associates of his from responsible 
posts. 
In March 1970 Shelepin was reported to have been ill and for 
nearly two months he was absent from the public scene. 
4 Shelest, Petr Efimovich (born 1908) 
Another Ukrainian of peasant origin, Shelest is now First Secretary 
of the Ukrainian Communist Party, a post he has held since 1963. He 
has been a CPSU Central Committee member since 1961 and after Khrushchev's 
ouster, he became a full member of the CPSU Politburo. Shelest has 
never travelled outside East Europe. 
He is an outspoken opponent of intellectual freedom at home and 
abroad and also of Ukrainian "bourgeois" nationalism. In 1969, he 
bitterly attacked China for her anti-Soviet propaganda and criticized 
the "aggressive" policies of the USA and the Federal Republic of 
Germany. In March 1970, in -a report to the 21st Congress of the 
Ukrainian Komsomol he emphasized the dangers of foreign pr ganda

EDITORS' NOTE: The essay below by Prof. Brzezinski represents a fundamental 
inquiry into the essential evolutionary processes of the Soviet political system. in 
our opinion, it deserves careful reading and discussion. Accordingly, we have asked 
a number of prominent scholars?historians, philosophers, sociologists, political 
analysts?to submit brief comments on Prof. Brzezinski's essay, as well as Son the 
articles in our recent .cymposium,"Progress and Ideology in the USSR" (Novem-
ber-December 1965). Replies will appear in forthcoming issues of this journal. 
_L._ he Soviet Union will soon celebrate its 
.:(:)zh anniversary. In this turbulent and rapidly 
:ging world, for any political system to sur-
:iv.: half a century is.an accomplishment in its 
right and obvious testimony to its dura-
iity. There are not many major political 
.zructures in the world today that can boast of 
:len longevity. The approaching anniversary, 
......ever, provides an appropriate moment for 
:?critical review of the changes that have taken 
place in the Soviet system, particularly in re-
gard to such critical matters as the character of 
izs top leadership, the methods by which its 
leaders acquire power, and the relationship of 
the Communist Party to society. Furthermore, 
the time is also ripe to inquire into the implica-
tions of these changes, especially in regard to 
the stability and vitality of the system. 
The Leaders 
Today Soviet spokesmen would have us be-
lieve that the quality of the top Communist 
leadership in the USSR has been abysmal. Of 
the 45 years since Lenin, according to official 
Soviet. history, power was exercised for au-
proximately five years by leaders subsequently 
unmasked as traitors (although later the charge 
of treason was retroactively reduced to that of 
deviation); for almost 20 years it was wielded 
by a paranoiac mass-murderer who irrationally 
slew his best comrades and ignorantly guided 
Approved For Release 1999/09/R2 
Soviet war strategy by pointing his hngcr at a 
globe; and, most recently, for almost ten years, 
by a "harebrained" schemer given to tantrums 
and with a propensity for wild organizational 
experimentation. On the basis of that record, 
the present leadership lays claim to representing 
a remarkable departure from a historical pat-
tern of singular depravity. 
While Soviet criticism of former party leaders 
is now abundant, little intellectual effort is ex-
pended on analyzing the implications of the 
changes in leadership. Yet that, clearly, is the 
impo.rtant question insofar as the political sys-
!.e:;) 
fAnin was a rare type of political leader, fus-
ing in his person several functions of key impor-
tance to the working of a political system: he 
acted as the chief ideologist of the system, the 
principal organizer of the party (indeed, the 
founder of the movement), and the top adminis-
trator of the state. It may be added that such 
personal fusion is typical of early revolutionary 
leaderships, and today it is exemplified by Mao 
Tse-tung. To his followers, Lenin was clearly a 
charismatic leader, and his power (like Hitler's 
or Mao Tse-tunqb's) depended less on institu-
tions than on the force of his personality and in-
tellect. Even after the Revolution, it was his 
personal authority that gave him enormous 
power, while the progressive institutionalization 
of Lenin's rule (the Cheka, the appearance of 
the apparat, etc.) reflected more the transfor-
mation of a revolutionary party into a ruling 
one than any significant change in the character 
of his leadership.

Lenin's biographers ' agree that here was a 
man characterized by total political commit-
ment, by self-righteous conviction, by.; tenacious 
determination and! by an outstanding ability to 
formulate intellectually appealing principles of 
political action as:well as popular slogans suit-
able tor mass consumption. He was a typically 
revoluti9nary figure, a man whose genius can be 
consummated only at that critical juncture in 
history when the new breaks off?and not just 
evolves?from the old. Had he lived a genera-
tion earlier, he probably would have died, in a 
Siberian taiga; a generation later, he probably 
would have been shot by Stalin. 
nder Stalin,! the fusion of leadership func-
tions was continued, but this was due less to his 
personal qualities 1 as such than to the fact that, 
with the passage Of time and the growing toll of 
victims, his power became nearly total and was 
gradually translated also into personal author-
ity. Only a mediocre ideologist?and certainly 
inferior in that respect to his chief rivals for

after Lenin's death, became invested in the 
Communist Party as a whole (much as the 
Pope at one timei acquired the infallibility that 
for a long time had rested in the collective 
church). But his: power was increasingly insti-
tutionalized bureaucratically, with decision-
making centralized at the apex within his own 
secret7iat, and its exercise involved a subtle 
balancing of thei principal institutions of the 
political system: the secret police, the party, 
the state, and the army (roughly in that order 
of importance). .:Even the ostensibly principal 
organ of power, the Politburo, was split into

ticipate in which subgroup and personally pro-
viding (and monopolizing) the function of 
integration. 
If historical parallels for Lenin are to be found 
among the revolutionary tribunes, .for. Stalin 
they are to be sought among the Oriental des-
pots.' Thriving on intrigue, shielded in mystery, 
and isolated from society, his immense power re-
flected the immense tasks he succeeded in im-
posing on his followers and subjects. Capitalizing 
'on the revolutionary momentum and the ideo-
logical impetus inherited from Leninism, and 
wedding it to a systematic institutionalization 
? of bureaucratic rule, he could set in motion a 
social and political revolution which weakened 
all existing institutions save Stalin's own secre-
tariat and his chief executive arm, the secret 
police. His power grew in proportion to the de-
gree to which the major established institutions 
declined in vitality and homogeneity.4 
The ,var, however, as well as the postwar re-
construction, produced a paradox. While Stalin's 
personal prestige and authority were further en-
hanced, his institutional supremacy relatively 
declined. The military establishment naturally 
grew in importance; the enormous effort to 
transfer, reinstall, and later reconstruct the in-
dustrial economy invigorated the state machin-
ery; the party apparat began to perform again 
the key functions of social mobilization and 
political integration. But the aging tyrant was 
neither unaware of this development nor appar-
ently resigned to it. The Byzantine intrigues 
resulting in the liquidation of the Leningrad 
leadership and Voznesenski, the "doctors' plot" 
With its ominous implications for some top 
party, military and police chiefs, clearly augured 
an effort to weaken any institutional limits on 
Stalin's personal supremacy..

the traditional priority Of heavy industry iind 
rt:storinc,? the primacy of the party. In fact, lie 
presided over the dismantling of Stalinism. He 
roklo to power by redwing tho predominant po-
sition of the party apparat. But the complex:-
ties of governing (as contrasted to the priorities 
of the power struggle) caused him to dilute the 
party's position. While initially he succeeded in 
. diminishing the political role of the secret police 
and in weakening the state machinery, the mili-
tary establishment grew in importance with the 
continuing tensions of the co1d'war.5 By the time 
Khrushchev was removed, the economic priori-
ties had become blurred because of pressures in 
agriculture and the consumer sector, while his 
own reorganization of the party into two separ-
ate industrial and rural hierarchies in November 
1962 went far toward undermining the party's 
homogeneity of outlook, apart from splitting it. 
Institutionally. Consequently, the state bureau--
cracy recouped, almost by default,-some of its 
integrative and administrative functions. Khru-
shchev thus, perhaps inadvertently, restored 
much of the institutional balance that had 
existed under Stalin, but without ever acquiring 
the full powers of the balancer. 
Khrushchev lacked the authority of Lenin to 
generate personal power, or the power of Stalin 
to create personal authority?and the Soviet 
leadership under him became increasingly dif-
ferentiated. The top leader was no longer the 
top ideologist, in spite of occasional efforts to 
present Khrushchev's elaborations as "a crea-
tive contribution to Marxism-Leninism." The 
ruling body now contained at least one profes-
sional specialist in ideological matters, and it 
was no secret that the presence of the profes-
sional ideologue was required because someone ? 
had to give professional ideological advice to the 
party's top leader. Similarly, technical-adminis-
trative specialization differentiated some top 
leaders from others. Increasingly Khrushchev's 
function?and presumably the primary source 
of his still considerable power?was that of pro-
viding political integration and impetus for new 
domestic or foreign initiatives in a political sys-
tem otherwise too complex to be directed and 
administered by one man: 
The differentiation of functions also made it 
more difficult for the top leader to inherit even 
the "routinized charisma" that Stalin had even-
tually transferred to himself from the party as 
a whole. Acquiring charisma was more difficult 
for a leader who (even apart from a personal 
style and vulgar appearance that did not lend 
themselves to image building") had neither the 
great "theoretical" flare valued by a movement 
that still prided itself on being the embodiment 
of a messianic ideology, nor the technical exper-
tise highly regarded in a state which equated 
technological advance with human progress. 
Moreover, occupying the posts of First Secre-
tary and Chairman of the Council of Ministers 
was not enough to develop a charismatic appeal 
since neither post has been sufficiently institu-
tionalized to endow its occupant with the special 
prestige and aura that, for example, the Presi-
dent of the ? United States automatically gains 
on assuming office. 
Trying to cope with this lack of charismatic 
appeal, Khrushchev replaced Stalin's former 
colleagues. In the process, he gradually came to 
rely on a younger generation of bureaucratic 
leaders to whom orderliness of procedure was 
instinctively preferable to crah carnoaiens. Ad-
ministratively, however, Khrushchev was a true 
product of the Stalinist school, with its marked 
proclivity for just such campaigns at the cost of 
all other considerations. In striving to develop 
his own style of leadership, Khrushchev tried to 
? emulate Lenin in stimulating new fervor, and 
Stalin in mobilizing energies, but without the 
personal and institutional assets that each had 
commanded. By the time he was removed, 
Khrushchev had become an anachronism in the 
new political context he himself had helped to 
create. 
rezhnev and Kosygin mark the coming to 
power of a new generation of leaders, irrespec-
tive of whether they will for long retain their 
present positions.? Lenin's, Stalin's, and Khru-
shchev's formative experience was the unsettled 
period of conspiratorial activity, revolution, and 
?in Khrushchev's case?civil war and the early 
phase of communism. The new leaders bene-
ficiaries of the revolution but no longer revolu-
tionaries themselves, have matuteri

established political setting in which the truly 
large issues of policy- and leadership have been 
decided. Aspiring young bureaucrats, initially 
promoted during the purges, they could obserye-
??but not suffer -from--:the debilitating conse-
quences of political extremism and unpredic-
table personal rule. TO this new generation of 
clerks, bureaucratic stability?indeed, bureau-
cratic dictatorship?must seem to be the only 
solid foundation for effective government. 
Differentiation of functions to these bureau-. 
crats is a. norm, while personal charisma is 
ground for suspicion. The new Soviet leadership, 
therefore, is both bureaucratic in style and es-
sentially impersonal in form. The curious em-
phasis on kolicktivr,ost rukovocittva (collec-
tivity of leadership) instead of the traditional 
kollektivnoe ritkovoclitvo (collective leader-
ship)?a change in formulation used immedi-
ately after Khrushchev's fall?suggests a cle? 
libo.rate effort at achieving not only a- personal 
but also an institutional collective leadership, 
designed to prevent any one leader from using a 
particular institution as a vehicle for obtaining 
political supremacy. 
. The question arises, however; whether this 
kind of leadership can prove effective in guiding 
the destiny of a major state. The Soviet system 
. is now led by a bureaucratic leadership from the 
very top to the bottom. In that respect, it is 
unique. Even political systems with highly de-
veloped and skillful: professional political bu-
reaucracies, such as the British, the French', or 
.that of the Catholic Church, have reseved some 
top policy-making and hence power-wielding 
positions for non-bureaucratic professional poli-
ticians, presumably .on the assumption that a 
free-wheeling, genetalizing and competitive 
political experience is of decisive importance in 
shaping effective national leadership. 
.To be sure, some top Soviet leaders no acquire 
such experience, even in the course of rising up 
the bureaucratic party ladder, especially when 
assigned to provincial or republican executive 
responsibilities. There they acquire the skills of 
initiative, direction, integration, .as well as ac-
commodation, compromise, and delegation of 
authority, which are the basic prerequisites for 
executive management of any complex organi-
zati;n. 
Nonetheless, even when occupying territorial 
'positions of responsibility, the apparatc.hila: are 
still part of an extremely centralized and rigidly 
hierarchical bureaucratic organization, increas-
ingly set in its ways, politically corrupted by 
years of unchali,-noed ,,ower an 
more&IPERYAMitiMMMIst'llOg 
case with a ruling body by its lingering and in-
creasingly ritualized doctrinaire tradition. It is 
relevant to note here (from observations made 
in Soviet universities) that the young men who 
become active in the Komsomol organization 
and are presumably ernbark.ing on a professional 
political career are generally the dull conform-
ists. Clearly, in a highly bureaucratized political 
setting, conformity, caution and currying favor 
with superiors count for more in advancing a 
political career than personal courage and indi-
vidual initiative.' 
Such a condition poses a long-range danger tn. 
the vitality of any political system. Social evolu-
tion, it has been noted, depends not only on the 
availability of creative individuals, but on the 
existence of clusters of creators who collectively 
promote social innovation. "The ability of any 
gifted individual to exert levb 
era,e within a so-
ciety . . . is partly a function of the exact com-
position of the group of those on whom he de-
pends for day-to-day interaction and for the 
execution of his plans."' The revolutionary 
milieu of the 1920's and even the fanatical 
Stalinist commitment of the 1930's fostered such 
clusters of intelleetual and political talent. It is 
doubtful that the CPSU party schools and the 
Central Committee personnel department en-
courage, in Margaret Mead's terms, the growth 
of clusters of creativity, and that is why the 
transition from Lenin to Stalin to KhrushcheV 
to Brezhnev probably cannot be charted by an 
ascending line. 
This has serious implications for the Soviet 
system as a whole. It is doubtful that any or-
ganization can long remain vital if it is so struc-
tured that in its personnel policy it becomes, 
almost unknowingly, inimical to talent and 
hostile to political innovation. Decay is bound 
to set in, while the stability of the political sys-
tem may be endangered, if other social institu-
tions succeed in attracting the society's talent 
and begin to chafe under the restraints imposed 
by the ruling but increasingly mediocre appa-
ratchiki. 
7 Writing about modern bureaucracy, V. A. Thompson 
(Modern Organization, New York, 1961, p. 91) observed : 
"In the formally structured group, the idea man is doubly 
dangerous. He endangers the established distribution of 
power and status, and he is a competitive threat to his 
peers. Consequently, he has to be suppressed." For a 
breezy treatment of some analogous experience, see also

degenerated into simple '.anarchy, and Stalin's 
power grew immeasurably because he effectively 
practiced the art of leadership according to his 
own definition: 
Jr ?Power 
The struggle for power in the Soviet political 
system has .certainly become less violent. The 
question is however: Has it become less debili-
tating for ;he political system? Has it become a 
more regularized process, capable of infusing the 
leadership with fresh blood? A closer look at 
the changes in the character of the competition 
for power may guide us to the answer. 
Both Stalin and Khrushchev rode to power by 
skillfully manipulating issues as well as by tak-
ing full advantage of the organizational oppor-
tunities arising from their tenure of the post of 
party First Secretary. It must be stressed that 
the manipulation of issues was at least as im-
portant to their success as the organizational 
factor, which generally tends to receive Priority 
in Western historical treatments. In Stalin's 
time, the issues facing the party were, indeed, on 
a grand scale: world revolution vs. socialism in 
one country; domestic evolution vs. social revo-
lution; a factionalized vs. a monolithic party. 
Stalin succeeded because he instinctively per-
ceived that the new apparatchiki were not pre-
pared to sacrifice themselves in futile efforts to 
promote foreign revolutions but?being for the 
most part genuinely committed to revolutionary 
ideals?were becoming eager to get on with the 
job of creating a socialist society. (Moreover, 
had the NEP endured another ten years, woulid 
the Soviet Union be a Communist dictatorship 
today?) 
Stalin's choice of socialism in one country was 
a brilliant solution. It captivated, at least in 
part, the revolutionaries; and it satisfied, at 
least partially, the accommodators. It split the 
opposition, polarized it, and prepared the ground 
for the eventual liquidation of each segment 
with the other's support. The violence, the ter-
ror, and finally the Great Purges of 1936-1938 
followed logically. Imbued with the Leninist 
tradition of intolerance for dissent, engaged in 
a vast undertaking of social revolution that 
taxed both the resources and the nerves of party 
members, guided by an unscrupulous and para-
noiac but also reassuringly calm leader, govern-
ing a backward country surrounded by neigh-
bors that were generally hostile to the Soviet 
experiment, and increasingly deriving its own 
membership strength from first-generation pro-
letarians with all their susceptibility to simple 
explanations and dogmatic truths, the ruling 
party easily plunged down the path of increas-
ing b rutliAlpp Fdissicii4zoibftltotiSeb1999Y6/02 ? CIA-RIDIP791.0171V4A001:1300420#0tV01940. r. 
that violence and controlled it. The terror never 10 338. 
The art of leadership is a serious matter. One 
must not lag behind the movement, because to 
do so is to become isolated from the masses. 
But neither must one rush ahead, for to rush 
ahead is to lose contact with the masses.l. e who 
wants to lead a movement and at the same time 
keep in touch with the vast masses must wage 
a fight on two fronts?against those who lag 
behind and. those who run ahead.? 
Khrushchev, too, succeeded in becoming the 
top leader because he perceived the elite's pre-
dominant interests. Restoration of the primary 
position of the party,.decapitation of the secret 
police, reduction of e privileges of the state 
bureaucrats while .maintaining the traditional - 
emphasis on heavy industrial development 
(which pleased both. the industrial elite and the 
military establishment.)?these were the issues. 
which Khrushchev successfully utilized in the . 
mid-1950's to mobil* the support of officials 
and accomplish the adual isolation and even-

But the analogy ends right there. The social 
and even the political system in which Khru-
shchev came to rule was relatively settled. In-
deed, in some .respects, it was stagnating, and 
Khrushchev's key problem, once he reached the. 
political apex (but before he had had time to 
consolidate his position there) was how to get 
the cbuntry moving again. The effort to infuse 
new social and political dynamism into Soviet 
society, even while consolidating his power, led. 
him to a public repudiation of Stalinism which 
. certainly shocked some officials; to sweeping 
economic reforms which disgruntled many ad-
ministrators; to a dramatic reorganization of 
the party which appalled the appareackiki; and 
even to an attempt to circumvent the policy-
making authority of the party Presidium, by 
means of direct appeals to interested groups, 
which must have both outraged and frightened 
his colleagues. The elimination of violence as 
the decisive instrumentality of political Compe-
tition?a move that was perhaps prompted by 
the greater institutional maturity of Soviet so-
ciety, and which was in any case made inevita-
ble by the downgrading of the secret police and

:hough anv struggle tends to exaggerate differ-
ences; the issues that divided Khrushchev from 
his opponents, though of great import, appear 
pedestrian in comparison to those over which 
Stalin and his enemies .crossed swords. In 
Khrushchev's case, they pertained primarily to 
policy alternatives; in the case of Stalin, they-in-
volved basic ?conceptions of historical develop-
ment. Compare the pot-Stalin debates about 
the allocation of resoUrces among different 
branches of the economy, for example, with the 
debates of the 1920's about the character and 
, 
pace of Soviet industrialization; or Khrushchev's 
homilies on the merits of corn?and . even his 
undeniably bold and controversial virgin lands 
campaignwith the dilemma of whether to col-
lectivize a hundred million ?reticent peasants, at 
what pace, and with what intensity in terms of 
resort to violence. 
It is only in the realm of foreign affairs that 
one can perhaps argue that grand dilemmas still 
impose themselves on the Soviet political scene. 
The nuclear-war-or-peace debate of the 1950's 
and early 1960's is' comparabk in many respects 
to- the earlier conflict over "permanent revolu-
ti(m" or "socialisrn in one country." Molotov's 
runoval and Kozlov's political demise .were to 
a large extent related to .disagreements concern-
ing foreign affairs; nonetheless, in spite of such 
?occasional rumblings, it would appear that on 
the peace-or-war issue there is today more of a 
consensus zi;nong the Soviet elite than there was 
on the issue of permanent revolution in the 
1920's. 'Although a wide spectrum of opinion 
does indeed exist in the international Commu-
nist movement on the crucial questions of war 
and peace, this situation, as far as one car; judge, 
'obtains to a considerably lesser degree in the 
USSR itself. Bukharin vs. Trotsky can be com-
pared to Togliatti vs. Mao Tse-tung, but hardly 
to Khrushchev vs. Kozlov.

In the earlier part of this discussion, some corn-
parative comments were made about Stalin, 
Khrushchev, and Brezhnev. It is even more 
revealing, however, to exainine their principal 
rivals. Take the men who opposed Stalin: Trot-
sky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin. What a range of 
political, historical, economic, and intellectual 
creativity, what talent, what a diversity of per-

The narrowing of the range of disagreement 
and the cooling of ideological passions mean also 
the wane of political violence. The struggle 
tends to become less a matter of life or death, 
and more one in which the price of defeat is 
simply retirement and sorne personal disgrace. 
In turn, with the routinization of conflict, the 
political system develops even a body of prece-
dents for handling fallen leaders. By now there 
must be a regular procedure, probably even

"counter-elite." After Khrushchev's fall, his suc-
cessors moved quickly to restore to important 
positions a number of individuals whom Khru-
shchev had purged," while some of Khrushchev's 
supporters were demoted and transferred. Al-
ready for a number of years now, it has been 
fairly common practice to appoint party offi-, 
cials demoted from high office either to diplo-
matic posts abroad or to some obscure, out-of-
the-way assignments at home. The total effect 
of this has been to create a growing body of offi- - 
cial "outs" who are biding their time on the ' 
sidelines and presumably hoping someday to : 
become the "ins" again. Moreover, they may i 
not only hope; if sufficiently numerous, young, 
-and vigorous, they may gradually begin to re-
semble somethinr, of a political alternative to 
those in power, and eventually to think and even 
act as such. This could be the starting .point of 
informal factional activity, of intrigues and 
conspiracies when things go badly for those in 
power, and of organized efforts to seduce some 
part of the ruling elite in order to stage an inter-
nal change of guard." In addition, the availa-
bility of an increasingly secure "counter-elite" 
is likely to make it more difficult for a leader to 
consolidate his power. This in turn might tend 
to promote more frequent changes in .the top 
leadership, with policy failures affecting the 
power of incumbents instead of affecting?only 
retroactively?the reputation of former leaders, 
as has hitherto been the case. 
The cumulative effect of these developments 
has been wide-ranging. First of all, the reduced 
importance of both ideological issues and per-
sonalities and the increasing weight of institu-
tional interests in the periodic struggles fot

compared with the situation under Stalin?tends 
to depersonalize political conflict and to make it 
a protracted bureaucratic struggle. Secondly, 
the curbing of violence makes it more likely that 
conflicts will be resolved by patched-up com-
promises rather than by drastic institutional 
redistributions of power and the reappearance 
of personal tyranny, Finally, the increasingly 
bureaucratic character of the strbggle for power 
tends to transform it into a contest among high-
level clerks and is therefore not conducive to 
attracting creative and innovating talent into 
the top leadership. 
Khrushchev's fall provides a good illustration 
of the points made above, as well as an impor-
tant precedent for the future. For the first time 
in Soviet history, the First Secretary has been 
toppled from power by, his associates. This was 
done not in order to tvlace him with an alter-
native personal leader'0 to pursue ,enuineIv al-
ternative goals, but in order to depersonalize the 
leadership and to pursue more effectively many 
of the previous policies. In a word, the objec-
tives were impersonal leadership higher bu-

however, also n-crais that personal intrigues and 
cabals can work, that,' subordinate members of 
the leadership?or possibly, someday, a group 
of ex-leaders?can effectively conspire against 
a principal leader, with the result that any fu-
ture First Secretary is bound to feel far less se-
cure than Khrushchev must have felt at the 
beginhing of October 1964. 
The absence of an institutionalized top execu-
tive officer in the Soviet political system, in con-
junction with the increased difficulties in the 
way of achieving personal dictatorship and the 
decreased personal cost of defeat in a political 
conflict, create a ready-made situation for group. 
pressures and institutional clashes. In fact, al-
. 
-though-the range of disagreement may have nar-
rowed, the scope of elite participation in power 
conflicts has already widened. Much of Khru-
shchev's exercise of power was preoccupied 
with mediating the demands of key institutions 
such as the army, or with overcoming the oppo-
sition of others, such as the objections of the, 
administrators to economic decentralization or 
of the heavy industrial managers to non-indus-
trial priorities. These interests were heavily in-
volved in the Khrushchev-Malenkov conflict 
and in the "anti-party" episode of 1957.

clashes take place in an, almost entirely amor-

and established procedures. The somewhat 
greater 'role played by the Central Committee 
in recent years still does not suflice to give this 
process of bureaucratic conflict a stable institu-
tional. expression. As far as we know from exist-
ing evidence, the Central Committee still acted

violence does .not, as is often assumed, automati-

In a stimulating study of political develop-
ment and decay, Samuel Huntington has argued 
that stable political growth requires a balance 
between political "institutionalization" and 
political "participation": that merely increasing 
popular mobilization and participation in poli-
tics without achieving a corresponding degree 
of "institutionalization of political organization, 
and procedures" results not in political develop-
ment but in political decay.l'i Commenting in 
passing on the Soviet system, he therefore noted 
that "a strong party is in the Soviet- public in-
terest" because it provides a stable institutional - 
framework."

The Soviet political system has certainly 
achieved a high index of institutionalization. 
For almost five decades the ruling party has 
maintained unquestioned supremacy over the 
society, imposing its ideology at will. Tradition-
ally, the Communist system has combined its 
high institutionalization with high pseudo-par-
ticipation of individuals." But a difficulty could 
ariso if division within the top leadership of rho 
political system weakened political "institution-
alization" while simultaneously stimulating 
genuine public participation by groups and in-
stitutions. Could this new condition be given 
an effective and stable institutional framework 
and, if so, with what implications for the 
"strong" party? 
Today the Soviet 'political system is again 
oligarchic, but its socio-economic setting is now 
quite different. Soviet society is far more de-
veloped and stable, far less malleable and at-
omized. In the pa4, the key groups that had 
to be considered as potential political partici-
pants were relatively few. Today, in addition to 
the vastly more entrenched institutional inter-
ests, such as the police, the military, and the 
state bureaucracy, the youth could become a 
source of ferment, the consumers could become 
more restless the collective farmers more re-
calcitrant, the scientists more outspoken, the 
non-Russian nationalities more demanding. Pro-
longed competition among the oligarchs would 
certainly accelerate. the assertiveness of such 
groups. 
" The massive campaigns launching "public discussions" 
that involve millions of people, the periodic "elections" 
that decide nothing, were designed to develop participation 
without threat to the institutionalized political organiza-
tion and procedures. The official theory held that as Com-
munist consciousness developed and new forms of social 
and public relations took root, political participation would

.2.1.....hrushchev's practice of holding enlarged 
Centrai Committee plenums, with representa-
tives of other groups present, seems to have 
be,l) a step towards formalizing a more regular 
comultative procedure. (It also had the politi-
ealiy expedient effect of bypassing Khru-
shchey's opponents in the central leadership.) 
Such enlarged plenums provided a consultative 
forum, where policies could be debated, views 
articulated, and. even some contradictory in-
terests resolved. Although the device still re-
mained essentially non-institutionalized and 
only ad hoc, Consultative and not legislative, 
Nril 1 subject to domination by the party a:pparat, 
it was nonetheless a response to the new quest 
for real participation that Soviet society has 
manifested and which the Soviet system badly 
needs. It was also a compromise solution, at-
tempting to wed the party's primacy to a pro-
cedure allowing group articulation. 
However, the problem has become much more 
complex and fundamental because of the organi-
zational and ideological crisis in the party over 
its relevance to the evolving Soviet system. For 
many years the party's monopoly of power and 
hence its active intervention in all spheres of 
Soviet life could indeed be said to be "in the 
Soviet' public interest." The party provided 
social mobilization, leadership, and a dominant 
outlook for a rapidly changing and developing 
society. But, in the main, that society has now 
taken shape. It is no longer malleable, subject 
to simple mobilization, or Susceptible to doctri-
naire ideological manipulation. 
As a result, Soviet history in the last few years 
has been dominated by the spectacle of a party 
in search of a role. What is to be the function of 
an ideocratic party in a relatively complex and 
industrialized society, in which the structure of 
social relationships generally reflects the party's 
ideological preferences? To be sure, like any 
large sociopolitical system, the Soviet system 
needs an integrative organ. But the question is, 
What is the most socially desirable way of 
achieving such integration? Is a "strong" party 
one that dominates and interferes in everything, 
and is this interference conducive to continued

Soviet economic, political and intellectual 
growth? 
In 1962 Khrushchev tried to provide a solu-
tion. The division of the party into two verti-
cally parallel, functional organs was an attempt 
to make the party directly relevant to the econ-
omy and to wed the party's operations to pro-
duction processes. It was a bold, dramatic and 
radical innovation, reflecting a recognition of 
the need to adapt the party's role to a new state 
of Soviet social development. But it was also 
a dangerous initiative; it carried within itself 
the potential of political disunity as well as the 
possibility that the party would become so 
absorbed in economic affairs that it would lose 
its political and ideological identity. That it 
was rapidly repudiated by Khrushchev's succes-
sors is testimony to the repugnance that the re-
organization must have stimulated among the 
professional party bureaucrats. 
His successors, having rejected Khrushchev's 
reorganization of the party, have been attempt-
ing a compromise solution?in effect, a policy of 
"muddling through." On the one hand, they 
recognize that the party can no longer direct 
the entire Soviet economy from the Kremlin 
and that major institutional reforms in the 
economic sphere, pointing towards more local 
autonomy and decision-making, are indis-
pensable.22 (Similar tendencies are apparent 
elsewhere?e.g., the stress on professional self-
management in the military ? establishment.) 
This constitutes a partial and implicit acknowl-
edgment that in some respects a party of total 
control is today incompatible with the Soviet : 
public interest. 
On the other hand, since obviously inherent , 
in the trend towards decentralization is the : 
danger that the party will be gradually trans-
formed from a directing, ideologically-oriented 
organization to a merely instrumental and prag-
matic body specializing in adjustment and com-
promise of social group aspirations, the party 
functionaries, out of a sense of vested interest, 
have been attempting simultaneously to revive : 
the ideological vitality of the CPSU. Hence the

ing; hence the new importance attachea to the 
? work of the ideological commissions; and hence 
the categorical reminders that "Marxist educa-
tion, Marxist-Leninist training, and the ideolog-
ical tempering of CPSU members and candidate 
members is the primary concern of every party 
organization and committee." 23 
Ti 
owever, it is far from certain that eco-
nomic decentralization and ideological "re-
tempering" can be pushed forward hand in hand. 
The present leadership appears oblivious to the 
fact that established ideology remains vital only 
when ideologically motivated power is applied 
to achieve ideological pals. A gradual reduc-
tion in the directing roll of the party cannot be 
compensated for by an increased emphasis on 
ideological semantics. Economic decentraliza-
tion inescapably reduces the scope of the politi-
cal-ideological and increases the realm of the 
pragmatic-instrumental. It strengthens the 
trend, publicly bemoaned by Soviet ideologists, 
toward depolitization of the Soviet elite:2! A 
massive indoctrination campaign directed at the 
elite cannot operate in a "de-ideologized" socio-
economic context, and major efforts to promote 
such a campaign could, indeed, prompt the 
social isolation of the party, making its dogmas 
even more irrelevant to the daily concerns o: a

If the party rejects a return to ideological

"many comrades" who have assumed leading posts in the 
"directive aktivs" of the party have inadequate ideological

what will hold these people togsther? The party 
at this stage w?ill face the same dilemma that the 
fascist and falange parties faced, and that cur-
rently confronts the Yugoslav and Polish Com-
munists: in the absence of a large-scale domcstic 
program of change, in the execution of which 
other groups and Institutions become subordi-
nated to the party, the party's domestic pri-
macy declines rind .its ability to provide ocia1-
political is negated. 
Moreover, the Soviet party leaders would be 
wrong to assume Complacently that the nar-
rowed range of disagreement over domestic 
policy alternatives Could not again widen. Per-
sistent difficulties in :Igriellit Ilre C0111(1 some day 
prompt a political aspirant xo question the value 
of collectivization; Or the dissatisfaction of some 
;lationalities could :mpose a major stram on the 
Soviet constitutional structure; or foreign af-
fairs could again become the source of bitter 
internal conflicts. The ability of the system to 
withstand the combi!ned impact of such divisive 
ues and of greater group intrusion into pol-
itics would much depend on .the adaptations 
tliat it makes in its organization of leadership 
and in its processes of decision-making. Unless 
alternative mechanisms of integration are 
created, a situation could arise in which some 
group other than the top apparat?a group that 
had continued to attract talent into its top 
ra:nks and had not been beset by bureaucrat-
ically debilitating Conflict at the top?could 
step forth to seek power; invoking the Soviet 
public interest in the name of established Com-
munist ideals, and offering itself (probably in 
coalition with some section of the party leader-
ship) as the only alternative to chaos, it would 
attempt to provide :a new balance between in-
stitutionalization arid .participation. 
The Threat o:f .egerloration 
The Soviet leaders have recognized the need 
of institutional reforms in the economic sector 
in order to revitalize the national economy. The 
fact is that institutional reforms are just as 
badly needed?and even more overdue?in the 
political sector. Indeed, the effort to maintain 
.a doctrinaire dictatorship over an increasingly 
modern and industrial society has already con-
tributed to a reopening of the gap that existed in 
prerevolutionary Russia between the political 
systeg and Aercixo therebimw e 
thre PPM glE 1#10?# 
A political system can be said to degenerate 
when there is a perceptible decline in the quality 
of the social talent that the political leadership 
attracts to itself in competition with other 
groups; when there is persistent division within 
the ruling elite, accompanied by a decline in its 
. commitment to shared beliefs; when :there is 
protracted instability in the top leadership; 
? when there is a decline in the capacity of the 
, ruling elite to (lane the purposes of the political 
system in relationship to society arid to express 
them in effective institutional terms; when there 
is a fuzzing of institutional and hierarchical 
lines. of command, resulting in the uncontrolled 
and unehanneled intrusion into politics of hith-
erto politically uninvolved groupings." All of 
these indicators were discernible in the political 
systems of Tsarist Russia, the French Third 
Republic, Chiang Kai-Shek's China and Ra-
kosi's Hungary. Today, as already noted, at 
least several are apparent in the Soviet politicalsystem. 
This is not to say, however, that the evolution 
of the Soviet system has inevitably turned into 
degeneration. Much still depends on how the 
ruling Soviet elite reacts. Policies of retrench-
ment, increasing dogmatism, and even violence, 
which?if now applied?would follow almost a 
decade of loosening Up, could bring about a 
grave situation of tension, and the possibility of 
revolutionary outbreaks could not be discounted 
entirely. "Terror is indispensable to any dicta-
torship, but it cannot compensate for incom-
petent leaders and a defective organization of 
authority," observed a historian of the French 
revolution, writing of the Second Directory." 
It is equally truc of the Soviet political scene. 
Thi: threat a degeneration could be lessened 
through several adaptations designed to adjust 
the Soviet political system to the changes that 
have taken place an the now more mature so-
First of all, the top policy-making organ 
; of the Soviet system has been traditionally the 
exclusive preserve of the professional politician, 
and in many respects this has assured the Soviet 
political system of able and experienced leader-
ship. However, since a professional bureaucracy 
is not prone to produce broad "generalizing" 
talents, and since the inherent differentiation of 
functions within it increases the likelihood of 
leaders with relatively much narrower speciali-
zation than hitherto was the case,_ the need for

somewhat broader representation of social 
talent within the top political leadership, and 
not merely on secondary levels as hitherto, is , 
becoming urgent. If several outstanding scien-
tists. professional economists, industrial rnanag,-
ers, and. others were to be co-opted by lateral 
entry into the ruling Presidium, the progressive 
transformation of the leadership into a regime 
of clerks: could they be averted, and the 
alienation . of other groups from the political 
system 'perhaps halted. 
Secondly, the Soviet leaders would have to 
institutionalize a chief executive office and 
.? 
strive to endow it with legitimacy and stability. 
This would eventually require the creation of a 
formal and open procesS of leadership selection, 
. as well?probably---as a time.,,Iimit on the ten-
ure of the chief executive position. The time 
limit, if honored, would deperorihlize Power, 
? while an institutionalized process of selection 
geared to a specific date?and therefore also 
- limited .in time?would reduce the debilitating 
effects of unchecked ,and protracted conflict in 
the top echelons of power.

he CPSU continues to be an ideocratic 
'party with .a strong tradition of dogmatic in-
'tolerance and organizational discipline. Today 
less militant and more bureaucratic in outlook, 
it still requires a, top catalyst, though no longer 
a personal tyrant, for effective operations. The 
..example of the papacy, or perhaps of Mexico, 
where a ruling party has created a reasonably 
effective system of presidential succession, offers 
- a demonstration of how one-man rule can be 
combined with a formal office of the chief execu-
tive, endowed with legitimacy, tenure and a for-
mally established pattern of selection. 
Any real institutionalization of power would 
have significant implications for the natty. If its 
Central Committee were to become in effeet.an, 
electoral college, selecting a ruler whom no one 
could threaten during his tenure, the process of 
selection would have to be endowed with con-
siderable respectability. It would have to be 
much more than a mere ratification of an a 
priori decision reached by some bureaucratic. 
cabal, ?The process would require tolerance for 
the expression of diverse opinions in a spirit free 
of dogmatism, a certain amount of open COM- ! 
petition among rivals for power, and perhaps 
even the - formation of informal coalitions?at 
least temporary ones. In a word,. it would mean 
a break with the Leninist past, with conse-
? quences that would unavoidably spill over from 
? the party into the entire system and society. 
Thirdly, increased social participation in poli-
? tics unavoidably creates the need for an insti-
tutionalized arena for the mediation of group 
interests, if tensions and conflicts, and eventu-
ally perhaps even anarchy, are to be avoided. 
The enlarged plenums of the Central Commit-
tee were a right beginning, but if the Committee 
to irtediuto aFitictivoly grnoill? tha intioty 
institutional and group interests that now exist 
in Soviet society, its membership will have to 
be made much more representative and the pre-
dominance of party bureaucrats watered down. 
Alternatively, the Soviet leaders might con-
sider following the Yugoslav course of creating 
a new institution for the explicit purpose of pro-
viding group representation and reconciling dif-
ferent interests. In either case, an effective 
organ of mediation could not be merely a front, 
for the party's continued bureaucratic arbitra-
tion of social interests, as that would simply 
perpetuate the present dilemmas. 
Obviously, the implefinentation of such insti-
tutional reforms would eventually lead to a pro-
found transformation of the Soviet system. But 
it is the absence of basic institutional develop-
ment in the Soviet political system that has 
posed the danger of the system's degeneration. 
It is noteworthy that the Yugoslays have been 
experimenting with political reforms, including 
new institutions, designed to meet precisely the 
probldrns and dangers discussed here. Indeed, 
in the long run, perhaps the ultimate contribu-
tion to Soviet political and social development 
that the CPSU can make is to adjust gracefully 
to the desirability, and perhaps even inevitabil-
ity, of its own 'gradual withering away. In the 
meantime, the progressive transformation of the 
bureaucratic Communist dictatorship into a 
more pluralistic and institutionalized political 
system?even though still a system of one-party 
rule?seems essential if its degeneration is to be 
averted.

MOSCOW, Feb. 5?Leonid, 
Brezhnev remains the domi-
nant figure in the collective, 
Soviet leadership as the 
Communist Party conducts 
final preparations for the? 
24th Party Congress, which 
begins March 30. 
This is the virtually unanif 
mous view of Western, neu-
tral and Communist observ-
ers here. But as one ambaso 
sador remarked, "There are-. 
no degrees? of knowledge% 
about what. goes on in the 
Kremlin?only degrees of 
Ignorance." Nobody who re-
members the surprise ouster 
of Matt Khrushchev in Oc-
tober, 1964, will make confi-
dent predictions about how 
long Brezhnev will remain 
the chief beneficiary of the 
Kremlin balance of power. 
Since surviving the last 
teriotis challenge to his 
dominance last July, the 
general secretary has gar-
nered ? several harvests cif, 
publicity reminiscent , of 
Khrushchev. They seemed 
efforts. to add to ,his per.; 
tonal stature while mobiliz-, 
ng public support for the 
+arty congress. 
He made three major 
peeches in republic capitals 
letween the end of August 
nd the end of November. 
;lach included significant 
oreign policy -pronounce-
aents. Each got heavy preSs 
nd television play, and one 
epublic party leader re-
erred to Brezhnev as "head 
f the politburo," a violation 
f collective protocol.

party that he does not stand ,

Dominance Continues 
The general secretary's. 
dominance in the party lead-
ership has continued into, 
the 4)eriod before the party; 
'congress when political con-, 
filets usually increase in 
scope and acerbity. In fact,, 
there is little evidence of in-, 
tensifying struggle this year, 
though the Kremlin pot has 
been simmering steadily' 
since July. 
The number of changes in 
regional and republic party 
jobs during the past year 
has been smaller than be-
fore previous congresses. As, 
of today, 47 of the 147 re-
gional committees have held 
,pre-congress conferences?a 
small proportion for this 
stage?and only one of the. 
47 changed first. secretaries. 
at its conference. 
Little change presumably

present leadership as a new 
central committee is formed;

gram. Many of MO ohangoa 
,that have taken place have 
benefited men previously 
sociated with Brezhnev or 
reduced the power of men 
thought to belong to oppos-
ing camps. ?? . 
Crisis in the major prob-
lem areas of Soviet life 
?could always change this.

have preferred to muddle

'Mending Fences 
The last real challenge to-
Brezhnev's leadership came 
in July, when some still'un-

the holding of two central' 
'committee meetings in 11' 
'days and the postponement 
of the party congress from 
last fall to next March. 
'Brezhnev cancelled a sched-

? The two likeliest reasons,.

that Brezhnev wanted te

If Marx went to Mr Brezhnev's Russia he would diagnose a classic case of

emud by the Germans, Byzantines and Mongols, ha:, entered 
.e last decades of its existence." He is in fact prepared 
be quite precise: the downfall of the. Soviet Union will 
kc place by 1984,' and its cause will be war with China. 
From outside Russia this prophecy might seem strange

mem Europe ; a western world once again ready to do

lan to liLvralise, or at least evidence of a systematic liberali-
Ittion in practice. The past three years have made it plain 
hat there is no such plan or practice in -Russia. 
It is perhaps inevitable that Mr Amalrilt should see the 
Itimate soitition in terms of a Sino-Soviet War, Whether 
!lich a war, is likely is hotly debated in the w,?::. On 
?vhel-, those who specialise in Chinese drain; tend to 
y it is not, because the Russians could not hope to impo:,e

Mve their problem. Other people see such a war as some. 
Ong a divided Russian regime might embark on. as a way 
tit of its internal and foreign dilemmas. But whate'..er I he 
hances of war, it must be said that Mr Anadriles analysis 
the situation inside the, Soviet Union itself rings depressingly 
ritie. Russia's leaders are trapped in a kind of fiozen immo-
iflity. They know. that the country needs economic reforiu, 
fLonly to ensure continued economic groWth and to narrow 
c technological gap between the communist and capitalist 
?iorlds. But they realise from the examples of Jugoslavia and 
lzechosloval that economic reform almost inevitably leads 
? political reform. And that they will not countenance. 
They have one hope. it isl that their present system can 
dmehow be made to work well enough to keep most people 
tappy in a kind, of soclalist Consumer ?society.' This society 
night not be of a kind to appeal to people like .Mr

which has clearly been given high priority, the progress is 
still. slow. From 1959 to 1965 it is reckoned that a third 
'of the population obtained new or improved accommodation. 
Yet as recently as two years" ago there were, on average, 
Imore than two persons per room., in the Soviet Union, a 
ratio far worse than that in most west European countwies. 
The Soviet Union's leaders need outside help to ensure 
the kind of growth that could help them to put zlies.tbin 
right and make material life in their country more attractive 
to its ritizen8; That is perhaps:one of the main factors behind. 
the present drive for closer economic tics with the west. This 
is for Russia a political as much as an economic issue. The 
,question is whether the Soviet economic system can make 
proper use of western economic aid even if it gets it. . 
And there is another great question about the stability.. 
.of the Soviet Union. This is ;he growing demand from non-,' 
Russians in .the Soviet Unio0 for greater equality with the 
-Russians. This may not be as pressing a problem at the 
moment as. that of living standards. It may become so in 
.: a few years' time, when the Russians will lose their present 
numerical superiority. But to grant . greater rights to the 
.various nationalities would be even more difficult for the 
:regime than to grant ordinary civil .rights. To keep such 
a vast country together you. probably do need a very strong 
government at the .centre. To allow its component parts 
any degree of real autonomy would be to invite disintegration'.

Mr. Starikov's strange remarks as deliberate-,

Politburo members and' some high Russian 
army officers who have been pressing '4n. the'

TOUGH LINE 
Among them are reported to be Politburo 
Members such as Aleksander Shelepin, former

! MOSCOW, Jan. 19 --- Nikltai 
S. Khrushchev, who has gone: 
unpraised in the Soviet Union' 
since his fall from power six 
years ago, is? described as a 
hard-working and %enslave 
wartime leader by an old as-
Societe, ?Marshal Ivan K. 
Bagramyan, in a book of 
Memoirs just published. 
I Marshal Bagramyan. who was 
deputy chief of staff for opera-1 
tions m the Southwestern army' 
group, at the start of World 
War II, worked closely with 
Mr. Khrushchev, who was the 
party leader in the Ukraine and 
the Politburo's representative 
on the military council for the 
area. , 
, As long as Mr. Khrushchev 
iwas the Soviet Union's leader, 
Marshal Bagramyan was lavish 
In his praise of Mr. Khrushchev. 
IThe latest book, "That Is How 
the War Started," is more re-, 
served in Rs comments but 
nevertheless breaks with the 
Practice begun after Mri 
l,Khrushchev's fall in 1964 of 
'not praising him In print. ' 
. Up to now, military and party 
h 
!stories have dhimply listed Mr. 
Khrushchev u holding a certain 
tposition without any 
pion of We work; , ??,,i', .. 
, 
? 
Some Color Included 
But Marshal Bagramyan, att 
73 a Deputy Defense Minister' 
and full member of the party's 
Central Committee, evidently 
was permitted to include some 
color 'about Mr. Khrushchev. 
Military memoirs in the Soviet 
Union tend to be more personal 
and open than more official 
writings. , 
Mr. Khrushchev also appears 
to have been favorably inclined 
toward Marshal Bagramyan. In 
oral reminiscences, published 
abroad as "Khrushchev Ranee 
hers," the former Soviet leader 
said of the marshal: 
"He is a rational: even-hand-
ed man. I like him. I can even 
say I am very fond of him, 
I have alwar admired him for 
his sober mind, his party spi-
rit, his wide-ranging knowledge 
of military affairs, and his un-
corruptible integrity, and 
straight forwardness." , 
r. Marshal Bagramyan, ? In 
his memoris, tries to convey 
the sense of disorder in the 
Ukraine at the start of the 
war when German troops 
smashed through Soviet lines 
on their way to Kiev. , 
In one scene, he describes the 
at beadattarters:* ?V 
"only NIthruclicheV'Sitif 
not abandon his office: Without 
interruption messages arrived. 
there, from Kiev and district 
centers dealing with further 
mobilization of the whole popu-
lation to rebuff the enemy." 
Mr. Khrushchev is described 
R3 having taken part in policy 
Conferences with military corn-. 
manders. He is singled out 
as having prepared Kiev for 
the Nazi attack, which proved 
successful: 
Suicide of Commissar 
Once, Marshal Bagramyan re-
calls, he was ordered by the 
Southwestern army group com-
mander, Lieut. Gen. Mikhail 
P. Kirponos, to report to mem-
bers of the military council on 
some recent decisions: 
."I went with my operational 
map and ,notes to N.S. Khrush-
they. He was? unusually sad. 
He listened to my report and 
without hesitation approved It.

to report ,10 hhn atty 
NikII NilolayoviOli Ma ended 
his war." 
Marshal Bagramyan explain-
ed that Lieut. Gen. Vashugin, 
the political commissar, had 
committed suicide- because of 
the setbacks in the first days 
of the German advance. 
, The memoirs also discuss one 
of the more controversial as-
pects of Soviet military history: 
Why Stalin insisted on trying 
'to defend Kiev in September, 
1941, when his military ad-
visers urged him to evacuate 
the city to avoid encirclement 
and to set up defenses on the 
eastern bank of the Dnieper 
River. Eventually the city had 
to be surrendered and large 
'Red army forces were trapped. 
General Kirponos was among 
those killed.,Marshal Bagra-
myan was with "a group that 
'succeeded in breaking out and 
rejoining the Soviet lines. ' 
Marshal Bagramyan says the 
decision to try and hold Kiev 
"at any price" was taken be-
cause Stalin _ told Harry Hop-

Soviet Domestic Dilemmas:  
Economic Crisis and Minority Dissent  
As time for the 24th Party Congress approaches, the Soviet 
Politburo finds itself confronted by many domestic dilemmas, not 
the least of which is its future control of the state. The 
Politburo's main problem would seem to be the need to find a 
middle ground in economic reform processes where necessary libfr 
eralizatiOn can be balanced with maintaining control over the 
economy.,--.- which in turn is viewed as crucial to holding on to 
political Control. To date, the scales have tipped in favor of 
those party dogmatists who saw the Soviet economic reform pro-
gram only as a means of improving existing planning mechanisms 
and against the "revisionist" group who viewed the reform as a 
means to liberalize the economy by restoring a genuine market 
mechanism. As a result, the Soviet Union faces an economic 
crisis brought on by the inability of its inhibited, party-
hounded economic machine to respond to the demands of the 
scientific-technical revolution. 
Any solution to the USSR's economic crisis hinges also on 
the extent to which the Soviet Politburo plans to crack down 
on scientific dissent. There is a growing awareness among 
Soviet scientists that the censorship and political orthodoxy 
which prohibit the free exchange of ideas between Soviet 
scientists and their non-Soviet counterparts are severely 
handicapping Soviet research and consequently, the country's 
technological capabilities. It is essentially the fear that 
the USSR's: technological lag behind the industrial West will 
eventually confine their country to the status of a second-
class power that has motivated many scientists to join the 
dissidents. in calling for fundamental changes in Soviet life. 
This has resulted in the amalgamation of scientific and ar-
tistic dissent, in itself a major political event, the im-
portance of which remains to be seen. 
The dissident scientists and their artistic allies are 
not the only vocal protesters in the USSR. A whole spectrum 
of loosely organized nationalist and minority groups from 
among the Crimean Tatars, the Baltic and Ukranian separatists, 
Jews, Baptists, and Christian Socialists are arrayed against 
the government. In contrast to most of the so-called "intel-
lectual dissidents" who hope to change Soviet society within 
the existing system, most of the minority groups are dedicated 
to the overthrow of the system --- or at least are opting to 
get out of the system. Apart from the Jews, the impact of 
these minorities is hardly felt beyond the confines of the 
double barbed-wire fences surrounding the USSR's 1,000 or more

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
slave labor camps. Nevertheless, these restless minorities re-
present yet another dilemma for the Soviet leadership. There is 
concern at the growth of nationalist feeling in the USSR and a 
fear that links may be forged between the "intellectual" dissi-
dents and some of the underground opposition forces. 
Briefly noted in the paragraphs that follow are some aspects 
of the weightier domestic dilemmas that might have a bearing on 
the course of events at the 24th Party Congress. 
ECONOMIC CRISIS 
"If the Soviet Union is to survive," wrote historian Andrey 
Amalrik, "it must undergo a total transformation. But if the 
present leadership is to survive, everything must remain exactly 
as it is." And therein lies the great dilemma. In economic 
terms, Amalrik's observation means that the inherited and con-
tinuing Stalinist command structure is inadequate for an increas-
ingly mature, consumer-oriented economy. Decision-making should 
ideally be decentralized and delegated to local levels and en-
terprises, subject to planning of key products. Yet, Brezhnev 
plans to force "intensive growth" (which requires the continu-
ing introduction of new technology) through strong centraliza-
tion of decision-making with local supervision by the Party 
bureaucracy, directed from the center. 
The economic reform toward decentralization and recogni-
tion of economic realities, launched in 1965 (the so-called 
"Liberman program"), has failed. Basic to this economic reform  
failure is the Soviets' refusal to admit the existence of such 
a thing as a "demand factor." To have succeeded, the reform 
should have been accompanied by more rational and flexible 
prices, less central control over the allocation of materials, 
and relief from the chronic shortages of raw materials. The 
leadership has given DO indication that the necessary radical 
changes will be introduced any time in the near future. 
Just about all the same economic problems preoccupy Soviet 
officials today as did in 1966: the volume of unfinished con-
struction and of uninstalled machinery continues to mount; in-
vestment capital is "dissipated" among too many projects; cen-
tral planners interfere in the operation of factories; enter-
prise plans are altered mid-stream; bureaucratic impediments 
frustrate procurement of supplies and sales of products; and 
in addition to a too high labor turnover; most Soviet industrial 
enterprises suffer from overstaffing and the underutilization 
of labor. 
In the past two years, emphasis has been on management  
discipline as the cure-all for many economic problems. There

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
has been an attempt to correct by Government decrees such abuses 
as top-heavy staffs, squandering of funds, hiding of reserves, 
unofficial adjustment of prices, etc. Early last year chief 
planner Baibakov noted that management leaders who failed to 
fulfill plans had to be strictly punished "right up to removal 
from their posts." Obviously, however, no economy can flourish 
if its managers are too intimidated to take risks. 
Continued lowering of production goals is another key to the 
sluggish state of the economy: steell production that was to have 
hit 130 million tons by 1970 is now targeted at 120 million tons 
for 1971; up to 850 billion kilowatts of electric power had been 
planned for 1970 and now the goal for 1971 is lowered to 790 bil-
lion kilowatts; in 1971 some 500,000 passenger automobiles are 
scheduled to be built, while original plans had called for 800,000 
by 1970. 
Plan fulfillment results for 1970 published early in February 
showed that it was not a bad year for the Soviet economy. After 
a powerful fourth quarter spurt, overall growth indices reflected 
a marked improvement over the poor returns of 1969. But the an-
nual report also showed that growth rate fell short of most goals. 
National income was reported up 8.5 percent over 1969. And, al-
though the lot of the consumer has improved by slow, steady gains, 
a continuing sharp growth in savings highlights the economy's 
failure to satisfy consumer demands. 
Consumer shortages abound in every-day articles ranging from 
shoes, toilet paper and matches to electric lightbulbs. Last 
August, for example, Premier Kosygin's house organ, Izvestiya, 
ran an editorial deploring the shortages of "table knives and 
forks, blankets, bath towels, quilted jackets, thermos bottles, 
iron ware; drawing paper, pencils, and a number of other con-
sumer goods." 
The greatest qualitative change of benefit to the consumer 
was apparently in agriculture, which recovered from its crisis-
level slump of 1969. Thanks to good weather and an increase in 
direct and indirect subsidies, the food grain problem is tempo-
rarily resolved. The main task of the 1970's will be to increase 
meat and animal product output. But without accompanying improve-
ments in :transportation, storage, and distribution facilities, 
output growth will mean little. 
On the eve of the 24th Congress, however, the whole agri-
cultural picture is muddied by the highly unorthodox procedures  
used in reporting last year's agricultural results. First, in 
mid-December Nlikaail Suslov claimed the country had "reaped the 
biggest harvest in the history of agriculture." Then, two weeks 
later, chief Soviet planner Baibakov announced that agricultural 
3

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
output had risen by only 6.5 percent against a planned 8.5 per-
cent. However, the plan fulfillment report released early last ' 
month claims an 8.7 percent increase, which would mean that the 
1970 plan had been overfulfilled. Statistical corrections of 
this magnitude are rare, even by Soviet standards. Also suspect 
is the continued failure of the agricultural report to publish 
any grain harvest figure. 
One cause for the current Soviet labor shortage is the 
failure of the economy to free workers from the farms, where 35 
percent of the population still labors. The priority growth 
areas of Siberia have failed to attract an adequate labor force. 
In the European part of the country, established plants -have 
tended to overstaff, causing strained labor conditions particu-
larly in the RSFSR. 
Interestingly enough, Politburo member and Chairman of the 
RSFSR Council of Ministers, Gennadiy Vbronov, suggested in a 
November 1970 speech that consideration again be given to link  
farming. Vbronov, an agriculturalist (and a proponent of spe-
cialist business management training for everybody) views the 
link system as beneficial to both industry and agriculture in 
that it would give greater leeway to individual farmers and 
should help free farm labor for industry. 
Under the link farming system collective and state farms 
would be broken into smaller units, each of which would be the 
responsibility of a small group of farmers called a "link." 
The link groups would be fully responsible for the whole procure-
ment and production process with rewards paid on the basis of 
output --- in short, a system in which individual or group in-
centives would be the motive force. Brezhnev and other Polit-
buro members on the other hand prefer the old brigade system of 
farming, according to which all functions of farming (plowing, 
sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, etc.) are given to worker 
brigades which have no stake in the success of the overall 
effort. A plowing brigade, for example, is paid according to 
how many hectares it plowed, not how well or deeply the furrows 
were plowed. The doctrinaire Politburo apparently fears that 
the link system may engender a "dangerous" feeling of private 
ownership on the part of the farmers. 
For the Soviet scientific, technical, and managerial in-
telligentsia, the most alarming failure of the Soviet leader-
ship is its inertia in undertaking to bridge the huge techno-
logical gap between Soviet and Western achievements in all 
technological fields, except those that are military and space 
related. The reform was meant to raise efficiency by intro-
ducing new technology. But the regime permitted no grand new 
strategies; it merely tolerated experimentation with the pres-
ent administrative apparatus. Furthermore, the free exchange

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
of scientific-technical information, on which scientific and 
technical progress depends, is denied the Soviet scientific-
technical .cohnunity. 
The increasing complexity of a major industrial and eco-
nomic system absolutely requires more and more sophisticated  
computerization. In this respect, the Soviet Union is computer 
"generations" behind the West and Soviet scientists point out 
that even now it may be too late to catch up. And still, the 
Soviet leadership has not seen fit to permit the freedom of 
information exchange necessary to raise the level of computer-
ization or otherwise to stimulate this central feature of an 
advanced economy. 
The Soviet leaders have been willing to only tinker with 
the administrative apparatus and make a beginning in establish-
ing management principles. Thus, the so-called Shchekino ex-
periment (at the Shchekino Chemical Combine in Tula) attempted 
to raise productivity by dismissing surplus labor and giving 
the wages of the fired workers to those remaining. This modest 
innovation is now hailed in the Soviet press as some sort of 
revolutionary example to be emulated throughout the country. 
The West has for decades recognized the importance of 
management as an integral part of economic growth along with 
labor productivity, investment, and technology. It is repre-
sentative of the backwardness of Soviet economic doctrine that 
the bureaucracy is just beginning to listen to those Soviet 
officials who have long been emphasizing that management train-
ing is essential if Soviet enterprise leadership is going to be 
capable of utilizing advanced technology. In early February, 
it was announced with great eclat that a New Institute for the 
Management of the National Economy, the brainchild of Premier 
Kbsygin's son-in-law, Zherman Gvishiani, had been opened "as a 
first step towards training a more enlightened managerial elite." 
Just as Amalrik put his finger on the political dilemma, 
Soviet physicist Andrey Sakharov summed up the economic-
technical failure when he wrote in his famous 1966 essay: 
"in the 1920s and 1930s...the slogan, 'Catch up with and sur-
pass America' was launched, and we really were catching up for 
several decades. The second industrial revolution began, and 
now...rather than catching up...we are falling even farther 
behind. The gap is so wide that it is impossible to measure 
it. We Simply live in another epoch." 
MINORITY DISSENT  
Long familiar to the West is the eloquent dissent of Soviet 
novelists, poets, musicians, historians, and other writers. We

may call them the creative intelligentsia -- the Solzhenitsyns, 
Amalriks, Sinyavskiys and Daniels, the underground "editors" of 
Chronicle of Events and other samizdat publications. No one 
knows what influence they exert on the various sectors of Soviet 
society but for the time being, anyway, that influence is limited. 
For this reason, perhaps; they are permitted to exist. Some are 
Chosen for special punishment by exile, incarceration in prison, 
forced labor camps, or insane asylums. 
It is one thing for Soviet authorities to squelch the voices 
of some of its artistic dissenters, of its lesser-known intellec-
tuals or civil rights agitators. It is quite another matter when 
the voices of dissent belong to prominent and often internation-
ally respected scientists among whose Chief spokesmen are Andrey 
Sakharov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Zhores Medvedyev, and most recently 
the son of a hard-line Politburo member, Vitally. Shelest. 
Biologist and author Zhores Medvedyev, advocate of more 
contact with Western scientists and of free, decentralized re-
search, was incarcerated in a mental hospital early last year 
and then released after a successful intervention by his fellow 
scientists, who included Sakharov and Mstislav Keldysh, Presi-
dent of the USSR Academy of Sciences. On the other hand, later 
efforts by Sakharov and other colleagues to obtain a release for 
the imprisoned mathematician Revolt Pimenov, were unsuccessful. 
The party and its press have been hard-hitting in criti-
cizing the political initiatives of the Soviet scientists and 
their outspokenness in advocating the revitalization of Soivet 
science. A 23 November Pravda editorial called for "waging pro-
paganda among scientists for the Marxist-Leninist understanding 
of contemporary political socio-economic and philosophical 
problems, and for uncompromising attitudes towards the ideo-
logical conceptions of anti-communism and revisionism." 
In late November, a CPSU Central Committee resolution 
attacked the Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow, where Sakharov 
is a staff member. The resolution was also designed to chastize 
the Ukrainian scientific community, where a strong group led by 
Vitally Shelest is opposing additional party controls. Shelest 
has called for more advanced theoretical research and wider con-
tacts with Western scientists. 
It was during this same month that Andrey Sakharov and two 
scientific colleagues formed a non-political "creative associa-
tion," whose aim is to develop the concept and practice of 
human rights in the Soviet Union "in accordance with the laws 
of the State." At his own request, in December Sakharov was 
allowed to attend the RSFSR Supreme Court session held to con-
sider the appeal against the five-year sentence earlier meted 
out to Revolt Pimenov. The sentence was confirmed, but Sakharov's

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300120001-0 
presence is symptomatic of the quandary he poses for the regime. 
Sakharov was also permitted to attend the RSFSR Supreme 
Court December session that rescinded the death sentence meted 
out to two of the eleven Leningrad highjacking defendants. By 
late December, Sakharov's Human Rights Committee had expanded 
and included in its membership Nobel Prize winner A1eksandr 
Solzhenitsyn. 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has increasingly become the focus 
of all crucial, issues in Soviet literary life. Recent criticism 
of him by official media have been in effect an assault on prac-
tically all original writing presently created in the USSR. The 
confrontation of dogmatists and moderates has been building 
steadily during the past two to three years. 
It is significant that two of the ablest dissidents, 
Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, representing two such different 
spheres of Soviet intellectual life should join forces. Sakharov, 
a top technocratic scientist, argues for democracy in functional 
and practical terms: if the system doesn't democratize, it's 
doomed. Solzhenitsyn's arguments for democracy and freedom are 
ethical, preaching the absolute value of human freedom. 
There has been little firm linkage or evidence of solidarity 
between.the so-called "intellectual dissenters" and the opposi-
tion forces among the Soviet's oppressed national minorities and 
religious groups such as the Baptists, Jews, Crimean Tatars, or 
Ukrainian and Baltic separatists. However, the plight of the 
nationalist dissenters, most of whose leaders are safely behind 
barbed wire, evokes active sympathy among many of the intellec-
tuals. 
That even behind the barbed wire fences there may be some 
cross-fertilization of ideas is evident from the letter written 
by seven political prisoners, including writers Yuriy Galantsov 
and A1eksandr Ginzburg at the end of 1969. They wrote that 
"putting people into prison for spreading the idea of national 
self-determination leads only to the kindling of national hatred, 
enmity and the alienation of nations." And already some writers, 
including Ukrainian historian Valentin Mbroz, have testified to 
the growth of national consciousness in some areas as a result 
of repressive policies. (For this testimony, Moroi was imprisoned.) 
Although it would be unrealistic to think that meaningful 
solidarity could develop from sympathy, the leadership is not un-
mindful of the explosive potential. When the Action Group for 
the Protection of Civil Rights made its first protest in 1969, 
more than a quarter of the signers represented the minority races. 
Maybe that is why the group was so short-lived.

THE ECONCMIST London 
30 January 1971 
DI the above cited issue, The Economist posed eleven questions designed to 
measure the amount of freedom in any given country. The Economist also answers the 
questions for the Soviet Union. Comparisons of answers for almost any country in 
the world will show the USSR to be far in the lead in the matter of governing by 
c peMb 13114 oppression: ( 
? Can you leave it if 
you don't like it? 
No : there is no right to emigration under 
Soviet law. Article 64 of the ,Soviet penal code 
makes an illegal attempt to leave the country a 
treasonable offence punishable by a minimum of 
ten years' imprisonment, and a maximum of 
death. A few people are allowed to emigrate, 
including about 1,300 Jews to Israel since June, 
1967. 
I there a secret 
police ? 
Yes; the KGB, ' though no longer allowed to 
operate completely outside the law, as it did 
under Stalin, still has wide powers including 
the surveillance of all foreigners and all suspect 
Soviet citizens, and the running of labour camps 
and institutions like special psychological hos-
pitals for political dissenters, Under "admini: 
stmtive regulations" the KGB is able to order 
Soviet citizens to move their place of residence 
for security and , economic reasons. 
How many political 
prisoners are there? 
It has recently been calculated that the labour 
camps run by the KGB, which are separate 
from the main prison system, may hold as many 
as a million people, of whom a substantial 
number are detained for political reasons. No one 
has claimed to have etiOtigii to 
make a precise estimate. 
Can you move and 
travel inside the 
country as you wish? 
Every Soviet citizen over the age of 16 must 
have an internal passport, which has to be 
exchanged periodically until he or she is 40. 
Younger people can be released from the obliga-
tion to have a passport if they hold office or are 
otherwise thought to merit it. To live perman-
ently in a city or town it is necessary to have 
the authorisation of the police or some, other 
higher authority. For certain offences, the courts 
are empowered to sentence people to exile to, 
or banishment from, a particular place. The 
number of people currently in exile is thought 
to be considerable, and to include many released 
prisoners who are not allowed to ' return to 
Nimcomr. 
Habeas corpus?does 
it exist ? 
Yes, in theory, under the 1936 constitution?
but the constitution is not observed. The pro-
cedure of " administrative " sentencing by the 
KGB has sent an unknown, but very large, 
number of people 'to imprisonment without 
trial. Wire tapping is widespread ; so is censor-
ship of the mail. 
How free iS the 
judiciary.? 
Courts at all levels are under the complete, if 
carefully concealed, domination of the govern-
and communist party in? all political 
,matters?although less than 50 per cent of all 
judges are communist party, members. The 
communist party holds that the separation of 
poweil is a bourgeois doctrine.

CPYRGHT 
How much political 
activity is possible? 
No public political activity is allowed except 
that organised and controlled by the communist 
party. The one-party elections offer only one 
candidate for each post. Other political parties 
than the communist party were abolished soon 
after the 1917 revolution. Factions within the 
communist party itself were forbidden in 1021. 
What forms of 
di.crimination? do 
people suffer from? 
There is discrimination against the 2 million to 
3 million Jews, who are not allowed their own 
schools or to be taught Jewish history. Of the 
, estimated 1,650,000 people of 12 other nation-
alities whom Stalin, uprooted and sent, to other 
parts of the Soviet Union, the .former Volga 
Germans and most of the Crimean Tartars are 
? still in exile. 
Is there freedom of 
worship? 
Churches are allowed to perform only religions 
services ; Any form of religious instruction, or 
charitable or social activity, is forbidden. 
Religious believers cannot hope to be 
appointed to responsible posts. 
How much freedom 
of the press is there ? 
None. All papers, radio and television stations, 
publishing houses and similar institutions are 
owned and run by the state. Private citizens are 
, not even allowed to own duplicatinf machines. 
All publications are subject to strict political 
control and therefore, sometimes, to long delays 
. in publication. Those who illegally write and 
-distribute the unofficial publications known as 
samizdat?" self-publications "?are subjca to 
heavy penalties. 
What restrictions are 
there on economic 
freedom ? 
Article to of the 1936 constitution allows the 
private ownership of articles of use and con-
sumption, but not things from which an income 
may be derived. The result is that the entire 
economy is controlled by the state, though there 
are a few private artisans and, in some remote 
areas, independent peasants. No one else can independence.

Report from Moscow 
Those Soviet economic troubles 
are deep-rooted.

So many lies have been foretold us, 
ky blue phantasmagorias. 
The weather prophets lied, 
the compass lied: 
-EVGENY EVTUSHENKO 
"Ballad of the False Beacons" 
In the final year of a fie-ear pl;.n that 
was supposed to. bring about niassive 
economic reforms, the Soviet Union's lead-
ers and planners are realizing that they 
have fallen !far short of the mark. The 
Soviet press has embarked on a campaign 
of national Self-criticism and analysis that 
staggers the Western imagination. Since 
the December plenum of the Central 
Committee, ithe problems of waste, ineffi-
ciency, alcoholism among workers, faulty 
planning, arid agricultural shortages have 
become an overriding concern of the 
Politburo.. - 
Demands for improvement in the econ7 
omy have become so widespread and in-
sistent that they have led to recriminations. 
among the top leadership and to specula-
tion that changes in the ?Politburo are 
imminent. During the last few years Party 
General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, Prime 
Minister Aleksei Kosygin, and President 
Nikolai Podgorny have spent much of their 
time "normalizing" Czechoslovakia and 
fighting off Chinese Communists along tbe 
Sino-Soviet border. Such external crises 
diverted their attention from the job 'Of 
realigning personnel and power within the 
party and Ministries so that they could 
bring about the much-touted economic 
reforms. 
Without direction from the top, change 
doesn't happen in an authoritarian social-
ist society, and debate still rages over how 
to bring about economic reform. Now the 
trend seems to be away from the "liberals," 
who press for more local initiative and 
responsibility, and toward the "conserva-
tives," who press for central control of the 
? decision-malcing process. 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02: 
Attack on bad management 
One important indicator of the change 
was a speech given by tBrezhnev at the 
Kharkov tractor factory last month. 
Brezhnev, a conservatiVe in Soviet eco-
nomic terms, appears to have taken the 
leadership initiative within the Politburo, 
and his speech marked a turn toward re-
newed party cOntrol of the economy. He 
promised "substantial corrective changes" 
and excoriated "bad management, waste-
fulness, and the violation of labor dis-
cipline." But he made no mention of new 
economic reforms; rather, he stressed the 
need to perfect the reforms that are al-
ready on the books. It is worth noting 
that Prime Minister Kosygin's name 
? has been closely linked in the past with 
proposals for economic experimentation. 
Communist leaders stress the need to 
develop a scientific and technGlogical base 
for Soviet productiOn, but centralized 
planning has hindered the advancement of 
technology. In other respects, too, the 
Soviet economy today presents a picture 
'of unfulfilled development. One hears of 
insufficient and badly utilized transporta-
tion, duplication of service facilities in 
factories, poorly built buildings, and agri-
cultural shortages, especially of meat. In 
brief, net much has changed in the Soviet 
economy since the bold proposals of the 
current five-year plan were first announced. 
(See "The Toughest Management Job in 
the World," FORTUNE, July 1, 1966, and 
"The Auspicious Rise of the Soviet Con-
sumer," August, 1966.) 
? The Chief job of the reforms was to put 
limits on party and ministerial control of 
factories. In theory the role of planners 
and ministries in Moscow was to be shifted 
to long-range planning and coordination of 
industry-wide production. As in major 
American corporations, there would be 
central planning groups but individual 
management of divisions. But in practice,

prices, capital allocations, and supplies all 
remain centrally controlled. Management 
functions continue to be blurred and full 
of duplications, which contributed to the 
failure of key ministries to fulfill their pro-
duction plans last year in such vital areas 
as ferrous metals, petrochemicals, paper, 
cement, and machine tools. 
Weather compounded ,the economic 
problems of 1969. Unseasonable cold 
waves and severe storms caused declines 
in the output of consumer goods and ser-
vices estimated at four to five billion 
rubles. According to Soviet figures, gross 
agricultural output last year was 3 percent 
below 1968, but Western experts say the 
situation was worse than the figures in-
dicate because some of the. crops were of 
poor quality. 
Psychological resistance to bha'fige has 
also slowed economic reform. Bureaucratic 
lethargy, or what the Soviets call "Oblo-
movism," and the reluctance of officials 
and managers to accept new methods have 
been serious stumbling blocks. 
Computer technology would seem, to 
lend itself readily to a centrally planned 
economy, but the Soviet Union has been 
slow to accept the idea that machines can 
play a part in the decision-making process. 
Vodka's the villain in this Krokocid 
cancion, part of an unprecedented wave 
of Soviet self-criticism. Says the work-
man as he uses his bottle as a level: 
"Look, we're laying 'em down tineven."

This biting comment on the Soviet road sys-
tem appeared in the humor magazine Krokodd, 
captioned: "On this bumpy road I built my house.". 
-Many bureaucrats find it hard to trust 
computer data. For example, the Ministry 
of Machine Tool .Building Industry has 
come under _strong criticism for its -failure 
to use computers effeatively. Every plant 
under the ministry's control has a com-
puter, and the ministry has forty-three 
regionaLdata centers, which have been in 
operation for eighteen months. Yet officials 
of the ministry continue to make personal 
phone calls every ten days to collect the 
information, they need. "One of the main - 
reasons for this is a psychological Ntrrier ' 
Of distrust, conservatism of traditions, and 
the habit of world lig in the old fashion," 
said Pravda. 
Economic ? reforms touch the sensitive - 
nerve of interrelated Ministerial and Com-
munist party interests. These delicately 
balanced power relationships will have to 
be readjusted if reforms are to succeed. 
But the aftermath of Czechoslovakia in-
hibits any innovation in Soviet society. 
Underlying the mood of caution .is fear 
that loosening the restraints on economic 
decision making might lead to demands for 
political innovation and freedom.

The price of uneven progress 
The Soviet Union has yet to attain the 
integrated economies of scale that make 
for smooth production and effective long-
range planning. For example, there is 
? 
plenty of crude steel, but a lack of spe-
cialized proce.sSing equipment limits out-
put of high-quality steel products. 
Other examples of uneven progress 
abound. Large investments have been 
made in lumbering and sawmills, but 
the manufacture of quality furniture 
has lagged. Automobile production has 
increased, but, service facilities have not 
kept pace?motels and roadside garages 
remain raritieS. 
Economists . talk of a 'fifteen-to-twenty-
year over-all plan, and of directbw the 
State Planning Committee' (Oosplan) to 
quit concerning itself with details.' But 
change means more than efficiency and the 
streamlining of production; it means elim-
ination of jobs in the overseeing ministries 
as well. Top-heavy staffing and duplica-
tion of effort in the ministries are so-appar-
ent that the; Central Committee of the 
Communist party and the Council of 
M inistraN last October decreed measure's 
1,i ei itii naL excesa staff that will help Nave 
1.7 billion rubles annually. 
To break up the centralization of power, 
an experiment is under way in the Ministry 
of Instrument Making, Automatic De- ; 
vices, and. Control Systems. Under the 
terms of the experiment, which will be 
applied to the entire ministry, the plan-
ning power :has been delegated to the 
department-chief level. Every department 
forms an industrial unit with the enter-
prises under its control to work out de-
tailed production planning jointly?and 
the ministry has no veto power over the 
decisions. The staff of the department 
paid from the pooled resources of the en-
terprises, with salaries dependent ,on? 
the progress of the industry. Last year " 
the automation industries that first 
applied this plan increased produCtion 
by 19 percent. 
200 cables, but no approval 
Other ministries are less enlightened. 
Last year the Meat and Dairy Industry 
Ministry sent subordinate enterprises and 
organizations more than 40,000 orders, 
instructions, and telegrams, most of which 
had nothing to do with production. "Un-
, 
fortunately, ministries are still engaged in 
issuing, redundant orders, very efzer. to the 
detriment of their duties," says Georgy 
Kalugin, manager of the Leningrad Machine 
Tool Building Consolidated Enterprises, 
and a frequent critic of overcentralized 
,ministerial control. Kalugin cites receiving 
up to 200 cables and queries monthly from 
his mintetry?"Yet we cannot get the 
ministry's approval for the plan of recon-
struction of one of our plants." 
Kommunist, the theoretical journal of 
the Communist party, noted in a recent 
issue that "to eliminate the ' redundant 
links in management" is a prime duty of 
Communists working in adrninistrative 
bodies. "Regrettably," Kommunisl added, 
"this is not carried out everywhere." 
Merger and consolidation 
The adoption of a new five-year-plan for 
the economy will be a major item on the 
agenda of the Twenty-fourth Party Con-
gress, which is expected to meet late this 
year. One of the issues the Congress will 
have to deal with is a proposal to stream-
line the structure of Soviet industry 
through merger and consolidation. The 
aim will be to cut down the number of 
inefficient small factories, coordinate each 
? industry's parts makers and suppliers, and 
eliminatC.the staggering waste that results 
when, each factory has its own repair and 
toolmaking,. facilities. Most Soviet factories 
work according to the "closed-circuit sys-
tem,'.' striving for self-sufficiency in pro-
duction of their products rather than 
integration into their industry. The result 
has been duplication of effort and high, 
uneven costs. 
? In Leningrad, a single combine is being 
set up to service 200 machine-building 
plants under sixteen different ministries 
with standard parts, tools, and auxiliary 
services. The first stage of operation is set 
for 1971 and the second by 1980. When the 
first stage goes into effect, an estimated 
26,000 jobs will be eliminated. With this 
and other economies, the plants will save 
some 44 million rubles a year.' 
' The Party Congress will also take up 
proposals for reducing the kind of ineffi-
ciency that is caused by the way the Soviet 
system itself operates. There are many 
self-defeating aspects of the economic 
system. Miners who are paid on the basis 
of quantity rather than quality have been 
mixing waste rock with iron ore to increase

their output. At one factory, workers 
damaged a freight car by overloading it; 
rather than face a penalty for the dam-
age, they- destroyed the car and crushed it 
into scrap. 
The Party Congress must also decide 
, how to adjust prices so that they reflect 
not only real costs but differences in 
quality as well. Under the proposed price 
'reform, a system of flexible prices would be 
instituted. But just how this will be done, 
and what its impact will be, is one of the 
1:nottiest problems facing the. planners. 
It is not at all certain that the Soviet 
Union's renewed thrust toward a 
technological society society will produce any 
more lasting results than earlier efforts at 
reform. Unless the Soviet leaders can 
accommodate political control to freedom 
for economic decision making, the reforms 
will never take hold, and the leadership 
still seems fearful that economic reform 
may lead to demands for politicalliberall-
zation. Despite lofty phrases of reform, the 
"false beacons" continue to shine and, in

cpYPuor organization plaguing good Soviet harvest 
MOSCOW?Pavoura.bie weather" 
has 
has given the Soviet Union reason' 
to expect the 1970 grain harvest 
to surpass last year's. The unof-
ficial estimate is placed at more 
than the 160 million tons reached 
last year, compared to the 180-
.million mark attained- in 1968. 
Considerable progress would 
have to be made to reach the 
annual goal of 195 million tons 
set up by Party Secretary-Gen-
eral Leonid I. Brezhnev last July 
for the forthcoming five-year 
plan. 
Serious problems apparently 
cpntinue to plague the organiza-
tion of the actual grain gathering. 
Several newspapers, including 
Pravda, have pointed out the 
deplorable harvesting conditions 
in such regions as Omsk and 
Aktyubinsk. 
Trucks, insufficient in number 
or poorly used, are unable to reg-
ularly transport the harvested 
grain to the delivery or storage 
centres. Grain has piled up by 
the sides of roads and fields, ap-
parently loose and exposed to the 
elements. Elsewhere, the faciltties 
are incapable of handling the 
inflow. 
A recent issue of Pravda cited 
the -case eta sovkhoz (1) where 
asloo tomi 4 put, grain are even 
noW outs.the' 00eh awaiting 
From our correspondent 
shipment to the nearest grain 
elevator, which can only handle 
35 to 55 tons a day. At that pace, 
the entire harvest will reach 
shelter only in mid-November?
after a considerable portion has 
been destroyed or damaged by the 
seasonal rain or snow. 
There are a number of reasons 
for ?these delays. Soviet news-
papers place a major part of the 
blame on the large number, o? 
trucks laid up in repair shops. 
At the ,sovIchoz cited by Pravda,4 
more than half of the vehicles 
were broken down. 
? 'Preventive measures 
These difficulties are all the 
more dkurbing in that they'' 
were foreseen well ahead of time 
and preventive measures Were 
taken. The Communist Party 
Central dommittee and the Soviet 
Council .of Ministers last, /June 
authorized- the 'governments of 
the federated republics to mobilize 
all , available transportatipn for 
the, forthcoming_ harvest, Includ-
ing the drafting of industrial and 
management motor resources for 
holkhoz ,and'so4haz yqf, 
? were granted bonuses of as high, 
as 50 per cent of their normal 
salaries. 
A second Central Committee-
Council of Ministers resolution in 
early August criticized the im-
proper use of vehicle pools in a 
number of agricultural enter-
prises. The emphasis this time 
was on improved repair and tech-
nical service organization. 
The most recent press criticisms 
are part of 5, year-old campaign 
aimed at eliminating, or at least 
reducing,: waste in all sectors of 
the Soviet economy. , 
The situation is all the more 
pressing, in agriculture for two 
reasons:t (1) this sector is in the 
priority position in the next five-
year plan; and (2) grain produc-
tion requires alt added boost to 
Compensate for last year's results. 
The apparent ineffectiveness of 
the party and government direc-
tives highlights both the clumsy 
weight of the Soviet apparatus 
and the difficulties facing the 
managers of the Russian econ-
omy.

25 January 1971 
WHY RUSSIA CAN'T CATCH UP 
WITHOUT WESTERN Kwyy-How 
? Inefficiency, waste, bureaucratic bungling. . . . This is only 
!part of the story behind Russia's lagging economy?and why 
dRtgl4Co11urning, more and more, to capitalist West for help. 
The extent of the profound failure of 
I the Soviet Union's economic system is 
! now coming into full view. 
For a long time Russian leaders 
! boasted they would catch up with and 
surpass the West. 
The fact is established, instead, that 
!Russia finds it impossible even to hold 
I its own. 
Years of economic bungling and in-
efficiency have forced the Soviets to 
; turn more and more to the West for 
!massive help to make up in some measure 
for their own shortcomings in industry 
. and technology. 
The Kremlin found it necessary in the 
1960s to import 6.5 billion dollars' worth 
I of machinery from smaller countries of 
i the capitalist world?a great blow to 
!Russian pride. 
? Lag in technology. In computers, 
I automation, atomic energy?all fields es-
sential in this technological era?Soviet 
!progress is found to lag behind that of 
i. the West. 
' The Russian people, fed promises that 
Iproducts commonplace in the West were 
i on the way, continue to find promises, 
I not goods? on their shelves. Nor is the 
I future much brighter. The five-year plan 
that started on Jan. 1, 1971, warns peo-
'pie not to expect any dramatic increases 
in consumer goods. 
! Industrial growth in Russia last year 
I rose 8 per cent?above expectations?but 
I failed to erase serious deficits plaguing 
I key sectors, such as fertilizers, chemicals 
rand construction. 
One eminent Soviet physicist, Andrei 
Sakharov, in a candid mood of self-crit-
icism, puts it this way: 
"We are now catching up .with the 
I United States only in some of the old, 
traditional industries -which are no long-
ler as important as they used to be for 
the United States?for example, coal and 
Isteel. In some of the newer fields?for 
of their help on "painless" terms. That 
means terms that will relieve the Rus-
sians of any additional de-
mands on their already 
limited reggrver of foreign 
example, automation, computers, petro-
chemicals and especially in industrial 
research and development?we are not 
onl). lagging behind, but are also grow-
ing more slowly." 
So, increasingly, Russia must rely on 
the West for assistance in overcoming 
its deficiencies. Moscow is counting on 
capitalism to supply the large-scale aid 
needed to exploit vast untapped natural 
Yesources, to build modern industrial 
plants and to develop new sources of 
hard currency to boost living standards. 
Massive imports. The billions of dol-
lars in machinery and equipment the 
Russians have imported from countries 
such as West Germany, Britain, Japan, 
Sweden, Italy and France have covered 
every industrial field?ships and marine 
goods, chemicals, timber and papermak-
ing, equipment, light industry, and food. 
The chart on these pages gives details. 
Broad objectives of Soviet', planners 
are evident in these deals Rttssia has 
concluded or has in the works: 
? Russia's auto industry is being rev-
olutionized by construction of a mass-
production plant at Togaliatti on ,the, 
Volga River by. Italy's Fiat Company. 
? British firms are providing the tech-
nical aid; equipment and Construction 
engineers for two huge chemical plants. 
? West Germany and Italy have 
signed multibillion-dollar agreements to 
supply Russia with large-diameter pipes, 
compressors and other equipment in re-
turn for gas from new wells in Siberia. 
? Japan will help Russia harvest its 
virgin forests in return for lumber. 
? Other Western firms are negotiating 
to help Russia develop tremendous re-
serves of iron, copper and nickel in 
? Siberia. 
What Moscow is counting on is that 
industrial firms and banks in the West 
are anxious enough to get a toehold in 
the Communist market to provide much 
exchange. 
Credit from capitalists. 
Up to now, Russia has 
obtained nearly 1.5 billion 
dollars' worth of credits 
from Western Europe and 
from Japan to finance the 
purchase of industrial 
equipment, know-how and 
management skills. Mos-
cow currently is dickering 
for an additional 2 to 3 bil-
lion dollars in credit from 
these countries. Most deals 
involve the barter of 
goods rather than payment 
of cash. 
Notably absent in the 
West's push to capitalize 
on Russia's needs: the United States. 
Foy political or strategic reasons, and 
under Government pressure, American 
firms have spurned "feelers" for construc-
tion of a truck factory and a computer-
assembly plant in the Soviet Union. 
. And American companies are conspic-
, 
uously absent from other important ne-
gotiations. 
Russia's reach for a Western hand in 
time of trouble is far from new. Almost 
from the time Communists took over 
they have sought capitalist help in try-
ing to deal with an ailing economy. 
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, 
American industry played a major role 
in the first of Joseph Stalin's five-year 
plans. During this period?when Wash-
ington did not even recognize Moscow 
diplomatically?U. S. companies laid the 
foundations of basic Soviet industries?
coal, iron, steel, petroleum, chemicals 
and fertilizers. U. S. engineers helped 
build the giant Dnieper Darn, at one 
time the world's largest. American ex-
perts taught Russian farmers how to 
grow wheat on a large scale. 
During World War H, with Russia 
staggering before advancing German

armies, it was the U. S. again which came 
to the rescue with food, transport and fuel. 
After Stalin's death, Nikita Khru-, 
shchev?the same Khrushchev who boast-
ed that Russia would be outproducing 1 
the U. S. by 1970?sent his farm experts 
to the U. S. to see whether Iowa's corn 
and hog-raising techniques could be 
adopted by Russia to help solve chronic 
food problems. 
Specialists on Boviat affairs do strolls 
this point: Russia has made giant strides 
in some sectors over the years. 
Crude-steel output totaled only 4 mil-
lion tons in 1928; today it tops 100 
million tons. In certain industries, nota-
bly machine tools and cement, Soviet 
output exceeds that of the U. S. In fact, 
Russia ranks second only to the U. S. as 
a military and industrial power. 
Still, Russia's total production ' of 
goods and services amounts to no more 
than half that of the U. S. The average 
Russian waits years to buy a car. He 
still finds it hard to purchase such ordi-
nary items as gloves, towels and razor 
blades. The chart on page 55 compares 
production of the U. S. and Russia in 
several key areas. 
Shabby, shoddy. One Western au-
thority on Soviet affairs describes the 
Russia of today in these terms: 
"Soviet planning?or the failure of it 
?has produced a country where shabbily 
dressed peasants use high-powered jets 
to take baskets of poultry and produce 
to market because food-short city dwell- , 
ers will pay prices that will more than 
cover air fares. It has produced a coun-
try which was the first to orbit a satel-
lite around the earth?but where some 
buildings are equipped with nets to 
catch falling bricks and plaster." 
A Soviet economist, I. Pashko, has 
detailed his country's backwardness in 
engineering. Soviet auto engines, he said, 
weigh two to three times more per 
horsepower than comparable American 
auto engines. The weight of Russian 
truck engines is four times as great as 
American counterparts. 
Practice in Russia is to pour time and 
capital into overhauling existing ma-
chines rather than introducing new ones. 
For example, 500,000 lathes in Russia 
have been in operation for more than 
20 years. One third of all Soviet textile 
mills are two decades old, or older. One 
fifth of all papermaking machines are 
over 50 years old. 
To maintain this old equipment, what 
the Russians call "the second machine-
building industry" has been spawned, 
geared to reconditioning antiquated ma- 1 
chinery. This industry ties up more than! 
1 million metal-cutting lathes?almost as 
many as are used in the entire ma-
chine-building industry itself. In 1968 
some 5 billion dollars was set aside for 
this rebuilding of industrial machinery?
more than all capital investment in ma-
chine building. 
Squandered resources. Waste is wide- ' 
spread. In 1965, according to one So-! 
viet source, Russia's engineering industry 
used 25 per cent more material than 
was used In foraign countriom to produce 
the same output. Twenty-nine per cent 
of Soviet rolled metal is scrapped each 
year. In the ball-bearing industry the 
figure is 57 per cent. Annual waste of 
steel shavings is three to four times as 
high as in other industrial countries. 
Human resources are equally wasted. 
Nearly one out of four workers is em-
ployed in "auxiliary work"?such as mov-
ing materials from one place to another. 
k 
Manual labor is widespread. In the me-
chanical-engineering and metal-process-
ing industry only 38 per cent of the 
work force is engaged in mechanized' 
tasks. Workers in coal mines still prop ; 
timbers by hand. Only five of 88 major 
gas fields are fully automated. Some 200 
tolling mills are not mechanized. 1 
In new construction, Russia lags dra-
matically behind the West. Example: It ' 
takes 1 to 2 years to build a chemical I 
plant in the U. S. and Britain; 5 to 7 
years in Russia. 
Notes one Soviet writer: 
"We design new enterprises in two 
or three years, we build them in five to 
seven years and we take one to two years 
to get them producing. . . . This shows 
how inefficiently we are using new 
technology and how we are slowing 
technical progress." 
Auto production is another example. 
While the rest of the industrial world 
grapples with problems of auto pollu-
tion, traffic jams and parking, the Soviet 
Union is barely entering the automobile 
age. With a population of 253 million 
people it has only 1.3 million cars?half 
of them Government-owned?and 3 mil-
lion trucks. Soviet auto production in 
1970 was around 300000 and truck out-
put half a million. That compared with, 
U. S. production of 6.6 million cars and' 
1.7 million trucks, a below-normal out-
put because of the 1970 auto strike. 
Computer shortage. Nowhere are So-
viet failings more apparent than in the 
computer field. Academician Sakharov 
estimates that Russian computer capaci-
ty is "hundreds of times less" than 
America's. . 
Russia not only has fewer computers 
in operation-5,000, against more than 
60,000 in the U. S.?but also lacks the 
big, complex models that have helped 
spur technology in the West. One writer 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01 
8 
estimates that 60 to 80 per cent of com-
puters in the U. S. and Western Europe 
belong to the third?the latest?genera-
tion of computers, with the remainder 
in the second generation. In Russia and 
Eastern Europe less than 5 per cent are 
third generation and more than one 
third are first generation. 
The Soviet Union also is falling down 
in computer "software"?programing the 
maim to dolivor at utmost offloioney. 
Computers in Russian factories, for in-
stance, are usually called upon to solve 
very limited problems. Computer sys-
tems to run an entire plant?administra-
tively as well as on the production 
fines?are relatively few. Often they per-
form poorly. 
Finally, Russia lacks the mathemati-
cians and cybernetics specialists who can 
solve practical industrial problems. 
Looking to West. With such defi-
ciencies and weaknesses it is no won-
der, experts on Russia point out, that 
the Russians are searching for help from 
the West. Cars, computers and chemi-
cals?these are the fields where the Rus-
sians are most anxious to get assistance. 
To refashion the languishing Soviet 
auto industry, the Italians are building 
,the Togliatti plant. It is scheduled to 
produce 600,000 autos a year by the end 
of 1972?more than half the country's es-
timated production at that time. 
Negotiations are under way to orga-
nize a European consortium, led by 
West Germany's Daimler-Benz, to build 
a 1-billion-dollar truck factory with an 
annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. 
Renault of France and DAF of Holland 
are also involved. The Russians began 
talking to these European manufacturers 
after getting a turn-down from Henry 
Ford II of the U. S. Ford, however, is 
reported still to be considering a tractor 
deal with the Russians. 
Moscow, in its bid to tap Western 
ingenuity in the computer sector, is run-
ning into trouble. Main reason: An em-
bargo, observed by all countries of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
Japan, prohibits the export to Russia of 
the large, more sophisticated computers 
that could be of strategic value. 
For example: Russia last October 
tried to get International Business Ma-
chines of the U. S. to build a subassem-
bly plant in the Soviet Union. This was 
rejected. Now it is turning to Siemens 
of West Germany to explore the possi-
bilities of co-operation in electronic data 
? processing. How these negotiations will 
fare in view of the NATO restrictions 
is uncertain.

velopment, Britain's International Com-

in NATO on strategic grounds. 
British firms are going ahead with 
providing help for construction of two 
giant petrochemical plants in Russia. 
One, a terylene facility designed to pro-
; duce 50,000 tons of synthetic fibers an-
nually, is scheduled to begin operation 
this year. A polyester-film factory is be-
ing built near Moscow with British aid. 
The two projects involve contracts total-
ing nearly 130 million dollars. 
Nowhere is Russia relying on Western 
; aid more than in development of Sibe-
ria's wealth of natural resources. Buried 
in that frigid land are 90 per cent of the 
country's coal, over half its iron ore, 
three quarters of its timber, huge oil 
reserves and one third its natural gas. 
To get that gas out fast is a major 
reason behind the "pipe for gas" agree-
ments Russia has negotiated in Europe. 
Russia does not have the time, capital or 
equipment to tap those reserves now. 
Nor does it manufacture the large 42-
'inch pipe needed to distribute it So 
West Germany is supplying 333 million 
dollars' worth of pipe and other machin-
ery in return for gas, Italy 200 million 
dollars' worth. 
Tapping foreign know-how. The 
pipe deal points up the advantages accru-
ing to the Russians in such ventures. It 
was described this way by one observer: 
"Russians grant no concessions to for-
eign firms. Foreigners are not permitted 
to own their own producing plants. No 
foreign internal-development project is 
permanent. No joint Soviet-foreign com-
panies are permitted. 
"Instead, Russia calls in foreign firms 
to do a job, take a profit and get out. 
"In short, the Russians get develop-
ment without any cost to their foreign-
exchange reserves and also acquire a lu-
crative new source of hard-currency 
earnings in the future." 
Siberia's timber resources are being 
exploited similarly in an arrangement 
with Japan. The Japanese have agreed 
to supply on deferred-payment terms 
150 million dollars' worth of machinery 
and other equipment for forestry devel- ? 
opment. Payment will be 3.3 billion 
board feet of lumber. 
Japan also is co-operating with Russia 
in construction of the new port of Uran-
gelya in the Far East near Nahodka, to 
handle the rapidly growing volume of 
trade between the Soviet Union and 
Japan. Russia is angling for long-term, 
low-interest loans of 90 million dollars 
from Japanese banks to finance the first 
stage of this port development. 
British projects. Other projects in 
the works concerning Siberia: 
Development of topper, zinc and 
nickel by British and other European 
firms; construction by Britain of a rail 
freight-container system from Leningrad 
to the Pacific Coast; building of a forg-
ing plant by Britain's GKN Company. 
How far and how fast these ventures 
will go, and how successful they will be 
are still matters of conjecture among 
Western experts. Officials specializing 
In East-West economic affairs seem rea-
sonably optimistic about prospects for 
deals involving 1 billion dollars or more 
?provided Moscow gets the long-term 
credit it wants and if payment is ac-
cepted in the form of raw materials or 
semi-finished products. 
Even so, there seem to be limits. A 
recent study by the Geneva-based Eco-
nomic Commission for Europe (ECE) 
showed that Russia in the decade ahead 
will find a declining market for its farm 
products, mineral fuels and industrial 
materials compared with the 1950s and 
1960s. Why? Western needs are not ris-
ing as fast. 
Also: Russian products are often of a 
kind and quality hard to sell in the 
West. 
? There are a few .exceptions. West 
German industrial companies and re-
search institutes are using certain kinds 
of Soviet isotopes because they come 
cheaper than from the U. S. Russia sup-
plies automated welding equipment and 
superhard tools to work on stress parts 
of engines. Russia is to furnish equip-
ment and technical help for a large iron 
and steel plant to be built in France. 
An Italian company has purchased sev-
eral Yak-40 jet planes that can land and

take off 'on beaten-earth fields. By and 
large, however, the flow of technologir 
cal goods is a one-way street, from West 
to East. 
The military drain. A question the:t 
persists as the Russians look to the West 
for more help is why a country oc':. 
cupying one sixth of the world's larn,1 
surface, so rich In natural resources, 
has been unable to keep up with tht'p 
rest of the industrialized world. From 
Soviet experts in Europe and the U. SI' 
come these explanations: 
1. Defense and the space race have; 
placed a 'tremendous burden on the Sc4 
viet economy, sharply limiting resources 
available for progress in other sectors 
Says one expert: 
"With a national income that is only', 
about half that of the U. S., Russia is 
trying to rival America as a military 
power and in space. The strain produced 
by this effort has been much greater 
than for the richer U. S. economy." 
,At the same time, both defense. and 
space technology are surrounded by an 
impenetrable security blanket. This has 
retarded the "spin-off" that has helped 
technological advancement in the West's 
civilian sector. 
2. Over the last decade, Soviet poli-
cy makers have been under rising pres-
sure from the people to transfer more 
resources to consumer-goods industries 
and to housing. Russia has not been 
wholly successful in this?as Kremlin 
leaders themselves have admitted?but 
the effort has drained capital away from 
the "growth inducing" capital-goods in-
dustries. 
3. The traditional system of economic 
planning from the center has created a 
nightmare of ineptitude. Basic economic 
decisions are made by a handful of "ex-
perts" in Moscow, many of whom are 
neither experts nor planners, but Com-
munist Party faithful. 
When the "experts" make a mistake, 
there is no free market to correct them. 
Since consumers have little say about 
what is made, a flood of unwanted and 
unneeded goods flows out of factories to 
sit?unsold?on store shelves. Enterprises 
which make these goods do not "go out 
of business" until the planners order it 
?so unwanted products keep pouting 
out year after year despite criticism and 
complaints. 
4. Administrative barriers and red 
tape hamper innovation. Managers of 
state-owned plants have little incentive 
to introduce different machines or other 
improvements. For example: 
To install new machinery, managers 
would have to shut down production 
lines, fall behind in their quotas, lose 
possible benefits. Even if new machln-
Oty Wer iuQd ilf11 Wolik1 
main. Fresh equipment means higher 
production targets that could complicate 
life for both supervisors and laborers. 
Result: An attitude of "just getting 
by" permeates the entire production 
process. 
Faults conceded. None of these fail-
ings has been entirely lost on Russian 
leaders. Over the decades, Soviet offi-
cials have conceded major faults?as the 
statements below indicate. In 1965 the 
Kremlin decreed an overhaul of the pro-
ductive machinery. It failed. Two years 
ago new changes were made in an effort 
to deal with planning, prices, invest-
ment and incentives. Recent complaints 
by Soviet leaders indicate that these 
"innovations" also are not working. 
A leading expert on Soviet economics, 
Mrs. Gertrude E. Schroeder, visiting 
professor of economics at the University 
of Virginia, summed up the Russians' 
drive to accelerate technology in the 
periodical "Problems of Communism." 
She said: 
"The present thrust seems unlikely to 
produce significant results even if given 
a great deal more time. The main rea-
son for this conclusion is that the Soviet 
leadership, as in the past, is still relyin 
on administrative methods of resolvin 
the problem." 
With results falling far behind expec-
tations, odds are that Russian overture 
to the West will continue to expand. I 
the view of many Western observers, 
they should be rebuffed, however. 
Asks one: "Why should free-worl 
capitalists come to the aid of Sovie 
Communists?and in terms that are s 
highly favorable to the Russians?" 
What the West gives Russia, thes 
observers continue, will not solve th 
basic problems inherent in the Commu 
nist system, but they will benefit Sovie 
leaders as they seek to overtake the U.S 
and narrow the technology gap. 
One British political commentator pu 
it this way: "It's sheer insanity that lead 
Western countries to scramble for a 
opportunity to help a nation that is stil 
dedicated to their destruction."

The results of the last such

most of the targets set by Pre-
mier' Kosygin in 1966 were not 
reached, priniarily because of 
delays in construction, back-
ward' plants and shortages in 
capital and labor investments. 
Over-all, the Soviet economy 
recorded a strong comeback in 
1970, after a poor showing in 
1969. Both industrial and Agri-
Cultural output showed signifi-* 
cant gains, and officials have 
-claimed a record grain harvest.

failed to display "the neces-
sary staunchness in the strug-

idealistic conceptions of bour-
geois selenUsta." 
But it is not foreign sclentif-
Ic ideas that the Kremlin is 
concerned about. In the More, 
the institute's party commit-

sophical problems of the day." 
It must further arouse among 
them "an uncompromising at-
titude towards the ideological 
concepts of anti-communism 
and revisionism." 
Behind the long words are 
very simple ideas. "Revision-

have always been used by So-
viet leaders to decry and dis-
credit the demands made by 
any section of the commnity 
for basic freedoms. Among the 
scientists, the rallying call is 
increasingly for freedom of

Vitaly Shelest, who had been 
greatly impressed by what he 
had seen in America. Young 
Shelest's father Is the party 
secretary for the Ukraine, a 
nation 01 50 million people. 
Ostensibly, Shelest was con-
cerned with the preference 
given to the applied sciences 
in the Soviet Union, and the 
restrictions, financial and or-
ganizational, placed on the 
basic sciences. But the basic 
sciences include, for him. "the

Political ideas, and ef the pan-
ty's conduct during the 53

Articles by other scientists 
In the Ukrainian Literary Ga-
zette soon took up, however, 
the inevitable topic of foreign 
contacts. This was absolutely 
necessary if young scientists 
were to develop their abilities 
fully, "but, unfortunately, we 
sent on such creative foreign 
trips for the most part anyone 
but those who are true scien-
tists." 
Foreign travel permits were 
governed by "a system of 
questionnaires, personal files, 
recommendations, and the 
like, which has completely, 
failed." Yet the system "still 
exists and hampers progress." 
The writer, himself a young 
scientist, demanded that the 
head of a scientific establish-
ment should alone be respon-c-
ble for deciding whether mem-
bers of his staff may travel 
abroad. 
This is the most direct and 
daring discussion to have ap-
peared in the Soviet press so 
far of the degrading system 
of checks and Investigations, 
administered by a special de-
partment of the Central Com-
mittee, which every Soviet cit-
izen must undergo before he 
obtains a foreign travel per-
mit. Previously, the system 
had only been criticized in lit-
erature circulated through un-
derground channels. 
Another complaint voiced In 
the Ukranian debate was that 
"it is almost impossible to ob-
tain, on time, a journal or a 
book from abroad." The au-
thor had inserted "on time" 
for the censor's benefit, for his 
readers will know of the great 
number of books that are not 
allowed into the country for 
political reasons?even when 
they deal with scientific top-
ics. 
A study published Vficially 
In Moscow last year concluded 
that the efficiency of Soviet 
science was greatly impaired 
by restrictions on the circula-
tion of scientific literature and 
- of the scientists themselves. 
Foreign journals reached sub-
scribers with great delays, it 
said, and it was "particularly 
deplorable" that "the most 
Important. of them" were 
available .r.,y In the form of 
photographic reproductions 
made in the Soviet Union from 
? foreign originals. (any "unde-
sirable" matter Is, of course, 
deleted in the process of re-
production.) 
The study laid particular 
stress on the importance of 
personal links between scien-
tists of different countries. 
These were now increasingly 
neczssary, because the high 
degree of specialization and 
the "Imformation explosion" 
made such personal contacts 
the most efficient way of ac 
-
Turing much of the important 
new knowledge. In the Soviet 
Union, the book concluded, 
"the delays in the movement 
of new ideas through the chan-
nels of communication are imp 
permissibly great." 
Some of the Soviet leaders 
are aware of the problem. 
Dzherman Gvishiani, the dep-
uty chairman of the State Sci-
ence Committee, who is one of 
the men most concerned in the 
Soviet leadership with improv-
ing the utilization of science in 
the interests of the national 
economy and defense, has of-
ten stressed the importance of 
foreign contacts. 
Although he is the son of a 
KGB general, Gvishiani hasp 
worked so hard to extend Bus-
sin's foreign links that In some 
quarters he is regarded as a 
liberal. Perhaps he is. The off-, 
spring, of KGB officials some-
times turn out to be remarka-
bly progressive. 
As the son-In-law of Alexel 
Kosygin, the prime minister, 
he can afford to take risks?
although he also remembers, 
no doubt, the sad fate of Mr. 
Khrushchev's son-in-law, Alex-
ey. Adzhubey, who became a 
"liberal" standard-bearer as 
editor of Izvestia, and has 
been last heard of as a report-
er on a picture magazine. 
In a recent article, Gvishianl 
raessed the "great impor-
? Ince" of studies designed to 
oetermine the effectiveness of 
Soviet science and scientists 
who, with auxiliary personnel, 
now amounted to more than 
three million people. It Is an 
army with considerable revo-
lutionary potential?and the 
more the Kremlin does to 
Im-
prove Its "effectiveness," the 
more dangerous it will be.

miles west of Moscow, and his wants are

dissent since the death of Joseph Stalin 
eighteen years ago. 
Like their artistic predecessors in the 
movement, the newly vocal scientists 
are concerned with civil liberties and 
creative freedom. But most of them are 
also motivated by the realization that 
the dead hand of Soviet conformity has 
throttled research and development, and 
may ultimately consign their country to 
technological backwater (box, page 
32). Few of the dissenters are Western-
style democrats; what they seek is an 
enlightened Soviet system. But even that 
relatively modest demand confronts the 
cautious bureaucrats in the Kremlin with 
their gravest challenge of the post-Stalin 
era. In all likelihood, the issue will not 
be settled soon. But the government's 
painful dilemma?whether to bend with 
the winds of change or to crack down 
savagely on dissent?may ultimately hold 
the key to the success or failure of the 
Marxist experiment in Russia. 
In a sense, the father of current Soviet 
dissent was Nikita Khrushchev. By in-
augurating the de-Stalinization campaign 
in 1956, Khrushchev raised many hopes 
and, quite unintentionally, sparked the 
birth of a literary counterculture. Under 
Khrushchev, Solzhenitsyn was permitted 
to publish his novel "One Day in the Life 
of Ivan Denisovich"?a searing indict-
ment of Stalin's prison camps. Even this 
much dissent, however, alarmed the 
gray bureaucrats who succeeded Khru-
shchev, and soon the government began 
to crack down again. In early 1968, it 
staged what was to become the Soviet 
Union's Dreyfus case?the trial of writers 
Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, both 
of whom were sentenced to prison camp 
for having sent "anti-Soviet" manuscripts 
abroad for publication. 
Prison: Dissent did not approach its 
present stage, however, until men like 
Solzhenitsyn edged off the 
sidelines. Solzhenitsyn's first 
timid step into political in-
volvement?a series of wartime 
letters to a friend in which he 
criticized Stalin?had earned 
him eight years in a labor 
camp. And after his release, he 
carefully avoided politics, set-
tling down to a quiet job teach-
ing mathematics in a provincial 
city. But then Solzhenitsyn 
turned to literature, and it was 
his evolution into a novelist 
of conscience that eventually 
brought him back to criticism 
of the regime. Thus, in 1967, 
he wrote to the Writers' Union 
demanding an end to the cen-
sorship that had "smothered, 
gagged and slandered" his 
novels 'The First Circle" Etnd 
"Cancer Ward." The next year, 
Andrei Sakharov, an illustrious 
physicist who is known as one 
of the "fathers" of the Soviet 
hydrogen bomb, published a 
liberal manifesto, in which 
he declared: "Intellectual free-
dom is essential to human so-
ciety." And early last year, 
Zhores Medvedev, a biologist 
who had aiready marls a name 
for himself by exposing Stalin's 
crackpot court scientist, Trofim 
Lysenko, lashed out furiously 
at censorship of the mails. 
At first, the new dissenters were un-
organized, if only because Soviet law 
forbids the formation of anything that 
resembles a political opposition group. 
But events were soon to convince some 
scientists that they would be better off 
hanging together. Last May, when Med-
vedev was arrested and hustled off to a 
mental institution. Solzhenitsyn joined 
the vast public outcry that quickly won 
the biologist his freedom and eventually 
even a new job. And when a less re-
nowned scientist, Leningrad mathemati-
cian Revolt Pimertov, was slapped into 
prison, Sakharov and two of his col-
leagues broke the organizational ice by 
setting up a "Human Rights Committee. 
In December, Solzhenitsyn himself 
joined up as an honorary member. 
Ilven though they were kept from the 
attention of the average Russian, these 
actions made waves that are still rippling 
across the world of Soviet art and science. 
Still other eminent figures have been 
drawn into the fray. As the official press 
heaped fresh abuse on Solzhenitsyn, the 
cellist Mstislav Rostropovich?who had 
taken the novelist into his country dacha 
outside Moscow?leapt to his friend's de-
fense in an open letter to four Russian 
newspapers. When the authorities re-
taliated by barring Rostropovich from a 
scheduled conceit, two other distin-
guished musicians, violinist David Ois-
trakh and pianist Sviatoslav Richter, re-
fused to participate in the concert until 
Rostropovich had been reinstated. The 
battle, however, did riot end there, for 
last week, Rostropovich's public appear-
ances abroad for the next six months 
were canceled, and his wife, the soprano 
Galina Vishnevskaya, was abruptly 
dropped from a Moscow performance of 
"Madame Butterfly." 
? Yet for all their. ,fame, men like Ros-
tropovich, Oistrakh and Richter are not 
vitally important to the bureaucrats who 
rule the nation. "The Soviet regime can 
get along perfectly well without its poets 
or musicians," says one Western Kremlin-
ologist. "But it can't get along so well 
without its technical elite." It is thus a 
cause of considerable concern to the 
men in th?e Kremlin that many Russian 
scientists feel increasingly alienated from 
their society. Ipartly, this estrangement is 
due to the steady encroachments of neo-
Stalinism. "Some time ago, we scholars 
lost our sense of personal security," math-
ematician Pimenov said shortly before he 
was jailed. "For scientific work, one must 
be certain of tomorrow.". No less im-
portant, scientific dissent is also fostered 
by a growing awarenesa that censorship 
and political orthodoxy are severe handi-
caps to Soviet research, as well as to the 
,country's technological capabilities. 
Perhaps the most common complaint 
among Soviet scientists is that they are 
often denied access to foreign scientific 
books and journals and thus fail to keep 
pace with developments abroad. Accord-
ing to various estimates, the Soviet Union 
obtains considerably less than half of the 
technical periodicals that are published 
in the world each year. Even those pub-
lications it does subscribe to are slow in 
reaching their destinations; Glavlit, the 
state censorship agency, insists upon du-
plicating periodicals and removing cer-
tain advertisements, and this process 
alone can take six months or more. In 
many fields, furthermore, new develop-
ments are occurring so rapidly that the 
journals cannot keep up with them; non-
Soviet scientists stay abreast through let-
ters and conversation 8 with foreign col-
leagues, but this possibility is not open to 
most Russian. scientists. "We are even 
encountering difficulty comprehending 
some foreign publications we receive be-
cause we are not familiar with all the 
long discussions that preceded articles in 
them," admitted a study published in 
Moscow two years ago. "Sometimes we 
have to form special groups to 'decode' 
these unintelligible reports ... All this 
may take several years." 
Refusal: Soviet scientists also have 
scant oppOrtunity to attend conferences 
in other countries, which are a gold 
mine of news and ideas for researchers. 
Russian delegations to these affairs are 
usually small and closely guarded by the 
KGB, the state security police, and they 
generally consist of older executives, 
rather than young innovators. In his 
book "The Medvedev Papers," (which 
will be published next June by Macmil-
lan), Zhores Medvedev describes how 
his superiors frequently declined confer-
ence invitations on his behalf "due to 
extreme overpressure of work." On one 
such occasion the very day when he 
was supposed to address a prestigious 
gathering in Britain Medvedev's "prior 
obligation" consisted of helping with the 
potato harvest in the fields outside his 
laboratory at Obninsk, in Kaluga prov-
ince. "Can we imagine a European sci-
entist, 50 to 60 years old, who has never

once traveled beyond the limits of his 
own county, nor ever taken part in an 
international =cling abroad, nor ever 
once visited a foreign laboratory, even in 
neighboring countries?" asks Medvedev. 
"Of course we cannot imagine it; it 
would be impossible in England, France 
or Belgium. But in the U.S.S.R. this is 
still true of most scientists." 
Because of their isolation, Soviet re-
touchers waste much of their time. In 
1961, Medvedev reports, 85 per cent of 
the Soviet Union's inventions merely du-
plicated earlier foreign discoveries, and 
there is no reason to believe that Russia 
has closed the gap in subsequent years. 
Thus, in the interests of efficiency, if 
nothing else, the active dissidents in 
Soviet science are eager to tear down 
the mental iron curtain that surrounds 
their laboratories. "The source of our 
difficulties is not the socialist system," 
Sakharov, physicist Valentin Turchin 
and historian Roy Medvedev (who is 
Zhores Medvedev's twin brother) in-
sisted last year in an open letter to the 
top Soviet leadership. "[The] source is 
the anti-democratic traditions and norms 
of public life which appeared dur-
ing Stalin's period and have not been 
completely liquidated down to the pres-
ent time." 
Factions: Despite their prominence, 
the dissident scientists and their allies in 
the arts have no monopoly on protest in 
Russia; a whole spectrum of loosely 
organized groups?ranging from clusters 
of Ukrainian and Baltic separatists to 
Jews, Baptists andChristian socialists?
are arrayed against the government. But 
although these latter groups are gener-
ally dedicated to the overthrow of the 
established order (or least to making 
good their escape from it), it appears 
that, apart from the Jews, their impact 
pn Soviet society hardly extends beyond 
the barbed-wire perimeters of its 1,000 
prison camps. In comparison, the impact 
A the dissident intellectuals is consider-
ible. Some foreign observers, however, 
liscern a potentially damaging split in 
the "respectable" opposition among the 
_ntelligentsia. According to this theory, 
one group?composed of influential men 
like Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov?hopes 
to change Soviet society from within and 
hews more or less strictly to legal forms 
of protest. The other faction, made up of 
younger dissenters?most of them artists 
?is frustrated by a lack of influence and, 
as a result, has moved into activities 
at lie outside Soviet law. 
"They fight the authorities," one Rus-
"an says of these mavericks. "They con-
front them directly. They do not have 
the fear of the labor camp in their 
bones." Thus, in addition to filing formal 
protests, lending moral support when 
their friends stand trial and signing the 
petitions that play a time-honored role 
in Russian dissent, these rebels stage il-
legal demonstrations, write articles, sto-
ries and poems in samizdat ("self-pub-
lished") form and pass around smudged 
carbon copies of A Chronicle of Current 
Events, the Soviet Union's principal 
underground newspaper. "Thank you, 
Party, goes a poem in ono issue of the 
Chronicle, "for all you have done and 
aro doim to nurture the hatred we fool 
today. Thank you, Party." 
Friends: Life is a hand-to-mouth busi-
ness for young dissenters on the fringe of 
the intelligentsia. Most are unable to 
obtain the kind of jobs for which they 
were trained, and since unemployment 
makes them vulnerable to imprisonment 
or exile to Siberia as "parasites," they 
take on menial work whenever they can 
find it. (Ironically, it is useful to have 
been ruled "insane" by the KGB; a num-
ber of quite lucid nonconformista?get 
around the requirement that they must 
hold jobs by drawing pensions for their 
alleged mental disability.) But money is 
the least of their worries, for in the free-
wheeling underground scene, a frugal 
dissenter can live well enough if he op-
erates on the age-old Russian principle 
that it is better to have 100 friends than 
1,000 rubles. 
Andrei Amalrik, the 32-year-old his-
torian whose book "Will the Soviet Un-
ion Survive Until 1984?" predicts that 
his country will disintegrate into total 
chaos, is in many ways typical of his 
generation of dissenters. His last "recog-
nized" job was as an occasional feature 
writer for the Novosti press agency in 
1967, and until recently, when he was 
sentenced to three years in a labor camp, 
Amalrik applied for one marginal job 
after another. Each time, the KGB 
scared off prospective employers until 
finally the young historian landed a po-
sition as a reader to a blind man. In a 
material sense at least, Amalrik clearly 
had little to lose. "A man like Sakha-
rov," observes a Western student of So-
viet affairs, "has reached his prime; he 
can say: 'What can they do to me?' 
Andrei Amalrik and those who are like 
him have so little hope of anything that 
they can say: 'What does it matter what 
they do to us?'" 
For all their cool determination, how-
ever, Amalrik and his friends?and even 
Sakharov and his more influential col-
leagues?are nonentities to most Rus-
sians. The average Soviet citizen, in fact, 
belongs to a "Silent Majority" of such 
awesome docility that, by comparison, 
the most conventional middle-class 
American might almost be a Weather-
man. "This country has no tradition of 
freedom," says a young  magazine editor, 
"and that's why there's not going to be 
any." Adds another gloomy writer: 
'Nothing will change this country in our 
lifetime. The lower classes are unhappy,

lotion entre les politiques sovietique et americaine : cette nor-
malisation globale se manifeste certes par des interventions 
diverses, plus on moms violentes selon les circonstances ; tcuttot 
communes, tantat reparties selon one division des roles dans 
les parties du monde qui e,chappent if la sphere d'intervention 
commune. Quand, comme au Vietnam ou et Cuba, la lutte 
heroique d'un people ou la victoire d'une revolution ne per-
met:tent pas a PU.R.S.S. de se soustraire a one caution ou a an 
,appui, celle-ci exerce en contrepartie one pression ,et lin condi-
tionnement politiques ; quand la lutte armee a des origines 
plus foibles comme au Cambodge ou en Palestine, les grandes 
puissances s'accordent pour isoler et tenter de reduire a des 
phenomenes marginaux ces minorites revolutionnaires. A l'in-
lerieur de chaque camp, les deux puissances se reconnaissent 
un droit reciproque de police internationale : les Etats-Unis 
accordent pea de gravite a l'intervention en Tche,coslavaquie, 
freine in tulle arniee en Amerigue Latine ou an Mo yen

Cette orientation conduit a un ,aboutissement &gigue : soit

sclerosees, d'une 4: deformation opportuniste et bureaucratique?,

repreadre la vieille formale ?reforrne ou revolution? ; pour 
noire part, nous ne croyons pas a la reforme possible des 
appareils staliniens, ici aussi line revolution est a faire. 
anssi pourquoi nous pensons qu'il faut tout 
faire pour sortir do cercle vicieux dans lequel est crujour-
dhui bloquee la gauche revolutionnaire entre un parti comma-
niste impuissant de degager de Pinterieur one nouvelle force ; 
et de nouveaux militants incapables de s'unifier pour devenir 
un point de reference exterieur. tine extraordinaire force 
potentielle est ainsi gaspillee. ,C'est pour quoi nous pensons

MESSAGE du 
BUREAU NATIONAL DU P.S.U. 
Le Porti Sochititle U nit ill, c voulu s'associer ce soir, comme iis'y 
est associe de toutes ses forces mtlitantes, en 1968, a la ,protestation 
que des militants du mouvement communiste international elevent 
contre le maintien de l'occupation militaire russe en Tchecoslovaquie 
et contre la repression qui continue de se developper contre les mili-
tants revolutionnaires tchecoslovoques, don't le tseul crime est de 
jeter a to face des occupants le vieux mot d'ordre du mouvement 
socioliste international : ? Un peuple qui en opprirne un outre ne 
sou roit etre un ,peuple libre ?. 
Les ,evenements qui se sont &routes en Europe depuis 1968 ont 
demontre l'inanite des arguments invoques par le Parti Communiste 
de l'Union Sovietique pour justifier ['intervention des forces armees 
du Pacte de Varsovie contre la Tchecoslovaquie socialiste. Que l'on 
se souvienne que le pretexte de ['invasion fut Ia volonte pretee aux 
dirigeants tchecoslovaques de renouer des relations diplomatiques avec 
la Republique Federate Allemande ; que Von s'en souviennen cores la 
signature du Pacte Allemagne Federale-U.R.S.S. et du pacte germano-
polonais. 
En realite, nut ne s'est trompe sur les mobiles reels de l'inter-
vention sovietique : c'est le jour oU la Republique Populaire Tcheco-
slovaque a commence de s'orienter irresistiblement vers 'organisation 
des consents ouvriers, de la base au sommet ; a commence, dans l'en-
thousiasme de tout le peuple tchecoslovaque, de batir cette democratie 
des producteurs sans lesquels ii n'est que des caricatures de socia-
lisme, que l'armee sovietique a lance ses blind& contre les ouvriers 
tcheques et slovaques. 
Et nous n'oublions pas que, comme un signe premonitoire, la 
presse officielle sovietique a desapprouve en termes identiques ceux 
de nos gouvernants capitalistes, le grand mouvement revolutionnaire 
frangais de mai 1968. 
La restauration de la democratie socialiste en Tchecoslovaquie, 
l'evacuation des troupes sovieticoes est une necessite absolue pour 
le developpement des mouvernents revolutionnaires dans les pays capi-
talistes d'Europe occidentale. 
La coexistence pacifique des puissances imperiales de l'Est et de 
l'Quest est la Sainte-Alliance des rois contre les peuples. Ensemble, 
nous la briserons.

Vous venez de vivre ? ou de revivre ? ce meeting 
de solidarite internationale a nos camarades tcheco-
slovaques et comprenez la necessite de ne pas laisser 
le voile de l'oubli tomber sur l'oppression dont us sont 
victimes. 
C'est vrai que, pour les larges masses, l'affaire tche-
coslovaque s'estompe et que des evenements nouveaux, 
dramatiques sont mis en avant, imposes par l'actualite 
politique, comme Burgos, Gdanzk et Gydnia, le proces 
de Leningrad, etc. Mais la protestation contre les denis 
de justice, la repression meurtriere, les atteintes aux 
libertes des peuples ? dans lesquels malheureusement 
des pays socialistes tiennent aussi la vedette ? ne dolt 
pas nous faire oublier un instant les freres ,< norma-
lises >, de la Tchecoslovaquie occupee ; le combat pour 
leur independance, pour leur droit de democratiser le 
socialisme, est inseparable des autres luttes que nous 
avons a mener. 
Justement, parce que les staliniens d'U.R.S.S. et 
de France, d'accord sur ce point avec l'imperalisme inter-
national, veulent qu'on ne pane plus de la Tchecoslo-
vaquie; qu'on considere cette occupation et ses conse-
quences comme un fait acquis, nous devons sans cesse 
mobiliser les partisans du socialisme, alerter l'opinion : 
c'est le seul moyen de saisir aux poignets les neo-
stalintens et d'empecher que la normalisation >, s'etende 
a des arrestations, a des proces, a des condamnations

MEETING OF INTERNATIONAL DISSIDENT COMMUNISTS ON CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
[Selected speeches from booklet edited by "Committee of 5 January"; 
Paris, Le Meeting du 26 Novembre 1970 -- Discours et Messages, 
French, pp 3-9, 11-14, 16-33, 36 and 43-45]

P 31  
On 26 November 1970, the Great Hall of the Mutual Insurance 
Building in Paris was filled with the partisans of socialism, 
both young and veteran, students, workers, white-collar em-
ployees, civil servants, cadres, and intellectuals with 
various leanings. 
For the first time, a meeting was being held for the renewal 
of sotialism -- this was therefore not an anti-Soviet or 
anticommunist meeting -- and against the deviations which 
disfigure it, such as the armed intervention against 
Czechoslovakia and the ensuring "normalization." 
While the bureaucratic distortions and those responsible 
for them were being denounced, the socialist regime was 
exalted there and the presence of foreign communists, of 
noncommunist supporters of socialism, on the speaker's 
platform reflected at once the spirit of international-
ism and union in which the "Committee of 5 January," the 
organizer of this event, had prepared the meeting. 
The speeches and messages read from the speaker's rostrum 
have been collected and constitute this modest brochure 
which each reader is invited to publicize or disseminate; 
the purpose is to leave a record of this important event 
which undoubtedly will have its aftereffects. 
For a socialist and independent Czechoslovakia; for the 
renewal of socialism.

Speech by Charles Tillon 
I want to thank you for coming to this meeting organized by 
the Committee of 5 January for a free and socialist Czechoslovakia 
with the support of organizations inspired by these same feelings. 
I deeply appreciate the honor which was bestowed upon me in 
having me preside over this assembly before you, side by side with 
the men of high conscience and great merit whom I salute in your name. 
They will speak tonight in a Paris that is faithful to its duty and 
to its proudest traditions. In a Paris which thinks of Prague, a 
Paris which is Paris only in the fight for liberty. 
We have gathered here to assert our brotherly and active soli-
darity with the people of Czechoslovakia but also for the purpose of 
giving this solidarity a new impetus, worthy of the history of the 
French working class and of all currents of thought which aspire to 
socialism in France. 
On this rostrum, I salute -- in your name, with respect and 
affection -- the presence of our Comrade Jiri Pelikan, by right the 
irrevocable member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Czechoslovakia, which was to meet at its regular congress on the eve 
of the very day when tanks, with misled soldiers perched on them, 
restored a brand of barracks socialism in Prague. We have gathered 
here to proclaim that, though some people may have to leave their 
country so that they will not have to shut up, there are no expat-
riates for a communist because there is not just a single Fatherland 
of socialism but rather a whole world to be won, for all socialists. 
We have gathered here to recall that it was Marx who proposed the 
universal declaration of the rights of socialist man, which confounds 
all of its adulterers. We have gathered here in the name of those 
who, in our country, share the same feelings, the same determination 
to address our virile and brotherly homage to the Czechoslovak people, 
and our duties as fighters for socialism with a human face, since 
a pleonasm has become indispensable in our language so as to dis-
tinguish that which has perished from that which remains most noble 
for the future of all mankind. It is under this sign that our meet-
ing tonight assumes its international significance of solidarity 
with the Czechoslovak people and with all peoples who are fighting 
for their liberty and their independence. 
Everything we know about the outraged Czech people makes us 
feel its indignation, its sufferings, and makes us admire its un-
quenchable courage. But the thing we are most concerned with now, 
the thing that you expect from this assembly, is that which will

help us do something useful, in other words, anything that can help 
wipe out the consequences of the crime which was committed against 
an entire people. One thing we are sure of and that is that the 
cause of socialism in Prague Is invincible and that there will be no 
more resignation of conscience on the part of the supporters of soc-
ialism and liberty in our country. 
That would just about conclude my remarks here if I had not 
felt the need.personally to bear witness here to the irrepressible 
love of the Czechoslovak people for liberty by telling you in a few 
words what I think about its past trials and tribulations. First of 
all I might recall the Prague I knew once upon a time, in 1938, in 
the very heart of all of the torments of a Europe threatened by 
Hitler. Above all, I want to tell you why I think as I do. Amid 
all of the blood shed in two wars, we think back first of all to the 
first of these wars, which was called the "War of Right" because we 
were made to believe that we were fighting for the freedom of peoples 
to settle their own affairs! This is not the story of a veteran 
fighter, a story which helps make the young people laugh at the ex-
pense of the past while this veteran is offered -- by way of the 
future -- only the political gerontology of the men in power or their 
compliant allies. 
It was during this first world war -- and my communist heart 
still beats joyfully as I think of this -- that an immense people won 
its freedom to settle its own affairs through a triumphant revolution 
in October 1917! It was then that the partisans of socialism through-
out the world had the duty to join ranks to defend the country of 
the Soviets. 
In France, moreover, we faced the duty of confronting the gov-
ernment in order to smash foreign intervention against the first coun-
try which had joined battle for a socialist way. There were communists 
-- who at that time were not card-carrying because there was no party 
-- who asserted themselves in action against their own government by 
proclaiming "that a people which oppresses another people cannot be 
a free people." I say this in order not to cast the shadows of the 
present over the past. I say this also because, after more than 50 
years, it is up to all peoples to judge socialism in each country in 
terms of what it has taught them. When we see the genius of Soviet 
scientists animate their fantastic robot on the moon, we admire them. 
When these same scientists -- on the land on which they live -- demand 
simple respect for the rights of man as proclaimed by the French 
Revolution 180 years ago, we are not engaging in anti-Sovietism 
in holding that the time has come to revise that Sovietism there. 
But it is only Prague which I want to remember here now, the 
Prague whose firm friends we can count here tonight, I am sure, in

much groaLor numbers than there are cobblestones on its streets. 
It was a few days before Munich in 1938. I had gone there as a memher 
ot a doiegatton from the Centrai Committee of the French Communist 
Party, chat-IA(1d with assuring the Czech party of our active solidarity 
In the common defense of the cause of peace. Prague and Paris at that 
time looked as much alike as a couple of sisters. But Prague daily 
lived submerged in the popular mass that had come from all over the 
country to express to its government its determination to support it 
so as to preserve liberty and independence which were in peril. 
Suddenly the news arrived from Paris that France was mobilizing 
the first reserves of its army in order to confront the aggression 
which was feared at the time. In just an hour, before our very eyes, 
the city, at first fever-swollen, was emptied of all of its able-bodied 
men. Then night fell on an entire people, resolutely determined to 
make the greatest sacrifices. On that day in Prague I saw the un-
forgettable resolution of a great people. 
On his return to Paris, Daladier had himself acclaimed by a 
crowd -- still the same crowd, the crowd that turns up whenever there 
are great social fears -- acclaimed because, with Chamberlain, he had 
decided that they would abandon Czechoslovakia to its tragic fate. 
That was a betrayal of the interests of everyone and you know what mis-
fortunes followed this. 
I owe it to history to say that only in France did the Communist 
deputies and two or three others refuse to forget about the liberty 
of the Czech people and vote against the crime of Munich. This duty 
is the honor of a party. 
When the Germans occupied the Sudetenland, I had to go to Prague, 
in the name of the International Red Cross, to help organize solidar-
ity with the revolutionary militants who had to flee before the in-
vader. One day I was slowly crossing St Charles Bridge, accompanied 
by a Prague comrade, when a Czech Army officer, who had heard us talk 
French, turned around and walked toward us. He clicked his heels. 
This soldier expressed his disgust over the fact that France had be-
trayed his country. He was one of those men of duty, whose face I 
see again and again, under the occupation, when we dreamed of liberty 
for all nations. 
Finally, when the people had defeated fascism -- and we must 
not forget the measure of sacrifice made by each people -- I had the 
tremendous joy, in Prague, in 1947, on the occasion of a memorial 
ceremony, to run into the old comrades of the FTP [Franctireurs of 
the Fatherland] who were among the best who had fought in the French 
Resistance. But my happiness quickly gave way to pain as I thought 
of those who had suffered under torture or who were assassinated 
during the term of office of Novotny, the normalizer before January...

The Czechoslovak people rallied around the Communist Party, 
which at last produced its popular and creative air, by driving him 
and other persecutors out. This, then, is the place for the glory 
of the Prague Spring, its drama and the struggle that remains, a 
struggle to which we give our determination and our strength. For us, 
Czechoslovakia remains in the very heart of the struggle for a peace 
which we really want without any strings attached. But it also has 
no liberty in the center of a Europe where -- through it is fortunately 
true that the forces of social progress have, in West Germany, driven 
back those who still feel sorry about having lost the war -- on the 
other hand the spirit of Munich has reappeared in the shadow of Yalta, 
with the abandonment of the Czech people who are political prisoners 
and prisoners of a certain war potential -- in a word, delivered up to 
the political and military subversion of an occupation which, before 
all the world, is but the denial of socialism. 
In France, unfortunately, we cannot teach anyone any lessons 
in socialism. For that, we tend to forget too often that the people 
are also responsible for their rulers. But our experience in 1968 will 
not be distorted by those "who try to wash away the stains with dirty 
hands." We assert our confidence in the struggle that will enable 
France to have a socialist, democratic, and independent future, a 
struggle for the action alliance of all partisans of socialism through-
out the world. 
This is the way we want to make our friendship and our soli-
darity with the people of Czechoslovakia effective in this trial from

Messaae of Edward Goldstucker, Member, Central Committee, Czechoslovak 
Communist Party 
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, dear comrades. 
I would have liked to greet you in person but since I am un-
able to do so, permit me to tell you something, in a few words, which 
I have always wanted to bring to your attention. 
I am convinced that the 1968 Prague Spring, that is, the effort 
of the Communist Party and the people of Czechoslovakia to establish 
a socialist democratic regime corresponding to the needs, the level 
of development, and the traditions of this country, will -- in the 
history of socialism -- be considered as a historical event and ex-
perience comparable to the glorious Paris Commune.

To all those who fight for socialism, to all those who would 
like to see a just and free social order emerge from the threatening 
crises of our times, the Prague Spring -- in spite of its brutal sup-
pression -- will serve as an indication of the real possibility of 
socialism with a human face, that is, a socialist regime that 
springs from the revolution, that introduces the guarantees of the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the citizen into its structure, 
and that thus creates conditions under which all production forces, 
all creative energies of society may be mobilized to attain its goals. 
This is why the Czechoslovak effort in 1968 everywhere, among 
socialists and democrats alike, triggered such great interest and 
this is why its suppression is not a "family affair" between Moscow 
and Prague, as the "normalizers" insist in picturing it as, but 
rather a vital issue for the destiny of socialism throughout the en-
tire world. 
Do not forget, dear comrades and friends, no matter where you 
are, that it is your cause which is at stake today in that little 
country in the center of our continent.

Message from Communist Party_ of Australia 
The Communist Party of Australia unequivocally maintains its 
position on 21 August 1968, that is, that the occupation of Czecho-
slovakia by the armed forces of the USSR and the other four powers 
of the Warsaw Pact was unjustified and unjustifiable. 
On 5 January 1968, the Czechoslovak Communist Party had adopted 
a new course toward a socialist democracy and toward worker self-
management. This new support received massive popular support from 
the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and students in the Czech and 
Slovak parts of the country. The Australian Communist Party hailed 
this as one of the most important developments for the future of the 
world revolution. 
The reasons given to justify the occupation were wrong and un-
founded. The occupation has struck at the very cause of socialism in 
Czechoslovakia and in the entire world and it has moreover tarnished 
the prestige of the Soviet Union and the other countries implicated 
in this. 
The events which occurred in Czechoslovakia afterward neither 
repaired, nor mitigated the misdeeds that had been committed; on the 
contrary, they reduced the chances of socialism in that country.

The only possible outcome is that which comes from the soc-
ialist principles in the matter of international relations, such as 
they were established by Marx and developed by Lenin: immediate 
withdrawal of all occupation troops, restoration of national inde-
pendence and of the autonomy of the Czech and Slovak nations, of their 
communist parties, of their labor unions, and of all their mass organ-
izations, so that they may resume their own road toward a renewal of 
socialism and progress toward democracy.

Address  by a Young Czechoslovak Revolutionary Socialist Woman 
I am happy to be able to speak at this meeting on the basis of 
communist positions. As a matter of fact, until very recently the 
Stalinists were able to block any criticism coming from the left-wing 
opposition. The very fact that this meeting could be held, shows that 
we have turned another page in history. 
We have witnessed the process of renewal in Czechoslovakia in 
1968 and the "Prague Spring" has become a famous word throughout the 
world. Today, after 2 years, we can better appreciate its develop-
ment and its rapid fall. 
In 1968 the economic and social crisis reached such a degree 
that a change in the political concept became a necessity for the 
majority of the ruling bureaucracy itself. The discontent of the 
workers and their aspiration for a change also played a great role. 
But this process had to be imposed against the will of the 
conservative and Stalinist wing which held dominant positions in the 
party and government machine, positions gained during the fifties. 
The changes to come thus fundamentally threatened their personal in-
terests. 
This meant that the Dubcek win had to obtain support from cer-
tain groups outside the party, groups which criticized the Novotny 
leadership. 
The change which appeared in the beginning as a purely internal 
affair within the party, soon -- thanks to the mass communications 
media -- became the affair of the entire people. The reaction to 
this change was quite a bit more spontaneous than the new leadership 
had anticipated. The ceaselessly growing activity of the masses in

the implementation of these changes sprang from the working class's 
aspiration to participate in the management of the state. 
The reformist wing had been incapable of taking the lead in 
this activity and becoming a real worker vanguard. 
This leadership instead tried to channel this activity in an 
artificial manner. This led to Sik's conception of the worker coun-
cils and, shortly afterward, the almost identical official proposals 
revealing the ideological and political roots of the liberal wing in 
Stalinism. 
In none of the official concepts -- coming either from the 
labor unions, or from the different variants of the government proj-
ects concerning socialist enterprise -- do we find the idea of the 
political centralization of the councils and the resultant creation 
of new power structures of the working class and all other working 
people. In other words, the institution of the direct power of the 
workers. This was a technocratic conception, entailing a real danger 
that these councils might degenerate, as we saw in Yugoslavia. 
Material incentive was emphasized, first and foremost, and the 
emancipation of man and his participation in the constant changes in 
society only played a secondary role. 
in spite of this, this evolution triggered fears in the Kremlin 
whose propaganda increasingly emphasized the danger of counterrevolu-
tion which supposedly existed among us. 
In spite of the inability of the reformist wing to become an 
authentically Marxist vanguard, we must emphasize the fact that it 
remained a guarantor against a possible restoration of capitalism on 
the political level and on the government level. Those who dared talk 
of such a danger in Czechoslovakia in 1968 are the same who identified 
the Novotny regime with socialism. 
Bourgeois propaganda did not really have any outlook in Czecho-
slovakia. The biggest example of bourgeois propaganda which the Krem-
lin could cite -- and while I was in Czechoslovakia I became sure that 
they did everything they could do along those lines -- is the Manifesto 
of 2,000 Words which urges the workers to organize themselves in 
worker councils. 
One of the most positive aspects of this evolution was that, 
for the first time in 20 years, there developed a broad political 
discussion on the contradictions of our society as well as an in-
creasingly consistent criticism of the past.

Only the upsurge in the activity of the masses could guarantee 
their true advance. Its most progressive manifestation was the spon-
taneous constitution of the worker councils. That was the beginning 
of a true revolutionary process whose fundamental aspect was not 
understood by the Czechoslovak Communist Party. 
There is however no doubt that Dubcek's policy was able to 
prepare the ground for the development of socialism, that is to say, 
of a society which would exclusively be based on the activity of the 
organized masses. 
It seems to us however that this process could onlyhave been 
managed better, in terms of all of its consequences, by a new 
vanguard which politically and ideologically was not weighted down 
by the distortions of the past. This new vanguard is neither a pro-
duct of our thought, nor an attempt to import tendencies from capi-
talist countries into Czechoslovakia. 
It was primarily in the eyes of the younger generation that 
the Czechoslovak Communist Party was unable fully to satisfy its needs. 
Its policy did not guarantee the new generation any sufficient pros-
pects. This distrust on the part of the younger generation has mani-
fested itself many times -- especially in August 1969 -- and is be-
ginning to take on specific organizational forms. This is not a con-
flict between the generations but rather the establishment of a new 
revolutionary concept which would install a government of the workers, 
organized at the base, in the place of the power of the bureaucracy. 
The antibureaucratic movement and the aspirations of the Czecho-
slovak workers to manage their own affairs themselves however can be 
realized only under the condition that there be a new revolutionary 
Marxist party which, tying in with recent and comparable experiences, 
would fight for proletarian democracy. 
We cannot condemn the intervention of the five Warsaw Pact 
powers only on the basis of moral positions and because the funda-
mental rules of international law were violated. The intervention, 
which was designed to prevent the counterrevolution, in fact had to 
defend the interests of the bureaucracy. 
Its consequence is an even greater blot on socialism in the 
eyes of the broadest strata and especially in the eyes of the younger 
generation. 
Likewise we must condemn the fact that the activity of the 
workers and especially of the working class in the enterprises was 
wiped out to a great extent by this act.

We will under no circumstances accept this state of affairs.

ially we of the younger generation will fight against this. 
We believe that this struggle for a true proletarian democracy

Message of Ernst Fischer  
Dear friends and comrades: 
I am very sorry that my poor health does not permit me to 
attend this meeting with you. 
The democratic revolution of the Czechs and Slovaks and the 
birth of a socialist democracy in Europe were more than just a his-
torical interlude: they furnished proof that a socialist democracy 
was possible, that it was the best way to arm the people, to give it 
initiative, to bring to bloom friendship, solidarity, imagination, 
and the full awareness of what was beginning to be born there. 
We entertain no illusions: the defeat of socialism in Czecho-
slovakia has not been imposed for just a short period of time. But 
the agreement among peoples in the struggle for their liberty, in 
Indochina, in Latin America, in Spain, and in Greece is inseparable 
from the struggle for liberty in Czechoslovakia, a struggle which is 
not over because the irresistible force of the people will wind up 
by putting an end to the "big-power" policy.

Speech by Vercors 
It is possible that the date of 21 August 1968 will go down in 
history as the darkest day in the second half of the 20th century. 
The extent of a human catastrophe is not necessarily measured by the 
blood that was spilled, by the number of dead, but by the gravities 
of the immediate and the more distant repercussions. The intervention 
in Budapest, 14 years ago, had already rudely hurt revolutionary

C onsciences. The Red Army had rived upon the people: That is where it 
lost its innocence. At least we learned later on that the danger ot a 
counterrevolution, followed by the danger of a third world war, had not 
been negligible. Armed intervention found an excuse there, in the ab-
sence of justification. We know without the slightest shadow of a doubt 
that no such danger accompanied the Prague Spring. That, on the contrary, 
this spring gave the communist parties of the entire world an audience which 
they had never had before. At the very same time after the May Barri-
cades, the French bourgeoisie were no less afraid of this glimmer to the 
East which seemed to build a bridge of revolution in truth and joy between 
Paris and Prague. The intervention of the Soviets served to reassure it, 
much more so than the intervention of the CRS [Republican Security Com-
panies]. Order prevailed in Prague and order prevailed in Paris 
One could once again sleep peacefully. Especially so since the impact 
that had been felt throughout the world by the sister parties had so shaken 
these parties that they could not stop disintigrating. And so it was rather 
with the help of the Soviet government that the walls fell, as if after an 
earthquake 
For a long time the bourgeoisie no longer had reason to fear 
that a revolution might spring from these walls which were crumbling. 
The important thing thus was to rebuild them. But we entertained no 
illusions: this is a long-term job. Especially since it must not 
and cannot be undertaken against the existing parties which still have 
the confidence of the majority of the workers. The thing now is to 
get everyone to become aware of what is going on because this aware-
ness will serve as the rallying point for this reconstruction. 
The ideal thing would be for the criminal error of 21 August 
to be revealed in all of its gravity as a cataclysm, if not to those 
who committed it and who certainly would never agree that they were 
wrong, then at least to the most honest and the most clear-sighted 
elements in Moscow and Prague. 
This is why I personally believe that we must never put an end 
to our protests, that we must never abandon ourselves to resignation 
and fatigue. The future of socialism undoubtedly will cost us that 
price.

to a reproach -- to the effect that they feel somewhat forgotten. 
Not just in the diplomatic sense but also forgotten by us, their 
friends, those of us who are forced to confront the problems we 
face each day in our lives. 
One could reply to this quite legitimate concern by paraphras-
ing the formula of Jaures, changing just one word in it: 
"If we look at events in progress in a superficial manner, we 
actually overlook Czechoslovakia; but as we look into them, in depth, 
we always run into Czechoslovakia." 
The thing that links the unsubjugated of Prague to the sacri-
fices of Annam is that Yaltatization of world policy, the policy of 
blocs which actually blocks the policy of the progressive movements. 
And the thing that unites the ousted comrades in Prague and 
Bratislava to those in other normalized parties is that very process 
of "normalization" which tends to cement all that which is abnormal 
in the worker movement. 
We must thus pose for ourselves the problem of solidarity 
with Czechoslovakia in a general framework. I would like to contri-
bute something to this by emphasizing two aspects of the problem here 
today: 
In our meetings with true socialists from the Soviet Union 
and from the people's democracies, we sometimes had trouble finding 
a common language. It so happens that they do not understand what 
is going on in the Left in the Western countries. The problems of 
the national liberation movements in the forgotten continents do not 
preoccupy them as much as they concern us. Haunted by the specter 
of Stalinism, they often repeat -- when the subject of China comes 
up -- the formulas presented by the official propaganda of their 
countries, although they detest it. We must clearly understand the 
difference in the points of departure: the documents which reach 
us from over there sometimes look a little bit too liberal to us; 
and those which reach them from us seem a little bit too democratic 
to them. One could say, by way of simplification: because they as-
pire to a true socialism, they speak above all of democracy; whereas 
we, who call for true democracy, speak above all about socialism. 
I know very well that this is an oversimplification, for what 
it may be worth, but I use it to bring out the specific nature of 
the conditions complicating attempts to find a basis of agreement 
and understanding with our friends from these countries.

Now, it seems to me that thLs is a prime necessity and that 
a revolutionary perspective, which would not take this necessity into 
account, would be nothing but a Leftist variant of the bloc policy. 
It is here that the experiences of Czechoslovakia and the knowledge 
of our Czechoslovak friends could help us find a link. 
For example, let us take the great idea of direct democracy 
of the producers which, in Czechoslovakia, found expression once 
again in the worker councils, in spite of all of their limitations. 
Today we often hear the phrase about the "Spring" according 
to which the issue was to make a synthesis between democracy and 
socialism in a socialist democracy. Presented by people who were 
nostalgic for democracy such as it was between the two wars, this 
formula cannot satisfy us. The synthesis of a socialism, which is 
not one with a democracy that was not one, could not lead to a soc-
ialist democracy. 
It is the return to the idea of direct democracy -- which 
penetrated the worker movement during the 10 days that shook the world 
-- which made the Czechoslovak worker councils so important during 
the 7 months that filled the worker movement with hope. 
This great idea, which was buried during the time of Stalin, 
shows the road to a true socialist democracy. The revolutionaries of 
East and West can meet thus from different points of departure. 
Here., it is the establishment of the fact that bourgeois demo-
cracy stops, at the entrance to the factory or the workshop. Over 
there, they already have the experience that, if self-management stops 
at the exit. of the factory or the workshop, if direct democracy is 
not extended to all areas, then self-management loses its life blood 
and we do not arrive at the State our classical authors describe as 
no longer existing in the true sense of the word. 
And we will then have to say: while young Marx wrote that 
the so-called Christian states are not a government expression of 
Christianity, one could add today that the so-called socialist "states" 
are not yet a government expression of socialism. 
Let me say it again: in the ideological crisis that pervades 
the worker movement in Europe we must place the question of soli-
darity with Czechoslovakia within the framework of an agreement of 
the progressive forces of East and West. The idea of direct demo-
cracy should permit us to find common ground. 
Now a few words on the second aspect of our solidarity with our 
Czechoslovak friends. We have recently observed certain interesting

signs in that country, especially the open polemic between the leader-
ship team that was imposed and the Stalinist extremists -- attempts 
at seduction to regain a party of technicians, postponement of trials 
that had been announced, release of a comrade who had been under 
arrest, etc. We know very well r:hat this is not a democratization 
of the "normalized" regime, not even a liberalization, and that this 
is not the time to proceed to an analysis of this mini-new-look, of 
its relationships with certain diplomatic negotiations, with economic 
difficulties, etc. However, one cannot make politics without taking 
into consideration all the nuances and it may be that, within some 
time, w c w 1 1 1 have posters announcing a debate meeting in the 
Lucerna Hall in Prague on the topic: "Tell me, Mr Bilak!" That is 
possible... 
But that changes nothing in the problems raised by 21 August 
1968 which are still with us, just as the questions taken up in the 
action program of the Czechoslovak Communist Party adopted in April 
1968 are still with us and just as we retain our conviction that fires 
were lighted, during that memorable year of 1968, in Paris and in 
Prague which one must not allow to go out. 
[pp 20-25] 
Speech by Roger Garaudy 
We must speak out here today because others must keep silent. 
The thing that was crushed by normalization in Prague is the 
historical initiative of an entire people and its Communist Party to 
build a model of socialism that would correspond to the requirements 
of their country. This is not an external event: this is a blow 
which directly strikes each one of us, each one of those who, through-
out the world, want to build socialism. 
There is no valid argument for remaining silent. 
The principle of noninterference in the affairs of another party 
is sometimes mentioned in this connection. 
But when the Soviet leaders -- in excommunicating Yugoslavia 
-- openly called upon the Yugoslav people to rise against the state 
and the party of their country, nobody said anything about noninter-
ference; people rivaled each other in hurling insults to justify 
Soviet interference.

When the Soviet leaders -- in an effort to exert political 
pressure against China -- broke all their contracts in order to 
disorganize its economy, many communist parties behaved as if they 
had no duty of proletarian internationalism toward the Chinese Com-
munists. Far from invoking no interference, they engaged in the 
worst slander to justify Soviet interference once again. 
When the Soviet leaders -- in the name of "normalization" --
imposed the Stalinist model upon Czechoslovakia, the same parties 
kept silent and this silence has the same purpose as the vocifer-
ations against Yugoslavia or against China. This was not, a matter 
of respecting the principle of no interference but rather of once 
again being an accomplice to Soviet interference. 
Some people also at length bring up the argument 
that any protest would only nurture anti-Soviet and anticommunist 
campaigns. But the thing that feeds anti-Soviet and anticommunist 
campaigns is the failure to denounce these crimes and the fact that 
one is an accomplice in them. It was not anti-Sovietism to denounce 
the crimes ?of Stalin; and it is not anti-Sovietism to denounce those 
of Brezhnev. On the other hand, one is only playing the game of all 
anticommunists when, through our silence, one approves a "normaliza-
tion" which gives communism a repugnant face. 
Finally we are told: "normalization" in Czechoslovakia is an 
external problem which does not concern the French people. This 
is another lie because the thing that was crushed in Czechoslovakia 
is the socialist future of France. 
From January to August 1968, the Czechoslovak communists showed 
that socialism is not the suppression of the conquests of bour-
geois democracy but is on the contrary the destruction of its limitations. 
At first, they ended censorship, political trials, the crime of 
expressing an opinion, all of the "formal" liberties which the capi-
talist countries no longer guarantee, as the recent political trials 
in the United States and France prove. 
Then they began to create the agencies of socialist democracy: 
a direct democracy, not a delegated and alienated democracy. In the 
capitalist countries, each worker, on one day every 3 or 4 years, is 
gladly given the title of sovereign individual on election Sunday, 
when he delegates and alienates all of his powers in one day; but on 
the next day, on Monday morning, he once again finds the monarchy of 
the bosses at the gates to his factory. Bourgeois democracy is thus 
based on a double lie: a political lie because, on this level, it is 
nothing but a delegated, alienated democracy; an economic lie because,

CPYRUHT 
on the economic level, democrncy is rodicnily excluded. The ntLempt 
at direct democracy represented by the worker councils marks the 
break with this capitalist system of the double lie and of the double 
abdication as well as the break with the model of a bureaucratic and 
authoritarian socialism where everything is decided "topside," by the 
party and government machines, speaking in the name of the working 
class, without the latter really becoming involved in the decision. 
With the creation of worker councils, Czechoslovak communists 
embarked upon the road of socialism as defined by Marx: a "free 
association of workers;" they embarked upon the road of socialism, as 
defined by Lenin when, before his death, he detected the first bureau-
cratic distortions and recalled that the Soviets could not only make 
socialism for the people but make it through the people; they embarked on 
the road of a socialism whose first concern was to release the histor-
ical initiatives of the masses, even though the conditions and the 
means may be very different: The initiative of the Paris Commune and 
of worker control during the October Revolution, the initiative of the 
Yugoslav self-management program and of the people's communes in China. 
Like the Paris Commune, like the Soviets in 1905, the worker councils 
in Czechoslovakia are a creation of the rank and file. The moment the 
party put an end to the system which had prevented the new generation 
from fully exercising its creative aptitudes, the impetus came from the 
bottom up, from the workers themselves: at the Wilhelm Pieck machine-
building plant the first initiative to create democratic economy manage-
ment agencies appeared. The real "Prague Spring" above all was that effort 
to set in motion the vast masses of the people who had been depoliticized 
by despotism and who were again becoming the true subject of history by 
passionately participating in the creation of their own future. 
The merit of the leaders is that they understood this and that 
they helped this movement develop. Now, from that point on, what are 
the mistakes which they could commit and which one inevitably makes 
when one embarks upon a new road, the moment these leaders have accom-
plished the first duty of any revolutionary leader: the duty of de-
tecting the direction of the great historical initiatives of the masses, 
helping them take shape and develop instead of imposing prefabricated 
frameworks upon them. Henceforth, in every enterprise, all of the 
workers, both manual and intellectuals, directly (and not through 
delegation to bureaucrats) decided everything that concerned the 
life of the enterprise. 
The worker council draft, prepared by the workers at the Wil-
helm Pieck plant, received the official support of the party and the 
State.

Thus hundreds of enterprise councils sprang up. On the basis 
of this living experience, the government published the draft of a 
basic law for the establishment of worker councils. That was in 
July 1968; the discussion and the voting were scheduled for the end 
of August; but the tanks crushed this hope during the night of 20 
August. 
Under Soviet occupation, at the 7th congress of the Czecho-
slovak labor unions, in March 1969, Karel Polacek, chairman of the 
Central Council of Labor Unions, came back to the concept of labor 
unions as held by Lenin who in 1920 said: "Our State is such today 
that the totally organized proletariat must defend itself and we must 
use these worker organizations in order to defend the workers against 
their State so that the workers may defend our State." One of 
the essential tasks of the labor unions, added Lenin, is "the struggle 
against the bureaucratic distortions of the Soviet apparatus." 
Vlastimil Toman, president of the Metal Workers Federation, 
told the same congress, in the name of 1 million metal workers, that 
his federation "was not inclined to pay for appeasement at the price 
of sacrificing civil rights and freedom of the press." 
Strougal, the Czech Politburo representative at that congress, 
made himself the spokesman of the Soviet occupiers when he demanded 
that the worker councils be dropped. His motion was rejected by the 
congress which represented more than 5 million workers. 
After that, by the will of the occupier, collaborator Strougal 
became chairman of the council, whereas Karel Polacek, chairman of 
the Central Council of Labor Unions, and Vlastimil Toman, president 
of the Metal Workers Federation, who had been reelected by the Con-
gress of Labor Unions, were stripped of their functions in November 
1970. A few weeks later the Soviet occupier ordered its "collabor-
ators" to abrogate the right to strike. "Normalization" is primar-
ily this: the systematic repression of any attempt on the part of 
the workers or the intellectuals to decide their own destiny for them-
selves. 
This is why all this is not just the affair of the Czechoslovak 
people. It is the affair of all of us. This is why we have not come 
here today at this sad moment in history, to ruminate on the past. 
The most manly way to assert our solidarity with the Czechoslovak com-
munists, who are victims of normalization, is to reflect upon the sig-
nificance of their "Spring" and to revive it here in France by work-
ing out -- with all those who want socialism, without any discrimina-
tion whatsoever -- the ways, the forms, and the model of a socialism 
that will correspond to the needs of our country.

First of all because the march toward a renewal of socialism 
is not blocked only in Prague by tanks. When a Communist Party 
refuses to be silent in the face of this crime against socialism, 
as represented by normalization, the Soviet leaders do not hesitate 
to encourage or create a split so as to be able to have at least one 
fraction available which unconditionally accepts their orders, as 
happened in a particularly noticeable manner against the communist 
parties of Greece, Spain, Finland, Austria, Great Britain, Portugal, 
Australia, and quite a few others. The crisis in the International 
Communist Movement has sprung from the determination of the Soviet 
leaders to impose their bureaucratic and Stalinist system as the 
only model of socialism. Each party henceforth must choose: it can 
either become the propagandist of this imported model or it can de-
nounce it as a caricature of socialism, if it wants to be among the 
builders of socialism in its own country. Any party that agrees to 
become the propagandist for the Soviet model by keeping silent in the 
face of its perversions and crimes condemns itself to powerlessness 
and sterility. 
It is not a coincidence of history that, after the October 
Revolution, all peoples who achieved socialism by their own means, 
did so outside the schemes of Stalin and Brezhnev, in China, Vietnam, 
Yugoslavia, or Cuba. 
The march to socialism is also blocked by the importing of 
outdated schemes which enable us to understand neither the develop-
ments of capitalism at the end of the 20th century, nor those of the 
working class, nor those of the forces which, side by side with the 
working class, are the standard-bearers of the future. Silent "nor-
malization " stifles living revolutionary thought and action. 
We rise against it, tonight, for the renewal of socialism. 
In our struggle for socialism, we are no longer facing the 
capitalism of the steam engine or the flintlock, but rather the cap-
italism of the computer and the intercontinental missile. And this 
requires a new analysis and a new strategy. 
The forces that are the standard-bearers of the revolution 
are not oniy those that are excluded from consumption but also those 
that are excluded from the decision-making process: first of all the 
working class and, with it, the millions of intellectuals and students 
who are moving toward it and who increasingly constitute a bloc with 
it, as demonstrated by the eruptions of May 1968. And this calls 
for a new concept of unity.

The conditions of the revolutionary struggle for socialism, 
in our country, are not those of a predominantly agricultural coun-
try, where the working class was a minority in an uneducated mass, 
where it was forced underground and into an organization run on 
army discipline, where, consequently, a professional apparatus 
speaks and commands in the name of the class. 
In France, socialism cannot be forced upon our people from 
the outside but, on the contrary, must be born of its most profound 
aspirations and must spring from the rank and file initiatives of 
the working class and the intellectuals who have adopted its histor-
ical perspective as their own. And that calls for a party of the new 
type. 
Such is the basic triptych for the renewal of socialism in 
France: new analysis of class relations and new strategy; new con-
cept of unity; new-type party. 
We have no enemies among those who pursue such a goal: neither 
among the communists, who are beginning to be aware of the sterility 
to which the observance of the Stalinist schemes of Brezhnev has led 
them, along with silence on the sordid anti-Semitism which is develop-
ing in Poland and in the Soviet Union, nor among the socialists of 
all shades who are becoming aware that a socialist party, wherever 
it was in power, has never built socialism, nor among those who are 
called "Leftists" and who have become aware of the powerlessness of 
reformism and the powerlessness of the many tiny little groups that 
only had speculative links with the working class, nor among the 
Christians who, after having experienced the evil-mindedness of the 
"Christian parties" throughout Europe, with good reason aspire to 
political expression. 
The issue is not -- neither tonight, nor tomorrow -- to create 
a center of opposition to the French Communist Party, nor to any other 
force of socialism in France, but everywhere to bring to life centers 
of impetus, of common search and action. To release the historical 
initiative of the rank and file, along the example of the Prague 
Spring, and to search for and create the conditions of unity and 
effectiveness of all of .those who want to build socialism in France. 
The only problem is to find out whether, beyond all of our 
disagreements, we can choose between barbarism and socialism, as 
Rosa Luxemburg put it. 
Socialism, the hope of everyone, can only be the work of every-
one: of those for whom socialism has the face of Jaures or of Lenin, 
the face of Trotsky, the face of Mao Tse-tung, or the face of Camillo 
Torres.

The problem is to unite the class and the bloc, all those who 
do not wish to be fenced in by the limitations of the capitalist 
system, all those who refuse to be integrated into it, all those 
who fundamentally challenge its direction, values, and ultimate 
purposes. 
This is not an eclectic rally without principle. On the 
contrary, with a clear awareness of our disagreements, and without 
wishing to claim any kind of leadership role, without pretending to 
create a group, a party, or an international that could only divide 
the movement even further, the important thing now for everyone is 
to ask ourselves about the model of socialism which we want to build, 
about the conditions of our unity and our effectiveness. 
A youth who today lives in the age of the apocalypse of 
Hiroshima and the Chinese Revolution, a youth who has embarked upon 
a conscious road between the irreversible challenges of the 
20th congress of the Bolshevik Party and Vatican Council II, 
such a youth could not conceive a defensive socialism, a socialism 
that fearfully entrenches itself behind walls, tanks or censor-
ship, but rather an offensive socialism, sure of its own significance. 
The important thing now is not to provide alibis for those who 
do not recoil before the barbarism of genocide in Vietnam, against 
which we demonstrate together, tonight, from the Bastille to the Re-
public; but rather to cast away the masks which, by disfiguring soc-
ialism, weaken the common struggle against imperialism and for Viet-
nam. 
From the Caribbean to the Andes mountain range and from Guinea 
to Vietnam, victories are being won against the common enemy in var-
ious forms. Let us not reject any of the lessons or possibilities 
emerging from them -- not to import them or to imitate them, but to 
use them to help us solve our own problems by inventing perhaps un-
heard-of means. 
It is up to us now to turn the extinct volcanoes on and make 
them roar. 
Beyond the outdated schemes, we must find ways to recover the 
elan of what all of the nascent socialist revolutions were; let us 
find ways to revive the spirit of the Paris Commune and of the October 
Revolution, of the Chinese Long March, of the epic of Vietnam, and the 
Prague Spring; let us find ways to recover the initiatives of thought 
and action of Rosa Luxemburg and of Antonio Gramsci.

Speech of Jiri Pelikan  
Dear comrades, dear friends. 
I would first of all like to thank, with all my heart, the 
organizers Of this meeting, the Committee of 5 January, the organiza-
tions and comrades who participated in its preparation, the foreign 
comrades who have come or who have sent messages from different coun-
tries, and you all who are here tonight, at the Mutual Insurance 
Building, to express your solidarity with the struggle of the Czecho-
slovak people against the occupation and "normalization," for an in-
dependent, democratic, and socialist Czechoslovakia. 
Your gesture is all the more important since the present regime 
imposed upon Czechoslovakia by the occupation is trying to crush the 
resistance of the popular masses by asserting that they are isolated 
and abandoned and that there is nothing left for them to do but to 
accept this so-called new reality. As if they had forgotten that we 
all became communists and socialists not to accept "reality" but, 
precisely, to change it. 
Your gesture is all the more important since our people can 
observe, with a certain degree of concern and bitterness, the depress-
ing hesitation and silence on the part of many of those to whom we 
are linked by the same goals of socialism and who, though they con-
demned the military intervention in August 1968, are gradually be-
ginning to reconcile themselves to its consequences. 
This is why your presence here is a concrete confirmation 
for our people that there are communists and socialists, that there 
are revolutionaries who are not abandoning their comrades in arms, 
even if they suffer blows and wounds, and who consider the struggle 
of our people to be their struggle. 
We come back today to that magnificent movement of 1968, known 
under the name of "Prague Spring," because, in spite of its particular 
features, it expressed the objective problems, the contradictions, and 
also the possible solutions of a new development in all socialist 
countries, in the entire socialist movement, especially in the in-
dustrialized countries. This is because the Prague Spring was neither

a palace revolution, nor a liberal movement, nor a chance explosion. 
It had been maturing for a long time within a socialist society, as 
a consequence of the contradictions between the ideals and the prac-
tice of socialism, as a consequence of the inability of the bureau-
cratic system successfully to solve the many problems of political, 
economic, and cultural development, and to assure a democratic par-
ticipation of the people in the development of policy. 
The study and analysis of all of the documents of the party 
and government agencies, of thousands of resolutions emanating from 
different organizations and from the demands of the citizens, pub-
lished at the time of the Prague Spring, convincingly confirm the 
fact that this entire movement had a socialist character, that the 
idea here was not to weaken but, on the contrary, to strengthen soc-
ialism. 
Can one say that the renewal and enlargement of all civil, 
democratic rights, especially the right of free expression, was 
"antisocialist"? 
Can one say that the principle of self-management of the enter-
prises by the workers and of government agencies by the citizens was 
"antisocialist"? 
Can one say that the autonomy of the labor unions and of other 
mass organizations, cooperation -- on a basis of equality -- between 
different political groups and interests around a socialist program 
was "antisocialist"? 
If these aspirations had to be considered antisocialist and 
counterrevolutionary -- as official government propaganda in Prague 
and Moscow claims -- then one would have to exclude from the Commun-
ist Movement the majority of the leaders and the members of the Italian, 
Spanish, British, French, and other communist parties who included 
these points in their fighting program for a socialist society! 
Of course, one can criticize the Prague Spring in connection 
with certain errors. On this subject, I would like to emphasize that 
we ourselves, the Czechoslovak communists, who participated in this 
movement and who are today faithful to its ideas, are not uncondi-
tionally defending everything that was done, said, or written, because 
such a democratic movement cannot be carried out without extremist 
positions and, above all, we do not intend to picture it as a "model" 
for the others. But one must not forget under what internal and ex-
ternal objective conditions this movement was born and developed. One 
must not forget that it was only the liquidation of personal power 
in the party and government leadership, in January 1968, which opened 
the road to political and ideological activity and which, in the course
