 DISSIDENTS
 The arrest by Soviet authorities over
 the past week of a number of leading
 dissidents and the expulsion of an Amer-
 ican journalist are clear signs of ris-
 ing Soviet irritation with human rights
 activism in the USSR and with Mos-
 cow's bad press on the issue in the West.
 The most prominent of those arrested
 are Yury Orlov and Aleksandr Ginzburg,
 leading members of the unofficial group
 set up last May to monitor Soviet com-
 pliance with the human rights provisions
 of the 1975 Helsinki accords. The group
 has been subjected to harassment and ac-
 cusations, especially since the KGB
 searched several members' apartments in
 late December and early January. Police
 reportedly planted  foreign currency,
 possession of which is normally illegal in
 the USSR, in the apartments of Ginzburg
 and others.
 Shortly before Ginzburg's arrest, he
 and other leading human rights activists
 defiantly met with Western newsmen and
 expressed their determination to carry on.
 Ginzburg publicly acknowledged that he
 has managed the Moscow end of a fund
 set up in 1974 by exiled author Aleksandr
 Solzhenitsyn to aid Soviet political
 prisoners and their families, but he denied
 all charges of illegal foreign currency
 transactions.
 The journalist was also accused of il-
 legal financial dealings, but the real
 reasons for his ouster were almost certain-
 ly his fluency in Russian and his extensive
 contacts in the Soviet dissident commu-
 nity.
 Ginzburg reportedly has been taken to
 a provincial town south of Moscow where
 he is a legal resident. This step suggests
 that he may be the first of the group to be
 formally charged. His friends fear he will
 be prosecuted not for his political crimes
 but for foreign currency manipulation, a
 serious criminal offense.
 Two  members  of  the  Ukrainian
 chapter of Ginzburg's group have also
 been arrested. They may be charged
 with illegal possession of arms, which
 they  say  had  been planted  in their
 apartments during police searches.
 Several other members of the Ukrain-
 ian group reportedly had their homes
 searched on February 5, but were not
 Aleksandr Ginzburg OC /
 arrested. So far, none of the members of
 the Lithuanian branch of the monitoring
 organization have been singled out for
 similar treatment.
 Czechoslovakia
 The Czechoslovak government is main-
 taining pressure on the supporters of the
 Charter 77 human rights manifesto. The
 authorities remain wary of issuing in-
 dictments unequivocally linked to the
 document, but "unofficial" messages to
 activist dissidents warning them of their
 vulnerability to punitive legal action have
 increased.
 A Czechoslovak media campaign late
 last month suggested that the protesters
 might be happier living in the West, and
 the government reportedly tried un-
 successfully to persuade several of them to
 sign emigration applications. Subsequent-
 ly, a broadcast by Prague television
 denied Western press speculation that the
 regime was planning to deport some
 leading dissidents.
 The number of signers of the manifesto,
 meanwhile, has been growing; spokesmen
 for the group say the total has passed 400.
 Nonetheless, the impact of Charter 77 on
 the Czechoslovak public does not appear
 to be significant. The government has
 sought to demonstrate that a substantial
 segment of the population is opposed to
 the charter, and pressure on workers to
 sign anti-charter statements should pre-
 vent widespread open support for it.
 The controversy over human rights in
 Czechoslovakia has created some inter-
 national difficulties for President Husak's
 regime. The Italian foreign minister
 recently canceled a planned stopover in
 Prague on the way home from the USSR.
 The Norwegians canceled a ministerial
 visit, and other planned official visits may
 now be in doubt.
 The controversy could also cause
 problems for all the East European coun-
 tries in connection with the Belgrade con-
 ference this summer that will review com-
 pliance with the Helsinki accords. Soviet
 propaganda has reflected this concern. It
 has sought to play down the Charter 77
 issue, putting emphasis instead on alleged
 Western failures in the human rights field.
 Yugoslavia
 A resurgence of open political dissent in
 Yugoslavia is dimming the Tito regime's
 hope that serving as host for the Helsinki
 review talks this summer will enhance
 Yugoslavia's  prestige.  The  dissenters
 are  cautiously  playing  on  increased
 Western criticism of Yugoslavia's per-
 formance on human rights to press Bel-
 grade to relax its ideological and political
 strictures.
 The first public step by the dissenters
 came last week, when a document
 protesting travel restrictions on persons
 regarded by the regime as troublemakers
 was leaked to the Western press. Sixty

 Yugoslavs signed the document, which
 had been privately circulating since last
 summer. Several dissidents have recently
 told Westerners that the document is only
 the of of an iceberg.
 Since a major purge of liberals in 1972,
 the Yugoslav regime has shut down dissi-
 dent journals, given stiff prison terms for
 a wide range of political "crimes," and
 gradually restored arbitrary police powers
 that is had scrapped after a period of
 abuse in the mid-1960s. The regime
 rationalizes that such measures are need-
 ed to help prevent problems in the
 post-Tito era.
 Some Yugoslav leaders would like to
 case the "vigilance campaigns" and rein
 in the secret police. Tito and many of the
 nien who became powerful after the 1972
 purge, however, have adamantly opposed
 any cancessions. The more moderate
 leaden have thus been unable to ac-
 complish more than a feeble propaganda
 effort :outing "socialist democracy" and
 mildly rebuking authoritarians in general.
 The moderates could still make some
 headway if the dissidents keep up the
 pressure and continue to avoid excesses
 that might trigger a sharp reaction from
 Lieulenant Colonel  Mengistu Haile
 Mariam emerged last week as the most
 powerful member of the ruling military
 council following factional fighting at
 the council's headquarters that resulted
 in the deaths of some of his major ri-
 vals.   4engistu's  increased  influence
 will  intensify  animosity  between the
 governrient and its domestic opponents
 and furi.her alienate Ethiopia's neighbors.
 Ethiopia's head of state, General Teferi
 Bentz, and several senior members of the
 council were killed in this latest bloody
 episode in a power struggle that has gone
 Tito. The dissenters, however, are loosely
 organized, and hotheads among them
 could take intemperate stands that would
 amount to a direct challenge to Tito's
 authority
 CEMA COSMONAUTS
 The USSR apparently has begun train-
 ing the first contingent of cosmonauts that
 are to represent the members of the
 Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic
 Assistance in planned joint missions on
 Salyut-class space stations. Prospective
 cosmonauts from Czechoslovakia,
 Poland, and East Germany arrived at the
 Soviet cosmonaut training center in late
 December;  others from  Bulgaria,
 Hungary, Cuba, Mongolia, and Romania
 are scheduled to come this year.
 The joint missions apparently are in-
 tended to foster an atmosphere of frater-
 nal cooperation among CEMA countries
 and may also provide useful data for the
 development of earth resources.
 The Soviets have said such missions
 could begin as early as 1978, but this may
 not allow enough time to integrate
 on virtually since the council took over the
 government 28 months ago. Teferi's
 predecessor was killed in a similar shoot-
 out in 1975. Mengistu, who had lost in-
 fluence in a reorganization in December,
 portrayed the events of February 3 as a
 foiled coup attempt.
 Mengistu's faction has pushed for the
 swift transformation of the country along
 Marxist lines. He is responsible for many
 of the arbitrary arrests and executions
 that have occurred under the council's
 rule.
 No member of the council is powerful
 enough to challenge Mengistu at present.
 Second Vice Chairman Atnafu, who has
 criticized him in the past, seems recon-
 ciled to his leadership for now.
 Commanders of major military units
 have conveyed their approval of the kill-
 ing of the council "plotters," whom
 trainees of dissimilar background and
 language. In order to launch CEMA
 cosmonauts as soon as possible, the
 USSR may initially limit them to conduc-
 ting scientific experiments and not permit
 them to perform crew functions on hoard
 the space station.
 The ambitious joint CEMA scientific
 space station program was officially an-
 nounced in September 1976 during the
 flight of Soyuz 22. That flight, which used
 East German photographic equipment,
 was hailed by the Soviets as the first in a
 new series of cooperative space flights
 with CEMA countries. According to the
 announcement,  the  multinational
 program will continue through 1983.
 Cooperation is likely to involve the con-
 tinued use of equipment from CEMA
 countries before CEMA cosmonauts are
 included in actual flights in any capacity.
 If the Soviets conduct the first manned
 flights in this program in 1978, it would
 give them a lead of several years on the
 joint US-European program for multi-
 national space crews. The US space
 shuttle is scheduled to orbit a European
 Mengistu has linked with an underground
 group working to overthrow the govern-
 ment. Some of the military are almost
 certainly concerned, however, about
 Mengistu's consolidation of power.
 In strongly worded statements after the
 fighting last week, Mengistu showed an
 uncompromising determination to
 eliminate  his domestic opponents by
 force. He has also lashed out at some of
 Ethiopia's neighbors, especially Sudan,
 Somalia, and Saudi Arabia, for aiding the
 various insurgent groups active in
 Ethiopia. He will probably seek closer ties
 with Libyan President Qadhafi, an enemy
 of the Numayri regime in Sudan.
 He will probably also press for swift
 implementation of the military purchase
 agreement reached with the Soviets in
 December, and may ask them for ad-
 ditional aid. The Soviet ambassador was

 Ababa. (An analysis of the numerous dis-
 sident and insurgent domestic groups that

 OAU
 The Rhodesian Patriotic Front of
 Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe last
 week  received the backing of the
 22-member  African  Liberation  Com-
 mittee of the Organization of African
 Unity. The committee stopped short,
 however, of exclusive recognition of the
 Front, leaving the door open for OAU
 members to deal with other Rhodesian
 nationalist factions.
 The Front apparently now will be the
 recipient of any additional military
 assistance to the Rhodesian nationalist
 movement  through  OAU  channels.
 Nigeria reportedly has pledged a substan-
 tial amount to the committee's fund, some
 of which will probably be earmarked for
 use by liberation groups from Namibia
 and South Africa.
 Nigeria apparently played a key role in
 opposing a determined effort by several
 countries to give equal status to all the
 Rhodesian  nationalist  factions.  The
 Nigerians provided the formula that was
 finally adopted.
 J i
 The Nigerians were aided by a strong
 desire on the part of OAU members not
 to risk another split in their ranks such as
 occurred over Angola. In that case, the
 existence of OAU resolutions giving equal
 backing to the three nationalist groups
 that had fought the Portuguese led finally
 to a divisive struggle between supporters
 of the rival Angolan governments
 proclaimed during the civil war.
 Still undetermined is the question of
 military assistance for Mozambique,
 which has borne the brunt of attacks by
 Rhodesian security forces against Rhode-
 sian guerrillas. A meeting of the OAU
 defense commission was to have taken
 place immediately following the liberation
 committee session to discuss Mozam-
 bique's problems. but many countries

 BOTSWANA
 The arrival in Botswana last week of
 400 to 500 black students from Rhodesia
 highlights  the  squeeze  on  Botswana
 because of its role as a front-line state
 in the Rhodesian conflict and its inter-
 est in maintaining close economic ties-
 and avoiding military confrontation-
 with iG white-ruled neighbors.
 Y he Rhodesian government asserted
 that the students were abducted by
 guerrillas at gunpoint from a mission
 school near the border. Botswana said
 they came voluntarily. Most of them have
 spurned pleas from their parents to return
 home.
 Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African
 People s Union will be recruiting among
 these new refugees for its guerrilla force,
 which is much smaller than that of the
 Zimbabwe African  National  Union,
 Nkomo's ally in a "Patriotic Front."
 ZAPU operates from Zambia-and to a
 lesser degree from Botswana-into
 western and southwestern Rhodesia.
 Although Botswanan President Khama
 has never authorized the Rhodesian
 guerrillas to operate out of his country, its
 400-man mobile police unit is unable to
 patrol tie border adequately.
 Botswana has also been a haven for
 refugee, from the civil war in Angola, the
 riots in South Africa, and South African
 counterinsurgency measures in Namibia.
 During the past six months the refugee
 flow has increased, primarily from South
 Africa and Rhodesia. The Botswanan
 government generally has tried to move
 the refugees on to other countries, since it
 lacks sufficient resources to care for them.
 After considerable agonizing, however,
 Khama decided recently to let them re-
 main in Botswana.
 The growing refugee community could
 serve as a catalyst for opposition to
 Khama's policies. There is a vocal opposi-
 tion in Botswana's multiparty democratic
 political system that strongly criticized
 the country's relatively weak support for
 African  liberation  groups  and  its
 economic links with South Africa and
 Rhodesia. Large numbers of Botswanans
 are employed in South Africa, and the
 Rhodesian-run railroad is crucial to ex-
 ports of Botswanan beef and minerals as
 well as imports of foodstuffs.
 Botswana's tiny security force,
 moreover, is not likely to be able to pre-
 vent the refugees from supporting dissi-
 dent activity against both Rhodesia and
 South Africa. The emergence of more ac-
 tive guerrilla operations from Botswana
 against  Rhodesia  may prompt the
 Rhodesians to mount sizable cross-border
 attacks as they have done in Mozam-
 bique, where ZANU guerrillas are based.
 Until now, Rhodesia has staged only
 minor raids against suspected guerrilla
 concentrations  in   Botswana.
 SUDAN
 Sudanese government forces crushed an
 attempt last week by some soldiers in
 southern Sudan to seize control of an air-
 port                                                   at  Juba,  the  regional  capital.
 Although the unrest posed little im-
 mediate threat to the central government
 in Khartoum, it reflected problems that
 continue to plague President Numayri's
 regime.
 Fighting broke out in Juba on February
 2. The action by the troops, who were ac-
 companied by some civilians, followed the
 arrest in Juba two days earlier of about 30
 Sudanese  soldiers  and  civilians  for
 allegedly plotting against Numayri. The
 against him.  Most Sudanese are in-
 different to the regime and protest only
 when there are economic problems, such
 plotters, who reportedly were followers of
 an exiled tribal leader, were said to be
 planning to assassinate Numayri and
 other leaders, seize control of the south,
 and use it as a base for further operations
 against the government.
 Numayri probably will face more such
 challenges because of his lack of broad
 support. There have been five serious
 attempts to oust him since he came to
 power nearly eight years ago. All but one
 were led by members of the military, on
 which Numayri depends for his political
 survival.
 Sudan's three diverse Islamic groups
 remain sources of active dissidence. Stu-
 dent groups, although limited in number,
 also have engaged in considerable anti-
 regime activity. They are kept in check
 only by the security forces and frequent
 closings of Khartoum University.
 The Sudanese Communist Party, of-

 President Sadat has been working to
 repair the damage done to his prestige and
 that of his government by the rioting that
 shook Egypt in mid-January. His efforts
 apparently have been at least partially
 successful, but he has been unable to find
 any quick or easy solutions to Egypt's
 pressing economic problems, the basic
 cause of the civil unrest.
 Over the past two weeks Sadat has held
 a series of meetings with educators,
 students, and workers, and made a major
 address to the nation. I n each case, he has
 sought to deflect criticism from himself
 and his government by blaming the unrest
 on leftist conspirators. He has refused to
 bow to pressures to oust Prime Minister
 Mamduh Salim, who is widely blamed for
 Egypt's economic woes, and instead has
 sacked the interior minister for his failure
 to head off the riots. Sadat has also an-
 nounced tax reforms directed against the
 wealthy and held a referendum on
 February 10 on tough new law-and-order
 measures designed to discourage further
 demonstrations.
 These moves probably have pleased
 politically conservative Egyptians and
 those in the middle class who fear further
 domestic upheavals. The harsh security
 measures, however, are not likely to be
 well received by Egyptian students and
 other  politically sophisticated groups,
 which have enjoyed greater freedom un-
 der Sadat's recent political liberalization
 program.  The  President's get-tough
 policy will receive its first major test with
 the reopening of Egypt's universities, now
 scheduled for February 12.
 Sadat's activities indicate that the un-
 rest has refocused his attention on the
 country's domestic troubles and the needs
 of its people. This could be an important
 positive side effect of the riots. In recent
 months the President has appeared to be
 out of touch with the great majority of
 Egyptians and the magnitude of the
 problems facing them daily.
 Sadat himself realizes there is little he
 can do to alleviate the immediate
 economic hardships that are the primary
 cause of the Egyptian public's unhappi-
 ness. He has appealed for patience dur-
 ing the "four lean years" he says the
 country is facing.
 For now, Sadat is hoping for new cash
 aid  from  wealthy  conservative  Arab
 states to shore up his position. Even that
 would provide little short-term relief,
 however, and long range solutions will be
 difficult and not easily accepted by the
 hard-pressed Egyptian people.
 Relations with the USSR-
 Recent new apti-Soviet actions by the"
 Egyptians and another postponement by
 the USSR of negotiations on a bilateral
 trade protocol for 1977 have aggravated
 long-standing strains in Egyptian-Soviet
 relations.
 The Soviet move in late January was es-
 pecially irritating to the Egyptians as it
 was the third time Moscow had deferred
 the talks in less than two months. The So-
 viets were apparently reacting in part to
 charges in the Egyptian media that the
 USSR had helped fuel the antigovern-
 ment food riots; Egypt had also moved to
 obstruct several  Soviet cultural
 delegations in Cairo. The introduction of
 a bill in the Egyptian parliament on
 January 26 calling for severing diplomatic
 relations with the USSR may have been
 an additional spur to the Soviet decision.
 In any event, the postponement was
 followed  by new and harsher public
 criticism of the USSR by Sadat, who was
 doubtless already irked by the extensive
 and prolonged Soviet media coverage of
 the rioting episode. This time, the Egyp-
 tian President flatly accused the Soviets of
 responsibility for the riots.
 Trade relations between the two coun-
 tries will continue even if the two sides
 never get around to initialing the 1977
 protocol. Soviet-Egyptian trade reached a
 high level in 1974, for example, without a
 formal trade protocol.
 Apart from the new irritants in
 Soviet-Egyptian  relations,  Moscow
 remains determined to keep pressure on
 Sadat and to refrain from any significant
 inducements to the Egyptians as long as
 Cairo gives priority to its ties with the US
 and ignores Soviet complaints. Moscow
 has been particularly incensed at Sadat's
 domestic  policies,  which continue to
 de-emphasize socialist institutions in
 favor of the entry of Arab and Western
 capital.
 At the same time, the Soviets do not
 want to make bilateral relations still
 worse and have therefore been reticent in
 their response to Sadat's charges. Some
 effort to smooth over the latest quarrel
 may be attempted by a Soviet Foreign
 Ministry official who arrived in Cairo for
 talks on February 8.
 The official's primary focus, however,
 will almost certainly not be bilateral
 relations, but rather the question of Mid-
 dle East peace negotiations. His main
 mission probably is to convey to the
 Egyptians,  in advance of Secretary
 Vance's arrival in Cairo next week, the
 importance attached by Soviet leaders to
 a return to the Geneva negotiating forum.
 The Soviets remain highly concerned
 that a new power balance may be emerg-
 ing in the Middle East that will diminish
 their influence further and cut them out of
 Turkey's coalition government is under
 increasing pressure because of continuing
 violence between militant young rightists
 and left-wingers, which resulted in 21
 deaths last month. The disorders have
 also added to strains among the four dis-
 parate parties that make up the coalition.
 Civil disorder has become an important
 issue for the election scheduled for this
 fall, with opposition leader Ecevit charg-
 ing that the government is unable to en-
 sure internal security.
 The government is especially vulnerable
 on the issue because one coalition par-

 Party--is held responsible for most of the
 disorders caused by rightist students.
 Prime Minister Demirel had been unwill-
 ing to -ein in Action Party leader Turkes,
 who is a deputy prime minister, but-early
 this month he reportedly did strip Turkes
 of general supervisory responsibility for
 internal security.
 Another coalition partner, the small
 centrist Republican Reliance Party, has
 threatened to withdraw from the coalition
 unless the government adopts stronger
 measures to deal with the disorders and
 corrects what the party regards as a
 failure to adhere to the coalition program.
 Witt.drawal of the Reliance Party,
 which has only a few seats in parliament,
 probably would not bring down the
 government, but would clearly weaken it.
 The government is facing two impor-
 tant votes on the budget this month.
 Further dissension within the coalition
 could cost the government its majority on
 one of these votes. This would not require
 Prime Minister Demirel to step down, but
 precede:nt-and a possible decision by
 Demirel that the coalition's liabilities are
 heginriing to outweigh its advan-
 tages-could lead him to do so.
 The Supreme Military Council-con-
 sisting of senior civilian and military
 leaders--is reviewing Turkey's domestic
 securit)  problems. It will presumably
 recommend stronger measures to curb the
 violence, possibly including the imposi-
 tion of martial law in certain provinces.
 Demirel has been hamstrung in his efforts
 to control the violence because of lack of
 cooperation from his two rightist coali-
 tion partners.
 Last week, following a regular meeting
 of the Turkish General Staff, President
 Koruturk issued a statement warning that
 failure to handle the unrest adequately
 could have unfortunate effects on
 democratic stability-as was the case in
 1971 when the military intervened and
 forced Demirel's resignation as Prime
 Minister. Senior officers still appear loyal
 to the government, however, and there
 seems to be almost no chance of military
 intervention   at   this   point
 Ambitious Gaullist leader Jacques
 Chirac has rejected a compromise with
 President Giscard that would have allow-
 ed the government coalition to enter next
 month's important Paris municipal elec-
 tion with a show of unity.
 Chirac last week turned down an offer
 by Minister of Industry and Research
 d'Ornano, a member of Giscard's
 Independent Republican Party and the
 President's personal choice for mayor of
 Paris, to prepare joint lists in sectors of
 Paris that are vulnerable to the
 Socialist-Communist opposition. The
 Gaullist leader said he would run his own
 competing lists and that he would per-
 sonally stand for office in the fifth district,
 where he is assured of election.
 The Independent Republicans, angered
 by Chirac's open defiance, reportedly are
 determined to try to block his election to
 the prestigious new post of mayor of
 Paris. They believe the Gaullists will win
 more of the 109 municipal council seats
 than any other party but not enough to
 assure Chirac's election without the help
 of other parties.
 They hope to deny Chirac a-majority in
 the first two rounds of mayoral balloting
 among council members and then com-
 promise with him on the third ballot,
 where a simple plurality suffices. The
 Independent Republicans would be will-
 ing to accept Gaullist Bernard Lafay, the
 current president of the Paris municipal
 council, as a compromise mayoral can-
 didate, but Chirac is not likely to go
 along.
 Under the Republicans' strategy, it is
 possible-but unlikely-that a Socialist
 or Communist opposition candidate could
 he elected mayor. The Socialist-Com-
 munist alliance is deeply divided and so
 far not in a position to profit from the dis-
 array of the majority. The Communists
 are more strongly entrenched in Paris
 than the Socialists and up to now have
 been unwilling to compromise on joint
 lists or a single candidate for mayor of
 Paris.
 In the end, Chirac is likely to be elected
 mayor. The post should keep him in the
 limelight as he conducts a vigorous cam-
 paign for the 1978 election, and serve as a
 steppingstone to a possible bid for the
 presidency in 1981. Should the opposition
 win the national election next year,
 Chirac would have in the Paris mayoralty
 a power base from which he could rally
 anticommunist forces against the left.
 Prime Minister Gandhi so far has
 prevented additional leading members of
 her Congress Party from joining with
 Jagjivan Ram, her former agriculture
 minister who quit the party and cabinet
 last week. Ram, a spokesman for India's
 untouchables, has established a new
 political party and plans to cooperate with
 the noncommunist opposition in the
 parliamentary election scheduled for
 March.
 Gandhi has obtained statements of sup-
 port from most key Congress  Party
 members, including a leading potential
 defector, the chief minister of the pop-
 ulous state of West Bengal. These com-
 mitments, however, may have been ob-
 tained at some political cost to her son
 Sanjay.
 Many older party members have been
 unhappy with the rapid growth of San-
 jay's power since the imposition of the
 emergency in June 1975. It is now likely
 that the party will nominate fewer of his
 followers as candidates for parliament
 than had originally been planned.
 Although the Prime Minister has at
 least temporarily forestalled defections,
 some other aspects of the campaign are

 not going well:
 ? The crowd that attended a
 Congress Party rally in New Delhi on
 February 5 was unenthusiastic and un-
 ruly. Sanjay, who was to have been the
 main speaker, did not attend, and the
 Prime Minister spoke instead.
 ? A major opposition rally in New
 Delhi  on  February 6  drew  a
 significantly larger and more respon-
 sive crowd than had attended Gandhi's
 rally.
 ? The press has been more out-
 spoken since the lifting of censorship
 last month than many expected.
 Gandhi  still  seems  committed  to
 holding the election, but she may decide
 to reimpose restrictions on the press and
 political gatherings. She says she will not
 tolerate a return to a situation of political
 turbulence like the one that prompted her
 to impose the emergency.
 The Prime Minister is aware that such
 a tightening of controls would cast doubt
 on the validity of the election, which she
 presumably still expects to win. Further
 setbacks nonetheless could lead her to
 take such action or possibly even to cancel
 the election. A cancelation would require
 stretching the constitution and would be
 generally seen as an admission of defeat.
 Chinese leaders are continuing to give
 top priority to the campaign against the
 four leftist Politburo members purged last
 October and their lower-ranking sup-
 porters. The status of former vice premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping apparently remains at
 issue, although steps taken during the past
 week seem to have brought him closer to
 rehabilitation.
 Commentary published last weekend in
 the Chinese media charged that local
 leaders have not exercised adequate
 leadership to advance the anti-leftist cam-
 paign. The articles point in the direction
 of a fairly hard-line campaign, but there
 still may not be full agreement on the
 issue in the Chinese hierarchy.
 The articles seem to reflect a concern
 that local leftists will go unidentified and
 unreformed and will be free to continue to
 create local political disturbances. There
 is no evidence of any serious recent
 violence, but low-level leftists have caused
 some embarrassment in Peking and
 elsewhere. They may have been responsi-
 ble for wall posters that attacked Polit-
 buro members last month during ac-
 tivities honoring the memory of Chou
 En-lai. They also apparently continue to
 cause trouble for some provincial leaders
 as well as for local leaders in Shanghai.
 Peking's effort to increase local
 political activity against leftists may pose
 a threat to certain provincial leaders who
 last year were in the forefront of the
 leftist-inspired campaign against Teng
 Hsiao-ping. So far none has been publicly
 associated with the fallen leftists, but
 some may still have to clear themselves of
 responsibility for either their own actions
 or those of their subordinates.
 Part of an editorial published last
 weekend appeared to advance Teng
 another step toward restoration to some
 office. It called "deepening exposure and
 criticism of the gang of four" the current
 "key link," but made only passing
 reference to "class struggle," which
 through 1976 had been the "key link."
 Teng previously had been criticized for
 failing to take "class struggle" as the "key
 link." Another possible step toward
 Teng's return was the reappearance in
 public of his brother this week.
 China's leaders still have not decided
 what position to give Teng when he is
 rehabilitated. They appear stalemated
 over the issue of whether to restore him to
 his original positions, including that of
 senior vice premier, or to follow Chou
 En-lai's wishes and elevate him to the
 premiership.
 Teng's return could affect the status of
 other members of the leadership, especial-
 ly that of Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng,
 who was the main beneficiary of Teng's
 fall. Teng leas ties throughout the
 hierarchy, which Hua has yet to establish.
 JAMAICA-GUYANA-USSR
 Guyana and Jamaica,  faced with
 economic difficulties and problems in ob-
 taining assistance from the West, are
 seeking  closer  economic ties  with
 the USSR and Eastern Europe. Among
 their  specific objectives, the Guy-
 anese                                                                                                      want  an  economic  agreement
 with the Council for Mutual Economic
 Assistance.
 Jamaica is taking similar initiatives.
 Prime  Minister  Manley's government
 recently ended its long stall on granting
 the Soviets permission to set up an em-
 bassy in Kingston and invited them to do
 so. Two high-level CEMA officials have
 been invited to visit Kingston, and
 Manley is reportedly considering an
 economic agreement with that organiza-
 tion. A Jamaican trade delegation will
 soon leave for Moscow.
 Guyana and Jamaica both have huge
 current-account  deficits.  Lower  sugar
 prices and rising import costs have offset
 much of the recent recovery in bauxite
 and alumina sales. The two countries' in-
 ability to obtain sufficient foreign funds to
 cover these deficits has forced them to
 adopt severe austerity measures.
 The USSR and other CEMA members
 are unlikely to provide much, if any, cash
 aid to either country; they might barter
 machinery  and equipment  for sugar,
 bauxite, and alumina.
 At least Burnham may be willing to
 make political concessions to the Soviets
 to get their help, particularly for a major
 hydroelectric complex he wants to con-
 struct. The Guyanese have approached
 the Soviets on it before without success;
 this time, Burnham may be willing to ac-
 commodate the USSR by appearing to
 grant a more active role in the govern-
 ment to the Moscow-oriented opposition

 r,,gypi and Syria, having patched up their recent quarrel,
 are making a concerted effort to reopen Middle East peace
 talks at Geneva. Neither country expects rapid progress, but
 both .i/'them-and Saudi Arabia-will be looking to the US to
 use its influence to end the negotiating stalemate this year.
 The Arab Peace Offensive
 1 he principal Arab states, having over-
 come the paralyzing divisions produced
 by  tie  Egyptian-Syrian quarrel  over
 Egypt's conclusion of a second Sinai ac-
 cord with Israel in 1975 and by Syria's in-
 tervention in Lebanon last year, are now
 in a rosition to apply strong diplomatic
 pressure for an early reconvening of the
 long-r.cessed Geneva conference on a
 Middlr, East peace settlement.
 the Egyptians are fostering high expec-
 tations of diplomatic movement in 1977
 and a-e attempting to marshal as much
 Arab and international support as possi-
 ale to press the US and Israel to resume
 serious,  comprehensive  peace
 negotiations.
 There are fundamental constraints on
 the flexibility of the Arabs, but their
 strategy in coming months will be to pro-
 ject an image of reasonableness on such
 key issues as the future of a Palestinian
 state, an end to the state of war, and oil
 pricing.
 Despite lingering  mutual  suspicion,
 Egyptian President Sadat and Syrian
 President Asad are likely to be able to
 maintain sufficient unity to resist any
 pressures  to  resume the step-by-step
 negotiating process in lieu of a return to
 Geneva. They may also be able to sell
 previously unpalatable positions to their
 Arab colleagues, at least on matters of
 procecure and implementation.
 Asad has learned from the confron-
 tations of the past year that Syria's in-
 terests are best served when he works in
 harmony with Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
 By winning their endorsement of Syria's
 prominent role in Lebanon at the Riyadh
 and Cairo summits, Asad ended Syria's
 diplomatic isolation and eased the finan-
 cial burden of its Lebanese campaign.
 Reconciliation with Egypt also paid off
 in reduced domestic tension and prepared
 the way for what Syria believes will be
 further substantial financial assistance
 from conservative oil states.
 Sadat, in turn, learned that he could not
 challenge Asad so long as Asad has Saudi
 backing and that he could not lead in for-
 mulating Arab strategy without the sup-
 port of both Syria and Saudi Arabia.
 Should negotiations reach a stalemate
 because of US or Israeli positions, there
 would probably be no disruption of Egyp-
 tian-Syrian coordination. Instead, failure
 to achieve whatever the Arab side con-
 siders substantial diplomatic progress by
 the end of 1977 almost certainly would
 lead to friction between the US and both
 Egypt and Syria, to Saudi support for
 further oil price increases, and to renewed
 Arab preparations for at least a limited
 war to achieve their political objectives.
 Preparing for Geneva
 Egypt and Syria have called for a
 resumption of the Geneva conference by
 March-not intending  that  this date
 should be taken literally, but wishing to
 underscore the urgency of the Arab peace
 offensive. The Syrians are almost certain-
 ly even more skeptical than the Egyptians
 that rapid movement is possible; Asad is
 less optimistic than Sadat about the ex-
 tent of Israeli flexibility and the degree to
 which the US is able to influence Israel.
 The key Arab leaders nonetheless will
 expect immediate movement to convene a
 Geneva meeting soon after the Israeli
 election set for May 17, regardless of the
 outcome of the election.
 A particularly important juncture may
 come at the next ministerial meeting of
 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries, scheduled for July. If by then
 the Saudis are disappointed with the US
 response on  peace negotiations, they
 probably would go along with the oil price
 hikes demanded by most other OPEC
 members.
 The commitment of Egypt and Syria to
 a "peace offensive" does not mean they
 will  be more flexible on substantive
 matters if negotiations in Geneva resume.
 Both countries probably now have a
 realistic appreciation that any com-
 prehensive  negotiations  will  be
 protracted. Neither Sadat nor Asad is
 prepared to reach a peace settlement as
 defined by the Israelis, one that would in-
 clude diplomatic recognition, commercial
 intercourse, and "defensible borders."
 The Arabs' overall negotiating goals still
 are Israel's withdrawal from the territory
 occupied in  1967 and restoration of
 Palestinian rights. Asad does apparently
 now share Sadat's willingness to discuss
 the end of the state of war with Israel.

 The two leaders differ in their inter-
 pretation of Palestinian "national rights"
 and in their willingness to make sacrifices
 for the Palestinian cause, but both appear
 to agree on the ultimate goal of creating a
 small Palestinian state consisting of the
 West Bank and the Gaza Strip and on the
 need to find a formula for including the
 Palestinians in the negotiating process.
 Sadat and Asad may be prepared to go
 back to Geneva initially without the PLO,
 but would be likely to press the US and
 Israel on Palestinian representation once
 talks begin. Without a resolution of the
 representation issue, it is uncertain that
 any of the Arab front-line states would be
 willing to conclude new territorial
 agreements.
 Egypt is on record as proposing that the
 Palestinians should have a separate
 delegation at Geneva. There is little
 doubt, however, that Egypt would endorse
 Syria's recently announced preference for
 a single, joint Arab delegation. Palestine
 Liberation Organization chief Yasir
 Arafat, who privately has long been will-
 ing to go to Geneva if invited on accept-
 able terms, would find it hard to reject a
 formula acceptable to Syria and Egypt.
 The two countries would apparently
 also be agreeable to a combined PLO-Jor-
 danian delegation, and they have urged
 King Husayn and Arafat to reach a
 political accommodation. Talks between
 the Jordanians and Palestinians are
 scheduled to begin this weekend in Am-
 man.
 At Geneva
 Even if the Geneva conference is
 reconvened, rapid progress is unlikely this
 year. There are no signs that any of the
 principal parties are prepared to make
 significant  new  concessions,  and
 procedural wrangling and public postur-
 ing would almost certainly delay progress.
 On the other hand, neither the Arabs
 nor the Israelis apparently believe it to be
 in their interest to force-or to be held
 responsible for forcing-the collapse of
 negotiations as long as talks on substan-
 tive issues are proceeding.
 The most promising approach  at
 Geneva probably would include aban-
 doning plenary sessions in favor of small
 working groups.  These might permit
 bilateral talks between representatives of
 Israel and each of the Arab states, or dis-
 cussions by separate groups that would
 focus on different aspects of the general
 settlement problem, such as territorial
 withdrawals,   demilitarization,
 guarantees, verification, the boycott,
 propaganda, and the role of the UN and
 the US.
 Discussing a range of issues in a variety
 of forums would not necessarily speed
 progress on all issues, but it probably
 would allow headway to be made on
 some, and would at least delay failure and
 the perception of failure.

 representation issue, for which the Arabs
 will press hard, would not assure progress
 on the substance of the Palestinian and
 West Bank issues, including the intrac-
 table Jerusalem problem. The Israelis are
 adamantly opposed to giving up any part
 of Jerusalem and to the establishment of
 an independent Palestinian state. They
 would much prefer to put off negotiations
 over the West Bank-even with Jor-
 dan--until much later.
 For  Egypt and Syria,  the major
 problerr will be to force the Palestinians
 to accei)t a truncated state, comprising
 the West Bank and Gaza, and coexistence
 with Israel. The repair of the Egypt-Syria
 rupture has reduced Arafat's room for
 maneuver and sharply diminished his
 potential for disrupting any negotiating
 strategy agreed upon by the key Arab
 states.
 fhe  complexities  of  Egyp-
 tian-Syrian-Palestinian                           relations,
 however, will tend to limit the pressure on
 the PLO and lead to disputes between
 Egypt a id Syria over the degree to which
 either should exert control over the
 Palestin ans.
 Arafat is not yet in a position to deliver
 the entire Palestinian movement on Egypt
 and Syria's terms. But the debacle suf-
 fered by the Palestinians in Lebanon ap-
 parently has led him to conclude that the
 PLO should moderate its political stance,
 in part as a means of deflecting Egyptian
 pressure and forestalling Asad's efforts to
 replace him with a pro-Syrian leader.
 Arafat privately has implied that he
 would accept a Palestinian state in the
 West Bank and Gaza, and his position has
 been publicly echoed by other Palestinian
 spokesmen.
 Arafat's goal in coming months will be
 to achieve a united Palestinian position to
 present to the various parties to the
 Geneva conference. Recent discussion of
 forming a government-in-exile, a move
 long urged by the Egyptians, is one indica-
 tion of this, as is the call for a session of
 the Palestine National Council.
 The PLO leader will continue to meet
 stout resistance from the various fedayeen
 "rejectionists," and bickering among the
 disparate factions is likely to preclude a
 unified Palestinian position.
 Complete unanimity among the
 Palestinians is not, however, a necessary
 precondition for their participation in the
 10    WEEKLY SUMMARY
 peace process. Arafat still speaks for the
 majority of the Palestinians, and Sadat
 and Asad are likely to lean heavily on the
 PLO leadership to support him.
 Asad would prefer to replace Arafat
 with a leader more amenable to Syrian in-
 fluence, but there is no other leader who
 could hope in the short run to exercise
 comparable authority over the Palestinian
 movement.
 In the meantime, Syria will work to un-
 dermine the rejectionist fedayeen. Much
 of the occasional fighting in Lebanon is a
 result of the efforts of Syrian forces or
 Syrian-backed PLO groups to weaken the
 rejectionist groups' military capability
 and to arrest or assassinate some of their
 leaders.
 Coordination of negotiating strategy
 between the PLO and Egypt and Syria
 has barely begun and will be a complex,
 quarrelsome  process.  The  outcome,
 however, is likely to be influenced by two
 major lessons the moderate Palestinians
 have learned from the Lebanese civil war:
 ? None of the key Arab states is go-
 ing to sacrifice its national interests by
 backing maximum Palestinian goals or

 Saudi Position
 Next to Egypt and Syria, Saudi Arabia
 will play the most important role on the
 Arab side if there is movement toward
 peace talks. The willingness of the Saudis
 to risk undermining the long-standing
 Saudi political goal of unity of the OPEC

 countries is in part a result of the peace
 offensive of Egypt and Syria.
 The Saudis have worked behind the
 scenes  to  ease Egyptian-Syrian
 differences and to help bring about a
 tenuous peace in Lebanon. They believe
 the Egyptian-Syrian peace initiative has a
 real chance-provided the US cooperates.
 They think their action to hold down
 prices has created an obligation on the
 part of the US to understand and
 cooperate with Arab efforts.
 The Saudis' action was not solely
 motivated by their desire to support and
 encourage the peace offensive; they also
 hoped to prevent an unfavorable US
 response in other areas affecting Saudi in-
 terests, specifically with regard to US
 arms sales and the Arab boycott against
 firms doing business with Israel.
 Egypt and Syria can expect the Saudis
 to back them with a further rise in oil
 prices if the Saudis conclude this is
 necessary to spur the negotiating process.
 The Saudis almost certainly would take
 such a step, although they probably would
 not take direct action-such as an em-
 bargo against the US-in 1977.
 They would, moreover, continue to ex-
 ercise some restraint on future OPEC
 price rises, primarily because they fear the
 effects of a very large price hike on
 Western political and economic stability.
 Jordan
 Jordan's role in the peace offensive will
 be limited largely to supporting Egypt and
 Syria and serving, as it has in the past, as
 a conduit for conveying Syrian views to
 US policy makers. King Husayn can take
 no territorial negotiating initiatives on his
 own, and he is unlikely to contest
 adherence by Egypt and Syria to the
 resolution adopted at the 1974 Arab sum-
 mit meeting that empowered the PLO to
 negotiate the return of the West Bank.
 Jordan's role will become important
 only when negotiations are under way on
 the formation of a Palestinian state. Jor-
 dan's Palestinian connection is a major
 reason for its diplomatic importance, and
 the roughly one million Palestinians in
 Jordan comprise the largest single group
 of expatriate Palestinians anywhere in the
 area. To protect his security interests,
 King Husayn is likely to seek some form
 of confederation or other close political
 association with a new Palestinian state.
 President Sadat's  recent suggestion
 that any such state be linked with Jordan
 may be indicative of an Arab intention to
 press for such an arrangement, once nego-
 tiations begin, in order to bypass Israeli
 objections to dealing with the PLO.
 Asad has expressed tentative support
 for this idea, but he and Sadat may only
 be testing US and Israeli willingness to
 work out a satisfactory compromise on
 the  Palestinian question.
 The USSR and Iraq have laid aside political differences in
 favor of closer military and economic ties. Last week, they may
 have concluded a major new military aid agreement.
 Iraq: Communist Military and Economic Ties
 The joint communique issued after
 Iraqi strongman Saddam Husayn's visit
 last week to the USSR reflects a con-
 siderable improvement in political
 relations since he last traveled to Moscow
 in April 1975. The Iraqis and Soviets may
 have completed agreement on a major
 new military  package on which
 negotiations may have started during
 Soviet  Premier  Kosygin's visit to
 Baghdad last May.
 At the time of Saddam Husayn's 1975
 trip, there were signs of strain between the
 two states. He did not meet with Soviet
 party chief Brezhnev, and the visit was cut
 short without explanation. Moscow was
 concerned  that the rapprochement
 between Iraq and Iran in March of that
 year would mean a diminution of the
 USSR's  influence  in  Iraq,  and  the
 Iraqi leader apparently did little to calm
 Soviet anxieties. Nor was any progress
 apparently made toward resolving long-
 standing political differences such as
 the treatment of Iraqi Communists by the
 ruling Iraqi Baath Party.
 In contrast, the statement issued on
 February 3 at the end of Saddam
 Husayn's recent visit indicates that the
 two sides have reduced their political
 squabbling. The communique also ex-
 plicitly referred to military assistance,
 something that had not appeared in such a
 joint statement since 1974.
 Political Aspects
 The most significant political aspect of
 the communique was the Soviets'
 willingness to give their blessing to the
 Baathist "revolutionary experiment,"
 which suggests that the Soviets have
 stopped making a major issue over Sad-
 dam Husayn's treatment of the Iraqi
 Communist Party.

 l he Baathist-Communist relationship
 has been uneasy at best, but at this point
 the Soviets apparently are not trying to
 induce  better relations among Iraq's
 squaDbling political groups-a position
 that will not please Iraqi Communists.
 TIc resurgence of Moscow's interest in
 Iraq is explained in part by Soviet set-
 hacks in Egypt and Syria. Significant
 Soviet influence in the Middle East now
 appears confined to Iraq and Libya.
 The Soviets have long disagreed with
 these two states, however, over an ap-
 proach to Arab-Israeli peace talks, with
 Moscow  insisting on  renewal of the
 Geneva  peace  conference.  Soviet
 diplomacy has not narrowed this
 difference, but Moscow is content to
 overlook the divergent approaches.
 F he Soviets used Saddam Husayn's
 visit to take swipes at both Egypt and
 Syria. The joint communique condemned
 "outside interference" in Lebanon, which
 is the standard Soviet formulation aimed
 at Syrian activities there. Kosygin's ad-
 dress at a banquet for the Iraqi leader
 stressed that Soviet economic programs
 abroad did not constitute a "charitable

 activity" and that Moscow would have to
 take into account "mutual interests and
 requirements," an obvious warning to
 Cairo.
 Record Military Deals in 1976
 Kosygin reportedly agreed last spring
 to supply Iraq with several major weapon
 systems.  Meanwhile, Soviet military
 deliveries to Iraq  under earlier
 agreements  rose  markedly last year,
 reaching a record level of $460 million.
 Aircraft to support air force moderniza-
 tion plans were by far the most important
 category. At least 86 planes, valued at
 over $250 million, were received.
 This is the largest number of aircraft
 the USSR has sent Iraq in a single year
 and more than three times the number
 sent in 1975.
 Recent Iraqi military purchases from
 the West and other attempts to diversify
 arms suppliers have contributed to the
 Soviet  willingness  to  provide more
 military equipment. The USSR is deter-
 mined to maintain influence in the Arab
 world and retain access to Persian Gulf
 maritime facilities. Continued access to
 Iraq's crude oil also has been an impor-
 tant factor in increased Soviet support for
 Iraq. The Soviets ship all of the 5 million
 tons of crude they import from Iraq each
 year to third-country customers to earn
 hard currency.
 Other Communist Suppliers
 Hungary and Czechoslovakia supplied
 most of the $80-million worth of equip-
 ment delivered from Eastern Europe in
 military-related equipment were made by
 North Korea under a $19-million agree-
 ment signed in 1975.

 Iraq also signed agreements last year to
 buy an additional $90 million of arms
 from East European countries and North
 to spend $9 million in Poland for un-
 specified military goods and services, and
 $30 million in North Korea for more than
 600 ZPU-4 air-defense machine
 guns-North Korea's largest arms agree-
 ment with a third-world country.
 To support Iraq's newly organized jet
 fighter squadrons, the Soviets and East
 Europeans increased the number of their
 military advisers and technicians by 100,
 to 1,100 in 1976. Some 300 Iraqi military
 personnel went to the USSR, mostly for
 pilot and aircraft training.
 Economic Relations
 The overwhelming concentration of
 Soviet aid in Iraqi power, water, and
 crude oil development will become more
 pronounced as a result of new agreements
 in 1976. A pact signed in May during the
 Kosygin  visit  reportedly  will  triple
 economic assistance in the next five years,
 compared with the last five.
 The agreement, like most recent Soviet
 economic accords with less     developed
 countries, probably is open-ended, calling
 for separate negotiations of credits for in-
 dividual projects. Commitments in 1976
 under the agreement are conservatively
 estimated at $150 million for power and
 irrigation contracts; they will probably be
 financed by long-term Soviet credits.
 In December, Iraq also signed con-
 tracts valued at $1 billion covering four
 major irrigation and power projects-the
 Hadithah and Habbaniyah dams on the
 Euphrates River and two canals linking
 irrigation areas in western and northern
 Iraq. Also discussed was further Soviet
 participation in the Hindiyah and Fallu-
 jah dams, which have a projected total
 cost of $1 billion.
 Soviet power and irrigation projects
 now in progress or under discussion would
 add 3 million megawatts of installed
 power capacity and bring 2.2 million hec-
 tares under irrigation. Soviet specialists
 are preparing a comprehensive land and
 water use program for Iraq as a guide for
 development activity over the next 25
 years.
 Soviet-aided projects completed in 1976
 included a 200-megawatt expansion of the
 Najibiyah thermal power plant, the
 42-kilometer Tharthar irrigation canal
 system, the first phase of the Mushrif oil
 field, and the Baghdad-Basrah pipeline
 (although the pipeline was not yet in
 operation at year end).  About 2,900
 Soviet technicians were in Iraq during
 1976 to support the projects. Priority
 attention was given to solving pressuriza-
 tion problems at the Rumaila oil field,
 which had been developed with Soviet aid.
 Output at the field is running at less than
 half the 800,000 barrel-per-day rate
 scheduled for the end of 1975. Water in-
 jection equipment ordered in August un-
 der the new economic agreement could
 raise output substantially by 1978.
 Work continued at five other fields as
 part of Moscow's 20-year oil development
 plan  for  Iraq.  Soviet-developed  oil
 facilities have been financed by more than
 $120 million in credits beginning in 1969.
 New dimensions could emerge in Iraq's
 economic relations with communist coun-
 tries through the relationship established
 with the Council for Mutual Economic
 Assistance in 1975. The first meeting of
 the Iraq-CEMA Joint Commission ended
 in November with a protocol establishing
 working groups to recommend suitable
 projects  for  multilateral  cooperation.
 Fields under study include petroleum,
 agriculture, and light industry.
 East European Economic Aid
 Iraq's apparent willingness to barter oil
 for industrial equipment and services
 makes Iraqi projects particularly attrac-
 tive to East European countries faced with
 rising oil import bills. Romania signed a
 new economic agreement last May that
 identified petroleum development, land
 reclamation, agriculture, and inland
 fisheries as priority targets for Romanian
 efforts.
 Czechoslovakia will continue to expand
 the Basrah refinery, which was completed
 in 1974 with $27 million in Czechoslovak
 credits. East Germany will participate in
 construction  of a  railroad  between
 Baghdad and the Syrian border, while
 Bulgaria is to complete food processing
 and livestock projects in 1977. Hungary
 has expanded oil exploration under a 1969
 credit and agreed to construct several
 housing projects.
 No financing arrangements for new
 projects have been announced, but it is
 likely that most East European countries
 are allowing a fast drawdown of their
 $275 million of outstanding credits. Most
 of the credits call for repayments in oil,
 and the East Europeans probably pressed
 hard for additional barter shipments to
 cover current account items such as
 technical services.

 As the power struggle continues within the ruling military
 group that overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, the regime appears
 to be losing ground both to an urban-based Marxist terrorist
 organization and to a variety o/ insurgent groups engaged in
 uerrilla war/are in the provinces.
 Ethiopia: Regime's Enemies Stronger
 The deaths of several inner-circle
 members of Ethiopia's ruling Provisional
 Mi itary  Administrative  Council  in
 another bloodletting last week is unlikely
 to result in any softening of the policies
 tha. have made the 28-month-old military
 regime widely unpopular. Radical First
 Vic. Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam,
 who appears more than ever to be calling
 the tune in Addis Ababa, has pledged to
 keen the regime on course and declared
 war anew on all the council's foes.
 he  council's  intractability  seems
 hound to cause further growth of an
 already  extensive    underground  leftist
 civi ian opposition centered in the capital
 and  of  multiple      provincial  insur-
 gencies that have been eroding the re-
 gime's control in the countryside for
 some time.
 Urban Agitation
 I he council's refusal to give civilians a
 significant role at the top levels of govern-
 men ensures continued opposition from
 the  Ethiopian  People's  Revolutionary
 Par y, a clandestine organization led by
 Marxist intellectuals. The allegations that
 the dead council members had been in-
 volved with the party, and the increased
 power of Mengistu-the party's main an-
 tagonist-will intensify  the enmity
 between the party and the government.
 the party's principal demand is an im-
 mediate return to civilian rule: its other
 policies  differ  little  from  the
 government's,  which  are avowedly
 soci 3hst.
 The  People s Revolutionary Party
 steadily gained strength last year and now
 has a network of supporters in several
 provinces.  Its primary supporters are
 students, teachers, and trade unionists,
 but it probably has the secret sympathy of
 some military officers and government of-
 ficials, including members of the ruling
 council. Most of these sympathizers do
 not share the party's leftist views, but see
 it as a means to hasten the downfall of the
 council.
 Last summer and fall, the party carried
 out a number of terrorist attacks in Addis
 Ababa directed especially against the
 council's civilian advisers who are
 members of a body popularly known as
 the politburo. Two members and four
 employees of the politburo were killed,
 and its headquarters was bombed. The
 party was distributing a regular publica-
 tion and other antigovernment tracts and
 posters.
 A crackdown begun in September
 resulted in a three-month lull in the par-
 ty's activities in Addis Ababa, but it ap-
 parently renewed its terrorism last month
 with the assassination of another pol~t-
 huro member. The party is probably also
 responsible for the recent attacks on the
 USIS library and the British cultural of-
 fice in Addis Ababa.
 The party played a role in organizing a
 recent boycott of classes by university
 students. The students ostensibly struck
 over university administrative matters,
 but there is little doubt their action was
 primarily a protest against the council.
 The party also has a military wing that
 conducts insurgent activity in at least
 three provinces.
 The People's Party lacks the means to
 overthrow the council, but it can probably
 expand its antigovernment activity and
 thus further discredit the regime.
 Insurgent Activity
 Major insurgent groups in different
 parts of the country have steadily expand-
 ed their activity in recent months. Some
 of the groups are leftist; others are led by
 former aristocrats who held high office in
 the old regime. Some are seeking in-
 dependence or autonomy from the central
 government; others want to force a
 change of government in Addis Ababa.
 Several have submerged their differences
 to work jointly against the military coun-
 cil.
 The secessionist guerrillas in Eritrea
 Province have for years conducted hit-
 and-run attacks on army garrisons, am-
 bushed convoys, and mined roads. In
 mid-1976 they began staging conventional
 attacks on isolated army posts in some of
 the smaller towns.
 The new strategy is proving effective.
 Within the past two months, the rebels
 have overrun  two towns  near the
 Sudanese border and an army post in
 southern Eritrea. Despite two major ef-
 forts, the government has failed to break
 the five-month siege of a town in central
 Eritrea. Insurgent pressure has forced the
 army to abandon some isolated garrisons
 it cannot keep supplied.
 The guerrillas' success reflects in part
 their effective use of the large numbers of
 recruits that have joined the movement
 during the past two years. Government
 weaknesses have also helped. Government
 forces suffer from poor morale and dis-
 cipline,  inadequate  logistics,  and  a

 SECRET
 shortage of qualified leaders. All these
 problems are growing.
 The government is likely to suffer
 further reverses in the next few months,
 but it will probably be able to maintain
 control of the major cities and highways
 by abandoning outlying posts and concen-
 trating its forces-a strategy it has ap-
 parently  begun implementing.  The
 government can use its air power, armor,
 and heavy weapons more effectively in
 defense of the larger cities than of the
 smaller garrisons.
 If the rebels attempt to mount sustain-
 ed large-scale attacks, their own deficien-
 cies will become more evident. They suf-
 fer from inadequate communications and
 have only a few heavy weapons. They also
 face problems in maintaining a steady
 flow of supplies because their supply
 routes from Sudan are long and cross dif-
 ficult terrain.
 The rebels are weakened by personality
 clashes and ideological, religious, and
 ethnic differences. There are now three
 major factions. One group, formed last
 year, operates independently. The other
 two work together only sporadically.
 Lack of unity is straining the in-
 surgents' relations with the Arab coun-
 tries that supply almost all their financial
 and military assistance, Although Arab
 threats to end aid unless the insurgents
 unify their forces may force the guerrilla
 factions to cooperate more closely, the
 three rebel groups are unlikely to become
 a unified fighting force in the near future.
 No insurgent leader can claim to speak
 for the whole movement.
 The ruling council has recently shown
 renewed interest in opening negotiations
 with the Eritrean insurgents, but the coun-
 cil's efforts are not likely to bear fruit. In
 late January, it instructed a group of
 Eritrean elders-traditional religious and
 ethnic leaders-to convey to the guerrillas
 the council's willingness to talk with in-
 surgent representatives without precon-
 ditions. The council on previous occasions
 has used the elders as emissaries, but their
 efforts have not resulted in significant
 progress toward negotiations.
 The insurgents have long insisted they
 will negotiate only after the government
 agrees to grant Eritrea complete in-
 dependence. They rejected a government
 proposal last May that would have
 granted the province a degree of local
 autonomy.
 Another insurgent group, the Ethiopian
 Democratic Union, has made recent gains
 in Begemdir Province. It is led by exiles
 who held important positions in the old
 regime. Its leaders include two former
 generals, Nega Tegegne and Iyasu
 Mengesha, who have joined forces with
 Ras Mengesha Seyoum, the traditional
 leader of the Tigre people, one of the two
 leading ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
 The Democratic Union has attracted
 other former aristocrats and conservative
 landlords in northern Ethiopia, as well as
 small farmers and peasants dissatisfied
 with the military regime's disruption of
 their traditional society and land tenure
 system. The group's professed aim is to
 bring about the downfall of the military
 regime in Addis Ababa and replace it with
 a government that will carry out reforms
 with more moderation and without the
 trappings of Marxist ideology.
 Sudan has provided the group with
 some arms and probably some financial
 assistance and allowed the guerrillas to
 use Sudanese territory as a base of
 operations. The group has also received
 arms and money from the Eritrean
 guerrillas and conducted joint military
 operations with the Eritrean Liberation
 Front, one of the rebel factions, but the
 alliance reportedly is becoming strained.

 A combined force last month gained
 control of two neighboring towns near
 the Sudanese border on the provincial
 boundary between Eritrea and Begem-
 dir. The commander of the army battalion
 guarding one of the towns defected to the
 Dem Jcratic Union along with most of his
 troops. Union forces have fought sharp
 clashes with the army in other parts of the
 province, at times inflicting heavy
 casu~.lties on government troops. An-
 tigo%ernment activity is increasing
 throughout the province, and the govern-
 ment has arrested suspected sympathizers
 in Gondar, the provincial capital.
 Also fighting the government's forces in
 Begerndir Province are members of the
 small military wing of the Ethiopian
 Peop.e's Revolutionary Party; they are
 conducting operations in the eastern sec-
 tor.  I'he Democratic  Union and the
 Peop e's  Revolutionary  Party, despite
 ideological differences, have apparently
 reached a tacit understanding not to in-
 terfere with each other in order to main-
 tain combined  pressure against the
 military council.
 Other Insurgencies
 The Tigre People's Liberation Front is
 active in Tigre Province. Theorganization
 is led by a Marxist ideologue, and its
 propaganda reflects a leftist ideology,
 although some of its rank and file are
 probably nonleftists.
 The Tigre group has concentrated its
 activity along a primary east-west road
 connecting major provincial towns. The
 towns are controlled by the government,
 but the guerrillas control much of the
 countryside, and government traffic can
 move along the highway only in heavily
 armed convoys.
 Insurgent activity isgoing on in Wollo
 Province,  too.  In the north and
 northwestern areas, there are guerrillas
 led by prominent local landlords who have
 ties to the Democratic Union. They also
 appear to be cooperating with a small
 People's Revolutionary Party force in the
 province.
 In eastern Wollo, the Afar Liberation
 Front conducts sporadic raids along the
 border with the French Territory of the
 Afars and Issas. The Afars, who enjoyed a
 great deal of autonomy under the old
 regime, revolted in 1975 when the military
 council tried to impose central govern-
 ment authority over their tribal lands.
 The Afar leaders maintain close ties to
 the Ethiopian Democratic Union.
 Somalia Involved
 Major insurgent activity is also under
 way in southern and eastern Ethiopia. The
 insurgents in these regions include both
 ethnic Somalis and dissident tribesmen
 who have a long history of resistance to
 Addis Ababa. Somalia is assisting both
 groups.
 The tribesmen are recruited in
 Ethiopia, sent to Somalia to receive train-
 ing and arms, and infiltrated back across
 the border. Some Somali regular troops
 have accompanied the insurgents into
 Ethiopia.
 It has long been Mogadiscio's aim to
 annex the Somali-inhabited portions of
 Ethiopia. Somalia also supports the in-
 surgents in order to divert Ethiopian

 military resources that could be used
 against Somalia in a war over the French
 Territory of the Afars and Issas.
 The insurgency in these regions is most
 serious in Bale Province, where guerrillas
 have deeply eroded the government's con-
 trol of the countryside. In Sidamo and
 Harar provinces insurgents stage sporadic
 raids on government installations and
 make travel without armed escort hazar-
 dous in some areas. The insurgents in all
 three provinces have laid mines, staged
 terrorist  incidents,  and  proselytized
 among the local villagers.
 Outlook: More Trouble
 The council is continually increasing
 the size of its forces. A 5,000-man
 counterinsurgency division  trained by
 Israeli advisers was formed last year. A
 new division is in the process of being
 formed with men from existing units and
 from the police.
 The council has taken preliminary steps
 to form still another division. It is also
 devoting considerable effort to es-
 tablishing militias throughout the country
 to be used primarily in fighting in-
 surgents. Several thousand men have
 already been recruited and provided small
 arms and rudimentary military training.
 The use of inexperienced troops and
 poorly trained and armed militia will not
 significantly improve the government's
 military capabilities. The logistic system
 will be unable to support the increased
 manpower adequately. The new troops
 may help the government's defenses in
 some areas, but they will. not enable the
 government to take the offensive against
 any of the insurgents.
 Indeed, the insurgents may well gain
 control of additional territory and con-
 solidate their control over areas they
 already hold over the next. few months.
 The several insurgencies do not have
 sufficient force to overthrow the council in
 Addis Ababa. They do, however, weaken
 the government's staying power. The ar-
 my's reverses have caused a further
 decline in morale and discipline. Defec-
 tions are increasing, although they have
 not yet reached major proportions.
 Dissension  is  particularly  serious
 among the armed forces in Eritrea. A
 delegation supposedly representing all the
 troops responsible for the defense of one
 of Eritrea's major cities flew to Addis
 Ababa late last month to demand that the
 regime negotiate a peaceful settlement of
 the Eritrean problem.
 Further government setbacks at the
 hands of guerrillas could cause more unit
 commanders to question the council's
 leadership. The killing of the council
 members last week doubtless created new
 enemies for the Mengistu faction and

 could lead to more coup plotting. At
 present, however, dissidents in the armed
 forces are dispersed and leaderless, and no
 one military leader has a strong enough
 base of support to challenge the council
 directly.
 There may be further upheaval over the
 next six months within the council itself.
 A continuing inability to solve the coun-
 try's  problems  could  lead  to
 recriminations  and  a search for
 scapegoats among council members.

 President Lopez Portillo has already done much to restore
 public confidence in Mexico. He arrives in Washington next
 week for a visit that he says is intended to demonstrate the im-
 portance he attaches to close ties with the US.
 Mexico: Lopez P-ortillo's First Sixty Days
 A ter two months in office, Mexican
 President Jose Lopez Portillo has done
 muci to restore public confidence, which
 had been badly shaken by a series of
 economic and political blows in the wan-
 ing days of the Echeverria administration.
 The new  President has established
 economic stabilization as a primary goal,
 set priorities for increased output of food
 and  energy,  selected a moderate
 cabinet, and moved quickly to reorganize
 the government. He has also given early
 signals of greater cooperation with the US
 on  bilateral issues  in expectation of
 reciprocal assistance.
 Lopez Portillo arrives in Washington
 on Fsbruary 14 to begin a state visit that
 he has said is intended to demonstrate the
 importance he attaches to close ties with
 the L'S. It is also likely to provide further
 reassirances to the Mexican public and to
 enhance his own personal image.
 A "New Style"
 Under the Mexican system, the power
 of the presidency is almost limitless, and
 Lopes Portillo's personal style of govern-
 ing will influence Mexico's course for the
 next .ix years.
 With an excellent record as an ad-
 ministrator, he has thus far proven to be a
 more deliberate,  pragmatic decision
 maker than his predecessor.
 Basic Mexican policies will probably
 not change much. Lopez Portillo reflects
 in many ways the system that produced
 him, from his administrative team of
 long-time confidants to his rhetorical
 defense of the revolutionary myth-the
 notion that the Revolution of 1910 that
 ideologically underpins the Mexican
 government and official party is a con-
 tinuing, institutionalized revolution.
 Domestic Priorities
 Lopez   Portillo  has  candidly
 acknowledged that Mexico's economic
 difficulties will remain serious at least
 through midyear. Economic stabilization
 is clearly his top short-term priority. He
 has sought the support of private business
 through a series of agreements calling for
 combined public-private investments of
 $5 billion over six years to stimulate
 production and create jobs.
 He has persuaded labor to accept a
 modest 9-  to  10-percent wage hike,
 arranged for private manufacturers to
 provide 90 basic consumer goods at
 reduced prices, and created a national
 workers' bank.
 The President has designated self-suf-
 ficiency in food and energy as his ad-
 ministration's other top priorities. He ap-
 parently favors land collectivization for
 more efficient agricultural production,
 but will have to take care not to arouse
 campesino groups by appearing to con-
 travene the revolutionary ideal of
 agrarian reform.
 He must also reassure private land-
 owners that their farms are secure before
 many will make the investments necessary
 to increase production. In the meantime,
 he is quietly negotiating a compromise in
 the dispute that arose last fall between
 peasants and landholders in Sonora and
 Sinaloa states, when former president
 Echeverria's  expropriation  of private
 holdings sparked land invasions by
 peasants.
 Another priority, and one that Mex-
 icans hope will be their salvation in years
 to come, is oil. Lopez Portillo apparently
 intends to pursue rapid development of
 newly discovered reserves.
 Government Reorganization
 Since the late 1960s, Lopez Portillo has
 urged that the Mexican government be
 reorganized. After one month in office he
 restructured the executive branch. The
 most important new cabinet ministry is
 the Secretariat of Programming and
 Budget, which supersedes the Presidency
 Secretariat.
 This office is to be the government's
 financial center and key economic plan-
 ning agency. Its responsibilities include
 budget matters, supervision of govern-
 ment  expenditures  and  investments,
 overall management of the state sector,
 and liaison with other secretariats on
 economic matters.
 Another major change is the merging of
 the National Patrimony Secretariat with
 industrial  development  responsibilities
 from the former Industry and Commerce
 Secretariat; the new Secretariat will
 provide uniform management of govern-
 ment industries, promote private and
 public industrial development, and con-
 trol natural resources. Commerce will

 regulate production, distribution, expor-
 tation, and import control.
 Human Settlements and Public Works
 were consolidated to coordinate housing,
 population, and welfare programs.
 Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources
 were joined to increase agricultural out-
 put. The government will also reorganize
 the nearly 800 autonomous agencies and
 make them subordinate to the cabinet
 secretariats.
 The New Cabinet
 The new cabinet members, mostly close
 personal friends of the President, span the
 political spectrum, but collectively seem
 to be a more moderate team than that of
 Echeverria. This has enhanced public con-
 fidence, especially among businessmen.
 The selections of Jesus Reyes Heroles
 as secretary of government and Santiago
 Roe] as foreign secretary were the only
 major surprises. Roel is well-connected
 abroad, but has had little: diplomatic ex-
 perience. His appointment may be
 politically motivated; he is from
 Monterrey, the home base of a powerful
 conservative business clique that was con-
 stantly at odds with Echeverria.
 Reyes Heroles is an academic and a
 political ideologue with wide top-level ad-
 ministrative experience in government
 and the official party, but he may lack the
 toughness needed for the secretariat of
 government.
 The secretary of programming and
 budget, Carlos Tello, is a young
 economist who gained the President's
 confidence while serving under him in the
 Finance Secretariat. Since Lopez Portillo
 will probably use the new ministry as a
 base for his personal direction of
 economic policy, Tello may become more
 of an executive officer than an
 authoritative policy maker in his own
 right.
 Another key figure will be Jorge Diaz
 Serrano, Director of PEMEX, the
 government petroleum agency. He is a
 tough administrator with broad ex-
 perience in the private oil industry. As a
 comparative outsider he will try to im-
 prove PEMEX's efficiency and overcome
 opposition from conservationists within
 PEMEX who would like to restrict
 production.
 Relations with the US
 Reports have consistently indicated
 that  Lopez  Portillo's general  foreign
 policies will be more narrowly focused
 and pragmatic than Echeverria's, that
 Mexico's third-world role will be more
 moderate, and that the Mexicans will
 cooperate more with the US in inter-
 national forums.
 The expected new slant has not yet
 become  apparent,  however,  perhaps
 because of policy  inertia  from the
 previous administration.  Since Lopez
 Portillo's inauguration:
 ? Foreign Secretary  Roe] has
 declared that Mexico will continue its
 efforts on behalf of' nuclear disarma-
 ment, a stand that has led to disagree-
 ment with the US in past UN debates.
 ? The Mexican UN delegation has
 resisted US efforts for a treaty on cor-
 rupt practices because Mexico believes
 it would delay substantive work on a
 code of conduct for transnational cor-
 porations.
 ? In the current International
 Telecommunications Union's Broad-
 casting-Satellite Conference, Mexico
 brusquely dismissed a US proposal on
 evolutionary planning without the
 customary prior consultation.
 ? Roel has said Mexico will con-
 tinue to press industrialized nations to
 accept  the principles  of the
 Echeverria-sponsored Charter of
 Economic Rights and Duties of States.
 In bilateral issues with the US, on the
 other hand, there are clearer signs that
 Lopez Portillo will pursue moderate,
 cooperative policies.
 ? He has advised US officials that
 restrictive laws on foreign investment
 will be interpreted flexibly.
 ? Mexico has offered to sell the US
 emergency supplies of natural gas and
 crude oil.
 ? Lopez Portillo has shown that he
 will cooperate in strong narcotics en-      25X1
 forcement, despite the appointment of
 a known trafficker as Federal District
 police  chief.
