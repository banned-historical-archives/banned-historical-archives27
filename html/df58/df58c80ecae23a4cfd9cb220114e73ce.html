 19 November 1985
 SUBJECT:  HPSCI Briefing -- 19 November 1985
 Attendees:  Daniel, Kastenmeier, Stokes, Beilenson, Hamilton, Stump, Ireland,
 Cheney, Livingston, McEwen, Brown (late), and 10 staff.
 Absent :    Dwyer, McHugh, Roe, McCurdy, Hyde, Michel
 The DDI addressed the following topics in the 30-minute briefing segment:
 Colombian Volcano Disaster
 Colombian Guerrilla Attack in Bogota
 Failed Coup in Liberia
 Snap Election in the Philippines
 The following questions were asked:
 Hamilton: Will Marcos be picking a successor when he names his Vice
 President?  Probably not.
 What will be the impact of a perceived rigged election?  Marcos
 will try to make the rigging not too obvious; in any case electorate
 expects it to be rigged.
 Stump: Is Savimbi a Marxist (Hyde question from last briefing).   Answered
 from talking points prepared for Hyde query.  (Stump asked for copy;
 OLL will provide.)
 What will rigged Philippine election and Marcos victory mean for
 the opposition?  Will weaken them for next legislative elections;
 result in lost opportunity for effective democratic participation
 in government.
 Stokes: Don't Liberian officials contend that US-Cuba-Libya were behind
 the coup plot?   Reports early on that some did; but no official
 allegations.
 Could coup have been planned by Doe?  We do not know.

 Was M-19 after drug records in its attack in Bogota?  Some reports
 suggest so; do not know for sure.
 Cheney: Do we know details of Anglican negotiator Waite's mission
 in Lebanon?  No.
 Daniel: Was there an SR-71 flight at the time Soviet equipment for
 Nicaragua was seen at Mariel harbor?  Do not know (OLL will
 task DDS&T and CRES for answer).
 There is no briefing scheduled for 26 November; unlikely to be one on
 3 December because Congress reconvenes that same day.  OLL will keep
 us apprised.

 Quiwonkpa's Failed Coup
 Former Commanding General Quiwonkpa, who engineered the coup attempt last
 Tuesday (12 Nov), was executed last week and his body put up for public
 viewing to quash any remaining popular support for his effort to unseat
 Head of State Doe.
 Quiwonkpa had been in exile in the US, Ivory Coast, and most
 recently Sierra Leone, since his implication in a failed coup
 against Doe in 1983.  Prior to his exile he had some measure of
 popular support among junior officers and unlisted men.
 We have little information on the men that operated with him, but
 about 20-30 Sierra Leonean mercenaries were reportedly involved.
 Some supporters of the coup apparently have escaped into Ivory
 Coast.
 The rebels probably moved last week in hopes of taking advantage of
 opposition claims of fraud in last months's presidential and legislative
 elections.
 -- Doe announced himself as the victor despite opposition claims that
 Liberian Action Party Candidate Jackson Doe had won.  Elections
 results are due to be certified by the end of the month.
 -- Quiwonkpa and his followers probably calculated that they could
 rally public support for their takeover by promising to restore
 political freedom and reverse Liberia's chronic economic decline.
 Doe was able to put down the coup because Quiwonkpa did not have the full
 support of key military units.
 -- The majority of the 800-man Executive Mansion Guard and the 400-man
 first battalion--made up largely of Doe's fellow Krahn tribesmen--
 remained loyal to Doe and were instrumental in thwarting the coup.
 -- The rebels attacked, but were unable to break into the Executive
 Mansion where Doe remained throughout the attempt.  Many plotters
 fled after troops loyal to Doe recaptured a radio station and
 announced they were in control.
 Doe has acted quickly and forcefully to purge his government and military
 of possible coup backers.

 25X1
 -- Many of Quinwonkpa's fellow Gio tribesmen from north central Nimba
 county have been killed or arrested.
 -- Candidates who participated in last month's presidential election
 and other key opposition leaders also have been arrested, but we
 are unable to confirm reports of executions.
 -- We have reports of violent retaliation by some undisciplined
 troops, but Monrovia is now calm and armed soldiers are gradually
 returning to their duties.
 Although Doe's position probably has been strengthened in the wake of the
 coup attempt, it nevertheless highlights the vulnerabilitity of any regime
 to discontented elements in the 6,600-man military which is the final
 arbiter of power in Liberia.
 -- The majority of the armed forces probably see Doe as the best
 guarantor of their corporate interests, but he will have to be
 sensitive to complaints of late pay, ethnic favoritism, or personal
 rivalries which could serve as powerful rallying points for future
 coups.
 -- Doe will use the attempt to intimidate the opposition, but holding
 key leaders without trial or excessive brutality will further
 undermine his popularity and the legitimacy of the return to
 civilian rule.
 The failed coup may temporarily strain relations with Washington--
 suspected by some officials of encouraging the plotters--but Monrovia is
 likely to avoid seriously jeopardizing ties to its principal economic and
 military benefactor.
 -- Doe may resist US urgings of restraint by accusing the opposition
 of complicity in the coup attempt and arguing that he must purge
 all potential threats to his rule.
 -- Doe is likely to request additional US financial and military
 assistance to help beef up his personal security, placate
 disgruntled members of the military, and stem chronic economic
 decline.

 Presidential and Legislative Elections
 Liberia held multiparty elections on 15 October for the first time since
 Head of State Doe seized power in a military coup in 1980.  Three
 opposition parties--the Liberian Action Party (LAP), the Unity Party (UP),
 and the Liberian Unification Party (LUP)--participated along with Doe's
 National Democratic Party of Liberia (NDPL).
 Voting came off with surprisingly few problems.  Opposition members
 were allowed to observe balloting at most polls and were generally
 pleased with voting procedures.
 Turnout was heavy throughout the country and voters felt free to
 cast bal lots for any of four parties.  With only few exceptions,
 the military was noticeably absent at polling places and observed
 orders to remain in their barracks.
 Nevertheless, the elections were marred by allegations of irregularities
 during ballot counting and the opposition has refused to participate in
 the new government which is scheduled to convene in December.
 -- Despite the government's announcement that Doe was elected with
 50.1 percent of the vote, the opposition firmly believes LAP
 candidate Jackson Doe won.
 -- The opposition also claims it won more than 13 of 64 seats in the
 House and 5 of 26 in the Senate, credit to them by the government.
 We have no hard evidence that Doe actual
 the results.
 In the wake of the failed coup on 12 November, Doe has clamped down on the
 opposition and further reduced the likelihood that the opposition will
 participate in a national unity government.
 -- The three opposition candidates and many key leaders have been
 arrested for questioning regarding the coup attempt.
 -- Doe has accused the Liberian Action Party of conspiring in the coup
 attempt, and he is likely to ban its participation in the new
 government.
 Doe could decide to delay or abort the transition to civilian rule if the
 opposition remains firm in its refusal to participate.  Doe could proclaim
 himself president and pledge to democratize the new government at some
 future date.

 -- Doe is likely to have considerable difficulty boosting his sagging
 popularity and will continue to rely on harsh tactics to suppress
 the opposition.
 -- He will probably continue to make spur-of-the-moment decisions on
 political problems rather than adhere to a long term strategy of
 opening the political system.

 Details of Economic Crisis
 Fiscal mismanagement and stagnant export markets have placed serious
 strains on Liberia's economy.
 -- Chronic budget deficits have forced Liberia to borrow heavily
 abroad--external debt has increased by two-thirds since 1979 to
 $1 billion.
 -- Vital iron ore and rubber exports have declined rapidly since 1980
 as international prices tumbled and the strong US dollar--which
 serves as the official currency--hurt export competitivenss.
 Withdrawal of external credit facilities may result in periodic shortages
 in food and fuel imports in the near future.
 -- Liberia cannot draw on its suspended IMF standby agreement pending
 clearance of about $34 million in arrears.
 -- Commercial credit lines also have been cut because of overdue debt
 payments.
 With few resources available to finance this fiscal year's projected
 budget deficit of $164 million, Monrovia is likely to take drastic
 measures.
 -- The continual release of local coins to cover domestic expenditures
 already has all but severed Liberia's traditional link to the US
 dollar.
 -- Liberia may intensify requests for increased US assistance, but
 lagging payments on US loans threaten suspension of future aid.

 Talking Points for the DDI
 Angola:   Orientation of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
 Savimbi, in our view,  s._.a_pagp~atic nationalist who does not appear
 firmly wedded to an                      B   ~" radical orientation.
 --He received his higher education in Portugal and Sw tzerland,
 switching from medicine to political science.  He received some
 training in 8uerr lla war are  n Communis   hina.
 --Savimbi professes to be a Ch.~istian and an adherent of the United
 Church of Christ, which funded his early universff , studies.
 --Prior to Angolan independence in 1975, Savimbi attracted aid from
 Communist-China, was an admirer of-Ka

 --In the April 1984 issue of Reason magazine, Savimbi is quoted as
 saying that as a guerrilla leaderand,tactican, Mao Tse-tung was

 should be avoided at all costs.
 Available evidence does not suggest that._SavimbLespouses Marxist

 little  different from policies long pursued by moderate pro-Western
 African states as Ivory Coast, Senegal, Kenya, and Cameroon.
 --A 1977 UNITA party congress spelled out a program for a future UNITA
 government that included free and compulsory education, free medical-'
 care, and an agriculturally-based economy with privately-owned farms
 and state controlled public services.
 --Savimbi in public statements says he would welcome an-Auppoort
 private investment in Angola's economy.
 Savimbi's moderate African, Arab, and Western European supporters voice
 no qualms about his ideology.
 --Moreover, we doubt that South Africa would back Savimbi if he were
 believed to be a Marxist-Leninist.

 Snap Election Update
 Marcos last week submitted a letter to the National Assembly stating that
 he will resign from office on the first day of the new presidential term.  He
 also submitted a bill to the Assembly establishing procedures for the special
 election, now tentatively scheduled for early to mid-February.  The election
 bill is slated to be discussed in the Assembly this week, following final
 debate on a succession bill currently before the body.
 -- A President--and possibly a Vice President--will be elected to serve
 six-year terms ending 13 June 1992.
 -- Candidates must file their bid by 2 December.
 -- Guidelines will be established for accreditation of private citizens
 watch dog groups, official accreditation of the dominant opposition
 party, and deadlines for voter registration.
 To pave the way for debate over the election bill, the Assembly passed
 the critical election code last week.
 -- The ruling party changed the election code to incorporate opposition
 demands for election safeguards, including the use of tamper proof
 ballot boxes and prohibiting voting areas within military
 installations.
 -- The code, however, contains several provisions that heavily stack the
 deck in favor of the ruling party.  These include allowing local
 government officials to sit on poll monitoring panels and granting the
 elections commission--controlled by Marcos--the power to disqualify
 individual poll monitors of designated watchdog groups such as NAMFREL.
 Despite public reservations about the constitutionality of Marcos's
 resignation scheme, the opposition seems to be moving towards a decision to
 participate; frictions among the leading contenders, however, appear about to
 end any chance of opposition unity for the elections.
 -- Opposition groups met this weekend to choose a Presidential and Vice
 Presidential candidate, but the Embassy reports that the meetings were
 acrimonious.  The chances for opposition unity have dropped sharply in
 our view, despite agreement among most leaders that a joint ticket
 between Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel would make the strongest
 opposition ticket.
 -- Meanwhile, Cory Aquino told the DCM that she has decided to run in the
 election, but refuses to share a ticket with Laurel.  In a separate
 conversation with the DCM, Laurel confided that he would not accept a
 Vice Presidential slot on Mrs. Aquino's ticket and was committed to
 running no matter what other opposition leaders had planned.
 -- For its part, NAMFREL is concerned that it will only be able to monitor
 60 percent of the country's polls if the election is held on its
 current timetable, but is moving ahead with efforts to organize
 effectively before February.

 President Marcos, meanwhile, is not waiting for the Assembly to debate
 the bill.
 -- He campaigned last week in the Visayan Island of Cebu--a traditional
 opposition stronghold--and is planning to make one campaign trip out of
 Manila a week.

 Marcos is almost certainly confident that he can win an election.
 moreover, 0 he is leaving                                                                                        25X1
 nothing to chance.

 -- Last August he packed the election commission with loyalists.
 -- He also has removed operational control of the local police from the
 military and returned it to local mayors--a move that many political
 observers believe is designed to facilitate the use of these units to
 intimidate voters during balloting.
 As the campaign gets underway Marcos still has to decide how to handle
 General Ver's impending aqu i tta l .
 -- The verdict on Ver and 25 others is in, and is due to be announced on
 Wednesday.  A motion for mistrial filed by 30 prominent Filipinos is
 currently before the Supreme Court and could delay the announcement,
 however.
 -- In any case, Marcos does not need Ver as Chief of Staff to ensure
 military loyalty during the elections.  Ver continues to remain active
 behind the scenes in the military and controls its considerable
 intelligence apparatus, which recently conducted a nationwide survey to
 gauge public reaction to the notion of an early vote.  Marcos also
 included Ver in a meeting held Monday with senior military officials to
 discuss Marcos's proposed reorganization of the armed forces.

 Talking Points for the DDI
 18 November 1985
 Syria-Jordan-Iraq Reconciliation
 Syria sees its participation in reconciliation talks with Jordan
 as an opportunity to take advantage of the faltering Hussein-Arafat
 peace initiative and to reinforce the hardline Arab position regarding
 negotiations with Israel.      At the same time Syria may be taking
 cautious steps toward a tactical accommodation with Iraq to create an
 alternative to its souring relations with Iran.
 --   We do not believe that Syria's efforts signifies a
 willingness to make concessions on their opposition to
 the Hussein-Arafat accord or to modify their support for
 Iran in its war with Iraq.
 -    Although Damascus has reportedly been able to extract
 sizable financial commitments from the Saudis in
 exchange for its efforts to repair relations with Amman
 and Baghdad, these inducements alone do not offer enough
 incentives for actual reconciliation.
 Assad believes closer ties to Amman will enable Syria to control
 the peace process and restrict Jordanian options.  Syria remains
 determined not to allow other Arab states to renounce the policy of
 confrontation toward Israel or accept bilateral settlements.
 --   Assad would like to appropriate from Hussein the
 preeminent role in formulating Arab terms for a
 settlement with Israel.
 Assad seems prepared to explore all possibilities that might
 enable Syria to play a central role in inter-Arab relations.
 --   Assad may try to maintain Syria's radical ties while
 improving its standing with moderate Arab states.
 An accommodation between Syria and Iraq, if it develops, is likely
 to be fleeting--because of historic political animosities.  The Syrian
 approach to Iraq is prompted by economic considerations and Syria's
 growing annoyance with its Iranian ally.

 --   Iran's suspension of oil shipments to Syria during the
 last month and friction over Syrian debts are factors
 causing Damascus to reassess its ties to Iran.
 --   The Syrians have been angered by Iranian interference in
 Lebanon--particularly by the activities of Iranian-
 backed Muslim fundamentalists, who are determined to
 undermine Syrian efforts to impose order on Lebanon's
 warring factions.

 Talking Points for DDI
 19 November 1985
 We believe that even if SA-5 equipment is delivered to Tripoli at
 this time, construction of missile sites/complexes and training for the
 Libyan crews could require another year before the Libyan SA-5's become
 fully operational.
 -- Qadhafi is likely to insist, as he has for other weapons systems,
 on Libyan control of the SA-5s.
 -- We believe that Qadhafi would construct missile sites along the
 northern coast of Libya such as Banghazi, Misratah, and Tripoli/
 Tarabulus in order to protect the Libyan-claimed Gulf of Sidra
 and the capital city.
 -- When operational, SA-5 missiles fired from Libyan sites will
 have a maximum operational range of approximately 300 kilometers;
 enough to cover the entire Gulf of Sidra and the portion of the
 southern Mediterranean operating area north of the Gulf.
 If Qadhafi believes that the US is likely to respond to or retaliate
 against him, especially over construction of the SA-5 sites and deployment
 of missiles, he may be willing to accept Soviet or Syrian personnel to
 help man the Libyan SA-5s.  This, in turn, would decrease the amount of
 time necessary to develop operational SA-5 sites to be used to target US
 military forces operating in the Mediterranean.
