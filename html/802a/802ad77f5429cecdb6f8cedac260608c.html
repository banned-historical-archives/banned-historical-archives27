 New Man for CIA
 Only a few insiders have much basis
 for judging the  I,.ork  of the United
 States  Central Intelligence  Agency
 (CIA) and they rarely talk. But there
 are a few hints along the way about the
 meaning of President Nixon's decision
 to name James R. Schlesinger Ct  di-
 rector and make the present director,
 Richard Helms. ambassador to Iran.
 President Nixon has not been satisfied
 with the performance of the U.S. "in-
 telligence Community." In late 1969 lie
 cut CIA personnel abroad by to to 1S
 per cent. Ile ordered a study of the CIA
 and intelligence generally by James
 Schlesinger, then a military and inter-
 national specialist in the While House
 Office of Management and Budget. and
 by K. W. Smith, a National Security
 Council aide.
 Their report came out in May, 1971. It.
 recommended  pulling intelligence  to-
 gether either by giving CIA Director
 Helms more authority over the five oth-
 er U.S. agencies beside the CIA that
 gather intelligence, or by setting up a
 new cabinet-level Department of In-
 Atomic Energy Conunission and  the
 Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 Now the President pulls Helms out
 and puts in one of the authors of the
 report - Schlesinger.
 One complaint that the President is
 said to have against the CIA under
 helms is that the CIA often has been
 realistic about Vietnam. For example,
 the CIA didn't think bombing North
 Vietnam `would be effective, or that it
 was effective after it started.
 Ousting Helms for being right  is
 wrong.
 On the other hand. Senator J. William
 Fulbright's  Foreign  Relations Com-
 mittee has been hassling the CIA for its
 private wars in Laos and Cambodia,
 which either violate U.S. law or come
 close to it. Ousting Helms for making
 war against the will of Congress Would
 be proper - but it is clear Helms w As
 only carrying, out Nixon's policy there.
 James Schlesinger is an economist
 who spent 12 yeau?s in the RAND Corpo-
 ration, an Air Force think tank, then
 three years as a Nixon appointee in the
 ,Bureau of the Budget and the White
 telligencc.
 In November, 1971. the White House et, then a year as Nixon's choice as
 ordered a reorganisation of intelligence chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
 activities to give llelms more leadership                                  mission, His record in government is
 over the rival intelligence agencies in good, but lie is a weapons man and a
 the State and Defense Departments, the hardliner.

 By Richard E. Ward.
 Last of a series
 How will a potential Vietnam ceasefire affect
 Cambodia?
 Contrary to statements by the U.S.-sponsored
 Phnom Penh administration about peace talks
 with the "Khmer Rouge," the Royal Government
 of National Union of Cambodia, headed by
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has denied that there
 have been any discussions between the resistance
 .forces,and the puppet regime.
 Although the government of National Union
 has given its full support to the nine-point peace
 agreement for Vietnam, after it was announced
 by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the
 Cambodian resistance is determined to fight until
 the ' U.S.-sponsored Lon Nol regime is over-
 thrown. Recent Western press reports imply that
 this may well be within, the capacity of the
 resistance forces within the foreseeable future.
 The position of the National Union govern-
 ment in no way conflicts with the position of its
 Indochinese allies, which would be able to
 furnish greater assistance to the Cambodian
 resistance if there were a cease-fire in Vietnam
 and the U.S. persisted in prolonging the war in
 Cambodia.
 In the short run, the U.S. could bolster the
 Phnom Penh regime for a time, but the days of its
 Cambodian clients appear to be numbered,
 despite  the  approximately  $350  million  in
 military aid annually being sent to Phnom Penh,
 the clandestine presence of U.S. military advisors
 and continued heavy U.S. air attacks against the
 patriotic forces.
 Rapid growth
 Two-and-one-half years after the U.S.-
 promoted coup ousting Sihanouk in Phnom
 Penh, the resistance forces in Cambodia are
 growing more rapidly than ever, controlling 85
 percent of the national territory, according to an
 Oct. 23 report by A.P. correspondent Holger
 Jensen who also wrote:
 "Khmer Rouge (the name used by the Western
 press for the Cambodian resistance forces)
 strength has jumped from little more than 5000 in
 March to about 40,000 combat-honed troops... .
 "U.S. officials . . . concede they 'drastically
 underestimated' the Khmer Rouge, which means
 Cambodian Reds.
 "   'They grew more, rapidly than  anyone
 realized or reported; it's as simple as that,' said
 one high-ranking American here. 'They're not
 dependent on the North Vietnamese any more.
 The Khmer Rouge are actively engaged in
 combat against Cambodian government forces
 and they're making a maximum effort."
 This assessment was corroborated by the Far
 Eastern  Economic  Review's  Phnom  Penh
 correspondent Nayan Chandra, who wrote in the
 to open Highway 6 and lift the siege of Kompong
 Thom, the Cambodian army has not recovered its
 morale. 'Chenla 11, has been as decisive for
 Cambodia,' estimates one  diplomat, 'as
 Stalingrad was to the Germans.'
 Not only was there heavy loss of men and
 material, but the credibility of Lon Nol as a
 strategist and leader suffered a grievous setback.
 Since then the army has launched a few half-
 hearted operations, with claims of initial victories
 followed by disastrous defeats.
 "Taking full  advantage  of  the  political
 demoralization and popular malaise (toward the
 Lon ' Nol regime), pro-Sihanouk forces have
 considerably strengthened their position. One
 knowledgeable observer says looting by
 South Vietnam (Saigon) and Cambodian troops,
 plus American bombing, has given the Khmer
 Rouge an audience that did not exist a year ago."
 While the American bombing continues to
 devastate the liberated zone, Saigon troops are
 no longer in a position to be sent in significant
 numbers to Cambodia, as the Nguyen Van Thieu
 regime needs every soldier available to him to
 meet the continuing offensive by the Liberation
 Armed Forces of the PRG.
 In reply to questions posed by a correspon-
 dent, Sihanouk explained on Oct. 29 that- the
 Cambodian resistance forces "sometimes have
 combined operations with our North Vietnamese;.
 and  NLF  friends  along  the  Cambodian-
 Vietnamese common border, but our armed
 forces, alone, have responsibility for all military
 operations in the interior of Cambodia. We give
 the troops of our north Vietnamese and NLF
 friends the right to cross our national territory
 but these friendly Vietnamese troops do not
 possess any permanent base in the interior of the
 country. The question of their evacuation from
 Cambodia is not an issue and will never be an
 issue."
 In answer to another question during the same
 interview Sihanouk noted that "the only route
 between Peking and  the liberated zone of
 Cambodia is- the Ho Chi Minh trail" on which
 travel would be much easier if there were cease-
 fires in Vietnam and Laos. Although the Cam-
 bodian leader was referring to the possibility of
 returning to his homeland, the military im-
 plications are quite clear and must be discon-
 certing to the Nixon administration which once
 called U.S.-supported operations in Cambodia
 the best example of the "Nixon doctrine" in-
 action.            ,
 The realities of the Nixon doctrine in Cam-
 bodia are  quite  different  than  Washington.
 originally envisaged when the CIA promoted the
 coup by Lon Nol and Sirak Matak, now bitter
 rivals, like most other "leaders" of Phnom Penh's
 pro-American camp. The regime now barely

 Virtually all traffic arteries from Phnom Penh
 have been cut on a more or less permanent basis.
 Route 5 going to the rice-rich Battambang
 -province have been held by liberation forces
 since August, which cut off the capital city from
 its main source of rice. Since September there
 have been periodic "riots" over rice shortages in
 which troops of the Lon Not army have par-
 ticipated.
 Apparently a large segment of U.S. aid goes
 into the pockets of corrupt officials and military
 officers. Interviewing some soldiers early in
 November, Times  correspondent  Schanberg
 noted that they were lucky to be receiving their
 pay, for "corruption has permeated the Cam-
 bodian army ever since the U.S. began pumping
 . military aid into the country.
 "Many commanders keel) dead men on their
 unit payrolls and put the dead men's pay into
 their own pockets. Other commanders even keep
 the pay of their own troops, which leaves the
 troops penri,iless and demoralized and results in
 their looting and pillaging the nearest village for
 food and other wants."
 Selling rope for their own noose
 On the point of the regime's total corruption,
 all Western observers in Phnom Penh agree. Lon
 Not's  personal doctor who was appointed
 minister of commerce earlier this year had to quit
 after a scandal" involving sales of rice to the
 patriots.                                     _
 Although most of Lon Nol's military forces are
 demoralized and unreliable and there is not the.
 slightest prospect of broadening the base of the
 puppet regime, the U.S. has accelerated its arms
 shipments to Phnom Penh in recent weeks, which
 raises several questions, including the probable
 violation of congressional limitations on U.S. aid
 to Cambodia and the presence of U.S. advisors,
 also prohibited by congressional enactments. It is
 also conceivable that at least some of the military
 equipment, especially aircraft, is destined not for
 Lon. Nol's forces but for America and other
 clandestine  U.S.  operations  which  are
 burgeoning throughout Indochina.
 It is understandable that Sihanouk does not
 desire to negotiate with the traitors who serve the
 U.S. imperialists, as they represent nothing in tite
 country, so.the probability is continued conflict
 in Cambodia as long as the U.S. seeks to maintain
 its Phnom Penh retainers. The Vietnamese
 liberation forces have expressed full support for
 the refusal of the Royal Cambodian Government
 of National Union to negotiate with the puppet
 regime.

 Mr. Pfei/3er is professor of zoology at the University of
 Montana and a co-author of Harvest of Death: Chemical
 Warfare in Indochina (Free Press/Macmillan). Ile visited
 Cambodia in 1969.and 1971 and was in Hanoi in 1970,
 While on a visit to Hanoi in June 1970 my two compan-
 ions and I met with Premier Pham Van Dong. During the
 conversation, I asked the Premier to evaluate Nixon's in-
 vasion of Cambodia which had occurred one month ear-
 lier. His ,answer was straightforward: "It makes things
 very favorable for the success of our revolution." By
 "our revolution" I suppgsed him to mean the revolution
 of the Indochinese people against foreign invaders.
 How well does Premier Pham Van bong's 1970 evalu-
 ation accord with the situation of Cambodia in late 1972?
 Recent dispatches from Indochina suggest that he knew
 what lie was talking about. According to the A.P. (Sep-
 tember 1), only one-third of Cambodia is still under
 "Khmer Republic" control. It has been revealed that the
 tanks used in the fall offensive against the An Loc area,
 (only a short distance from Saigon) came from the Chup
 Rubber Plantation and nearby areas in Cambodia. These
 are the very areas that President Nixon characterized
 in April 1970 as "Communist sanctuaries" that must be
 cleaned out.
 Two factors have been principally responsible for the
 failure of Ni}.on's Cambodian policies. First, the Presi-
 dent was badly misinformed about past U.S.-Cambodian
 d b  t the situation on the Vict-
 I received some months later from Sen.Frank' Church,
 the raid was carried out by Air America, a CIA airline,
 for what purposes we still do not know. After the raid,
 the Sihanouk regime asked that American officials visit
 the region, with a view to making reparations for the
 'damage. Although the U.S. Government to this day offi-
 cially denies having carried out this operation, it did send
 a team of experts, including Charles Minarik of the Chem-
 ical Warfare Laboratories, U.S. Army, into the Mimot
 region shortly after the raids. This team's report describes
 how they were flown over the region, driven through it,
 and how they walked in it-just as Westing and I did
 some months later. It is inconceivable to me that the
 North Vietnamese and Vietcong, who according to Nixon
 controlled the area, would have permitted an official U.S.
 Government team to wander through what Nixon called
 "the headquarters for the entire Communist military op-
 erations in South Vietnam." After the invasion began it
 was widely reported that no key control center could
 be found. Some arms caches were reportedly uncovered
 and, of course, a great deal of rice. The rice did not
 greatly surprise me, since at the time we were there, the
 main occupation; in addition to tapping rubber, was liar-
 vesting rice.
 When speaking about the Cambodian "Communist
 sanctuaries," Mr. Nixon failed to mention that, on orders
 of Prince Sihanouk, troops of the Royal. Cambodian
 Anny had in fact swept these areas about three months
 before his invasion. The troops were led by Prince, Sirik
 Matak, a loyal American protege and one of those later
 involved in Sihanouk's overthrow. Sihanouk ordered
 Vietnamese relations an . a ou
 nainese-Cambodian border prior to the March 1970 Matak to search out and destroy all Cominunist-Viet-
 change in the Cambodian Government. For instance, in namese positions in Cambodia. Paul Bennctt of the Cam-

 stated: "Tonight American and South Vietnamese units
 will attack the headquarters for the entire Communist
 military operation in South Vietnam. This key control
 center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and
 Vietcong for five years in blatant violation of Can_bodia's
 neutrality." Mr. Nixon, standing in front of a map of
 Cambodia, put his finger on the little town of Mimot as
 he made this accusation. That puzzled me a great deal,
 for I had spent two days in and around Mimot about
 four months before the U.S.' attack, and knew it to be
 controlled by French and Cambodian rubber interests.
 Mahy Europeans were working there, and some of them
 (e.g., a Belgian plant pathologist) were in complete
 sympathy with the American effort in South Vietnam.
 These Europeans were living with their wives and chil-
 dren in an environment of complete tranquillity. We
 asked many of them whether they had seen any sign
 of North Vietnamese or Vietcong activity and they all
 answered no.

 A Cam
 interview, March 22, 1971:
 tion began in January of 1970 in a northeastern province
 at approximately the time when Sihanouk left for France
 and when Prince Sirik Matak was Acting Prime Minister.
 They sent up a number of additional battalions, among
 the better troops in the Cambodian Army, and carried
 out a series of small sweeps generally in this area. They
 did have, as I recall, a number of contacts with small
 V.C. and North Vietnamese units. They found and de-
 stroyed a number of small supply dumps, a relatively
 small campsite, but there was no major contact with the
 main North Vietnamese forces." Where were the thou-
 sands of North Vietnamese troops that Nixon said had
 occupied the area for five years?
 Besides being mistaken about the nature of the
 so-called Communist sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia,
 Mr. Nixon grossly misrepresented the facts when he
 stated that "American policy since 1954 has been to
 scrupulously respect the neutrality of Cambodia. . . .
 North Vietnam, however, has not respected that neutral-

 puppet..,
 Events quickly proved the term was exact. The Lon Nol-
 Sirik Matak regime was demonstrably a sub puppet of the
 Saigon puppet regime, propped up by Saigon mercenary
 troops and U.S. air power.
 A slavish imitator in all things,-Prentier'Lon Not is now
 resorting to a one-matt electoral farce-with Saigon-
 Washington blessing---similar. to that  perpetrated  by
 dictator Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon last October.. The
 ,object is to,keep himself in?power.
 On Sept. 3, there will be "elections" in that fast
 shrinking one fifth of the counts-y the lion Not regime still
 controls to a new "National Assembly."
 Since the U.S. prefers the facade of "democracy," three
 main parties are "competing." Even under a microscope it
 wotdd be impossible to distinguish any difference in their
 programs. Each is headed by. one of the main plotters of
 the' anti-Sihanouk coup.. .
 The "Social-Republican  party of Lon Not is led by
 proxy by the dictator's younger brother, the fascist Col.
 Lon Non, who master-minded the attacks on the embassies
 of the'Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Provisional
 Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam which
 preceded the coup and the massacre of Cambodians and
 Vietnamese that followed. The "Republican" party 'is
 headed by chief co-plotter and former Premier, Sirik
 Matak. The "Democratic" party is headed by In Tam, who
 as vice president. of the National Assctt.bly-which was
 surrounded by Lon Nol's tanks at the time-moved the
 motion deposing Sihanouk is head of state.
 The only thing that distinguishes the parties is the
 deadly rivalry between the three leaders for power. at the
 'guard against any such future "accidents.
 Thus assured of a sweeping victory, Lon Not and "free
 world democracy" will probably score another triumph
 this month:
 Sirik Matak and In Tam are just as ferocious enemies of
 democracy as Lon Nol. If they had his power they would
 'do exactly'the same thing. They had both played a leading
 role in suppressing any shred of democracy following the
 coup. This did not prevent In Tam however, from usmhing-
 the name of the Democratic party which once had real
 influence among progressive intellectuals in Cambodia.
 No Democratic party
 In a statement July 16, prince Phourissara-one of the
 most distinguished Foreign Ministers in the pre-coup years
 who recently escaped to the Liberated Zone-vigorously
 denounced in Tarn's pretense of heading the Democratic
 -party. After exposing the traitorous and double-puppet
 role of Siril: Matak?and In Tam, Phourissara and two other
 well-known personalities, in the name of the Democratic
 tarty of which they had been leading members?'stated:
 "(1)  The Democratic party has ceased to exist for
 several years following the unanimous decision of its
 members. At the present time there is no Democratic
 party.                    ?
 "(2)  The overwhelming majority of its members of
 good reputation and faithful to the democratic ideals of
 the. party categorically repudiated the traitors Lon Not,
 Slrik Ma.tak and Son Ngoc Thant following the March 18
 coup. At the present time a great number of members of
 the ,former Democratic party play their part in working
 within the ranks of the Cambodian National United Front
 (NUFK) which is a broad organization of national unity
 with a political program in conformity with the idea of the
 whole nation and the whole of the Cambodian people.

 From their Paris embassy,
 North Vietnamese spokesmen
 have sent us an exclusive mes-
 sage that they feel sure Mc-
 Govern would pull U.S. troops
 out of Vietnam as he has
 promised. They also believe he
 would keep his word not to
 give more military backing to
 the Saigon: regime.
 Nixon Paranoia
 They  recited  Mr. Nixon's
 record back  to his 1953-61
 term as Vice President when
 lie made    saber-rattling
 speeches  about Indochina.
 Nevertheless, they were ready
 to negotiate with Mr. Nixon in
 1971, they said, for the total
 withdrawal of U.S. forces and
 the immediate return of U.S.
 urisoners.
 President Thieu on Oct. -1 and
 the  escalated  bombing  of
 North Vietnam a few days
 later, they said exacerbated
 their old suspicions of Mr.
 Nixon.
 Now they feared Mr. Nixon
 would listen to Thicu's ap-
 peals for renewed U.S. inter-
 vention In the Vietnam war,
 As evidence, they cited the
 buildup  of  U.S. forces in
 neighborhing Thailand  and
 the increase in air-naval units
 around Vietnam.
 The Communist diplomats
 said they trusted McGovern, if
 he should be elected, not to
 re-intervene in the war. But
 one diplomat suggested that
 they  would  make rapid ar-
 rangements with McGovern to
 return American prisoners so
 he would have no excuse to
 re-intervene.
 They, therefore, not only
 would  negotiate  the POW
 issue with McGovern, but they
 would  move. fast, suggested
 one North Vietnamese diplo-
 mat, to return American pris-
 oners.
 But the North Vietnamese
 conceded, in the end, they
 probably will have to negoti-
 ate with a re-elected Richard
 Nixon. They couldn't afford,
 therefore, to place all their
 bets on McGovern, they said.
 Hanoi's views on the elec-
 tion were delivered to us by
 an emissary who met with the
 North Vietnamese three times
 for a total of four and. one-half
 hours. For diplomatic reasons,
 we  agreed to withhold the
 names of the participants.
 All    the discussions were
 held in French, so we can only
 paraphrase what the North Vi-
 etnamese said. Their suspicion

 in Laos, the North Vietnamese
 said, could be returned as part
 of a general U.S. agreement to
 withdraw   from  Indochina.
 They said the Americans held
 in Cambodia could also be re-
 turned as part of a general In-
 dochina settlement.
 A Cambodian Communist,
 who was present during the
 discussions, said the American
 prisoners in Cambodia are sus-
 pected CIA agents and specia
 forces, not combat troops cap-
 tured during the U.S. incur-
 sion of May, 1970.
 The North Vietnamese were
 particularly  emotional  over
 the alleged American bombing
 of  the  dikes,   which  they
 pleaded could lead to two mil-
 lion deaths from drowning
 and starvation.

 could  turn their flood-control
 system!nto a huge mudslide.

 ports suggest that 1110scow and

 The reason, apparently, is that

 the unknown McGovern.

 SIR: I refer to the letter of W. E. Colby, executive
 director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who re-
 butted the charges made by some American newspa-
 permen that the CIA was involved in opium traf-
 ficking. I do not question Colby's good faith, neither
 do I say that the CIA, as an entity, traffics in opium;
 but, I am sorry to say that there is more to these
 charges than more "gossip, conjecture and,, old history."
 I also know what I am talking about because'I was
 involved in security matters for the South Vietnamese
 government under President Ngo Dinh Diem. In effect,
 one day, the President told me to investigate into the
 activities of our chief of secret police, chief of our own
 "CIA" and chief of military security, and to report, di-
 rectly to him, because as he put it: "I cannot ask my
 own chiefs of police, `CIA,' and military security to
 investigate into themselves."
 I found out the corruption of two. chiefs, ? and the
 President took very drastic measures against them. I
 have kept the contact with my security agents ever
 since. They firmly confirm that a few CIA agents in
 Indochina are involved in opium trafficking. But above
 all, a line must be drawn between Indochina and the
 rest of the world, because, due to the fact of the coun-
 ter-instu'gency warfare, the operations of the American
 CIA in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are extremely ira-
 portant, when they are compared to operations of the
 same agency in other countries. In Indochina, the CIA
 is a real army with his own aerial fleet. A number of
 CIA operatives deal directly with Vietnamese, Lao, or
 Moo warlords or officials at the highest level with
 whom they share the proceeds of the opium traffic. For
 good American citizens in the United States, it is very
 difficult to imagine the influence and power of those
 operatives in Indochina, Their power, in fact., is un-
 limited-they are the true rulers of Indochina; their
 desires are orders-no Vietnamese, Laotian or Cambo-
 i dian official would dare resist their orders. Corruption
 growing from a do facto power-affects some of these
 CIA operatives.
 The traffic of opium involves a rely t.ively large num-
 her of persons. Outside a few Americans, there are
 Vietnamese Laotians and Aleo who are involved. Since
 these personis have their clans, families and friends who
 live from this traffic, the total number of persons con-
 cerned become so great that it is impossible to keep
 secret the operations.
 I also do not question the good faith of CIA Director
 Richard Helms when he said that "os an agency, in
 fact,  we  are heavily engaged in tracing the foreign
 roots of the drug traffic for the Bureau of Narcotics
 and Dangerous Drugs. We hope we are helping with a
 solution; we know we are not contributing to the prob-
 lem ... -" However, as I said previously, a line must
 be drawn and a distinction must he made; for circum-
 stances are not the same-there is not the vaguest re-
 semblance between CIA operatives in Indochina and
 their colleagues operating in other countries.
 In conclusion, CIA Director Helms and Colby, Miss
 Randal, and McCoy said the truth and did not contra-.
 diet one another; they perhaps did not talk about the
 same country.

 PHNOM PENH, Cambodia-
 In the demoralized atmosphere
 of this war-weary capital, one
 of the country's highest lead-
 ers still maintains a  sem-
 blance of unabashed     confi-
 dence in the face of the worst
 enemy threats.
 He is Son Ngoc Thanh, a
 revolutionary   figure from
 Cambodia's  French colonial
 ast and now prime minister
 der the ailing President Lon
 Nol.  . .
 "We are determined to push
 out the enemy," said Thanh, a
 peppery, slightly built man,
 "We are now establishing a
 true Khmer or Cambodian re-
 public," said Thanh, who last
 served as prime minister at
 the end of the Japanese occu-
 pation in 1945, "Now there are
 no more quarrels. The people
 can decide whom they want to
 lead them."

 fledgling efforts toward de-

 mocracy remains unshaken by
 a presidential  election last
 month in which Lon Nol easily
 steamrollcd over two oppo-
 actually have instigated his
 ouster.
 Thanh preferred not to dis-
 cuss the CIA's role in the sud- I/
 den turn of events in Phnom
 Penh. Instead, he noted the
 build-up of the Ca m b o d i a n
 army over the last two years.
 "At the beginning we had
 only 30,000 men in Cambodia
 and  another  20,000  of  my
 men," he said. "Now we have
 at least 170,000. We have a
 broad army now."
 He admitted that the quality

 interpreter. "At the same time
 we will strengthen the regime

 Returned from Disgrace
 If Thanh seems overly opti-
 m i s t i c  about  Cambodia's
 chances of success, it is partly
 because he himself has re-
 turned from disgrace and exile
 since the overthrow of the
 Leftist chief of state, Prince
 Norodom Sihanouk, more, than
 two years ago.
 Appointed  prime  minister

 dence of the coun

 constitution.  Critics  charge
 that Lon Nol will manipulate
 the assembly election just as he
 is accused of doing in the ballot-
 ing for president-and that, in
 any c a s e , the constitution
 grants little real power to the
 assembly.
 For Thanh, however, almost
 any alternative seems prefera-
 ble to the rule of Sihanouk, his
 most bitter foe since World
 War II. The rivalry between
 Thanh and Sihanouk dates to
 the Japanese decision to ele-
 vate,Thanh to national leader-
 ship during the war while Si-
 hanouk remained only a fig-
 urehead'with little power.
 French Dump Thanh
 The French colonialists, re-
 turning after the war, prompt-
 ly dumped Thanh, who then
 alternately fought and recon-
 ciled with Sihanouk. Finally,
 in the 1950s, Thanh organized
 a guerrilla force that fought
 against Sihanouk until fleeing
 to Thailand and South Viet
 Nam.
 It was from Viet Nam, thru-
 out the decade before Siha-
 nouk's  downfall,  that Thanh
 "We had our troops along
 the , border before  Sihanouk
 was overthrown," said '? nanh.
 ,,He knew he would fall. I had
 had contact in advance withi
 Lon Nol and Lon Nol's young-
 er brother, Col. Lon Non."
 Almost immediately after Si-
 hanouk's ouster, Thanh's
 forces crossed the frontier into
 Cambodia and began fighting
 the Vietnamese Ccrninunists:
 The speed-with which Thanh's
 troops entered the war in
 Camdodia has nonvinccd some

 time crony of Sihanouk's and
 now the commander of a large

 Thanh. "H1 6 has never fought
 in the jungle or the mountains.
 He had bad training."

 Puppet President Lon Not of-
 Cambodia easily won his regime's
 first presidential election Sunday,
 with a comfortable but discreet 60
 percent' of the vote. The actual
 number of voters was nowhere
 stated, only percentages were giv-
 en,and this is not surprising.
 Marshal Lon Nol's army cannot
 go anywhere outside capital city
 of Phnom Penh without being at-
 tacked by the patriotic forces of
 the Cambodian National United
 Front.
 NUF units are able to operate
 within a few miles of the center
 of Phnom Penh without any hin-
 drance. A? conservative estimate
 would place NUF control of the
 country at around 80 percent. In
 fact, while the votes were being
 counted Monday, the NUF shelled
 the Defense Ministry building in
 downtown Phnom Penh, some.of
 the shells landing only 50 yards
 from Lon Nol's residence.
 hard to see how Lon Not could
 claim to have held elections at all.
 Last Oct. 20, when he abolished his
 own puppet National. Assembly
 and announced he would rule by
 decree,  stating  lie  would  no
 longer "play the game of democ-
 racy," he was being much more
 time to form. But this inust have
 disturbed his U.S. advisers, who
 have an eye out for U.S. public
 opinion, so in March, Lon Nol
 simply  declared  himself  the
 President of Cambodia and an-
 nounced there would be a presi-
 dential election soon.
 Interestingly enough, Lon Nol is
 supposed to have gotten 60.76 per-
 cent of the vote, a figure that was
 "predicted" down to the last deci-
 mal point by his regime's official
 newspaper, Le Republicain.
 Son Ngoc Thanh - who was ap-
 pointed Premier by Lon Nol this
 March- has a lurid past: lie was
 born in South Vietnam, a member
 of the Khmer Krom or ethnic
 Under. 'these  conditions  it's , Cambodian minority of some two
 o
 million in the' Mekong Delta.
 The Japanese appointed him their
 puppet Premier of Cambodia in
 World War II; after 1945, he was in
 exile in Thailand until be was
 picked up by the U.S. Central In-
 telligence Agency and sent back to
 South Vietnam.
 The CIA had established what
 it called the Khmer Serei ("Free
 Cambodian") movement, made
 up entirely of Khmer Kroln who
 were carrying out armed raids
 into Cambodia from South Viet-
 nam. Son Ngoc Thanh was in-
 stalled as the head of this "move-
 ment."
 In the past, LonNol was always
 able to call in heavy U.S. air sup-
 port plus invasions of his own
 country by thousands of Saigon
 puppet troops when things' got
 really rough for him. Today,
 things are different. The patriotic
 offensive in South Vietnam made
 the Saigon regime pull all its
 troops out of Cambodia.
 Lon Nol is thus left on his own.

 'statement in- 1970 that Sihanouk's ouster
 "surprised no nation more than the U.S."
 According to  Intercontinental  Press,  the
 recently named prime minster Son Ngoc
 1hanh revealed to Oxford University scholar
 v   T.D. Allman in a series of interviews that CIA
 agents promised to do "everything possible"
 to aid anti-Sihanouk forces in a coup. Allman,
 who was in Asia last year on assignment for
 the Manchester Guardian, said Thanh told him
 the U.S. paid "millions of dollars" to train and
 equip his own private forces, the "Khmer
 Serei" ("Free" Cambodia) forces, which were
 recruited from Cambodian mercenaries living
 in South Vietnam. Shortly after the coup by
 Lon Nol, the Intercontinental Press report
 states, Thanh's group was air-lifted to Phnom
 Penh where it played a key role in holding the
 capital.... The Phnom Penh army is becoming
 more unpdpular among youth in Cambodia.
 According to a Feb. 2 AFP report:  "The
 Cambodian military authorities are having a
 lot of trouble in recruitment, many youths
 having crossed over to Thailand to dodge
 service in the Phnom Penh army".... "News
 from Cambodia," a feature in the Vietnam
 Courier, published In Hanoi, reported in March
 that Thai mercenary troops have pillaged
 homes, shrines and temples in Cambodia-all
 on the  pretext of  pursuing, "Co'mmunist
 rebels".    . "News from Cambodia" also
 reported that the deputy manager of the
 Sihanoukville branch of the National Bank
 /crossed over to the liberated zone of the
 country Feb. 13.
 A celebration was held in Paris April 22 to
 mark the second anniversary of the summit
 conference of the Indochinese peoples. The
 first meeting was held in the spring of 1970,
 shortly after Norodom Sihanouk was over-
 thrown from his position as head of Cambodia
 by a CIA sponsored coup. The Paris meeting
 last month, organized by the Paris Committee
 of the National United Front of Cambodia; the
 Union of Lao Students in France; and the
 Union of Vietnamese in France, was attended
 by  over  4000  people.  The  meeting
 unanimously adopted a resolution that ac-
 claimed the victories of the Indochinese
 peoples  and  condemned  the  U.S. war
 escalation, especially the bombing of Hanoi
 and Haiphong. A banner across the meeting
 hall read: "Long live the fraternal 'militant
 solidarity of the Cambodian, Lao and Viet-
 namese peoples!'.'
 The  Women's  International  League  for
 Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is continuing its
 efforts to get the Saigon regime to release
 Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh from jail, where she has
 been held for the last six months due to her
 antiwar activities- When she collapsed on a
 stretcher in a courtroom March 22, due to an
 asthma attack, Thanh issued a statement
 saying: "We don't want the Americans to
 come here. I, want all the Americans to go
 home and hand back our sovereignty and we
 want to talk with the. other people from the
 other side, about our business, among the
 Vietnamese".. ..A letter from a Saigon puppet
 soldier, written as he was retreating from the
 demilitarized zone last month, was printed in
 the Washington Post April 6. The letter said in
 part: "We did not want to fight the Reds. What
 for? They have never harmed us... we should
 kill Instead the corrupted leaders in Saigon
 and  their  dirty  Saigon-American  friends
 (President  Nixon's)  withdrawal  is  in.
 terminable. hence we have no independence.
 His Vietnamization shall never work because
 he is fighting not only the Communists but
 also the whole Vietnamese population"... .
 The  Gaiphong  Press  Agency  of      the
 revolutionary forces reported from Hue April
 18 that puppet general Hoang Xuan Lam,
 former commander of the I corps area, built an
 "execution pole" in the center of the city of

 North Vietnam is invading
 South Vietnam. He said the
 North Vietnamese troops com-

 Gunther said the President's

 The CIA
 AMERICANS seem to be the
 Intelligence Agency is up to, and
 J now they are learning about the
 CIA's role in Cambodia from a,
 'CMMMM 'trwho had a part in it.
 Prime Minister Thanh told a
 British inter.viewer,  before
 attaining his present post, that the
 United States paid millions after
 1965 to train his own rebel troops.
 He said CIA agents assigned to him
 assured him of help if existing
 government of Prince Norodom
 Sihanouk were overthrown and the
 rebels came under left-wing attack.
 The   government   was
 overthrown in 1970 and that led to a
 leftist counter-attack joined by
 Sihanouk and that in turn led to a
 massive    American-South
 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.
 So the Southeast Asia war engulfed
 meddles
 Cambodia, as it had Laos, where
 the' CIA also was involved with its
 private army. The results of all this
 meddling have been to spread a war
 without gaining a vestige of victory.
 If the meddling alone were not bad
 enough, the disasters following it
 made it worse.
 So far the CIA seems to have
 done  better in  its strictly
 intelligence operations than in its.
 paramilitary and covert actions,
 but not even Congress knows fore
 sure. Congress might be expected
 to approve a standing proposal to
 require that the CIA report to it as
 well as to the Executive branch.
 Instead, Congress is voting what
 amounts to a blank check, and
 getting  reports on Central
 Intelligence Agency activity
 through the prime minister of
 Cambodia.

 Calls Nixon Policy `Fraud
 Vieimn a '
 By MARY TIERNEY
 U.S. Rep. Michael J. Har-
 rington, D-Beverly, yesterday
 attacked  President  Nixon's
 policy of Vietnamization as a
 "fraud." He made the re-
 marks following a visit to
 South Vietnam last week,.
 As a member of the House
 Armed Services Committee,
 the North Shore congressman
 has been working for the past
 month to force' the adminis-
 tration to increase the flow of
 public information about U.S.
 military activities in South-
 east Asia.
 Yesterday,  at  a  Parker
 House press conference, Rep.
 Harrington said that "Viet-
 namization has been sold to
 the American people as a way
 of withdrawing our presence
 from the Indochinese war.
 "In fact,"  he  continued,
 "that policy, as it is now be-
 ing pursued, requires a con-
 tinued,                  massive  American
 military presence in Southeast
 Asia for many years to come.
 "It commits us to continue
 to spend billions of taxpayers'
 dollars for the support of the
 armies of Laos. Cambodia
 and South Vietnam.
 "IT COMMITS US to spend
 many billions to pay for an
 air war as extensive as any
 this country has ever engaged
 in - even at the, height of.
 World War II.. .
 "It commits us to continued
 direct  involvement  by  the,
 Central Intelligence Agency in
 the groundTigliting in Laos
 and Cambodia and to continue
 to devastate four countries in
 a war which has long since
 lost any conceivable justifica-
 tion - militarily, politically or
 morally."

 gaged in that war," he said.
 Rep. Harrington. said that,
 American   involvement   is
 greater than the American
 people have been told and that ;
 it is time "to raise American
 consciousness to the magni-
 tude of our involvement."
 He said he was "particular-
 ly  disturbed"  about  the
 secrecy that surrounds the
 military operation in Thailand
 where the U.S. is "spending $5
 million a day to maintain
 25,000 Air Force men at five
 large air bases in a country.
 club atmosphere."
 He said he would do every-
 thing in his power to see that
 all censorship of news from
 .Thailand would be lifted so
 that  the  American  people
 would  know  where    their
 money was going.
 "When the full facts are
 known there will be public
 annoyance, anger and frustra-
 tion in the inability to extri-
 cate," he said.  .
 Rep. Harrington said that'
 since the U.S. has broken off
 peace talks, the South Vietna-
 mese Army has been unable
 to hold its ground without full-
 scale American military sup-
 port.
 "Current American policy
 requires us to maintain our
 involvement  in  the  Indo-
 chinese War for the forseeable
 future.
 And, as long as we remain
 committed to the maintenance
 of a pro-American regime in
 Saigon and as long as the pro-
 American forces are unable to
 sustain themselves in power,

 the killings at My Lai; South

 WASHINGTON.-The  Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency (CIA)
 played a crucial role in en-
 couraging the coup that top-
 pled Prince Norodom Sihan-.
 ouk and plunged Cambodia
 into the Indochina war, ac-
 cording  to  Cambodia's  re-
 ently named prime. minister,
 Son Ngoc Thanh.
 vv  Describing Sihanouk's over-
 throw in a series of interviews
 last year with Oxford Univer-
 . sit}?- scholar T. D. Allman,
 Thanh said that CIA agents
 promised they would do "ev=
 .erything possible" to help if
 the Cambodian plotters suc-
 ,cessfully mounted a coup and
 .then-found themselves under
 attack by pro-Sihanouk and
 Communist forces.
 Shortly after the March 1970
 coup, Thanh's  own  forces,
 trained  by  U. S.  Special
 Forces in Vietnam, were dis-
 patched by plane to Phnom
 Penh, where they played a
 vital role in defending the
 Cambodian capital for Gen.
 Lon Nol.
 THE WHITE HOUSE main-
 tains that ? the U. S. had no
 prior knowledge of the coup
 and that "no American mili-
 tary or civilian officers" were
 ever involved officially or un-
 officially with the plotters. Si-'
 hanouk's ouster "surprised no
 nation more than the United
 States," President Nixon said
 after the coup.
 Sen.  Mike  Gravel  (D.,
 Alaska) said on Tuesday that
 White House denials of U. S.
 involvement in the 1970 coup
 are "incredible" and he called

 According to Son Ngoc
 Thanh, CIA agents assigned to
 Thanh's staff were kept aware
 of developments concerning
 the  coup  including secret
 meetings b' t:veen Thanh and
 aides of Gen. Lon Nol.
 At that time, Lon Nol was
 Sihanouk's prime minister,
 while Thanh, who had been
 sentenced to death by Sihan-
 ouk,. headed  a       rebel  sect
 known as the Khmer Screi
 ("Free Cambodia") from a
 jungle post near the Viet-
 narn- Cambodia border.
 According to Thanh, begin-
 ning in 1965 the U. S. paid
 "millions of dollars" to train,
 arm and support his forces,
 most of whom were recruited
 from the Cambodian minority
 living  in  South  Vietnam's
 Delta region.           -
 Thanh told Allman, who was
 1969 and may have been part
 of Thanh's invasion plan to
 overthrow Sihanouk. Accord-

 "If the Vietcong attack Phnom

 the capital?"

 Pathet Lao have been unmatched in
 their ability to construct a popular na-
 tionalist political movement, in this
 case, too, with revolutionary social con-
 tent. U.S. intervention from the late
 1950s has drawn North Vietnam in-
 creasingly into Laotian affairs, much
 as in South Vietnam and more recently
 Cambodia, where the March  1970
 coup, very likely with a CIA hand, and
 the US-ARVN invasion that followed,
 shattered a fragile though conceivably
 stable neutralism and increased the
 probability that Cambodia too will be
 brought ultimately into a communist-
 led federation of. some sort if outside
 force is withdrawn.
 For reasons that need not detain us
 here, the United States has never been
 willing to tolerate the "loss" of Indo-
 china, and remains unwilling today.
 The conditions of U.S. intervention
 have changed over the years, but not
 the essential goals. Furthermore, the
 basic problem facing the Western in-
 vaders has also changed little during
 the past quarter century. Several years
 ago, an American military spokesman
 formulated the problem clearly: the
 U.S. has enormous military force but
 littl.: political power and must defeat
 an adversary with enormous political
 power but only modest military force.
 To this problem the U.S. must find the
 "proper response"-in Vietnam and
 elsewhere in the third world as well.
 (Jean Lacouture, Vietnam: Between
 Two Truces, 1966).
 This problem dictates  American
 strategy. The basic strategy has been,
 necessarily,?to demolish the social and

 long tolerate the costs of a continuing
 military occupation in South Vietnam,
 coupled with a costly air war against
 the North. Consequently, the direct
 U.S. troop commitment was leveled off
 and then gradually lowered through
 "Vietnamization"-a policy suggested
 by Pentagon systems analysts in 1967
 -while a sharply expanded techno-
 logical war reached its peak in the early
 months of the Nixon Administration.
 Nixon and Kissinger are gambling
 that the massive destruction and forced
 population concentration in the South,
 with its devastating impact on the rural
 society, may create conditions under
 which the U.S.-imposed regime can
 survive. To use Robert Komer's terms,
 "thanks to massive U.S. military in-
 tervention at horrendous cost," a "fa-
 vorable military environment" has been
 created "in which the largely political
 competition for control and support of
 the key rural population could begin
 again" in this "revolutionary, largely
 political conflict" (!. of International
 A(jairs, 1971, no. 1). He fails to add
 that control of the "key rural popu-
 lation" may be facilitated by the fact
 that at least half the population, 85
 percent rural in 1960, now lives in
 urban ghettoes (J-C Pomonti, Foreign
 Affairs, Jan. 1972), part of the "hor-
 rendous cost" of "massive U.S. mil-
 itary intervention." Much the same is
 military and police apparatus, an'd
 gradually absorbed within the U.S.-
 Japan Pacific system. The vast areas
 ceded to ' the resistance will be sub-
 jected to intensive bombardment which
 will continue to make an organized so-
 cial life virtually impossible. Parts of
 Laos may be effectively incorporated
 within Thailand, as George Ball sug-
 gested years ago. It may be that the
 willingness of the Administration to
 concede the presence of Thai mer- STATINTL
 cenaries in Laos (in conflict with ex-
 plicit legislation designed to prevent
 this) reflects the need to prepare the
 public for this outcome.
 As the very knowledgeable Austra-
 lian analyst Peter King observes; such
 "successes" as have been achieved in
 this program are "no mystery": "It re-
 quires more than ordinary courage for
 civilians to maintain their political al-
 legiances openly in the face of a semi-
 genocidal counter-insurgent strategy"
 (Pacific Affairs, Fall 1971), the pre-
 requisite  for  Komer-style  "nation-
 building." It is this counter-insurgent
 strategy and its results that lead Gen-
 eral Westmoreland to believe: "I think
 particularly significant is that the en-
 emy does not have the strong infra-
 structure and the guerrilla forces in
 large numbers, well equipped and high-
 ly motivated, that he had in 1963"
 (Peter Osnos, Washington Post-Bos-
 ton Globe, Feb. 1, 1972). However, as
 King and many others recognize, "the
 durability of that success may be
 doubted."
 Given the insistence of the U.S. pub-
 lic on scaling down the direct Amer-
 ican involvement, it has been obvious
 for several years that it would become
 necessary for the U.S. to engage in
 some sort of political manipulations
 within the areas'of South Vietnam that
 remain tinder U.S. control, or to "get
 ready for political competition in South
 Vietnam," as Harvard Professor Sam-

 Is Son Ngoc Thanh
 our next albatross?,
 Most Americans pay little at-
 tention to changes of government in
 small and volatile nations like Cam-
 bodia. Political leaders come and go,
 and it is difficult to remember their
 names.
 The name of Son Ngoc Thanh is
 worth remembering.
 He would appear to be, at the
 moment, the real power in Cam-
 bodia. He has been for more than
 two generations a leader of the na-
 tionalist movement in Cambodia.
 But he has also been, for the last
 twenty years or more, in nearly con-
 stant opposition to the now-exiled
 Prince Sihanouk, and his opposition
 has in recent years been heavily
 financed by the American Central
 Intelligence A.
 In a very real sense, the CIA's
 man is now in power in Phnom Penh.
 His arch-enemy - and still the most
 popular, beloved, and nearly-deified
 Cambodian, Norodom Sihanouk - is
 in exile in Peking.
 That Js  hardly a  recipe for
 stability.
 a politician nearly as popular at
 times, as Sihanouk himself.
 Son was exiled; recalled briefly;
 exiled again. He has since the early
 1950s organized several nationalist,
 anti-Sihanouk   guerrilla  organiza-,
 tions, backed variously by Saigon
 and    Bangkok  (both  historic   an-
 tagonists of Cambodia) and the CIA.
 Ile comes to power in Phnom
 Penh now by a curious route.
 Lon Nol, the general who drove
 Sihanouk  into  exile, this     month
 abrogated  all  semblance          of
 democratic process in Cambodia: He
 cancelled the nearly-completed draf-
 ting of a new constitution, declared
 himself president, ousted the titular
 "chief of state" and assumed that
 role as well; and surrounded himself
 by a "cabinet" of Army men loyal
 to him, with only one token member
 of the democratic opposition.
 From a man who has suffered a
 crippling stroke, who apparently can-
 not walk without support, and who
 has never in several previous stints
 as head of government been con-
 sidered anything but -a figurehead, it
 was a remarkable show of decisiveness
 - remarkable enough to make one
 wonder who was behind it.
 He then named Son Ngoc Thanh
 -as premier and prime minister.
 AMERICAN POLICY in Indochin ,,
 has, on previous occasions, single
 out nationalist leaders whom we coul
 trust, and helped to install them in
 power, Ngo Dinh Diem was only the
 first of many such men in Vietnam.
 It is, at best, a risky business.
 Today's American-sponsored national
 hero can be tomorrow's albatross.
 SUPPORT FOR Son Ngoc Thanh
 is not unreasonable. He began his
 career as a crusading anti-colonial
 editor (in Cambodia's first newspaper
 in the Cambodian. language) in 1937.
 He worked with the Japanese in the
 latter stages of World War II to drive
 the French out. His pressures pro-
 bably made Sihanouk, then a very.
 young (and French-sponsored) king,
 hasten Cambodia's independence.
 Sihanouk's hostility toward Son
 can be seen as personal jealousy of

 would be chosen and headed

 He also said there would be

 Thanh's acceptance was re-

 Daily World Foreign Department
 from combined news sources
 The World Council of Peace has called on more _ than ' 100' of its national peat
 committees to implement the program for a worldwide Week of Solidarity with the In<
 dochina Peoples.
 ? The Week of Solidarity. being
 held this week is to include dem-
 onstrations, meetings, rallies and
 campaigns protesting the contin-
 uation of the U.S. aggression
 against Vietnam, Laos and Cam-
 bodia and demanding the with-
 drawal of U.S. and allied forces.
 . Meanwhile a massive drive to
 annihilate the Khmer Rouge, or
 Cambodian patriotic forces, en-
 tered its fourth day, with more
 than 50,000 Saigon puppet troops
 supported by U.S. aerial and ar-
 tillery  forces  conducting  a
 "search - and destroy" operation
 in Cambodia.
 Puppet regime near collapse
 The puppet Saigon trbops were
 ordered into Cambodia as a po-
 litical crisis threatened to topple
 the puppet government in that
 country headed by Prime Min-
 ister  delegate  Gen.  Sisowath
 Sirik Matak, a. compradore cap-.
 italist  and  arch conspirator
 against the Cambodian people.
 The gavernmental crisis came
 to a head Friday when the inval-
 ided Lon Nol, crippled by a
 stroke, took over from Cheng
 Heng as chief of state and dis-
 solved the National Assembly.
 Lon Nol, who had seized pow-
 er with the aid of the U.S. Cen-
 t/ tral Intelligence Agency while
 former head-of-state Prince No-
 rodom Sihanouk was out of the
 country, today proclaimed him-
 self  president;  commander-in-
 chief of the armed forces, and
 prime minister:
 Last week the Cambodian Stu-
 dent Association precipitated the
 crisis when it voted "absolutely
 no confidence" in Sirik Matak.
 Lon Nol claimed that he had act-
 ed "according to the wishes- of
 Buddhist monks and all compat-
 riots."
 Khmer Rouge attacked
 The seriousness of the Cambod-
 ian situation was evident in the
 size of the puppet Saigon force
 sent to buttress the Cambodian
 puppets. U.S. jets and helicopters
 were reported to be backing the
 Saigon forces. U.S. B-52 bombers
 pounded areas.believed to. be oc-
 cupied by the Khmer Rouge.
 U.S. and Saigon military spokes-
 men apparently got their lines
 crossed in reported details of
 the operations. One dispatch from
 Saigon claimed the' invasion of
 Cambodia had been launched to
 head off an attack by "North
 Vietnamese" troops. This is the
 standard jargon used by the U.S.
 and puppet regimes, which pur-
 port to see "North Vietnamese"
 as the only fighters in the three
 Indochina countries.
 A second dispatch from Saigon
 admitted, however, that the inva-
 sion was ordered to prevent a
 "guerrilla  attack on  Saigon,"
 which apparently referred to the
 Khmer Rouge forces. This dis-
 patch said a force of about 25
 U.S. helicopters was flying a
 "search and destroy" mission at
 tree-top level in advance" of the
 Saigon puppet forces.
 Neither dispatch admitted, how-
 ever, the real motive for the new
 invasion of Cambodia-the need
 to protect the Cambodian puppets
 from the Cambodian people.

 The bill, signed by President

 military personnel working for the

 assistance and advisory groups
 now operating in Cambodia and
 $341,000,000 ceiling on aid  o

 CIA  is  reported  to     have
 warehouses filled with arms at

 The CIA will be forbidden to pay
 foreign troops - such as the 4,800
 "volunteers" in Laos - more than
 their' counterparts in the U.S.
 armed forces. The bill specifical-
 ly, places the CIA under existing
 restrictions on giving arms to
 forces in Asia.
 It will require quarterly reports
 to Congress on Cambodia and
 annual reports on foreign aid. CIA
 assistance will. be included in the
 totals, althoughit will probably not

 'Congress And CIA Control.
 The Central Intelligence Agency, a
 sat of world power unto itself these
 many years, is going to have to join the
 Union at last.
 The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee put its foot down recently and
 slopped some new controls on the CIA
 when it prepared the foreign aid authori-
 za.ion bill. President Nixon signed the bill
 last week.
 The controls mean the CIA will be
 limited in the number of military person-
 ?r nel it can use for its projects; in how
 .. much it can pay foreign troops; and in
 the amount of arms it can distribute i
 other countries.
 One objective of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee was to curb CIA activity
 to Cambodia, where the committee
 feared the agency might generate anoth-
 er war, as it helped to do in Laos. Thus,
 aid to Combodia is limited and the CIA
 must make quarterly reports on that
 country to Congress.
 The new limitations are not air-tight.
 More are probably needed. But the Con-
 gress has at last put a firm hand on the
 reins for the first time since the CIA was
 created in 1947.

 Through the efforts of a handful of
 U.S. senators, controls have at long last
 been placed on the operations, cost and
 i personnel of the Central Intelligence
 Agency. These cui bs are contained in

 last week by President Nixon.
 {
 Credited with providing the controls
 are Senators Clifford Case of New

 Stuart Symington of Missouri. All are

 Relations Committee. Together with
 ? -Sen. William Fulbrfght, committee
 chairman, they have protested in-

 knowledge of the  CIA's  activities,
 particularly in Southeast Asia.
 According to the New York Times,
 Senator Case urged last summer a
 tightening of restrictions over the
 Defense Department's use of its funds
 overseas and over its power to transfer
 "surplus" military material' to other
 ;,U.S. agencies. Senator Case, the Times
 said, insisted that the CIA be included

 . A number 'of senators, particularly.
 those serving on the Foreign Relations
 Committee, have complained. over the
 years  regarding  the  lack  of
 congressional knowledge and control
 over military action abroad. The
 disastrous "Bay of Pigs" invasion of
 Cuba soon after John F. Kennedy
 assumed the presidency in 1961 was one
 of the major operations planned
 secretly by the Central Intelligence
 Agency. Since 'then the agency has
 been blamed or received credit for
 masterminding  various coups  and

 would certainly be the most

 In the last five years we have heard various
 reasons for our violent presence in Vietnam. We
 had commitments; we wanted self-determination
 for the South Viets.
 And our GIs were told that they were fighting in
 Southeast Asia to keep war from the beaches of
 California.
 So we have not felt this war's outrageous im-
 mensities. Unless one of ours was a casualty. And
 we sit satisfied that our President is "winding down
 the war." Some say he is merely substituting
 brown bodies for white.
 But how much longer will we keep converting
 their "green earth" into brown dust?
 In one of those wind-down years, April 1969, one
 "clandestine raid" (so described by Paul It.
 Ehrlich and John P. Holdren in Saturday Review)
 by Air America, an airline of the U.S. Central In-
 telligence Agency  defoliated  173,000 acres  in
 eastern Cambodia. It damaged about one-third of
 Cambodia's rubber crop and damage to local fdod
 production was severe.
 Presumably the defoliation of 173,000 Cam-
 bodian acres prevents this same from happening to
 104,000 Crawford, 24,300 Venango, 28,600 Warren,
 and 2,800 Forest county crop-producing acres.
 By late 1969, more than five million acres of
 Indo China had been treated with defoliants applied
 at an average of 13 times the dose recommended by
 the USDA for the domestic use.
 Those millions represent, more acres than all
 Pennsylvania farms used for crop production in
 1967, according to the Pennsylvania Statistical
 Abstract of 1969.
 For Southeast Asians it's often fatal to be down-
 wind from the "wind down."

 With Senate passage of drastically chopped
 foreign-aid legislation, the future prospects
 for the Nixon doctrine remain very much in
 'doubt.
 Beyond that, it is clear now that there is a
 widening willingness on Capitol Hill to try to
 exercise steadily more control over U.S.
 handling of overseas involvement.
 In the past several days, the Senate has
 approved $2.65 billion in economic and -mili-
 tary aid. While still a substantial sum, the
 figure is about $267 million less than in the
 bill defeated by the Senate two weeks ago
 and about $000 million less than the admin-
 istration wanted.
 Close vote studied
 It remains to be worked out just how the
 .reduced funds are to be allocated, but it is
 clear now that the administration faces the
 very real prospect of seeing some of its most
 --1 cherished programs drastically curtailed
 unless agreement can be worked out in
 conference.
 'Seen here as highly significant was the
 narrow passage of an amendment raising
 military aid from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
 That was still less by about a half billion
 dollars ? than  the  administration  desired
 originally. And the closeness of the vote,
 even in the light of the reduction, did not
 appear here to portend well for the future
 of military aid at present levels.

 Aug. 10 a palace revolt inspired by Son and
 supported by the Lempelai (Japanese po-

 upon Son the office of prime minister:
 Following the collapse of Japanese pow-

 cabinet minister to go to Saigon for the
 avowed  purpose  of discussing  "certain
 questions" with the French command. A
 week later French Gen. Leclerc arrived in
 Pllrlolll Penh and arrested Sou. Ile was put
 in the Saigon jail a nd then sentenced to
 forced labor for collaborating with the
 Japanese. Soon, he was scant to France and
 put under house arrest.
 After several royal interventions, Son

 The frankness of our cap-
 tors amazed and puzzled
 me. Toshiichi Suzuki of Ni-
 hon Denpa News and I both
 requested interviews and it
 was we who subsequently
 .,ran out of questions. The
 Vietnamese never tired of
 talking. It indicated, I per-
 sonally concluded, the con-
 fidence which they kept ex-
 pressing that public opinion
 was on their side thruout
 the world. Thru the inter-
 views and chats with
 guards, as well as what we
 saw, we obtained a glimpse
 of what has puzzled the
 world-how and why they
 fight.
 We, spent two weeks in a
 place we called Plum Ka-
 sat (Press V ill a g e.) It
 seemed to be some kind of
 transient camp, a collection
 of thatched roof "hootches"
 (huts) scattered under
 thickets of trees between
 two villages. We were con-
 fined to two small huts, one
 -built on the second day
 when it became obvious the
 six of us were too cramped
 in the first.
 They put Suzuki and me
 .in one hootch, the Cambodians in the other. There was a
 manger-type wooden water trough, small bamboo table,
 hammocks and mosquito nets. We were permitted to walk
 only to a "squat-hole" type toilet about 50 yards away
 through some trees at the rear. A lean-to bath house, with,
 a crock of water filled only three times before we were
 released, backed onto the ~,;nali hut Suzuki and I shared
 on those interminably long days and nights.
 We had no idea why we were there or for how Ion-. We
 sometimes lost track of the days and never saw our faces
 In a mirror. I made a crude sun dial out of a stick in the
 ground. We gauged when our twice daily. meals would
 come by when the cows from the east village walked
 past.
 HALF A SHELL OF WINE
 The monotony was broken only during our conversa-
 tions with the officers and casual chats with our guards.
 Otherwise, it was nightly Radio Hanoi broadcasts, rising
 before dawn for exercises and speculating on the move-
 ments of the villagers and 20 or so military personnel in
 the camp.                     .
 One night the guards gave Suzuki and me half a coco-
 nut shell filled with rank, fiery rice wine. It was the only
 night we slept well; One day we saw them pull a motorcy-

 aware that the black pajamas they had provided for me

 as part of the communist outfit if ever there was an

 PHNOM: PENH - The French
 government was in touch with the
 top leaders of the South Vietnam
 National Liberation Front for at
 least four years before the start of the
 Paris peace talks, according to re-
 liable French sources. The contact
 points were in Cambodia.
 Through these contacts with the
 NLF leaders, the French govern-
 ment received accurate advance in-
 formation of such moves as the pre-
 parations for the 1968 Tel. offensive
 in South Vietnam and the decision
 to transform the NLF into a provi-
 sional government in June. 1060.
 The French government was thus
 In a unique position to make arse:ss-
 ments  of  such  matters  as  the
 strengths and weaknesses of the
 Communist effort in Vietnam, the
 delicate and often ambiguous rela-
 ?tionship.between the NLF and Han-
 oi,  the  Communist ' leadership's
 readings of American willpower to
 continue the war, and Communist
 strategy..
 These contacts took place on the
 grounds  of the  several  French-
 owned rubber plantations in eastern
 Cambodia not far from the border
 of South Vietnam. They were fre-
 quent and continued almost up to
 the day Prince Norodon-r Sihanouk
 was ousted as Cambodian head of
 state.
 The IT ii i t e d States deliberately
 avoided trying, to make use of the
 F r e n. c h channel to the 1 LF for
 soundin;s? about a peace
 settlement,. the  sources
 said, because President
 Lyndon B. Johnson want-
 ed to do nothing that
 would obligate the United
 States to French President
 Charles de Gaulle, whose
 hostility to American in-
 tervention  in  Indochina
 was Well known.
 American diplomats and
 other officials used highly
 valued French channels,
 however, on Vietnam mat-
 ters. And ' American' e--
 perts on the Tet offensive
 say ample intelligence was
 available  at U.S.  head-
 quarters in Saigon that a
 major offensive was corn-
 ing One sourcAp13 m*ed
 seen many of the official
 documents says the top
 command misread the in
 tellience they had and
 t h ereby  underestimated
 the magnitude of what the
 enemy planned.).
 The possibility that the
 French would pass on con-
 fidential                                                    information  to
 the top NLF leadership
 through Cambodia ap-
 pears to have been a major
 reason why the American
 delegation  to  the  talks
 w i t h North Vietnam,
 which opened in Paris in
 May, 19GS. consistently de-
 clined to take the French
 fully into confidence. In-
 stead, the Americans
 chose to deal with Russian
 diplomats, thereby giving
 the Soviet Union the cre-
 dit for serving an interme-
 diary role.
 The French contacts in
 Cambodia  were  estab-
 lished on such a firm
 working basis that when
 the French wanted to find
 out some important point
 of NLF policy, or to dis-
 cuss a minor detail such as
 safe passage for a French
 citizen driving from one
 place to another within
 South Vietnam on a par-
 ticular day, they had. only
 to pass a message to an
 NLF agent and a meeting
 with a high-ranking NLF
 official.. would be arranged
 -a day or two later.

 embassy in Phnom Penh
 with the NLF's perma-

 Known to Sihanouk
 The contacts, according
 to the.   French  sources
 here, were known to
 Prince Sihanouk. He did
 not object to them because
 he saw them as hastening
 the end of the war in Viet-
 nam through some kind of
 negotiated  solution  that
 would bring the NLF to
 power in Saigon but spare
 Cambodia from takeover
 by the Vietnamese Com-
 munists in the near fu-
 ture. Sihanouk was so dis-
 creet about the contacts
 that he never once alluded
 to them in public.
 The contacts also be-
 came  known  to  South
 Vietnam and the United
 States, and they exerted
 an influence on their di-
 plomacy vis-a-vis France.
 The French-NLF meet-
 ings began on a systema-
 tic basis after the Indochi
 nese peoples' summit con-
 ference hosted by Sihan-
 ouk in Phnom Penh in
 March, 1965, at which the,
 NLF was represented. In-
 formation about there was
 passed to South Vietna-
 mese intelligence by
 South Vietnamese agents
 in Cambodia.
 The fear of. the Saigon
 govern;ne'nt that the
 French might be transmit-
 ting information of tacti-
 cal value to the NLF was
 reportedly  an  unspoken
 reason behind Saigon's
 decision to break diploma-
 tic relations with France
 in 1965. After the break,
 the French Embassy in
 Saigon was reduced in sta-
 tus to a consulate general
 and its staff cut sharply.
 . At the time of the     -
 killer-!can-South Vietnamese in-
 cursion into Cambodia in
 May, 1970, American mili-
 tary intelligence in a i n-
 tained that the Central Of-
 fice for South Vietnam,
 the Communist headquar-
 ters for South Vietnam,
 was located in the Fish-
 hoo:c area of Cambodia not
 far from the town of Mim-
 ot.
 This headquarters was
 n e v e r uncovered, a n'd:
 American  officials  a r e
 now inclined to believe
 that COSVN was located'
 all along in the NLF Em-
 bassy in Phnom Penh. The
 French have never said
 anything  publicly about
 COSVN, but their intelli-
 gence information is be-
 lieved to have been more
 accurate.
 Among the top leaders of
 the NLF who are reported
 to have had a, number of
 secret meetings in Cambo-
 dia with French intelli-
 gence agents is Tran Bu'u
 Kiem, a member of the
 NLF Central Committee
 who became the head of
 the NLF delegation to the
 enlarged Paris conference
 after the bombing halt in
 November,  1968.  He  is
 presently listed  by the
 NLF as minister to the of-
 fice of the chairman of thy;
 Provisional Revolutionary'
 Government of the Repub-
 lic of South Vietnam.
 From the point of view
 of the NLF, the contacts
 in Cambodia furnished the'
 only available channel for
 a continuing exchange of
 information  w i t h ' t h e
 Western world-at least
 until the start of the Paris
 negotiations' - in condi-
 tions as close to total se-

 Thruout, I found in them an odd mixture of

 they were homesick. They listened to radio Hanoi

 The two soldiers who
 had captured us tied our
 arms behind our backs
 with t a p e , vines and
 ropes. They ordered us,
 into a nearby bunker
 and a few moments lat-
 er approached with a
 green sack.
 "It's plastique (an ex-
 plosive widely used in
 Indochina)," I thought,
 and tried to scramble
 out, passing the word
 back to the others. We
 all thought.we would be
 blown to pieces.
 But the sack was for
 our cameras and per-
 sonal effe ts. One'of the
 soldiers sat methodical-
 ly taking inventory on

 in round North Vietnamese military canteen,, but
 it was not enough. We grabbed at the canteens,
 drained them and pleaded for more. They
 brought more from a nearby command post that
 we had passed without. seeing.            -
 Running .silently on his thick rubber Ho Chi
 Minh sandals, one of the soldiers returned with
 the first officer we were to meet. He wore no
 rank insignia. Only a pistol on an American belt
 identified him as a superior. His uiform, drab
 brown shirt and green trousers, was the same as
 those of the common soldier.
 "You are invited to go to my place where there
 will be food and water," he said, checking the
 binds on our arms. "It is a short walk from
 here."
 It was the first of many walks which were nev-
 er short, always long. It was the worst.
 The trail was one we had crossed several times
 while trying to elude the communists. It led back
 to the Kirirom road, branching off from Das Kan
 chor, the Cambodian outpost that had been our
 hoped-for renclevous point with government
 troops.
 The guards stopped and hacked branches from
 the trees around us. With difficulty, we each held
 one with our bound hands. Like walking trees, we
 set off down the roadside,
 A Cambodian wearing a bright blue shirt and civilian
 trousers appeared from somewhere and soon the other
 five captives were brought back. That whispered that
 they had simply undergone questioning by the Viet-
 namese. The Cambodian, prompted by Vietnamese, an-
 nounced in Cambodian that we were prisoners of the
 Cambodian Liberation Forces. He said we were not to
 fear for our lives and would be taken a short way to
 another place. He said the Liberation Armed Forces were
 "humane."
 Our ropes were replaced with green plastic-covered
 wire, Mine, I noticed, were looser than the others. Tied
 in a chain and warned again not to run from the planes,
 we marched off into the night.
 I remember little of that walk, except that we had no
 shoes. We were passed by shadowy groups of troops and
 some girls with pony tail hair styles. Four litters moved
 past shadows, their bearers running at a shuffling trot.
 Two litters were closed, carrying dead. Groans. and
 screams came from another and a guard told us it was a
 malaria case.
 We were moving deep into the mountains and an artil-
 lery barrage started. We were herded into a three-man
 bunker. The guards stayed outside. The bunker was typi-
 cal, deep and thick with about three feet of overhead
 cover. The six of us crammed inside, hardly able to
 breathe for what seemed about 30 minutes. It also
 smelled-of U.S. Our party moved across creek beds,
 adways uphill. We were passed by 'two soliders carrying

 S~akrvf Cmbodicrn. regime
 The cabinet crisis that has af-
 flicted Cambodia for the past _ two
 weeks offers a discouraging glimpse
 into the political health. of our coun-
 try's newest Southeast Asian ally.
 The premier, General Lon Nol,
 who was swept into power in the
 coup that preceded the American-
 South Vietnamese invasion a year
 ago, tried in vain to resign.
 He has suffered a serious stroke;
 has been hospitalized in Hawaii; has
 returned, under doctor's orders to
 spend no more than an hour a day
 doing any kind of desk work; and
 would obviously like to retire.
 But if he were to retire, a clique
 of colonels  grouped  around  his
 younger  brother  would lose  in-
 fluence, so they are urging him to
 remain, in title at least, premier.
 His deputy premier, General Sirik
 Matak, is unpopular with some fac-
 tions, so everyone prefers to have
 Lon Nol remain formally premier -
 even though the latest report on his
 health is that he is too ill to make
 important decisions, or to be told
 bad news.
 Meanwhile, some of the important,
 .decisions will apparently include the
 advice . and counsel of a long-time
 Cambodian exile, Son Ngoc Thanh.
 Thanh was briefly his nation's
 premier in 1945. His ambitions clash-.
 ed with those of Prince Norodom
 Sihanouk, and Thanh fled into exile,
 where he encouraged the view that
 Sihanouk was a tool of Communism.
 Thanh has spent most of the last
 decade raising a clandestine guerrilla
 army to overthrow Sihanouk, with.
 support from the American CI;4 and
 possibly the Green Berets as well.
 With Sihanouk now overthrown,
 Thanh obviously feels it safe to re-
 appear, and the CIA is presumably
 glad to see him back.
 Whether his presence, Lon Nol's
 tottering premiership, Sirik Matak's
 enemies or the colonels and their
 friends will bring stability to Cam-
 bodia remains to be seen.
