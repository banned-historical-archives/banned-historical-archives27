 WHY U. S. IS LOSING
 THE 'COLD WAR'
 Governor Dewey, After Far Eastern Trip, Says Russia
 Outspends and Outsmarts This Country on Propaganda
 Bullets and armed might are not the
 only forces in this world-wide conflict.
 We are also engaged in a death struggle
 of ideas, and ideas can be more important
 than bullets in the grand decision.
 In Hong Kong last summer I was told
 a story I did not fully believe, but it is
 one of the most important stories I have
 ever heard. An American who has spent
 many years in the Far East said that the
 Russian budget has equal appropriations
 for the armed forces, for propaganda and
 for revolutionary activity in other coun-
 tries. He firmly believed that to be true.
 Some others that I know believe it is true.
 Nobody can analyze the Russian budget
 so, of course, nobody knows for sure.
 But we do know one thing-there is
 enough truth in the story to make it clear
 why America is taking such a terrible beat-
 ing all over the world on the propaganda
 front. I do not believe we have to take this
 beating. I refuse to admit that Commu-
 nists are smarter than we are at anything
 if we will only apply our brains to a job.
 If the story about the Russian budget is true, and it is
 certainly partly true, how does the American budget com-
 pare with it?
 We have a 58-billion-dollar defense budget. We are spend-
 ing thousands of millions in assisting the free nations to
 defend themselves. The Marshall Plan has worked and is
 working in country after country. There has been a general
 stiffening of the backbone of the free world.
 Yet we spend practically nothing to win the world to our
 side in the field of propaganda. We move in with our physi-
 cal strength, with our economic assistance, but we pay little
 attention to the spiritual strength of our allies. So the Rus-
 sians, posing as liberators, have extended and consolidated
 their position to the point where the Kremlin now controls
 over 800 million people, or one third of the world, and they
 have done it without shedding the blood of a single Russian
 soldier in the last six years.
 Now I am not asking that we increase our propaganda
 appropriation to 58 billion dollars. That would be ridiculous.
 I am not asking that we increase it to even 1 billion. I want
 to start using our brains. What I want is to see America start
 winning back the minds and hearts of people all over this
 world who have been successfully lied to by the Kremlin
 propaganda machine. First of all, we have got to put a lot
 of old ideas behind us.
 In the past, where our information services were not ac-
 tually, in the hands of left-wingers who tried to stab us in
 the back, they were in the hands of sin-
 cere bunglers who tried to sell America
 as a commodity and not as an ideal, They
 presented an America which was a glit-
 tering picture of how wealthy and com-
 fortable life could be under freedom and
 democracy. They boasted that we had
 more automobiles than all the rest of the
 world put together, more telephones,
 more radios, more electric toasters and
 more electric dishwashing machines.
 They told the simple facts of how
 .every American had shoes and how the
 standard of living on public relief was far
 higher than the average standard of living
 of others who work for a living in the rest
 of the world-as it surely is. They painted
 pictures of average American homes with
 two-car garages, gas stoves, refrigerators
 and even green tile bathrooms.
 Now what was the effect of this in
 Asia? The average Asian never saw a gas
 stove. He doesn't have enough dishes even
 to want a washing machine. He never
 hopes to have a telephone. He and 12 or
 14 members of his family live in four or five small rooms. He
 never saw a bathroom, particularly a green tile bathroom.
 The average Asian knows he will never own an auto-
 mobile. He hopes most earnestly that tomorrow he will have
 enough rice and fish to feed himself and his family. That is
 almost the limit of his personal ambition because his struggle
 is to stay alive.
 So what has been the effect of our propaganda on our
 Asian friends? It played directly into the hands of the Com-
 munists. They would have paid us to spread it and they
 were delighted to help spread it for us. They told the Asians:
 "Look how rich America is. See how all the people
 have shoes and clothes and coats and automobiles and
 telephones and paved highways and hospitals and radios
 and even a new, expensive thing known as television."
 Then the Communists added the crusher:
 "You see, everything we have told you about America
 is true. They exploit the rest of the world and rob Asia
 for their own comforts. They are rich and you are poor.
 Down with the Americans."
 With the aid of our own propaganda the Russians suc-
 ceeded in making us hated by millions of people who have
 always liked and admired us. We have played the Russian
 game for them. I propose that we stop it and never again do
 it so long as we live.
 After all, hate is the easiest emotion to arouse. And the
 Communists deal in simple terms. In many hours of conver-

 sations in many countries of the Pacific this summer I sought
 the answer to this problem. How can we combat this simple,
 evil propaganda of greed, envy and hate?
 How can we convince them that only in the free world
 can their living standard rise-that killing Americans, or
 British or French-or their own landowners and merchants
 will not create any more wealth for anyone?
 Most of all, how can we convince them that we Americans
 do not want one acre of their ground or one single slave in all
 the world? How can we convince them that all we want is to
 have a free and peaceful world in which we can all exchange
 goods and services to the advancement of mankind?
 The best answer I received in all the Pacific countries
 was from a wise Chinese on Formosa. He has spent his life
 first as a teacher, then as a soldier, now as an important gov-
 ernment official. He pointed out that for centuries the white
 men of Europe have occupied Asian territory and they have
 often exploited the Asian people. This was easy to do be-
 cause the Europeans had superior weapons and a few could
 conquer many. But, he points out, the day is gone when a
 gunboat can be sent up a river and thousands of native
 Asians will peacefully surrender.
 Today the Asian insists on running his own country but
 he is still an easy prey for demagoguery and falsehood. The
 Communists know the masses of Asia have admired America
 in years past, so the Reds spend most of their time painting
 America as the source of all evil.
 "But," my Chinese friend pointed out, "what has been
 Russia's strength can become Russia's weakness. Every Com-
 munist movement in Asia has Russian masters. The people
 are beginning to see it. America's great opportunity," he
 said, "is to point out to Asia in words of one syllable that
 the Russians are taking them over, and hammer it home day
 after day after day."
 "The way to appeal to the hearts of the people of Asia,"
 he continued, "is for America to champion Asia for the
 Asians-not for the Russians. Korea for the Koreans-not for
 the Russians. China for the Chinese-not for the Russians.
 Japan for the Japanese-not for the Russians. Indo-China for
 the Indo-Chinese-not for the Russians. Indonesia for the
 Indonesians-not for the Russians."
 Here is the greatest, simplest opportunity we have ever
 had. People can understand it. And it is true.
 Today, Soviet Russia is the only European empire or
 U. S. ARMS AID: "Ideas can be more important than
 bullets in the grand decision"
 STALIN POSTER: "America is taking a terrible beating
 all over the world on the propaganda front"
 Asian empire which is seizing and running Asian lands and
 imposing imperialistic, unequal treaties upon their helpless
 Asian satellites.
 The Chinese can understand it. It is said there are 200;000
 Russians running the government of Mao Tse-tung in China
 today. Others calculate the figure to be higher. No one knows
 the exact number. The Russians are smart. They stay in
 their compounds and do not show themselves on the streets
 much. But with such an enormous number, and most of them
 young, they appear increasingly. Moreover, they drink too
 much. The people are slowly becoming unpleasantly con-
 scious of the Soviet occupation.
 You don't have to draw any pictures for the Japanese.
 The Russian threat has hung over their islands all their lives
 and they understand the danger very clearly.
 But the people of the critical areas of Southeast Asia have
 no knowledge of the Russians. They do not know what it
 is to live under the heel of Moscow. Their most skillful native
 Communist  revolutionaries  are  Moscow-trained,  but the
 people don't know it.
 I propose that our country start telling them the ugly
 truths and stick to that and little else. We believe in "Asia
 for the Asians-not for the Russians.",Let's start saying it and
 proving it and let's start winning back the friends we have
 lost for the cause of freedom.
 I have another basic proposal to make concerning our re-
 lations to other nations of the Pacific. It involves not only our
 propaganda but the highest Government policy. It is this:
 We must stop trying to make the rest of the world over into
 our own image. Nothing has made us so many enemies and
 nothing ever will. Nothing has cost us more dearly than the
 proud but childish assumption by our people and by our
 Government that the rest of the world must copy us.
 To be perfectly blunt about it, the peoples of Asia do not
 want to copy us. Moreover, they cannot be made over into
 our likeness and it is time we stopped trying it. j
 If we are going to have any friends left in the `Pacific it is
 time we began recognizing that they have a totally different
 background from ours. It is time we began recognizing that
 they intend to keep on having that background. They like
 their culture. They like their music, which is utterly alien
 to our ears. They like their family tradition. They like it
 even as we in America love. every tradition of our own and
 every one of our precious liberties.  They want a govern-

 ment of their own people-good or bad-and not one run by
 or for any other country.
 It was very interesting to me that in eating the food of
 many countries I visited this summer, most of it had the most
 curious appearance, often appearing to be quite inedible.
 Yet I found that I liked almost all of it very much. The only
 really bad food I had in two months was at a place where
 they tried to imitate American food in our honor. And be-
 lieve me it was awful.
 I think the same thing is true of all Asia. When they are
 themselves, in their own best tradition, they are superb.
 When we expect them to try to imitate us, we are digging
 our grave. It just won't work and we'd better stop it.
 The cultures of Asia are very old. While many of our an-
 cestors were still primitive, many of the peoples of Asia were
 enjoying their third thousand years of cultured literary and
 SOVIET TROOPS: "They have done it without shedding
 the blood of a single Russian soldier"
 artistic tradition. We in the West made immense progress
 in a few centuries and have now passed all the world in
 both technical and material achievement.  But we can't
 make people like us just because of that.
 The greatest mistake we have made in the past is to ex-
 pect nations whom we hope will be our friends to pattern
 their systems of government, of justice, of education, and of
 social relations after ours.
 "If you don't mind," they say, "we like our own system
 very much. If we can't be your friend under our system,
 then we're sorry, we shall have to forego the pleasure."
 When I consider how deeply we Americans have resented
 past European criticism of our own manners and institutions,
 I can't say that I blame the Asians in the least for their re-
 luctance to accept us as their model.
 The truth is, of course, that there is deep beauty and rich-
 ness in Asian culture. We have much to give to each other.
 But we will never give each other anything unless we start
 off with a genuine respect for the culture and the traditions
 of those we expect to be our allies.
 Nothing is more infuriating to them than the smart-Alex
 news reports that are filed from so many Asian countries
 criticizing their form of government or poking fun at their
 leaders, their habits and their customs. It takes the patience
 of a Buddha to submit peacefully to the abuses and the
 falsehoods wh'ch have been heaped not only by individuals
 but even by our own Government upon the leadership of
 many Asian countries which are our friends. Some of them
 are our friends even to the point at this moment of fighting
 and dying on our side.
 Surely their customs are different and surely their govern-
 ments are not the best of all governments in the best of all pos-
 sible worlds. But with complete impartiality I venture the sug-
 gestion that there is nobody within the sound of my voice who
 is willing to suggest that we in America have the most honest,
 the most competent, and the best of all possible governments.
 In 10 short years Communism has increased its sway from
 180 million people of Russia to 800 million people. It does
 not intend to leave a single spot of light, a single area of
 freedom on all this earth. There is no use denying the fact that
 whatever temporary retreats or changes of policy they may an-
 nounce, the Soviet Union intends to wipe us out and the rest
 of the free world with us.
 In the face of this menace and unending challenge we
 need every friend we can get. We need them whether they
 are black, brown, yellow or white. We need them whether
 they are Christian, Moslem, Buddhist or Confucian. We
 need them as equals, as friends and allies.
 The only possible way we can save our civilization is to
 win World War III without fighting it because an atomic
 world war would destroy everything. The only possible way
 we can win World War III without fighting it is to have
 overwhelming strength and overwhelming numbers.
 There are 270 million free people in the Pacific today,
 almost the same number as there are in Western Europe.
 Added to the population of North and South America and
 Western Europe we would total 870 million strong. That is
 more than Stalin's 800 million. For the first time the free
 world would have not only superiority of industrial power
 and resources but also more people.
 This is one reason I have advocated a total Pacific Alliance
 similar to the North Atlantic Alliance. But if we are to get ,
 a Pacific Treaty, we must deal as equals with proud peo-
 ple of the Asian nations. We must respect them. We must
 stop the condescending attitude that America knows better
 than they do how their own affairs should be run. If we will
 use the brains God gave us, we will treat others as we would
 like to have them treat us. If we will accept them as they are
 and help them develop their own traditional talents and
 skills, we have a right to hope that they will respect us as
 we are and be glad to join us in equal partnership for the
 protection of the free world.
 In this period when world leadership has been thrust
 upon us, we must grow rapidly to an intellectual maturity.
 We must develop a wisdom and patience in dealing with
 others that we have never known. To preserve our very exist-
 ence, we must do it fast.
 With new-found respect for our friends and allies and
 with a high degree of competence in our relations with them,
 I am confident we can win through this dreadful period of
 trial without total war.
 Let us dedicate ourselves to a better understanding of
 the free peoples of the world. Let us unite in a mighty com-
 pany in the common defense of our liberties. Let us be so
 strong and so numerous we can win the peace without war.

 New York at Hartford, Conn., Oct. 16, 1951.)

 WORLD WAR III1
 RUSSIAN STYLE,
 IS HERE
 New Strategy Conquers 600 Million People, Rolls On
 World War Ill, Russian style, is being lost by
 U. S., won by Russia, hands down.
 Conquests to date are among history's
 greatest-600 million people in five years.
 Fifth column, revolution, assassination,
 propaganda, purges, satellite wars are Rus-
 sia's weapons in the world's new World War.
 Atom bombs may never be used.
 U. S., preparing for imaginary war of the
 future that Russia will not start, is losing real
 war Russia now fights in her own way.
 World War III is here. It has been here
 for five years. In the real war to date, Rus-
 sia, definitely, is winning, U. S. losing.
 . U. S., arming, is getting set for an
 imaginary war of the kind Russia will
 avoid at almost any cost. Russia is ac-
 tively waging war of the kind that pays
 returns, war fought in the name  of
 peace for conquests that enrich a con-
 queror.
 War that U. S. prepares for would
 blow up much of the world, if started.
 Nobody wins, all lose, that war. War, as
 Russia is waging it, aims at conquest of
 earning assets, not of bomb-blasted rub-
 ble. Russian strategy is that of a modern
 imperialism.
 War, Russian style, is proving highly
 profitable to Russia.
 In Eastern Europe, at no cost in Rus-
 sian life, modern war has yielded Russia
 the second largest industrial complex in
 all Europe.
 In Asia, without cost in Russian lives,
 World War III has brought China, with
 its man power and industrial potential,
 into the Communist empire.
 Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary are gone. China is, too.
 India is wobbly. So are Indo-China,, Burma,
 Malaya, Indonesia. Iran totters. So do Egypt,
 Jordan, Iraq and Morocco.
 In U. S., Britain, France, Italy, elsewhere,
 fifth columns are at work, trouble is exploited.
 Russia, winning, knows where she's headed.
 U. S., losing, seems bewildered, punch-drunk,
 moving toward eventual inflationary crack-up.
 World War III may be lost by default:
 All but the fringes of the great Eura-
 sian land mass today are within that em-
 pire. Through Southeast Asia, in the
 Middle East, even in Western Europe,
 those fringes are being prepared for
 eventual  conquest.  In  the  Western
 Hemisphere, advance units of Commu-
 nism are busy scouting the ground, pre-
 paring for the day, maybe distant, when
 war, as Russia's strategists conceive it,
 can be carried forward successfully.
 War preparation, U. S. style, aimed at
 some imaginary war that Russia will not
 fight unless attacked, is geared to yield
 disaster for all.
 If this imaginary war of the future is
 fought, it promises to blow up everybody
 and everything. Its conception is that
 of horror and obliteration. Its aim, as
 officially outlined, is to leave the world
 a shambles that nobody but a Com-
 munist would want to try to run.
 If the U. S.-style war is not fought,
 there is the prospect of. economic dis-
 aster when preparation for that imagi-
 nary war slows. Communists plan to be
 around to pick up the pieces.
 Either way it goes, so far as anyone
 can learn from this country's planners,
 the end product of American planning
 is something like chaos.
 Strategists for U. S. are only now
 starting to fathom World War III as Rus-
 sia actually is waging it, for profit.
 Ideas, they discover, are a major Rus-
 sian weapon. Propaganda commands as
 much, or more, thought and effort in
 Russia's warmaking as does armament.
 Peace, as an idea, is paying off through
 preparation of the ground for conquest
 more handsomely than scores of divi-
 sions of troops could do. Fifth columns
 are on hand to exploit trouble, to grab
 power where opportunity offers. Com-
 munists grabbed Eastern Europe, with
 150 million people and strong industries,
 through this method.
 Assassination is encouraged as a trou-
 ble brewer. A Puerto Rican radical tried
 it on President Truman. Assassins can
 prepare the ground for revolution, as in
 Iran, or Pakistan, or Jordan.

 China is threatened in guerrilla war.
 Malaya is, too. Korea is waged as inter-

 life, at small cost in Russian resources
 and armament.

 gain. U. S., countering, pushed the Mar-
 shall Plan of gifts to friendly nations in
 Europe. This plan was supposed to stop
 the Communists. Stalin then countered
 for Russia by a coup that took Czecho-
 slovakia. A Russian general took over in
 Poland. Purges went forward in Ru-
 mania and Bulgaria to strengthen the
 Russian hold. Bids for power were made
 in elections in France and Italy. Com-
 munists lost, but proved themselves, the
 largest single party in each of those
 countries-a fifth column of major size
 and importance.
 U. S. planners, frightened, turned all
 attention to  Western  Europe.  Stalin,
 who is smart, shifted to Asia.
 Communists took China while U. S.
 officials looked on, unmoved. A war was
 fought by U. S. to save China from
 Japan. But U. S. then found China in
 Russia's empire four years after the war
 supposedly was won. Top officials were
 unimpressed, assumed the attitude that
 nothing could be done. War flared in
 Indo-China,   tying   down  important
 French forces, placing an economic drain
 on France. Guerrilla war flared in Mala-
 ya, tying down important British forces,
 placing an economic drain on Britain.
 Still unimpressed, with all U. S. offi-
 cial attention centered on ways to bol-
 ster Western Europe, the hint came that
 U. S. interests no longer extended to
 Korea. Formosa and Korea apparently
 were to be had for the taking. Stalin
 moved in June, 1950. Through a puppet
 regime in North Korea he acted to stake
 his claim to South Korea.
 The U. S., resisting, joined Britain
 and France, tying important forces down
 in Asia, where top American officials
 had been determined they never would
 be tied down. The drain of World War
 III on American resources was in two
 directions-toward Western Europe and
 toward Korea in Asia. In U. S., feverish
 churning started to prepare for an imagi-
 nary war of all-out destruction.

 the battlefront and to prepare the ground

 for what he expects to be new victories
 in the real, modern-type world war that
 he is fighting.
 POSTERS IN PRAGUE
 Revolt against the West has struck
 Iran. Assassination was used in Jordan
 and Pakistan to prepare the way for
 trouble. Revolution of a sort stirred in
 Egypt. Rumblings of trouble began to
 be heard in French Morocco. New fronts
 were being opened, as 1951 moved to-
 ward a close in the fifth year of World
 War III. American strategists still had
 their eyes glued to Western Europe and
 their plans geared to the imaginary war
 that Russia would never fight. In the
 fifth year of war, .Russia still could wage
 war in the name of peace.
 The United States, leading industrial
 power of the world, at this point ad-
 mittedly remains on the defensive, out-
 smarted, outmaneuvered at every turn.
 Everything is geared to the one-track
 idea of a war to blow up the world. As
 a few officials outside the central plan-
 ning ground see it, U. S. is busy losing
 the world in a war its leaders cannot see
 or understand.
 Victory, to date, is going to a nation
 and a system that is highly vulnerable
 to counterattack of a modern variety,
 waged with modern weapons.
 Communist Russia, besting the United
 States in World War III, is a weak na-
 tion.
 Stalin holds power only through con-
 trol over secret police and the Army.
 Nearly 10 per cent of Russia's popula-
 tion is in political prisons, working on a
 slave-labor basis. In 30 years, the Rus-
 sian people have enjoyed no chance to
 blow off steam. Periodic purges elimi-
 nated dissenters, leaving bitterness be-
 hind. Peasants are turned into day la-
 borers, land is nationalized. There is no
 single language, no common bond for
 discordant nationalities that make up
 Russia.
 Industry remains primitive, compared
 with U. S. Transport is weak, very vul-
 nerable. Armed forces, while large, are
 of uncertain reliability in war that might
 carry them to other parts of the world.
 The whole Russian empire is filled with
 disgruntled  people-held  in  virtual
 slavery-working for a relatively few
 privileged Communist rulers who get all
 the gravy, held in bondage by secret
 police and armed guards.
 Counterattack, geared to exploit the
 weakness of Russia, is beginning to be
 considered by officials in U. S. who rec-
 ognize World War III for what it is, but
 who are not now in power.
 Ideas are seen as the most potent
 weapon in U. S. hands. Present propa-

 freedom, and sold by Americans who
 are trained in putting across mass ap-
 peals, might prove explosive. That, at
 least, is the view of those who know
 how to reach masses of people. What is
 needed, in their view, is a positive type
 of "crusade" to sell freedom in practical
 terms.
 Sabotage, too, is.a wide-open field of
 operations. With no support from the
 West, against hopeless odds, workers in
 several countries of the Communist em-
 pire already are carrying on effective
 sabotage. In Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
 Poland, there are slowdowns in industry.
 Peasant revolt is reported from many
 areas, even from isolated parts of Soviet
 Russia herself. There are ways to encour-
 age and aid sabotage of Communism.
 Fifth-column  opportunities  appear
 to be wide open in many areas. In China
 there still is a chance to promote civil
 war in some areas. Parts of Eastern Eu-
 rope are described as ripe for local re-
 volts. Assassination is a two-edged sword
 that not only Communists but also local
 partisans can use. Dollars have paid off
 in more than one instance when dealing
 with Communist leaders who love the
 good things the West offers. Methods
 to stir trouble are many. Yet American
 officials, to date, have frowned upon
 their use.
 Pressure for revolt, obviously, is seeth-
 ing in major sections of the new Russian
 empire.  Living  standards  are  being
 ground down. Peasants are losing land.
 Purge and threat of purge are develop-
 ing desperate men who are not afraid of
 chance taking. Those who are advocat-
 ing a counterattack against Communism
 insist that a tiny fraction of effort and
 money going into arms, if devoted to
 weapons for revolt, could produce star-
 tling results. Russia, with nothing to sell
 but slavery, without real strength to chal-
 lenge the West; has won control over
 600 million people and vast territory by
 exploiting dissatisfaction.
 The degree of unhappiness and dis-
 content within the Russian empire is
 pictured as more intense than in any
 other part of the world.
 A promise to blow up the unhappy
 people of the Russian empire is not cal-
 culated to encourage them to look hope-
 fully to the United States. A chance to
 do some revolting on their own, with
 the hope of freedom, might get results.
 To 'win World War 111, instead of los-
 ing it, the United States is to be forced
 to  turn  against  Russia's  Communists
 the  weapons  that  Communist    Russia
 uses against the West.
 As things are going now, U. S., arming
 to the teeth, is losing the war. Russia,
 without committing troops of her own,
 is winning with ideas, propaganda and
 revolution.

 BLOW BY BLOW-Russia Still Gaining
 After Five Years of War
 Communist coups grabbed most of Eastern Europe by 1947.
 Attack on Greece then was made to flank Turkey, control Eastern
 Mediterranean.
 U.S. countered with the Truman Doctrine. Money, arms, officers went
 to Greece.
 War was on, as Russia saw it. It was U. S. vs. Russia in March, 1947.
 Arms aid started to Turkey. U. S. vowed to "contain" Communism.
 Marshall Plan for economic aid to U. S. friends was proposed.
 Czechoslovakia fell to Communist coup February, 1948. Czechs
 had wanted Marshall Plan aid.
 Berlin was blockaded in March, 1948. Aim was to get the West out.
 "Air lift" was begun to beat blockade. U. S. won after 14 months.
 Communists were jolted by election defeats in Italy in April, 1948,
 in France in November, 1948.
 Bloody uprisings, Communist directed, broke out in Malaya.
 Tito was denounced by Communists for deviation in June, 1948.
 Coup in Hungary brought all-Communist Government in May, 1949.
 Drives stepped up as Communists shifted strategy to Asia.
 China fell to Communist armies. Chiang fled to Formosa in October,
 1949.
 War in Indo-China flared more actively.
 U. S. Navy plane was shot down over the Baltic in April, 1950.
 Attack on South Korea was launched in June, 1950. U. N. resisted.
 Chinese invasion of Korea followed defeat of North Koreans. Korean
 war flared anew.
 Defense for Europe, under General Eisenhower, was set up in skel-
 eton form April, 1951.
 Tibet was conquered by Communist invaders in May, 1951.
 Setback in Japan was suffered by Russia when the West signed a
 separate treaty.
 Uprising in Iran, with Communist backing, forced out British in
 October, 1951.
 Assassinations foretold more trouble in Jordan and Pakistan.
 Norway was threatened by Russia in October, 1951.
 Shooting war began in Egypt.
 Truce talks in Korea, on and off, brought no results after 125 days.
 Communist drives, in five years, gained a vast empire, 600 million
 people.

 Iran Is Seen as an Example
 Of Too-Late U. S. Planning
 State Department . Early Aware of Thorny
 Oil Issue, but Hewed to Daily Tasks
 By JAMES RESTON
 special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.
 WASHINGTON,  Oct.  30-The
 delicate job of trying to find a so-
 lution to the Iranian oil crisis has
 now been given to two young and
 energetic members  of the State
 Department, Assistant Secretary
 of State' George C. McGhee, and
 the head of the Department's Pol-
 icy Planning Staff, Paul H. Nitze.
 Mr. McGhee is an able geologist
 and former oil company official
 from Texas, a protege of former
 Under  Secretary  of  State  Will
 Clayton and  a    wealthy  former
 Rhodes scholar, whose area of re-
 sponsibility                                                              now        covers    every
 critical point from   Morocco  to
 Pakistan.
 Mr. Nitze took over the Policy
 Planning  Staff from George    F.
 Kennan a couple of years ago after
 a distinguished academic career at
 Harvard and an equally successful
 career in Wall Street and various
 branches of the government.
 So far, they have made some
 ing that detailed planning by Mr.
 Nitze, when his staff recognized
 the problem more than a year ago,
 would at least have been a more
 hopeful enterprise than interven-
 tion by Mr. Nitze now.
 Mr. Nitze, however, was spend-
 ing a good deal of his time then on
 short-range problems rather than
 on long-range planning, just as he
 is spending a great deal of time
 now negotiating with Premier Mo-
 hammed Mossadegh of Iran, and
 just as his deputy, John Ferguson,
 is off in Paris working on other
 immediate problems.
 This is not, of course, Mr. Nitze's
 fault. He does what he is told, and
 he was assigned to the Iranian ne-
 gotiations by Secretary of State
 Dean Acheson, who is the man who
 has argued with more eloquence
 for  a  State  Department  ivory
 tower than anybody else.
 Negotiations Displace Planning
 The best critique of the Policy
 Planning Staff was prepared under
 the direction of Mr. Acheson him-
 self. This was just before he be-
 came Secretary of State, when he
 was a member of the Hoover Com-
 mission: in that job, he supervised
 the  commission's  report  on  the
 State Department, which included
 the following:
 "The Secretary of State should
 continue  the  present  high-level
 planning activity under a Planning
 Adviser, with special emphasis on
 freeing him and his staff of cur-
 rent problems, upon providing him
 with a broad-gauge staff, and upon
 utilization by him of competent ad-
 vice from inside and outside the
 progress, but the general feeling
 here is that the United States in-
 tervened in the problem too late
 and cannot now be expected to find
 any compromise that will satisfy
 the United States, Britain or Iran.
 The arrival of Mr. Nitze in the
 current negotiations illustrates at
 least one aspect of the problem.
 He is head of one of the newest
 and most important sections of the
 State Department, created several
 years ago so that there would be
 at least one area in the depart-
 ment where men would be free to
 concentrate, not on the immediate
 problems of the moment, but on
 problems that could be seen on, the
 contained the nationalistic feelings wee s s ow,  l   is s Ill.! spen In
 States In erven ion w s       y'  And the point of the criticism
 not  hopelessly,  hampered  by being heard here on Iran is not so
 events.
 Nobody here is prepared to say much that the planning staff was
 today that early intervention by negotiating rather than planning
 e United States would have over- in the past, but that, as Mr. Nitze's
 Iran Case No Surprise      Government.
 "The  present  Policy Planning
