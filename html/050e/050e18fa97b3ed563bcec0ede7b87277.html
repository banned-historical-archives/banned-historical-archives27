 IDEOLOGY OF ERNESTO CHE GUEVARA EXPLORED
 [Article by Peter Schenkel, Bad Godes'b erg, Vierteljahresberichte, German,
 CFNW 1968, pp 137-153]
 GHT
 The death of Ernesto Che Guevara, officially confirmed in Bolivia
 in October of 1967, finally solved the mystery about the Argentine-Cuban
 revolutionary.  But his death and the failure of the guerrillas led by
 him in Bolivia also provided new fuel for the violent controversies
 carried on by continental left-wing forces about the means of the Latin
 American revolution.
 Although Guevara became famous as a daring guerrilla leader, his
 real significance lies in the ideological field.   As Marxian theorist
 of a  particularly militant proletarian internationalism, as strntetist
 and tactician of guerrilla warfare in Latin America, and as a reformer
 in Cuba, his was without doubt the most prominent and ablest intellect
 of Cuban Marxism besides Fidel Castro, and he had great influence on the
 thought and actions of the young revolutionary forces.   His ideas, which
 were proclaimed loudest in Havana, will  probably continue to  play a part
 with the Latin American left.  This is already assured by the fact that
 the discrepancy between the idea of armed struggle propagated by him and
 Cuba and the more moderate course of action advocated by the Soviet Union
 and the majority of the Latin American Communist Parties has entered a
 stage of open antagonism which  c a n n o t  b e  s e t t I e d  over-
 night.                       For this reason alone, it appears useful to examine the ideological
 legacy of Che Guevara.
 It must be mentioned beforehand that Che Guevara has not         left a
 comprehensive theoretical work.  With the exception of his book on
 guerrilla warfare  La Guerra de Guerrillas (The Guerrilla War), Havana,
 INRA*1960, translated into all world languages), his ideas are found
 scattered in a great number of speeches, interviews, official documents
 and other publications.  In spite of this somewhat splintered character,
 his ideological legacy does not lack a certain coherence.  Only Guevara's
 last manuscript could not be taken  into account  here:  his still-
 unpublished diary on the guerrilla episode in Bolivia.  However, that
 too -- this much is known -- leaves his fundamental theses unchanged.

 I.  Che Guevara's Radical Global Concept
 The general line of action followed by N. Khrushchev, but also
 by the present leaders of the Soviet Union, is that of coexistence, of
 peaceful competition between states with different social systems,
 of avoidance of policies which might lead to a direct confrontation with
 the US and to atomic war, and of the realization of the socialist revolu-
 tion in developed and underdeveloped countries in a peaceful way with
 participation of the non-Communist sectors of the population.  This line
 of action ran into growing resistance not only in China but also in the
 militant movements of many of the developing countries.
 1.  Enemy of Peaceful Coexistence
 Che Guevara was bitterly opposed to  the politics of "peaceful
 coexistence," where his reasons were of a political and doctrinal nature.
 On the one hand, due to the strained relations between the US and Cuba
 and their consequences, he held that peaceful coexistence was illusory
 and impossible.  ". . , The aggressive nature of the US's monopolistic
 capitalism makes any agreement impossible; the relationships will of
 necessity remain strained or become worse until the final destruction of
 imperialism."1  Like Fidel Castro, Che Guevara refused to sign the
 Nuclear Agreement of August 1963 and spoke against the suggestion advanced
 by Brazil, Chile and Mexico in the UN to create a nuclear-free zone in
 Latin America.2
 On the other hand, Guevara saw in the general concept     which had
 been worked out by the international conference of the Communist Party of
 1960 and by the last conferences of the Communist  Party of the Soviet
 Union in which great significance was seen in the possibility of realiz-
 ing the socialist revolution in a peaceful manner and of developing the
 "state of national democracy" in the "Third World" a renunciation of the
 armed fight for independence in colonial and economically dependent areas
 and a watering-down of the struggle against i~.~~rialism in general.  He
 was convinced of the inevitability of armed struggle. in the underdeveloped
 world and above all in Latin America, and saw in Vietnam the shining
 example for the even greater conflict "which awaited      imperialism on
 the Latin American continent."  He prophesied that "the final victory
 in this struggle will also signify the end of US imperialism."3   The
 process of disintegration of the "imperialist    world system" he thought
 to be so far advanced at the present that there exists a real possibility
 of changing the existing balance in the world and of sealing the "fate of
 imperialism" through the armed struggle for independence.  Hence, in the
 final analysis, the idea of coexistence of the Communist states meant for
 Guevara a strengthening of imperialism and neo-colonialism.

 Che Guevara's concept    of proletarian internationalism far
 exceeds the limits set by the Eastern European countries.4  He judged
 that "there are no limits in this struggle of life or death."  "The
 victory of any nation over imperialism is our victory, and its defeat
 is defeat for all of us.  The practice of proletarian internationalism
 is not only a duty ,  .  .  , but an urgent necessity.   It is our interna-
 tional duty .  . . with our efforts to help    bring about the liberation
 of the nations as quickly and as radically as possible."5  What he meant
 by this is obvious from the following reproach addressed to ~'oscow and
 Peking:  "The solidarity.of the progressive world with the peoil c of
 Vietnam today resembles the bitter irony of the plebeians wh o encouraged
 the gladiators in the Roman arena.  The point is not to wish the victim
 of aggression success, but to share his fate."  It would have been their
 duty "to make Vietnam an inviolable part of the socialist world and to
 force the US into a decision -- even at the, risk of world war."7
 This is the way, similar to Fidel Castro, in which Che Guevara
 conceived of the "basic line of action of     militant anti-imperialism
 and internationalism" of Cuba.  The development of socialism in Cuba
 was for him only one of the fundamental tasks of the new regime -- and
 not even the most important.  The more meaningful task was to acrrively
 and with all possible means advance the "anti-imperialist   struggle for
 liberation wherever it had started or where conditions were rine for it.
 Long after Guevara had left Cuba, Fidel Castro said, ".  .  . . Ct.r Country
 is fighting for its wealth and its future, but it will never want to
 achieve this future at  the dishonorable price of the betrayal of its
 international duties."8  For Che Guevara, this postulate was not only o'
 political but also of eminent moral significance.   He feared that a revolu-
 tion which concentrated only on the solution of its own economic problems
 and forgot      militant proletarian internationalism would soon cease
 being a guiding force for humanity.9  Glancing     at Eastern Europe, he
 felt that it would certainly degenerate to sluggish indolence in which
 the real revolutionary spirit would be lost.
 No problem has been more vigorously disputed during the past years
 within world Communism than the question of war and peace.   In this connec-
 tion it has frequently been asked whether Guevara's militant anti-imperial-
 ism does not represent a particularly extreme pro-war doctrine.  This
 question cannot be answered in the affirmative without reservations.  For
 him, nuclear conflict was not an unavoidable means of carrying out the
 world revolution,  But neither did he draw back from a world v-ar which
 might be the consequence of a local fight for liberation.  With regard
 to Cuba, he explained:  "For the right to build up socialism according
 to the will of our people, we must pay any price."10  And, at another
 point, "If it has fulfilled its role as example for Latin America, our
 nation will be completely happy, even if because of it  nuclear war should
 come about.1111  That this was not mere rhetoric became apparent during
 the rocket crisis of 1962.

 Che Guevara considered the :;.ti-imperialist   struggle for libera-
 tion in Africa, Asia and Latin America to be historically justified and
 necessary.  "If anybody opposes it," it was his opinion that "it is
 permissible . . . to employ arms in the fight for peace."12  He demanded
 of the Communist countries to make this fight for liberation their fight,
 and he blamed them for having betrayed Vietnam out of fear of a global
 conflict with the US.  He wrote, "Since the imperialists extort humanity
 with the threat of war, it is a wise reaction not to fear war! . .  . It
 is our duty to liberate it at any price."13  he said it was the task of
 Latin America to create a second or third Vietnam which would then intro-
 duce "the final victory over imperialism" in a global conflict.
 Che Guevara talked of the suffering and the victims of such a
 struggle as nothing by saying, "They would be less than those which we
 would have to suffer if we continuously avoided war so that others would
 have to do the dirty work for us."14  His statement that     " US imperial-
 ism is weaker than we think; it is a giant or, clay feet," does not permit
 us to interpret this to mean that he may perhaps have had in mind a
 peaceful submission by the US.15
 Thus, it is obvious that Guevara's ideas on war and peace do not
 agree with the Soviet line but are closer to Mao's.
 4.  The Unity of the Anti-Imperialist Struggle
 In the writings from the time Che Guevara spent in Cuba, we find
 no hint as to his position with regard to the schism in the Com unisy
 world.   Nevertheless, it was hardly a secret to anyone that he sympathized
 with Peking as far as the tactics and strategy of the so-called anti-
 imperialist struggle was concerned.  only after he had left Cuba, he
 wrote, "In view of the malice and inflexibility with which the respective
 points of view are advocated, we, the dispossessed, can take our stand
 neither on the one side nor on the other side of the discrepancies  .       ,
 even though we sometimes agree more with the assertions C)17 the eec side
 than with those of the other."16  ','his statement, which may be interpreted
 as being pro-Chinese is however not based on a relationship of ideological
 dependence by Guevara on Peking.  Early in 1960, Che Guevara admitted to
 the author that he knew neither Mao Tse-tung's writings nor anything else
 about China, and in 1963 he explained to a US student delegation that any
 agreement of his position with that of Peking was "purely accidental."
 He blamed both Moscow and Peking for the continued existence of the
 schism.17
 Guevara had no illusions about the prevailing contradictions.
 They were said to have reached such intensity and bitterness that there
 was little or no hope for a dialogue or perhaps even a reconciliation.
 Nevertheless, he passionately called for unity.  He wrote, "The time
 has come to bury our discrepancies and to employ all of our forces in
 the service of our struggle."  And his reason for this was that "The
 enemy is at hand; he attacks us daily and threatens us with new attacks,
 and these attacks shall unite us today, tomorrow, or the day after.

 Anyone  who is the first to see this and who prepares for the necessary
 unity will receive the gratitude of the nations."18
 Guevara considered the unity of the Communist world movement to
 be more than merely a theoretical, academic question.  For him it was
 the prerequisite for "the creation of a common front of all underdeveloped
 countries with the Communist countries against imperialism."  The manner
 in which "imperialism" proceeds against both groups of countries "justi-
 fies with elementary logic the necessity of as alliance -- and if there is
 no other reason for a close alliance, the common enemy provides it."19
 But Guevara was skeptical of the Eastern European countries.  Independently
 of them, the pleads everywhere -- at the World Conference for Trade and
 Development (Geneva, 1964), in the United Nations (December,  1964), and
 during his stay of several months in Africa and Asia (early in 1965)  --
 "to establish the unity of the c wip of the underdeveloped countries."20
 He was, without doubt, the spiritual originator of the Tricontin.atal
 Conference   held in Havana in January 1966 and the founder of the Latin
 American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which was given the task to
 become the mouthpiece for the liberation movements in Asia, Africa and
 Latin America, and to advance and coordinate their armed strug1e.21
 II.   Che Guevara on the Strategy and Tactics of the Revolution in Latin
 America
 Guevara's ideological complex which is most significant and most
 nearly complete in itself concerns the revolution in Latin Ammerica.   This
 was his most important business.  Guevara:'s contribution consists in his
 having clarified the theoretical theses w1ich were designed to serve as
 fundamental guidelines for the strategy and tactics of an armed struggle
 for liberation and for guerrilla warfare.  Even today, these theses are
 still an integral part of Castro-.'h:arxism, especially of the OLAS mentioned
 above which has its seat in Havana.
 Che Guevara's theses on the Latin American revolution are primarily
 characterized by the extrapolation of the Cuban example to the conditions
 on the whole continent.   Its motto is:   `What was possible in Cuau can be
 repeated in Latin America."  With reference to this, we have to call atten-
 tion to the following authoritative theses:
 Objective and subjective conditions.  According to Guevara, the Cuban
 example proved that wherever lati'r:undium and capital are allied with US
 capitalism and where, as a consequence, political dependence and under-
 development prevail -- and this is said to hold for most countries of
 Latin America -- the objective conditions for a revolution according to
 the Cuban example are given.  He specified that "these objective condi-
 tions are based on hunger -- the common denominator of the masses of
 Latin America -- the reaction of the masses to this hunger, the govern-
 ment terror and the hatred which is a product of this terror."22  Of
 course, in some countries (such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, ~,exico),

 CPYRGHT
 he did not consider the objective conditions for a revolutionary develop-
 ment as being immediately present.                            But in most of the countries of Latin
 America he judged the objective conditions to be incomparably more ready
 than those which had existed in Cuba.23
 As far as the subjective conditions arc concerned, the Cuban
 revolution was said to have shown that these can be created during the
 struggle itself.   Guevara stressed that the revolutionary consciousness
 is created through the struggle, through armed struBgie," because only
 this struggle would bring "clearly into consciousness the necessity of a
 radical revulsion and the defeat of the army by the people's forces."
 Fidel Castro also explains- that "Man hiasclf, the revolutionary process,
 creates the revolutionary consciousness."24  Like him, Che Guevara was
 of the opinion that there was no need for politically-prepared masses to
 get a revolution under way, but that one needed only a small guerrilla
 nucleus with the capacity to draw the masses into the struggle, as in Cuba.
 The Hopelessness of the Peaceful bay.   Next, Che Guevara feels that
 the Cuban experience has proven until everybody became weary of it that
 it is impossible in Latin America to effect thorough reforms for the masses
 in a peaceful manner.  He thus thought the struggle which aims only at
 creating civil legality without putting itself the task of assuming power
 to be completely senseless.25   In guerrilla warfare, the masses must be
 convinced of the impossibility of carrying on the struggle for social
 gains within the framework of civil conflict.26
 Justification of the Armed Str.z; e.   Third, ho thought the Cuban,
 revolution to have shown the correctness of the idea of an armed fight
 and of the fighting methods of guerrilla warfare.  Che Guevara did in
 fact warn not to underestimate the role played by the constitutional
 methods of fighting, but he left no doubt that he considered armed fighting
 -- according to Cuban example -- the principal way "of getting to power."77
 After all, without destruction of the existing ar?iy, even the victory in a
 popular election would provide no Guarantee,   The conf=lict with the reac-
 tionary classes would soon spring up again, and the         of a military
 coup d'etat would always be there.   hence, Guevara had little regard for
 the more moderate theses of many of the Communist parties.  His fighting
 motto was that of the Second Declaration of I-Iavana:   "It is the duty of
 each revolutionary to make revolution."  Referring to the hesitating Com-
 munist parties, he wrote, ".  . . Nobody has the right to believe that
 liberty can be obtained without struggle."28  Besides, he thought the Cuban
 experience to have shown that, in Latin America, guerrilla warfare is the
 only correct form of fighting for power to be used by the :.iasscs.29
 Rural Areas as Center of Gravity in the Fighting.   Fourth, he
 thought the Cuban revolution to have clearly shown that "the basic armed
 struggle in the underdeveloped part of America must be carried out in
 the rural areas."30  Guevara opposed those who wanted to concentrate
 the fighting in the cities and ignored the large part of the rural popula-
 tion.                               He said that because of the inhuman conditions under which they
 live, theirs would be the decisive part in the national struggle for

 liberation.  In the end, the country would conquer the cities with the
 help of an army of peasants.31  To the forces in the city should be given
 the role of merely supporting the guerrilla bands operating in the rural
 areas.  The decisive factor in this was that Guevara saw the principal con-
 tradiction in Latin America in the gap between the backward rural areas
 and the far more highly developed cities.  To this was added his tactical
 consideration that the nucleus of guerrillas in the country would continue
 to guarantee the continued existence of the revolutionary leadership, even
 if the movement in the city were to be destroyed by the enemy.
 Support by the Rural Population.   As a basic prerequisite of success-
 ful guerrilla fighting, Che Guevara postulated, according to the Cuban
 example, the support of the guerrillas by the local rural population.  He
 found this support to be a condition "sine qua non" for the struggle against
 a powerful  ;.rmy with modern equipmcnt.~2   Guevara considered it a foregone
 conclusion that the masses of the workers and peasants of Latin America
 would take the side of the guerrillas, join them, and supply them.  After
 all, on the basis of the Cuban experience, they would know that it is
 possible to win with the guerrillas; secondly, they would have thus become
 conscious of the fact "that the future belongs to the people, since it is
 for social justice."33  He figured that without comprehensive support by
 the rural population, guerrilla warfare could not be recommended in Latin
 America, either.
 The similarity of Guevara's postulates with the theses of Mao Tse-
 tung on peasant war and the encirclement of the city by the country is
 obvious,   The OLAS conference in Havana (1967) accepted all of these
 theses.  Contrary to this, they are not accepted today by the majority
 of the Latin American and European Communist parties which point out the
 difference in the conditions in Cuba and in Latin America.
 2.   Exception from the Cuban Example
 From within the ranks of many orthodox Communist parties, repeated
 statements have been made since the triumph of i,idel Castro which consider
 it questionable whether the Cuban revolution could be repeated and which
 point toward the "exceptional character" of the case of Cuba.  Che Guevara
 himself was aware of some of these exceptions in the Cuban model.
 Polarization of the Forces.   Guevara admitted that the success of
 the Cuban revolution was made possible by the support which Fidel Castro
 was also given by many sections of the propertied classes and by the
 passive behavior of the US.  "Thus, non-revolutionary forces actually
 helped in the establishment of the revolutionary regime          US
 imperialism was disoriented, and it did not succeed in understanding the
 true significance of the Cuban revolution.1134
 However, Che Guevara felt that this formula today could no longer
 be successfully be applied in Latin America because of the later change-
 over to the socialist revolution in Cuba.  He thought that the propertied
 classes of Latin America had learned their lesson from this and that

 CPYRGHT
 "even      imperialism on the continent could no longer be taken by
 surprise."35  He maintained that "The Cuban revolution has given the
 signal .  . . . It has drawn the line in the sand and introduced a process
 of polarization of the forces:  the exploiters on one side of the line,
 the exploited on the other."36  He further assumed that this polarization
 process would become more strongly accentuated with the continuing radical-
 ization of the Cuban revolution. Neutrality would, of necessity, become
 the exception, and the contrary positions of the bourgeoisie and the work-
 ing class would become more clearly defined.  Finally, the polarization of
 the antagonistic forces would explode in a global conflict.
 Revolution Without, Bourgeoisie.   Che Guevara was convinced of the
 fact that, because of the polarization which had occurred, one must no
 longer expect the participation of wide strata  of the middle class and
 the lower middle class in the revolution.   Even though he thought that
 there existed contradictions "between the national bourgeoisie and imper-
 ialism, these bourgeoisieshave shown that they fear the people's revolu-
 tion more than the suffering of imperialist suppression .  .  .1137  For
 this reason, the majority of them have allied themselves with "imperial-
 ism" and openly resist the revolutionary efforts of the masses.   Hence,
 the possibility of the participation of the Latin American middle classes
 in the revolutionary struggle, as it was postulated by the declaration
 of the 81 Communist parties (Moscow, 1960), was decidedly denied by Che
 Guevara.  Also, he thought that the tactics successfully employed by
 Castro to disguise his movement by giving it an exclusively anti-dicta-
 torial and even slightly anti-Communist appearance before the seizure of
 power, could not be repeated.   Today, such a disguise would be illusory
 and damaging.   Hence, the struggle for liberation would have to be carried
 on in the name of Marxism-Leninism in Latin America and would have to
 openly pursue the goal of the "realization of the socialist revolution."38
 He thought it absolutely necessary that it identify itself with the Cuban
 revolution.   Guevara reasoned that with the "victory over imperialism"
 and over local reactionary forces in Latin America, too, the first stage
 of the socialist revolution would be attained ".  .  . Then the people
 could begin with building up social ism."s9
 The Continental Character of the Struggle.  Due to its tactics
 during the period of the uprising, the  Cuban  revolution did not Leconte an
 object of global conflict between the US and the Soviet Union, prior to
 its triumph but attained its victory, in a way, "isolated" from other
 world affairs.  Guevara considered a repetition of this happy state of
 affairs impossible in Latin America.   ,c was certain that now the US
 would leave nothing undone in order to give not only political but also
 military support to the ruling oligarchies.   hence, military intervention
 by the US and by the reactionary neighboring states would make the success
 of the revolution in each country much more difficult to attain.   He
 thought that from this arises the necessity to reply "to the unification
 of the forces of suppression with the unification of the forces of the
 people."40  Consequently, Che Guevara conceived of "The organization of 41
 a continental fighting front against imperialism and its local allies.
 This idea was realized in the OLAS and probably also in a kind of strategic
 supreme  command of the guerrilla movements.

 Thus, on a number of significant questions, Che Guevara admitted
 the exceptional position of the Cuban revolution.  However, he did not
 conclude from this that a repetition of this revolution would therefore
 be impossible on the continent,but that it would just be much more diffi-
 cult and could take much longer.  For example, in Bolivia, Guevara is
 said to have expected the fight to take about ten to twenty years.42  His
 basic conception of the correctness of an armed struggle in Latin America
 was not diminished by this but rather strengthened.
 3.  The Guerrilla as the Military Arm in the Struggle for Liberation
 For Che Guevara,guerrilla war was the primary military instrument
 of the revolutionary movement.   Hence, he attributed decisive significance
 to the tactics of guerrilla warfare.   P4nat were his relevant fundamental
 ideas?
 Phases of Development of the Guerrilla.   Guevara wrote that after
 the selection of the area of operations, a guerrilla war would generally
 run through three stages.43  In the first stage, that of strategic defense,
 he thought it was the principal task of the guerrillas to get to know the
 terrain, to carry out limited attacks, and above all to prevent their own
 destruction.44  In this stage, during which also      contact with the popu-
 lation and future strongholds would have to be built up, there would be
 "three conditions for the survival of the guerrillas: constant i:obility,
 constant vigilance and constant distrust."4a  As soon as the guerrillas
 had overcome their relative tactical inferiority, had grown in numbers
 and had established a solid stronghold in an area in which the army would
 no longer dare to attack, the guerrilla war would eater its second phase.
 During this, the guerrillas would resort to over more powerful strikes,
 would force the opposition forces into the defensive and would enlarge
 the liberated zone.  The third and last phase would be introduced with
 bringing out the guerrillas, now organized in strong units, and would
 lead to the occupation of the large cities and to the total destruction
 of the enemy.46
 Fighting Tactics of the Guerrillas.   Like Mao 'i'se-tun;, Che Guevara
 saw the basic problem of a weak guerrilla group as opposed to a powerful
 regular army in the followin  tactic: "I;, view of the general superiority
 of the enemy, we must find the tactical way of attaining relative superiority
 at a selected point."47  By the concentration of superior forces or the
 use of the terrain, the correlation of the forces would have to be shifted
 and superiority of one's own forces would have to be created.   Under no
 circumstances should a struggle be entered into "which does not bring
 victory as long as one is able to determine 'how' and 'when' ."4S  Guevara
 ascribed decisive significance above all to the element of surprise and to
 the speed with which the guerrillas hit the enemy, where he assigns an
 important role to night attacks, fast retreats and evasion movements.   On
 the other hand, he scorned the idea of guerrilla war as "passive self-
 defense" of a certain area, without regard to the rest of the country.49
 Such a tactic would necessarily lead to the localization, surrounding and
 destruction of the guerrilla.   Even in the beginning stage, the guerrillas

 CPYRGHT
 should "constantly develop their capacity to attack the enemy."    n y  y
 consistently using the Vietnamese principle of "armed propaganda," i.e.
 of the demonstration of their military strength and invincibility, Che
 Guevara believed, can they win the population to their side and thus
 serve as catalist  of the popular forces.50
 Disturbance  of the Existing Balance.  The tendency toward institu-
 tionalism in the countries of Latin America was evaluated by Che Guevara
 as being unfavorable to the development of a guerrilla war.  But even more
 he was afraid that the ruling classes, "who assume the appearance of
 democratically-elected representatives of the people," could succeed in
 blunting the class struggle by economic    and social concessions and in
 averting the social explosion.   hence, he demanded that it must be the
 task K the guerrilla to prevent this backward development.   he wrote,
 "It is necessary to disturb by force the balance between the oligarchic
 dictatorship and the pressure of the masses."  "The dictatorship tries
 to maintain itself without use of force"; hence, it would be necessary
 "to force them to show themselves without disguise, in their true form
 as a violent dictatorship of the reactionary classes; this would .  .  .
 intensify the struggle to such an extent that it is no longer possible
 to withdraw."51  The guerrilla actions would force the democratic regimes
 to rid themselves of their pseudo-legality and to use terror against the
 guerrillas and their allies in the cities and in the country.   I-;ence, he
 thought the main concern was to press on with the progressive radicaliza-
 tion of the revolutionary process.
 Vietnam as Example.   By using the guerrilla war, he not only
 wanted to force the downfall of the prevailing orders in Latin America,
 but also wanted to level a ruinous attack against the "imperialism of
 the US."     For this reason, Guevara demanded the simuit4neous develop-
 ment of guerrilla movements in several Latin American countries.   Each
 was supposed to try to transform itself as fast as possible into an
 invincible people's army and thus force the US to secure the stability
 of the government, whose armed forces would collapse under the guerrilla
 attacks, by sending its own regular troops.52  Guevara reasoned that with
 this the tactical aim, "to lure the enemy from his nctural environment
 and to force him to fight in regions whore his living habits will collide
 with the existing realities," was attained.  The  cost in privations,
 victims and repeated defeats in the end would wear down the US soldiers
 and would bring about the class struggle in the US itself.   Thus, for Che
 Guevara, the road for Latin America to take was that or Vietnam.
 4.  The Guerrillas as Political Center in the Struggle for Liberation
 In addition to their decisive military function, the guerrillas,
 according to Che Guevara, also have significant political tasks which are
 designed to increase their revolutionary resonance  and striking power.
 The Guerrilla as Propagandist and Social Reformer.   "The guerrillas
 are the fighting vanguard of the people."  According to Guevara, this
 axiomatic necessity requires of the guerrillas that they create political

 Sanitized - Approved For Relealie : CIA-RDP75-00149R000300330001-5
 CPYRGHT
 conditions which are necessary for establishing revolutionary power.53
 Thus, it is the important task of the guerrillas to convince the local
 rural population of the justice and necessity of the armed struggle.   In
 this, however, neither proclamations to the people nor personal dialogue
 are sufficient.  The important point is to demonstrate the humanitarian
 goals of the guerrillas, to help the peasants "technically, economically,
 morally and culturally,"54 in other words, to demonstrate with actions to
 the population the moral superiority of the guerrillas    over the regular
 soldiers.55  As an example, Guevara mentions the execution of agrarian
 reform in the liberated areas as it was carried out by Castro in the
 Sierra Maestra of Cuba.   As a consequence of such measures, the land-
 hungry peasant population would take the side of the guerrillas and thus
 create the prerequisite for developing the guerrillas into a popular army
 and for extending and radicalizing the revolution.
 The Guerrilla as Political Leader of the Revolution.   however, Che
 Guevara took one more decisive step.   He demanded that the guerrillas are
 to be considered not only as the military but also as the political center
 of the national liberation movement.   Thus he remained true to the example
 of the   Cuban  revolution with respect  to  teis  point,  too,  in wn  ch  the
 military and political leadership had been with Fidel Castro's head-
 quarters.   Guevara argues that, on the one hand, "the back one of the
 political power of the movement remained unbroken, even when the revolu-
 tionary forces in the city suffered a defeat."56  On the other hand, the
 guerrilla activity could not be directed from the city without robbing
 it of its striking power and efficiency, os:)ecially if one would try to
 subordinate the actions of the guerrillas to the goals of political
 maneuvers in the urban areas.   For this reason, Guevara demands that both
 the political campaigns of the movement and the actions in the cities must
 be subordinated to the guerrilla war as the fundamental fighting method.
 Even in countries in which there is a large urban preponderance, "the
 political center of the struggle must therefore be developed in the
 country."  In addition to this, he also demanded that "the military and
 political leaders  .  .  ., as far as possible, should not be identical.i57
 With this, Che Guevara definitely opposed the thesis which had been used
 by the Communist party of Venezuela and also by the Communist party of
 Bolivia and which consisted of the argument that the guerrillas should
 only represent the armed branch of the revolutionary movement, while
 the political center of gravity should remain in the city in the hands
 of the party leadership.
 Challenge to the Leadership Role of the Orthodox Communist Parties.
 Guevara's conviction that the orthodox Communist parties of the continent
 had lost their "leadership role in the revolutionary and anti-imperialist
 struggle" was in back of his thesis of the central political role of the
 guerrillas.58  Guevara was strengthened in this conviction by the partly
 passive, partly negative attitude of the majority of the Latin American
 Communist parties toward the Cuban call for armed fighting in the Second
 Declaration of Havana (1962)  and by the almost unanimous condemnation of
 the course of guerrilla warfare recommended by Cuba and by the OLAS by
 all of these parties in recent times.59  As early as 1963 he wrote,

 "Nobody can claim the title of vanguard li::e a diploma handed out by a
 university.  To be the party of the vanguard means to lead the working
 class in its struggle for power, to guide it in its conquest of this
 power, and to show it the shortcuts available for this road."60  Guevara
 accused the traditional Communist parties of occupying themselves only
 with the forms of legal fighting.   In his opinion, they were striving only
 for alliance with other forces and, in this way, were indefinitely post-
 poning the seizure of power.  Ile thought that under present conditions
 the guerrillas were the only force which would consistently identify
 itself with the justified demands of the ,;asses for radical solutions.
 With this, Che Guevara denied the Communist parties of Latin
 America the moral right to lead the masses and he postulated instead
 that the future party, as in the case of Cuba, would have to grow out
 of the guerrilla  nucleus.  "The guerrilla is the germ of the party and
 not vice versa."61  In the same sense, Fidol Castro had attacked the
 "right-wing course" of the Communist parties of Latin America and had
 claimed for the guerrilla movements the loading political role in the
 continental fight for liberation.62   Thus, from the very beginning, there
 was hidden in Guevara's theses on the Latin American revolution the
 ambitious idea to Cafi into life, through the guerrillas, a new radical
 left front for the %Q%olet continent which would be independent of the
 existing Communist parties and which would take its direction from Havana.
 III.   Che Guevara on the "Building of Socialise,;"
 Che Guevara's ideas on the reconstruction of society in many ways
 put his personal stamp on the Cuban model of the "building of socialism.'
 Of course, he formulated nothing concrete on the question of institution-
 alizing the revolution.  Also, in the purely economic area he has left no
 original ideas; his theses on the priority of industrialization and on a
 strict centralism are today considered outdated even in Cuba.  Neverthe-
 less, Guevara has made a lasting contribution to the "development of the
 socialist order of society in Cuba, namely in the area of education and
 morals.
 1.   The Building of Socialism, the Individual, and Ethos
 The Aim of Communist Society.   Lice 'Marx, Guevara considered the
 dictatorship of the proletariat and the building of socialism     a pre-
 liminary stage in which the socialization of the means of production,
 the maximal development of tcchnology, and a just property distribution
 had to be secured so that later the classless society of Communism with
 its optimal satisfaction of demands could be realized.   3ut, for him,
 satisfying the material requirements was not the only and not even the
 most important concern.   Socialism and Communism meant more to him than
 the destruction of the capitalist   order and the creation of socialist
 conditions of production and distribution; they meant above all overcoming
 old ideas and replacing them by new ones.
 In addition to the development of technology, Che Guevara therefore
 considered it to be the principal task of the socialist state "to create

 the new man" who is poisoned "neither by the ideas
 of
 the
 19th century
 nor by those of our decadent .  .  . 20th century."
 "It
 is
 the ;:an of the
 21st century whom we have to create."63  Hence, it
 is
 not
 the function of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat to keep down
 t h
 e
 classes which
 have been deprived of power, but to call forth spiritual and moral change
 in the victorious masses and above all in the young.
 The Significance of the Revolutionary Consciousness.      selecting
 the correct instruments for the mc-lization of she masses, Che Guevara
 always came back to the model of the guerrillas who had aroused a readi-
 ness to make sacrifices and a figi. i; g enthusiasm in the people and,
 after the triumph, a growing devotion to the revolutionary cause.   l,e
 believes that only in this way was it possible to skip over certain stages
 and to realize the "transition to socialism in Cuba" within barely two
 years.64  Hence he demanded that   it  be a postulate that "to find a  ormula
 which will perpetuate this heroic attitude in the  daily  work, be one of
 our most important tasks from the ideological point of view."~,5  however,
 in his opinion, this formula could in no way consist of ways c.:ld cleans
 which were a legacy of capitalism and in using  the,.; one would get into
 a "blind alley without escape" and "open the door to revisionism."     Only
 by moral means would the state be able to prevent that the adult genera-
 tions, who, for a large part, are affected with the reprehensible remainders
 of yesterday, "become morally corrupt and infect the growing generation."66
 Hence, Che Guevara demanded that the instrument of mot lization of the masses
 must basically be of a moral character.
 Moral and Material Inducements.   Guevara called the material
 inducement a damaging anachronism and, therefore, rejected it in pri_:;c.pie
 as a lever for an accelerated develop,-,e-it.   He held teat '.  .  . _.: is a_
 remainder or the past;  in  the new  society  to be created  teere  will be no
 room for it .  .  .  ; it will be replaced by a ,::oral inducement,    co;,-
 sciousness of duty and the new revolutionary attitude.1167                                 He left r.o
 doubt that he considered the moral inducement to       been the su nort and
 t;ae,
 principal point of orientation of the Cuban revolu-ton.  At the same
 he  was  convinced  that  with  the  moral  inducements  he COUic., in  the   en ,
 achieve a faster development of the productive forces than with material
 ones.68   Che Guevara's idea of the budget  ina::ce system which he intro-
 duced and defended passionately also was based on this consideration.                               Che
 Guevara thought it superior to fire system of scld-financing and  as convinced
 of the fact that it was      closer to  the stage o"l               because it Was  not
 based on the capitalist   concepts of profitability,   sel- nterest, ann
 material inducements.  IIe saw the budge  Finance s;, ste, as an ii,; nortant
 instrument for the development of the revolutionary consciousness and
 believed strongly that, in the final analysis, it would prove to be
 superior to the  bonus       system and the principle of economic accounting
 even with regard to the increase of productivity.69  Finally, voluntary
 work played an important role in C:e Guevara's conception of the develop-
 ment of man under socialism and communism.

 socialism," Che Guevara demanded of the revolutionary elite to act as
 examples of their own ideas.   By being a living example, something which
 Guevara took very seriously, he also wanted to gain distance from those
 Communist parties into which had crept the abuse of power and a return to
 the life of the bourgeoisie.   lie considered this duty to be an example of
 historical calling and thus gave it the characteristics of a mystical self-
 sacrifice and a devotion to the revo.utio::1,%nich far exceeded the normal
 measure of devotion of the ;Marxist rationale. Even of the guerrilla
 fighter he had demanded that he be a "perfect ascetic ."70  Later he
 demanded of the revolutionary leaders that "in their daily dosag-e o
 human emotion" they must "not descend to the level  which   the ordinary
 human being shows them."71  Though he considered the elite to be the
 interpreters of the desires of the ;::asses, as executors of the ,,.?.;s of
 history, he still thought them, however, to be far above the -)co  0.7-2
 His unshakable belief in the inevitability of the predestined path caused
 him to admit that "all tasks of the revolutionary vanguard are at once
 magnificent and cause for anxiety.73  In a completely charis:rat c spirit,
 he announced that, "In order to be able to say that we are the ideal, that
 as a nation we are leading all of America, w e, the leaders, must pay a
 daily price .  .  . with our self-sacrifice."74  All of this reflects a
 Messianic mysticism which constitutes a part of the legacy of Che Cuevara
 which must not be underestimated.
 2.   Criticism of the bast : uronean Attitude
 Che Guevara's passionate appeal to the moral obligation o.~ the
 socialist state was directed above all to its relationship to ogler
 states, in particular to those of the underdeveloped w ;ord.
 Hein for the Third ;t'orid by the "Social ist Cou:;tries          com-
 plete dependence of Cuba on the assistance of the deve oped Communist
 countries prompted Guevara to examine this problem first.     In  doing
 this, he developed the idea that this aid -- contrary to that which the
 West grants -- must not be based on purely commercial interests but on
 the moral obligation unselfishly to help make it possible for  the
 developing countries to join the highly industrialized nations sec.-,.
 He blamed the East European, countries for getting themselves be guided
 by world market prices in their economic  'c1ations with the areas of
 the Third World, prices which are determined by the capitalist    natio..s
 and by the price gap between law materials and ;;;anu actured Toocds caused
 by  these -nations.    He  accused  them.  of  profiting by  this  situation,   "since
 they  generally    exhort  manufactured)   goods and  -r,-port raw materials  from
 the Third World."~5  From this, Guevara concluded that under those cond:g-
 tions there can be no question of "mutual profit," that such an
 exchan e
 could rather be said to be "immoral in nature," and that by it the Co;.i-
 munist nations would, in a way, even become "accomplices  i n
 imperialist exploitation."76  He claimed that  the  "socialist countries"
 have "the moral obligation to discontinue their silent conspiracy wits.
 the Western exploiting countries  .  .  .  . The development of the countries
 which are now on the road to liberation (should) cost the 'socialist
 states' something."77

 CPYRGHT
 Simultaneous Development o'              and Communis.,.   Guevara
 rejected, on principle, the thesis or tl .e development of socialism and
 Communism in two stages strictly separate:! in time.   On the national level,
 in Cuba, he saw possibilities of a certain parallel development of socialism
 and Communism, e.g. through socialist educational measures and Communist
 advancement of consciousness.   But, on an international love!, Cho Guevara
 definitely rejected the Soviet thesis that the realization o:i Communism
 would first occur in a single country.  To strive for absoliu-te satisfaction
 of all demands in a single country, e.g. the Soviet Union, at a time at
 which two-thirds of humanity still remain  in  the abyss of underdevelopment
 was for him -- as he once explained it to a group of his closest co-workers
 --  an "abject  amorality,"78 because,  first, this  country pursues  its  goal
 by way of discriminatory economic relations with the Third World and,
 secondly, because in this way the point at which the underdeveloped
 countries would be able to join the industrialized nations is being moved
 into an even more distant future.  Because of this point of view, which
 sounds like Maoism, Guevara rejected the concept of economic competition
 with the West as a long-range  overall  strategy.   in its place, he demanded
 massive help for the underdeveloped world as prerequisite for an accelerated
 "defeat of imperialism" and, when the time comes, a common and ;-.ore or less
 simultaneous development of the "socialist" and the underdeveloped countries
 toward Communism.
 IV.  Concluding Considerations
 One basic attitude which unequivocally characterizes his position
 within world Communism runs like a red thread throul~'-h all of C;e Guevara's
 ideology:   the fact that he opposed, on principle, the   hoscow-
 lining c o n c e p t s.  In all areas, whether it be the general strategy
 for the anti-imperialist    struggle, that of the fight for liberation ir.
 the underdeveloped world, or that for building the socialist society, his
 ideas depart from these concepts     on significant points.   In -.;:ace of
 peaceful coexistence, of the popular- front tactics, and the o;:._ sis on
 the satisfaction of material demands, he puts the militant anti-
 ism of the Third World, with the Communist countvies or without them,
 direct armed fighting for liberation and emphasis on the ;::oral development
 under   socialism and Communism.   This inadvertently calls to mind Mao
 Tse-tung's theses on cultural revolutio.., on _ ermanent popular struggle,
 and on the encirclement of the city by the country in a universal sense.
 In spite of this apparent relationship of the basic conceptions, it would
 be wrong to speak of an ideological dependence on Pehing by Cho Guevara.
 If Guevara sympathized much more with China than with the Soviet Union,
 then this is explained by the fact that he -- lino "two Tse-tung -- for,m.u-
 lated his Marxist theory exclusively fro;., the -poi-,t o  view of the prob-
 lems and the requirements of the Third         and  in  that respect Latin
 America has more  in  common with  China than with  Eastern  Europe.    hence,  it
 is correct to say that Castro-Marxism, of which Ghe Guevara was the most
 prominent ideologist, is basically a product of their own experience and
 of the Latin American realities.
 Thus, the significance of Che Guevara's ideas must be seen in the
 fact that they contributed theses for a new, essentially independent Latin

 American Marxism which renounced many of the formulas of the conventional
 Communist parties of the continent and took on the role of a rival in the
 revolutionary process.  Both, Che Guevara as well as Fidel Castro, have
 repeatedly and in recent years with increasing emphasis pointed out this
 original, independent character.79  It is not clear whether Che Guevara
 supported Fidel Castro's break with China early in 1966; but it is obvious
 that this pointed dispute was the logical consequence of Guevara's theses
 on the independence and the originality of the ideology of Cuban :,iarxism.
 The will toward independence of this new Marxism is not only expressed
 with regard to the Communist parties of Latin America and the so-called
 modern revisionism in general, but also with regard to Peking with the
 goal of establishing a third Communist center of force with Havana as the
 new Mecca.  Thus, in the final analysis, the significance of Che Guevara's
 ideas must also be seen in the fact that it exceeds by fax the concept
 of freedom of action and tactical independence of the individual Communist
 parties as given at the conference in Karlovy Vary, as well as Togliatti's
 polycentralism or the theory of the "unity of multiplicity."
 Especially with reference to the international solidarity of the
 liberation movement, Guevara's position was even further to the left than
 that of Fidel  Castro himself.   I'inile the latter acted with reservation
 during the crisis in the Dominican Republic in the spring of 1965 and
 thus, de facto, recognized the priority of the consolidation of socialism
 in Cuba, Che Guevara was, even with reference to Vietnam, definitely a
 champion of consistent use of the principle of proletarian international-
 ism, no matter what the consequences might be.
 Mysticism, Messianism, and belief in an elite gave Che Guevara's
 theories markedly romantic and idealistic characteristics and an emotional
 force which could not help but rouse, particularly, an impatient youth
 within and outside of Latin America.
 in this connection we can speak of an objective significance of
 the ideological legacy of Che Guevara.  And we can do this regardless of
 the fact that Che Guevara's theses as well as the prograAL-,iatic OLAS
 declarations80 which have largely incorporated these theses are almost
 uniformly rejected as voluntaristic and romantic left radicalism by the
 pro-Soviet Communist parties of Latin America and Europe.Sl
 After what has been said, the interesting question arises whether
 developments will pass over Che Guevara's legacy or whether his ideas
 will live on after his death, as he had prophesied, and will continue to
 be effective in Cuba and in the revolutionary liberation movement of the
 Third World.
 As far as Cuba is concerned, his main theses will certainly continue
 to be of significance.  His theses on the Latin American revolution have
 been incorporated into the declaration o  the OLAS conference organized
 by Havana.82   The fundamental role of moral inducements has repeatedly
 been stressed by Fidel Castro.  However, especially the latest deteriora-
 tion of     relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union must be evaluated

 as a triumph of Che Guevara's ideas.  The condemnation of the Soviet Union
 by Castro because of the re-establishment of diplomatic and economic rela-
 tions with the different countries of Latin America, his remarks about
 capitalist   tendencies in the Russian economic   system, the proceedings
 recently held in Havana against a so-called "micro-fraction" of pro-Soviet
 Communists, and the decision by Cuba not to take part in the Budapest
 conference are all an indication that today Che Guevara's fundamental
 conceptions with regard to Eastern Europe are reflected to a greater
 extent in Cuban domestic and foreign policies than they were even during
 his lifetime.83  Nor will this probably change in the foreseeable future.
 Compared to this, the survival of Chc Guevara's ideas on the Latin
 American continent must be considered doubtful.  Negative experiences with
 guerrilla warfare, up to now, in many places have brought about the point
 of view that many of his theses do not withstand an objective analysis of
 the present Latin American conditions.  The reproach that he stayed too
 closely with the Cuban model and that he did not sufficiently take into
 consideration the Latin American conditions is probably justified.   Both
 Guevara's theses on the willingness of the peasant population to join the
 guerrillas and on their capability to develop a broad revolutionary popular
 movement, as well as his conviction of the invincibility of the guerrillas
 can be subjected to this objection.  Beyond this, there arises the basic
 question whether, today, in Latin           even in the most backward
 countries, there even exist the objective conditions for an armed struggle
 for liberation and a guerrilla war.
 On the other hand, as is apparent from the latest reports, the
 economic and social progress in Latin America advances at an alar.iingly
 slow rate.84  In several important areas such as in agriculture there is
 stagnation or even a regressive tendency, while in the area of foreign
 economic aid the situation appears to be considerably less favorable than
 ten years ago.  Furthermore, the more favorable rates of growth are, in
 the long run, completely insufficient to stop the continual increase of
 the gap between Latin America and the highly industrialized nations,let
 alone    of decreasing it.  The difficulties which face even the most pro-
 gressive governments in Latin America in the enactment of even modest
 economic   reforms and social programs are well known.
 From these circunstances, iroportant conclusions may be drawn.
 After all, Guevara's basic conception rests on the assumption that a
 solution of the fundamental problems of Latin America is impossible by
 peaceful means, by way of the capitalist   economic order and of repre-
 sentative democracy, or with the help of the US.  As long as this thesis
 is not convincingly disproved by facts, above all by a general and lasting
 economic   improvement, Che Guevara's ideas will probably continue to
 find disciples in intellectual and student circles and among the discontented
 masses of Latin America.

 Summary
 CPYRGHT
 Because of the important role Chd Guevara played in the Cuban revolution and as the org siz-
 ing brain of armed revolt in Latin America, the author considers that his recent death in B livia
 marks an opportune moment for an analysis of his ideological heritage. The urgent nee  for
 such a study is felt to be underscored by the present challenge posed by the Havanna come lied
 OLAS to Latin American peaceful development and because of the growing rift between Ca tro's
 Cuba and the pro-soviet CP on the continent.
 As regards Che Guevara's global concepts concerning the anti-imperialist struggle, the at thor
 shows t    lie rejected the concept of peaceful coexistepice, considering it a betrayal o the
 liberation struggle fought in many parts of the word. Chu: Guevara interpreted the princi? c of
 international proletarian solidarity as an obligation to give more than just lip-service sit port
 to this struggle. In his "Message to the Tricontinental" in 1967 he even rebuked the by big
 communist powers for failing to make Vietnam their battle-ground at the proper time.   rom
 this the author concludes that Chd Guevara did not rule out the possibility of a nuclear con-
 flagration. The threat of war, he taught, should not deter the masses in the underdcvci pod
 countries from fighting for their liberation at any cost. To doom the stronghold of worn im-
 perialism, the United States, the country he called "a giant with clay feet", Chd Guevara )lea-
 (led for unity in the communist world     advocated a close and militant alliance betwee                                             the
 'communist nations and the progressive ceu:htries and liberation movements in Africa, Asi and
 Latin America. The author deals thereupon with the core of Chd Guevares heritage - his t Isis
 regarding the basic strategy and tactics of armed revolt and guerrilla warfare in Lati:1 Am ricer.
 He points out that one the ',hand Chd Guevara professed the Cuban revolution to be the exa, iple,
 because it had demonstrated a) that in many Latin American countries conditions were ripe
 for revolution, b) that armed struggle and the guerrilla liar method focussed on the cob try-
 side and based on peasant support rather than on the eLy movement, were the only c  reel
 solutions for seizing power. The author notes, however, that Cad Guevara admitted except oral

 repeat themselves on the continent. He held, above al,, that the rap:  transition to socialism
 of the Cuban revolution had produced a polarization o  forces in Latin America, aligning all
 reactionary forces and U. S. imperialism on one side and the pop uiar :masses oil the other.
 Neither the middle classes nor the United States could therefore be deceived and surprised
 again (as they had been in Cuba:); repressive measures would be severe from the outset and
 the struggle long and hard. Consequently, Chu Guevara ruled, revolutionary war in Latin
 America would have to be waged without the support of the bourgeoisie and on an openly
 anti-imperialist, Marxist and pro-Cuban label.
 Ch6 Guevara called for armed struggle on a continental scale to counteract the close military
 collaboration between the so-called Latin American                      and U. S. imperialism.
 Small guerrilla units, operating in a number of countries according to a coor ?mated strafe y
 and hit and run tactics were to sharpen existing contradiciiuns making the struggle more and
 more radical. Gradually they were to grow into large peasant armies, turning finally Latin
 America, as Chd Guevara put it, into the torch of a second or third Vietnam. Attention is also
 called to the fact that Chd Guevara did not consider the guerrilla only as the main military
 instrument, but as the political center of the whole revohut' nary movement as well. lie main-
 tained that the revolutionary party should grow out of the guerrilla and not 'ice versa. Most
 of these views, the author points out, are rejected by the orthodox CP of Latin America and

 The article goes on to discuss Chu Guevara's ideoluiieai contribution to the period of con-
 structing socialism in Cuba, noting that Chu Guevara the economist was less influential than
 Che Guevara the moralist. The author stresses his convicion that socialism as well as commu-
 p ?r',or man and explains thus,
