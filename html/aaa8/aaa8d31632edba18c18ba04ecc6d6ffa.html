 CASTRO ON COEXISTENCE, SOVIET AID, AND ARMY COUPS
 Castro's latest speech, touching on several themes
 prominent in recent Cuban statements, explicitly
 rejected Soviet moves toward "peaceful coexistence"
 as long as US "aggression" toward Cuba continues.
 REORGANIZATION OF CUBAN AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM
 The pattern of missile-site relocations and fighter
 redeployments suggests a shift from island-wide cov-
 erage to point defense of major installations before
 transferring the system to Cuban control.
 GRAIN SITUATION IN THE COMMUNIST WORLD
 Khrushchev has admitted publicly to the "rather
 difficult position" of the 1963 harvest.   It now
 seems certain that the USSR will buy--for cash--
 11 million tons of Western wheat in the next ten
 months.   Peiping will presumably need some five
 million tons.
 MOSCOW NAMES NEW MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF
 The appointment of a former deputy secret police
 chief to this position in the aftermath of the Pen-
 kovsky case probably signals a security crackdown
 which could lower morale and hamper Moscow's intel-
 ligence collection effort at least temporarily.
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS MAY BE APPROACHING  NEW CLIMAX
 There are growing indications that Soviet leaders,
 perhaps believing that Peiping's rejection of the
 test ban treaty has created a favorable opportunity,
 are considering convening a new international Commu-
 nist meeting.   The Chinese would certainly challenge
 the legitimacy of any conference which was organized
 along lines they could not accept.

 THE COMMUNIST WORLD (continued)
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS
 This year's 1 October celebrations--like the last
 three--avoided the boasts of military and economic
 strength which characterized the first ten.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADER VISITS NORTH KOREA
 Liu Shao-chi apparently failed, however,  in his
 attempts to embroil the Koreans more deeply in
 the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 The government continues its efforts to improve
 its image at home and abroad.   The level of Viet
 Cong activity has declined slightly from the 1963
 high recorded the previous week.
 COMMUNISTS INCREASING SUPPLY ACTIVITY IN LAOS
 Routes from North Vietnam are being reopened with
 the end of the rainy season, and this may presage
 a resumption of military pressure on neutralist and
 rightist forces.
 CHALLENGE TO BEN BELLA REGIME IN ALGERIA
 President Ben Bella seems to have sufficient assets
 to contain--though not to liquidate--the dissident
 movement in the Kabylie region, but the outbreak
 there may encourage manifestations of opposition
 to him in other areas.
 CONGO PRESIDENT DISMISSES PARLIAMENT
 The Adoula government evidently feared that oppo-
 sition factions might rouse new disorders against
 it and hopes now to wield firmer control over prep-
 arations for parliamentary elections next year.
 CYPRUS HEADING INTO NEW CONFLICTS
 The Greek and Turkish communities on the island
 are deadlocked over President Makarios' proposals
 to revise the constitution and eliminate British,
 Greek,  and Turkish guarantees.

 RESULTS OF RECENT EEC COUNCIL MEETING
 The Council's proposal for settling the poultry
 dispute with the US is inadequate, and dims hopes
 for the "Kennedy Round" of tariff talks.   Another
 Council move was intended to elicit Soviet recog-
 nition of the EEC as a trading unit.   The Council
 also discussed a proposed EEC-CSC-EURATOM merger.
 THE FRENCH NUCLEAR SUBMARINE PROGRAM
 Delays in the development of some components make
 it unlikely that France's first Polaris-type sub-
 marine can be deployed on station before 1971.
 THREATS TO ITALIAN ECONOMIC STABILITY
 The modest austerity program of the caretaker Leone
 government will probably be inadequate to stabilize
 the economic situation and could complicate Italy's
 already delicate political situation.

 GREECE PREPARES FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
 The appointment of a nonpolitical caretaker
 cabinet opens the way for the opposition's
 participation in the elections and should
 improve the general political atmosphere.
 FINLAND'S CABINET CRISIS DRAGS ON
 Efforts to resolve it still founder on the insist-
 ence by  President Kekkonen's Agrarian Party that
 representatives of one of two rival trade union
 federations be included in any new government.
 CONTINUED DOMINICAN POLITICAL INSTABILITY LIKELY
 The apparently well-intentioned efforts of the ci-
 vilian triumvirate installed after the military coup
 may be undermined by maneuvering and corruption on
 the part of certain politicians and military leaders.

 CASTRO ON COEXISTENCE, SOVIET AID, AND ARMY COUPS
 Fidel Castro's speech on
 28 September, marking the third
 anniversary of the formation of
 the Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution, touched on
 several themes prominent in re-
 cent Cuban public statements.
 On Cuba's attitude toward
 the nuclear test ban treaty and
 signs of lessening US-Soviet
 tensions, Castro was more direct
 and explicit than ever.   He said,
 in effect, that Cuba cannot go
 along with Soviet moves toward
 "peaceful coexistence" as long
 as the United States continues
 its policy of "aggression" to-
 ward Cuba.   He stated flatly
 that  "naturally we will not
 calmly accept a situation in
 which tensions decrease else-
 where while they increase for
 us.... We are glad when tensions
 relax, but we cannot consider
 ourselves at peace with an im-
 perialism that triep to strangle
 us more and more.... This situa-
 tion will determine our policy
 in the international arena, in
 the United Nations and every-
 where.   It will determine our
 stand on the nuclear pact and
 toward the proposals on denu-
 clearization."
 Castro then emphasized
 that Cuba "has its own stand"
 which is dictated by its posi-
 tion in the "anti-imperialist
 struggle" and which, moreover,
 derives from the unique origins
 of the Cuban revolution and the
 place it has in history. Here,
 Castro seems to be telling the
 Soviet Union that Cuban policy
 is independent and cannot be
 subject to Moscow's dictates.
 Later in the speech, Castro
 warned the Cuban people that
 they must not become accustomed
 to Soviet economic assistance
 and must make every effort to
 pay off its trade debt to the
 USSR.
 In another portion of
 the speech, Castro stated that
 the news of the Latin American
 revolutionary struggle is "more
 encouraging every day." Refer-
 ring to the recent coup in the
 Dominican Republic, he declared
 that this demonstrates once
 again that "there is only one
 way, only one remedy"--the La-
 tin American military class
 must be liquidated and its
 principal leaders executed.

 25X1
 A major reorganization of
 the air defense system is in
 progress in Cuba.
 eight of the 24 sur-
 ace-to-a r missile (SAM) sites
 have been evacuated, including
 one entire SAM regiment of four
 sites and a support area in cen-
 tral Cuba.  To date, four of
 the sites have been re-estab-
 lished at other locations.
 The pattern of relocations
 indicates a shift from an is-
 land-wide SAM coverage to point
 defense of major cities and in-
 stallations--in anticipation of
 on-site training of Cubans in
 SAM sites may be reduced in the
 reorganization process and some
 SAM equipment withdrawn from
 the island.
 MIG-21s have been de-
 ployed from the San Antonio
 de los Banos training base to
 three other airfields for the
 first time since March.   At
 the same time, MIG-15 fighters
 have been deployed to San Julian.
 While it is too early to deter-
 mine whether these transfers
 are permanent, the deployments
 may be related to the over-all      25X1
 reorganization of the air defense
 system prior to transferring the
 system to Cuban control.

 Khrushchev now has admitted
 publicly that the 1963 harvest
 is in a "rather difficult posi-
 tion" because of unfavorable
 weather.   This appears to be
 a gross understatement.   Total
 grain production may be signifi-
 cantly smaller than the medi-
 ocre 1962 crop and the wheat
 harvest may be especially bad--
 down to an estimated 44 million
 tons compared with last year's
 estimated production of 57 mil-
 lion tons.   The Soviets need at
 least 50 million tons of wheat
 for domestic use and are committed
 to export--mainly to the Euro-
 pean satellites--4 to 5 million
 tons.
 Lagging production stems,
 in part, from difficulties in
 the New Lands, which the USSR
 has come to count on for more
 than a fourth of the total grain
 harvest.   Production there
 slipped badly again this year
 because of the weather, and
 serious problems of a more perma-
 nent  nature may be developing.
 Local newspapers are pointing
 to a mounting problem of wind
 erosion of the soil--one arti-
 cle called it "national dis-
 aster."  Western analysts have
 long pointed out that the con-
 tinuous cropping of such mar-'
 ginal land without offsetting
 conservation measures could lead
 to serious erosion and possibly
 even dust bowl conditions remi-
 niscent of the US during the
 1930s.   Adequate conservation
 practices would take large
 amounts of land out of culti-
 vation, but without them a
 dust bowl is a growing possi-
 bility.
 In either case the regime
 is faced with the necessity of
 raising land productivity
 throughout the country.   This
 probably accounts, in part,
 for Khrushchev's present emphasis
 on rapidly increasing fertil-
 izer production and introducing
 irrigation on a large scale.
 Grain conservation is
 now the keynote in the Soviet
 Union. The laws against feeding
 bread and flour to animals are
 being strictly enforced, and res-
 taurants are no longer per-
 mitted to give free bread with
 meals; a kind of informal ra-
 tioning  is being practiced
 in the stores, which are fre-
 quently out of bread and flour.
 It now seems likely that
 the USSR will import at least
 11 million tons of Western
 wheat in the next ten months.
 Although the largest single
 contract, with Canada, allows
 for credit, Moscow apparently
 intends to pay cash for the
 lot--almost $800 million,
 including freight charges.

 The Communist World
 MOSCOW NAMES NEW MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF
 As a result of the Pen-
 kovsky spy case and other re-
 cent setbacks for the Soviet
 military intelligence service
 (GRU), the Kremlin has assigned
 Colonel. General Petr Ivashutin
 as GRU chief.  He replaces Gen-
 eral Ivan Serov, who has re-
 portedly been demoted and as-
 signed to a relatively unim-
 portant army command in Central
 Asia.
 For at least 20 years, Iva-
 shutin has been a high-ranking
 official of the secret police
 (KGB) directorate for "counter-
 intelligence in the armed for-
 ces," a euphenism for the war-
 time SMERSH ("death of spies")
 organization.   Now also known
 as the Third Directorate of the
 KGB, the unit has always acted
 as the regime's watchdog over
 the loyalty of the military.
 Ivashutin headed this direc-
 torate from 1953 to 1958 and
 supervised its work during
 his subsequent five years as
 first deputy chairman of the KGB.
 Ivashutin's new appointment
 suggests that he is being brought
 in to conduct a security crack-
 down which could temporarily
 hamper Moscow's military intel-
 ligence collection effort.  This
 sign of Kremlin distrust is
 likely to lower both the morale
 and the efficiency of GRU offi-
 cers, particularly those who
 regularly deal with foreigners.
 At least in the GRU, and
 perhaps elsewhere in the De-
 fense Ministry, the appointment
 could also increase the tradi-
 tional antagonism of the military
 toward the civilian secret police.
 Ivashutin is reported to be
 callous, overbearing, and con-
 ceited--traits which are likely
 to sharpen military resentment
 of the KGB's authority to keep
 all levels of the armed forces
 under surveillance.
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS MAY BE APPROACHING NEW CLIMAX
 There are growing indica-
 tions that Soviet leaders are
 considering convening a new
 international Communist meeting.
 They may believe that Peiping's
 rejection of the nuclear test
 ban treaty has created a favor-
 able opportunity for exploiting
 this forum to further discredit
 and isolate the Chinese.
 Publication by Pravda
 during the past week o  appeals
 by three small Western Communist
 parties for such a meeting--
 last convened in 1960--suggests
 that Moscow will attempt to
 rally a great majority of for-
 eign parties in condemning
 Chinese dogmatism, "splitting
 activities," and attacks on
 the Soviet leadershi .
 Such a conference could
 take place in connection with
 the 7 November anniversary of
 the Bolshevik revolution, when

 delegations from almost all
 Communist parties customarily
 gather in Moscow.   Khrushchev's
 tactics would probably center
 on demands for a cessation of
 open polemics, a ban on inter-
 ference in the affairs of other
 parties, and a revision of the
 1960 Moscow statement which
 would label dogmatism rather
 than "revisionism" the "main
 danger" to the Communist move-
 ment.   Moscow's interest in
 asserting these points has
 been foreshadowed in a Para-
 guayan party statement published
 in Pravda on 30 September, in
 a speech by Poland's leader
 Gomulka, and in other documents
 and statements.
 Hints that Moscow now
 favors a new conference--a
 departure from its previous
 reluctance to give the Chinese
 another forum for vilification--
 may be designed to pre-empt a
 Chinese initiative to convene
 an international meeting in
 Peiping,
 A Soviet decision to pro-
 ceed with a meeting organized
 along lines which the Chinese
 could not accept would indi-
 cate that Moscow is deliberately
 seeking to provoke the Chinese
 into some action which the USSR
 could represent as Peiping's
 formal voluntary separation
 from the Communist movement.
 The Chinese would certainly
 call into question the legiti-
 macy of such a Soviet-spon-
 sored conference and might
 convene a rival meeting of
 their followers in answer.
 Peiping in fact appears
 to be challenging the Soviets
 to undertake some decisive
 action which could then be
 turned against them.   The
 third installment--published
 25 September--of China's
 answer to the 14 July Soviet
 letter expresses an unre-
 strained abomination for
 Khrushchev as a traitor and
 renegade, and Peiping's prom-
 ise of more in this series can
 only mean that more scurrilous
 language will be used to
 blacken the Soviet leadership.
 For months a major portion
 of the main Soviet press and
 almost all of China's news
 output have been devoted to
 the exchange of progressively
 more serious charges.F
 In this
 charged atmosphere some new
 climax appears to be building
 up and a possible international
 Communist meeting might pro-
 vide the occasion for it.

 For the fourth consecutive
 year, Communist China's National
 Day celebrations on 1 October
 avoided the boasts of military and
 economic strength which character-
 ized the first ten anniversaries.
 The Chinese were instead defen-
 sive about both domestic and for-
 eign policies and cautious about
 economic progress and prospects.
 Chou En-lai tried to maintain
 an optimistic tone by claiming that
 there has been a "trend of general
 improvement" in the economy since
 the disaster years of 1959-61. How-
 ever, he made no comparison between
 1963 and 1962.  Other propaganda
 claims of increases in selected
 sectors of the economy suggest that
 agricultural and industrial out-
 put has risen only slightly during
 1963.
 Chou promised only that China
 would eventually overcome its many
 difficulties.  He made the expected
 assertion that China intends to go
 it alone, while defensively insist-
 ing that it has many:.friends and is
 not, as the Soviets charge, isolated.

 Liu Shao-chi's visit to North
 Korea from 15 to 27 September was
 a new Chinese Communist effort to
 tighten political, military, and
 economic ties between the two re-
 gimes.  He apparently failed, how-
 ever, in his attempts to embroil
 the Koreans more deeply in the Sino-
 Soviet struggle.
 The communiqud issued on  Liu's
 departure stressed the identity of
 current political views between Pei-
 ping and  Pyongyang, specifically
 including "major questions which
 have arisen in the international
 Communist movement."  Nevertheless,
 it was a surprisingly brief document,
 and avoided any elaboration of the
 points of Sino-Korean political
 affinity.
 Pyongyang has always been care-
 ful to make clear that its espousal
 of Chinese-favored positions springs
 from its own analysis of what is
 best for Communist interests.  For
 this reason, Pyongyang may have
 been chary of again officially join-
 ing Peiping in a substantive commu-
 niqud on the dispute so soon after
 the strongly anti-Soviet communiqud
 issued following the June visit of
 Korean President Choe Yong-kon to
 China.
 Liu's trip was ostensibly to
 return that visit.  However, the
 presence of high-ranking military
 and ideological personnel in Liu's
 party and of the Chinese minister of
 foreign trade in Pyongyang the week
 before Liu's arrival suggests that
 major substantive matters were on
 the agenda.

 Peiping may have offered new

 SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 SECRET
 The Diem government is making
 efforts to redress its image both
 within and outside South Vietnam and
 to portray itself as firmly in con-
 trol.   While the National Assembly
 elections on 27 September provided
 no true gauge of the government's
 support, they were conducted with
 a minimum of Viet Cong harassment
 and, seemingly, with heavy voter
 participation.
 President Diem's scheduled ad-
 dress to the opening of the new as-
 sembly on 7 October may provide a
 further test of his' willingness to
 carry out his promises to the Bud-
 dhists. He may use the occasion to
 urge swift removal--which he has
 said must be an assembly act--of
 a long-standing ordinance which
 discriminates against Buddhist
 organizations.   Diem made a rela-
 tively moderate radiobroadcast on
 28 September, urging the country
 to get on with pressing'tasks in
 the "interest of the entire nation,
 not the selfish interests of a
 group or minority."
 The level of Viet Cong activity
 declined slightly last week from
 the 1963 high recorded the previous
 week.   The number of larger scale
 Viet Cong attacks in September--3
 of battalion and. 17 of company size
 --was the greatest for any month
 since June 1962.   While most of this
 action occurred in the delta prov-
 inces, the northern part of the coun-
 try also suffered an increased        25X1
 number of attacks, aimed partly
 at securing rice from the fall
 harvest.
 COMMUNISTS INCREASING SUPPLY ACTIVITY IN LAOS
 With the advent of the dry sea-
 son, Communists forces have resumed
 large-scale convoy operations into
 Laos along the recently reopened
 Route 7.                            indi-
 cate a substantial infusion of
 troops and supplies during the
 past two weeks.   Pathet Lao forces
 in the Plaine des Jarres area were
 short of supplies. during the mon-
 soon period, particularly since earl
 August when Meo guerrilla units
 sabotaged the supply route with
 explosives.
 Renewed convoy activity has
 also been reported in south-
 central Laos along Route 12, an-
 other key resupply route leading
 from the North Vietnamese border
 to the Nhommarath-Mahaxay area.
 These movements may presage
 a step-up in Communist military
 pressure against right-wing and
 neutralist forces deployed in for-
 ward positions.   Recent maneuvers
 by the Pathet Lao to improve its
 political position proved fruit-
 less.
 While neutralist and right-
 wing forces appear fairly well dug
 in on the western edge of the
 Plaine des Jarres, non-Communist
 forces near Route 8 in the Nhommarath
 region are disorganized and would
 probably be unable to hold out   -
 against even moderate enemy pres-
 sures.
 Premier Souvanna, following his
 recent'address to the UN General As-
 sembly and talks with Presidents
 Kennedy and De Gaulle,.plans visits to
 Britain and the USSR--coguarantors of
 the Geneva agreements on Laos--be-
 fore returning to Vientiane later
 this month.   Souvanna's neutralist
 military chief, Kong Le, is also     25X1
 scheduled to return to Laos this
 month following a two-month stay
 in the Soviet Union.

 CHALLENGE TO BEN BELLA REGIME IN ALGERIA
 Ahmed Ben Bella, who on
 20 September began a five-year
 term as Algeria's first Presi-
 dent, is faced with the most
 direct challenge to his authori-
 tarian control since he bested
 his opponents in the struggle
 for power last year.   He seems
 to have sufficient military and
 police strength to contain the
 Berber dissidents who staged a
 public rally in Tizi Ouzou on
 29 September to demand the
 formation of a new Algerian
 government.   However, the
 boldness of the Berbers' action
 could encourage manifestations
 of opposition to Ben Bella in
 other chronically depressed
 areas.
 The rally was attended by
 some 4,000 Berbers of the Kabylie
 region and apparently was or-
 ganized by Hocine Ait Ahmed,
 one of the original leaders of
 the Algerian rebellion and long
 a fellow prisoner with Ben Bella.
 Ait Ahmed broke with him in 1962
 and now wants to re-establish
 the collegial leadership that
 prevailed in the rebel movement
 before its victory.
 Ait Ahmed is backed by Col.
 Mohand ou el Hadj, whom Ben
 Bella has relieved of command
 of the Seventh Military Region,
 of which Tizi Ouzou is the
 center.   He may also have the
 backing of Belkacem Krim,
 also a Berber and another of
 the original rebel leaders.
 Krim's recent arrival in Morocco
 probably inspired Ben Bella's
 charge that the Moroccans are
 supporting the Berbers by cre-
 ating incidents along Algeria's
 western border.
 Ou el Hadj's immediate
 subordinates support Ben Bella.
 The colonel, however, has
 rallied a reported 3,000 of
 his former troops--nearly the
 full complement of his command,
 which was organized in nine
 infantry battalions armed with
 artillery and heavy mortars.
 Most of the,men in these forces
 were local guerrillas whom Ou
 el Hadj commanded during the
 seven-year rebellion.   They
 are believed to be fit, alert,
 and more effective than the
 average Algerian soldier. They
 could defend the mountainous "
 Kabylie indefinitely but would
 be incapable of advancing on
 Algiers.
 Ou el Hadj may have allied
 himself with Ait Ahmed in re-
 action to recent command
 changes imposed by Algiers.
 Some subordinate officers were
 transferred and a number of
 ex-guerrilla companies were
 replaced by Algerian Army regu-
 lars in an attempt to bring
 the Seventh Military Region
 more under Algiers' control
 and to reduce Ou el Hadj's
 independence of action.   The
 government is using similar
 tactics in other areas where
 loyalty is doubtful, and it
 may face similar reactions
 if its action is not rapid
 and effective.

 The dispute between the
 Congo's government and parlia-
 ment over the latter's refusal
 to restrict itself to constitu-
 tion making ended abruptly on
 29 September when President Kasa-
 vubu prorogued the legislature.
 He charged the deputies and sena-
 tors with "default" of their
 responsibilities and said a spe-
 cial constitutional commission,
 from which they would be excluded,
 would be named to draft the con-
 stitution.   The decision was
 made by Kasavubu, Premier Adoula,
 and army chief General Mobutu,
 and was carried out smoothly.
 Adoula and Mobutu appear
 confident they can make the move
 stick, and they seem determined
 to deal vigorously with any at-
 tempts by the opposition to in-
 cite new disorders.   Adoula told
 Ambassador Gullion that he had
 lost patience because parliament
 had spent its time trying to at-
 tack the government, incite in-
 surrection, and mount intrigues.
 He said he would cut parliamen-
 tary salaries to "subsistence"
 and would govern by decree until
 the constitution was promulgated;
 elections would follow "immedi-
 ately" after a constitutional
 referendum.
 One immediate reason for
 the move appears to have been
 recent antigovernment activity
 by the Lumumbist and Gizengist
 factions.   In mid-September,
 the government uncovered a plot
 to free leftist Antoine Gizenga
 from his island prison of Bou-
 labemba, where he has been since
 January 1962.   Gizenga's former
 representative in Cairo, Pierre
 Mulele, reappeared in the Congo
 in mid-September to organize
 the plot.   On 25 to 27 Septem-
 ber, Lumumbist and Gizengist
 party leaders staged  "free
 Gizenga" demonstrations in Leo-
 poldville, alleging that Gi-
 zenga was seriously ill or dead.
 Gizenga reportedly had been on
 a partial hunger strike since
 17 September; he was found to
 be in satisfactory condition by
 a team of doctors on 24 Septem-
 ber and is said to have resumed
 eating.
 The government may also
 have believed that this was a
 propitious time to crack down
 on the opposition.   Besides
 constitution building, it is
 looking ahead to parliamentary
 elections next year.   Both pro-
 and anti-Adoula forces are
 endeavoring to build "national"
 parties out of the profusion
 of factions, and the present
 leadership is particularly ea-
 ger to keep a tight hold on
 the government apparatus during
 this period.

 CYPRUS HEADING INTO NEW CONFLICTS
 There is growing danger
 that Greek and Turkish Cypriots
 will again turn to violence in
 their chronic communal disputes.
 Leaders of both communities
 openly admit that they expect
 armed clashed "sooner or later.
 the American ambassador of his
 extreme pessimism over the pos-
 sibility of any agreement be-
 tween himself and Makarios.   He
 warns that if the Greek Cyp-
 riots   attempt a unilateral
 revision of the constitution,
 the result will be ignored by
 his community.   Turkish Cypriot
 leaders view the present docu-
 ment as their best guarantee
 against eventual Greek domina-
 tion.   Kuchuk, for the first
 time since 1958, has privately
 voiced the opinion that the only
 answer to the present impasse
 may be either to partition the
 island or to exchange popula-
 tions--the Turkish Cypriots in
 Cyprus for the Greeks still
 resident in Turkey.
 President Makarios con-
 tinues to call for revision of
 the Cypriot constitution, abro-
 gation of a treaty with Britain,
 Turkey, and Greece, and removal
 of Greek and Turkish troops sta-
 tioned on Cyprus at the time of
 independence.   He terms "harm-
 ful" or "unworkable" consti-
 tutional provisions which grant
 to the Turkish minority the
 right to veto certain legisla-
 tion, to have its own munici-
 pal governments, and to hold a
 specific proportion of civil
 service jobs.
 Makarios wants to change a
 treaty calling for the Turkish
 and Greek troops and to abrogate
 outright one permitting Greece,
 Turkey, and Britain to intervene
 jointly or unilaterally to
 prevent violation of the 1959
 agreements. These provisions
 Makarios now calls an "unaccept-
 able infringement of sovereignty."
 Should he be rebuffed by Ankara,
 Athens, and London in his effort
 to alter the settlement, as he
 probably will be, he has indi-
 cated that he will act unilater-
 ally.
 Vice President Kuchuk, a
 Turkish Cypriot, recently told
 The large and well-organized
 Communist party (AKEL), mean-

 Greek frustrations, Turkish
 fears, and the probable develop-
 ment of a controversy among
 three NATO partners.   While
 Makarios maintains cordial
 relations with AKEL, some other
 Greek Cypriot leaders are becom-
 ing concerned by recent Communist
 gains.   As long as the communal
 dispute remains the major issue
 on Cyprus, however, it appears
 unlikely that any anti-Com-
 munist campaign will be likely
 to generate much interest or
 support among Greek Cypriots.

 RESULTS OF RECENT EEC COUNCIL MEETING
 At its 23-26 September
 meeting, the Common Market
 Council of Ministers took up
 a number of long-standing is-
 sues, including the poultry dis-
 pute with the US, relations
 with the USSR, and the proposed
 merger of the EEC with EURATOM
 and the Coal-Steel Community
 (CSC).
 By offering a reduction of
 only 1.3 cents per pound in the
 poultry levy--and this condition-
 al on US relinquishment of fur-
 ther negotiating rights--the
 council dimmed hopes for any
 early settlement of this issue.
 The US had previously made it
 clear that even an uncondition-
 al reduction of this size would
 be unacceptable.   Although EEC
 spokesmen have since urged the
 US to participate in further
 bilateral talks, they have in
 fact held out little prospect
 that a compromise can be reached,
 Nor have they  been respon-
 sive to US proposals that GATT
 be asked to pronounce on the
 size of any "compensatory with-
 drawal" of tariff concessions
 the US would be justified in
 making.
 EEC Commission officials
 continue to express grave con-
 cern over the "political ef-
 fects" of the poultry dispute
 on US-EEC relations, particular-
 ly with reference to the forth-
 coming "Kennedy Round" of tariff
 talks.   Although the EEC appears
 to be slowly approaching a
 single position on how tariffs
 on industrial items should be
 reduced, no such agreement on
 agricultural trade is in sight.
 As for EEC-USSR relations,
 the Council,decided to offer
 Moscow Community-wide tariff
 concessions on three export
 items of some importance to the
 USSR.   In return, the EEC re-
 quested Soviet abandonment of
 past claims for most-favored-
 nation treatment from EEC
 members individually and--in
 effect--tacit recognition of
 the Community as a trading unit.
 There is considerable doubt
 that the USSR will accept the
 offer--which, in the opinion
 of some EEC officials, would be
 a step toward,  the Community's
 adoption of a common commercial
 policy toward the bloc, perhaps
 leading ultimately to a single
 trade agreement between the EEC
 and the USSR.
 The Council also called
 for a report by the end of 1963
 on proposals for a fusion of
 the executives and the councils
 of EEC, CSC, and EURATOM.   This
 report in itself will be only
 one of the preliminaries to
 moves toward future merger of the
 three communities, but Community
 sources believe it will lead to
 some useful rationalization of
 the Community institutional
 structure in the meantime.
 The question of bringing all
 the Community institutions into
 a si"gle European "capital" is
 still a very delicate one, and
 any thoroughgoing merger would
 reopen  the three Community
 treaties to amendments--including
 those designed to trim away
 supranational powers.

 THE FRENCH NUCLEAR SUBMARINE PROGRAM
 The French Navy continues
 to  give highest priority to
 the design and construction of
 a nuclear-powered, Polaris-
 type submarine, a project ab-
 sorbing over half of the Navy's
 1963-64 research and develop-
 ment funds.   Despite public
 claims that the first submarine
 will be available  in 1969 or
 before, delays in the develop-
 ment of some components make it
 unlikely that the first nuclear
 unit can be deployed on station
 before 1971.
 Construction of a land-
 based, prototype nuclear pro-
 pulsion plant for the submarine is
 encountering some delays.   Its
 reactor was to have been operat-
 ing by the middle of this year,
 but production of some of the
 reactor components was slowed
 by a serious fire at one of
 the plants late last year and
 it now appears that the reactor
 will not become operative until
 early in 1964.   No major prob-
 lems are reported on the con-
 struction of heat exchangers,
 turbines, or reduction gearing.
 A hull begun in 1957, and
 originally intended for the
 first French nuclear submarine,
 is now being equipped with a
 conventional diesel power plant,
 and will be used as an experi-
 mental missile test platform.
 Work is being completed on a
 center section for this hull
 containing at least four and
 perhaps eight launching tubes.
 This boat will probably be
 launched next year, but the
 test missiles are not likely to
 be available until 1965 or
 1966, which will in consequence
 delay underwater testing of
 missiles and guidance systems.
 France is also evidently
 making adequate progress in
 developing a two-stage, solid-
 fuel missile with a 1,000- to
 1,500-mile range.   A series of
 tests of solid-fuel rockets
 planned for the next two years
 --using some components of
 this military missile--will
 provide additional information
 for the military program.   Al-
 though early French guidance
 systems are likely to be in-
 accurate by US standards, they
 will probably be sufficient
 for the oft-stated French goal
 of a weapons system for use
 against population centers,
 25X1
 if
 progress with warhead minia-
 turization can be assumed, all
 components of the weapons sys-
 tem can be available and an
 operational submarine can be
 at sea in 1970.   About a year
 more would probably be required
 for sea trials before the first
 submarine went on station.
 Current French plans call for
 the production of three nuclear
 submarines, each with 16 mis-
 siles.

 TthtEATS TO ITALIAN ECONOMIC STABILITY
 Although business in general
 is booming in Italy, prices are
 steadily rising, and the balance-
 of-payments problem has become
 grave.   The modest austerity
 program which caretaker Premier
 Leone has presented to Parliament
 will probably be inadequate to
 stabilize the situation, and it
 may also complicate the already
 delicate problem of forming a
 'center-left coalition.
 The cost of living has risen
 about 8 percent in the past year,
 with price indexes going up faster
 in the first half of 1963 than
 during the comparable period of
 1962.  The average take-home pay
 of Italian workers is still con-
 siderably lower than in the other
 EEC countries, however, and or-
 ganized labor is pressing for
 additional wage increases.   Since
 there is a shortage of labor in
 several fields, and unemployment
 is low--about 2.5 percent of the
 labor force--the unions are in
 a strong bargaining position.
 The wage-price spiral is
 weakening the competitive position
 of Italy's export sector, which
 in recent years has been a main
 contributor to the country's
 rapid economic growth.  The ex-
 panded imports the government
 has encouraged to hold prices
 down helped wipe out Italy's
 customary balance-of-payments
 surplus last year, and this year
 the payments deficit may well
 reach one billion dollars.  This
 is causing increasing concern on
 the part of central bank author-
 ities, although official reserves
 ...              Europe
 of about $3.5 billion are large
 enough to cope with the situa-
 tion for the present.
 The measures proposed to
 Parliament last month are de-
 signed to reduce the balance-
 of-payments deficit, curb in-
 flation, increase productivity
 and restrict certain types of
 consumption.  They entail a
 10-percent cut in the budget
 deficit, tax inducements for
 modernization of factories,
 more low-cost housing con-
 struction, and increases in sales
 taxes on luxury goods.
 These measures are much less
 extensive than informed observers
 had expected, however, and their
 impact on the economy is not likely
 to be decisive.  The Christian
 Democrats look to the Socialists
 for eventual participation in a
 center-left coalition--a consid-
 eration.which inhibits the Leone
 government from pressing for re-

 A major step toward re-
 solving Greece's three-month-
 old political crisis has been
 taken with King Paul's accept-
 ance of Prime Minister Pipine-
 lis'   resignation.  This was
 a major concession to the larg-
 est opposition party, the non-
 Communist Center Union (EK),
 which threatened "militant
 abstention" if elections were
 carried out by the Pipinelis
 government.
 The new caretaker govern-
 ment, which will preside over
 general elections on 3 November,
 is headed by the president of
 the Supreme Court, Stylianos
 Mavromichalis, and consists en-
 tirely of nonpolitical figures.
 Its installation opens the way
 for all three major parties to
 participate in the elections--
 the right-of-center National
 Radical Union (ERE), under
 former Premier Constantine
 Karamanlis; the EK, under George
 Papandreou; the right-wing Pro-
 gressives, under Spyros Mark-
 ezinis; and the Communist-dom-
 inated United Democratic Left
 (EDA) under John Passalides.
 Since the disputed election
 of 1961, Greek politics have
 been unusually bitter, and the
 opposition parties have fre-
 quently refused even to partic-
 ipate in parliamentary sessions.
 Last June, Karamanlis suddenly
 resigned after a dispute with
 the King over a proposed royal
 visit to Britain.  While rela-
 tions between the royal family
 and Karamanlis had become in-
 creasingly strained, he may have
 seized on the dispute as an
 opportunity to clear the polit-
 ical atmosphere.
 Karamanlis and the King
 agreed on career diplomat Pipine-
 lis as the interim prime minister
 to conduct elections.  However,
 Pipinelis, a member of ERE and a
 minister in the last Karamanlis
 government, was immediately at-
 tacked by the EK and other op--
 position parties as not really
 neutral.  Eventually, even part
 of the ERE press called for a
 completely nonpolitical  figure.
 Both Karamanlis and the King are
 known to feel that an election
 without EK participation would be
 meaningless and would intensify
 political instability.                25X1
 Kara -
 man  s remains the most popular
 figure in Greece, and most ob-
 servers predict another electoral
 victory for the ERE.  The party
 may lose some of the 180 seats
 that it has held in the 300-member
 parliament, since the provisions
 of the new electoral law and nor-
 mal popular disenchantment with
 any party in power for eight years
 would tend to work against it.
 Leadership of the EK is badly
 split, but the success of Papan=
 dreou's "unrelenting struggle" to
 force new elections may attract
 enough support to increase its
 representation.
 The EDA suffered a major defeat
 in 1961, when its share of the pop-
 ular vote fell to 15 percent from
 nearly 25 percent in the previous
 election.  This year the Communist-
 dominated party appears to be in
 a good position to make at least a
 partial comeback.  The security
 services are not harassing EDA mem-
 bers                                          25X1
 anywhere near as much as before,
 and there are continuing economic
 problems on which it can capitalize.

 Europe
 Efforts to resolve Fin-
 land's month-old cabinet crisis
 continue to founder on the in-
 sistence by President Kekkonen's
 dominant Agrarian Party that
 representatives of one of the
 two rival trade union federations
 be included in any new govern-
 ment.
 A number of non-Communist
 leaders have been trying to
 assemble a new coalition since
 30 August, when Prime Minister
 Karjalainen and his coalition
 cabinet resigned after its
 three extra-parliamentary
 representatives of labor with-
 drew in a dispute over economic
 policy.  The four non-Communist
 parties which made up the
 coalition are in general agree-
 ment on policy, but the Agrar-
 ians' insistence on including
 labor has proved to be the
 principal obstacle.
 The problem of labor rep-
 resentation is complicated
 not only by the political ri-
 valry between the Social Demo-
 crats and their left-wing
 splinter--the so-called Skog-
 ists--but': also by the paral-
 lel split in union ranks which
 has resulted in the formation
 of two separate trade union
 federations.   The previous
 government secured "labor
 representation" by assigning
 three cabinet posts to indi-
 viduals identified with the
 trade union federation con-
 trolled by the Skogists and
 Communists.   Kekkonen and the
 Agrarians continue to shun all
 cooperation with the Social
 Democrats on grounds that they
 do not support Finland's offi-
 cial policy of friendship with
 the Soviet Union.
 The Agrarians, as the
 party closest to Kekkonen and
 commanding the largest bloc
 of seats in parliament, have
 played the principal role in
 the maneuvering to form a
 new government.  The insistence
 by the Agrarians on labor's
 participation reflects not
 only their wish to broaden
 their base of support, but
 also their reluctance to bear
 the onus of the unpopular
 economic decisions the new
 government may be compelled to
 make in the coming months.
 Kekkonen has thus far
 avoided intervening directly
 in the crisis, except for his
 recent proposal that an all-
 party government, including
 the Communists, be formed.
 This proposal was promptly dis-
 missed by the non-Communist
 parties, including the Agrarian
 leadership, which is well aware
 that such a development would
 split their own party.  Now
 that all practical possibilities
 for resolving the crisis have
 been explored without success,
 the stage would appear to be
 set for more decisive inter-
 vention by Kekkonen within the
 limits imposed by the realities
 of Finland's domestic political
 situation.  His immediate ob-
 jective is likely to be the
 reconstitution of Karjalainen's
 majority coalition, including
 the labor representatives, but
 if this fails his only alterna-
 tives would be a four-party
 coalition without labor or a
 nonpolitical cabinet of civil
 servants.

 could undermine the apparently
 well-intentioned efforts of the
 ruling triumvirate.   Several
 of the new rightist cabinet

 their political and personal

 Colonel Oswaldo Lopez, chief
 of the Honduran armed forces, led
 forces under his command in a coup
 early on 3 October.   The move was
 made despite strong pressures by
 US diplomatic and military officials
 in Honduras to persuade him and
 President Villeda to guarantee the
 continuation of constitutional gov-
 ernment and the holding of orderly
 elections on 13 October.
 Early indications were that
 the coup involved some violence in
 Tegucigalpa, the capital.   Chances
 of widespread disorders and civil
 strife had not been ruled out by
 midmorning, when it was still not
 clear how far the Villeda govern-
 ment and the ruling Liberal Party's
 presidential candidate, Modesto
 Rodas Alvarado, would go in trying
 to rally their own armed supporters
 to oppose the military.
 The revolt in effect is aimed
 at preventing the election of Rodas
 on 13 October.   Although Lopez has
 expected some armed resistance by
 Rodas' Liberal supporters, he is
 said to believe he can control the
 situation.   There is evidence that
 he has solicited support from
 Nicaragua and El Salvador and that
 he expects to receive immediate
 recognition from them as well as
 from the Peralta military regime
 in Guatemala.
 Lopez, who has been under
 heavy pressure from some of his
 subordinates to act, stated before
 the coup that it had the full sup-
 port of the armed forces, who favor
 the opposition Nationalist Party.
 The military feared that Rodas
 would curtail the influence of the
 army and build up the  power of the
 Civil Guard, which is in effect
 the military arm of the Liberal
 Party.   The tension between the
 military and Rodas has been fos-
 tered by the candidate himself,
 who remained aloof from high rank-
 ing officers and refused to clarify
 his intentions toward the military.
 A forceful politician who has
 not displayed a tendency to com-
 promise, Rodas is believed to have
 favored resisting a coup.   In a
 conversation with US Ambassador
 Burrows on 30 September, he said
 the Liberal Party would prepare
 to oppose the army.   There have
 been recent reports that arms are
 being distributed to Liberal Party
 followers.
 The strong emotional partisan-
 ship of both Liberals and National-
 ists, the availability of arms to
 both sides, and the political involv-
 ment of the military and the Civil
 Guard could bring further violence.
 Military leaders probably will try
 to justify their coup on the basis
 of their constitutional duty to
 guarantee free and orderly elections.
 They might also attempt to vindicate
 themselves by charging that the
 government was penetrated by
 Communists.
 Nicaraguan President Rene
 Schick admitted to US Ambassador
 Brown on 1 October that, although
 General Anastasio Somoza had pre-
 viously indicated a desire to sup-
 port a Honduran military coup, the
 Nicaraguan Government had decided
 not to assist in any way.   Julio
 Rivera, President of El Salvador,
 also indicated that his government
 would not encourage the Honduran
 military. On 3 October,  Schick told
 Brown he would issue a statement
 deploring the coup and offered
 his cooperation with the US.

 COLORADO RIVER PROBLEM AFFECTS MEXICAN POLITICS
 The Mexican Government may
 initiate some form of legal
 action against the US unless
 there is an immediate solution
 to the problem of the Colorado
 River's excessive salinity when
 it reaches Mexico.  The onset
 of the dry season in the Mexican
 State affected--Baja California--
 in October produces peak demand
 for irrigation water, and Presi-
 dent Lopez Mateos and other
 senior officials have recently
 been emphasizing that they be-
 lieve the US is committed to
 measures this fall to lower
 the Colorado's salinity to
 acceptable levels.   In addition
 to its concern over this year's
 severe reduction in crop acreage,
 the, Lopez Mateos administration
 is also anxious about political
 repercussions.
 In commenting on the Mexi-
 can attitude, the US Embassy
 at Mexico City states that in
 the absence of a prompt solution
 to the salinity problem, Lopez
 Mateos may feel compelled by
 domestic pressures to seek a
 remedy in the International
 Court of Justice, or in a US
 federal court.   Mexico might
 also enter a complaint in the
 Organization of American States
 or the UN that its riparian
 rights have been injured by the
 US.   In any event, the resulting
 publicity would, in the embassy's
 opinion, cause a sharp deteri-
 oration in US-Mexican relations.
 The embassy also believes that
 Mexico's case in any court,would
 be a strong one.
 The government is evidently
 trying to keep a rein on public
 emotions surrounding the issue,
 which are potentially explosive,
 and has clamped a tight lid on
 public discussion of the sit-
 uation.   Its motive in doing
 this probably is related to
 plans for the selection by
 November of the ruling party's
 next presidential candidate.
 Lopez Mateos probably fears
 that influential pro-Communists
 like former President Cardenas
 and former Baja California
 governor Maldonado will exploit
 public indignation over the
 Colorado to demand a hand in
 making the nomination, which
 in Mexico is tantamount to
 election.
 It is also possible that
 Lopez Mateos' own apprehension
 over any increase in peasant
 unrest caused by the water
 dispute might lead him to choose
 a leftist successor.  Although
 at present he seems to favor
 the selection of a moderate,
 he has long tended to over-
 estimate the actual influence
 of the far left in Mexico,  He
 might be persuaded that a left-
 ist  would be in a better posi-
 tion to defend Mexico's inter-
 ests  before world opinion in
 pursuing the Colorado case.
 The situation also carries
 the threat of a new effort by
 Communist-led political and
 labor groups to attract peasant
 support and develop their assets
 in Baja California, already
 better organized than in the
 rest of Mexico.

 THE NEW ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT PARTY
 While Argentine President-
 elect Illia appears to be a cau-
 tious and moderate politician,
 many members of his party--the
 People's Radical Civic Union
 (UCRP)--harbor some highly paro-
 chial and uninformed attitudes
 on key issues.
 The UCRP, slightly left of
 center, is out of touch with many
 present-day realities, partly
 because it has been in opposition
 for so long.  For the same reason
 it lacks men with the experience
 and knowledge necessary to cope
 with Argentina's complex economic
 and political problems.   Illia
 himself has a keen political sense
 and will give the party stronger
 leadership than it has had in the
 past, but he too lacks executive
 experience on the national scene.
 For the last 25 years he has been
 a practicing physician in a small
 railroad town in central
 Cordoba Province.
 Dr. Julio Cueto Rua,
 a Conservative Party
 leader, journalist, and
 former professor of law
 in the United States, has
 expressed concern to US
 officials in this regard.
 He is one of a number of
 well-informed Argentines
 undertaking an "educa
 tional campaign" designed
 to break down some of the

 Despite its lack of
 experience and small
 plurality of 26 percent
 of the national vote, the
 UCRP is firmly based both
 at the national level and
 in most of Argentina's 22
 provinces.   It controls

 federal capital and the

 in the electoral college after
 his party won a plurality in the
 7 July elections.
 Cueto Rua is particularly
 concerned that the Illia govern-

 other center-oriented leaders
 are discussing how such support
 can be provided.   Cueto Rua has
 urged that the US show patience
