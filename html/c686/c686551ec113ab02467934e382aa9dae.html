 The USSR appears to be
 marking time pending the re-
 ceipt of the western replies
 to its 27 November notes on
 Berlin.   Moscow is seeking to
 maintain pressure on the west
 by underlining its determina-
 t3lon to carry out previously
 announced plans to transfer
 the remaining Soviet respon-
 sibilities in East Berlin to
 the East Germans and by warning
 against the dangerous conse-
 quences of moves by the western
 :~ers to preserve their posi-
 tion in Berlin by force.
 Soviet propaganda on the
 NATO ministerial meeting
 stresses the absence of western
 counterproposals  and alleges
 that rejection of KArushchev's
 plan proves once again that the
 west is not interested in
 "normalizing" the Berlin situ-
 ation or relaxing tensions in
 Europe.   In an interview with
 the East German press agency on
 19 December, General Zakharov,
 commander of the Soviet forces
 in Germany, warned that western
 resort to military action re-
 garding Berlin could precipitate
 a global war.
 A Soviet Embassy official
 in East Berlin refused to rule
 out the possibility that, fol-
 lowing the western replies,
 consideration would be given
 to implementing previously
 announced Soviet plans to trans-
 fer control of Allied access to
 the East Germans.   He said the
 USSR does not consider the
 NATO communique an answer to
 the Soviet proposal for a free-
 city status for west Berlin.
 A Pravda "Observer" article on
 20 December declared that
 western refusal to seek agree-
 mest:rwith the USSR on Berlin
 will not deter Moscow from
 carrying out these plans.
 The visit of First Deputy
 Premier Mikoyan to the United
 States in early January may
 shed greater light on the true
 Soviet position.  Mikoyan is
 described by some European ob-
 servers as a "suitable person"
 to prepare an East-West "dia-
 logue."  Bonn commentators see
 Mikoyan's trip as specifically
 relating to Berlin and as a
 possible prelude to a modi-
 fication of the "ultimatum"
 character of Moscow's 27
 November note.
 The East Germans are
 attempting to intimidate Ber-
 liners who work for the Ameri-
 can, British, or French mis-
 sions.   Office employees and
 servants employed by the West-
 ern powers have been contacted
 in person or by letter by East
 Germans who have made ominous
 statements concerning their
 future.   Some Germans have in-
 dicated their intention to
 resign their positions with
 the French mission after Christ-
 mas.   Shopkeepers near the city
 sector border were approached
 by East German agents immedi-
 ately prior to the recent
 elections and asked to make
 their premises available for
 Communist party political
 meetings.   Upon refusal, they
 were threatened by the agents,
 who ostentatiously placed their
 names in a book for "future
 reference."

 23 December 1958
 An East Berlin paper, BZ
 am Abend, on 6 December caried
 aTrott-page article reporting
 that preparations        now were com-
 pleted by the Allies to evacuate
 1,000'prominent West Berliners.
 The NATO meeting, which
 reaffirmed the West's intention
 to remain in Berlin, had a re-
 assuring effect on Berlin morale
 The opinion was generally ex-
 pressed in West Berlin that,
 pendi._g Western countermoves
 on the broader aspects of the
 German problem--which the
 majority of Berliners feel is
 the only way to deal with this
 question--the NATO communiques
 were all that could be expected.
 Mayor Willy Brandt told American
 officials that he was fully
 satisfied with the Paris meeting.
 Nasir and Iraq
 army action against Qasim,
 UAR President Nasir has
 continued his recently initi-
 ated campaign against Com-
 munist influence in the area.
 The campaign has consisted so
 far of press and radio  state-
 ments warning of the dangers
 of deviating from the "Arab
 caravan," of efforts by the UAR
 censorship authorities to crack
 down on Communist-line papers
 in the Syrian region of the
 UAR, of the circulation of in-
 spired rumors in Baghdad and
 other Arab capitals, and of
 public statements by Nasir
 himself.   His strongest attack
 was made in a speech on 23
 December when he denounced
 local Syrian Communists for
 obstructing the progress of
 the UAR.
 In Iraq,  Prime Minister
 Qasim continues to rely prima-
 rilyon the Communists for sup-
 port.   Pro-UAR nationalist lead-
 ers,                    who are generals without
 armies since the Nuri Said re-
 gime eliminated their contacts
 with the people, do not yet
 appear to have organized for
 any action.   They are probably
 relying on the possiblity of
 Arab and Israeli forces re-
 main alert to possible new in-
 cidents, but there have been no
 further repercussions to the
 latest serious clash in the air
 over the Sinai-Israeli border.

 response to repeated viola-

 MIGs and to previous recon-

 presumed to have been UAR

 of the action,  in which the
 Israelis claim one UAR air-

 indicates that the Israelis
 lured the MIGs into a trap,

 tack on the village with artil-
 lery and aircraft, and the Mos-
 lem members of the cabinet have
 attempted to shift the responsi-
 bility to the Christian members
 and to President Shihab.  The
 "Popular Resistance," a para-
 military arm of the Moslem
 National Front, has circulated
 a leaflet demanding that the
 government break up the training
 camps of the Social National
 party, which has strongly sup-
 ported ex-President Chamoun.
 The government has offered an
 indemnity to the villagers, but
 the Moslem leaders appear de-
 termined to extract the maximum
 political capital from the af-
 fair and have rejected the offer.
 The developments are symptomatic
 of the state of tension which
 may arise if, as some Moslems      25X1
 have envisaged, new parliamen-
 tary elections are held next
 spring.

 CONFIDENTIAL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Soviet party central
 committee plenum which met from
 15 to 19 December centered its
 attention on a review of agri-
 cultural policy during the five
 years of Premier Khrushchev's
 command of the party.   Claim-
 ing great successes for his
 policies and calling for a vig-
 orous new push on the agricul-
 tural front,  Khrushchev also
 used the plenum as a platform
 for a renewed blast at the
 "antiparty group" of Malenkov,
 Molotov,   Kaganovich, Bulganin,
 and Shepilty. Bulganin was
 forced to confess to sins
 :against the party and to pay
 humble tribute to Khrushchev's
 leadership.   There is no in-
 dication,                       however, that the
 central committee took further
 action against the defeated
 faction at this session.
 Despite the appearance of
 firm control on the part  of
 Khrushchev, his quest for a
 new testimonial to his leader-
 ship at this time may indicate
 he feels the need for fuller
 support for his present inter-
 national objectives and his
 domestic goals, including the
 impending educational reform
 and the Seven-Year Plan to be
 adopted at the party congress
 in January.
 The plenum, planned over
 a month ago,  appears to have
 been timed to enable Khrushchev
 to use this year's record
 harvest to back up his claims
 of success.   The plenum was
 announced and fully reported
 while still in session--a break
 in precedent--and numerous of-
 ficials, both high and low,
 were paraded before the commit-
 tee to speak in praise of Khru-
 shchev's agricultural policies
 arad to ?~enounce his opponents.
 It was clear that Khrushchev
 wanted the lessons of the meet-
 ing driven home with full force.
 Khrushchev's opening speech
 catalogued the achievements
 of his administration in agri-
 culture which, he emphasized,
 had been successful over the
 opposition of the "antiparty
 group."  The "despicable group
 of wretched splitters," he
 charged, had had no understand-
 ing of agriculture and had op-
 posed nearly every major policy
 in that sphere sponsored by
 Khrushchev since Stalin's death.
 The Soviet premier hinted at
 some further steps against them,
 such as expulsion from the
 party, by saying that "the
 tongue refuses to call such
 people 'comrades' even though
 they have remained members of
 the party."  The plenum closed,
 however, without any reference
 to their future.
 Addressing the central
 committee on the fourth day of
 its session, Bulganin abjectly
 conceded that everything said
 about him and his fellow plot-
 ters in preceding days was
 justified.   He poured abuse on
 the other members of the group,
 admitted he had been its "nom-
 inal" leader, and said that in
 his present post as chairman
 of a provincial sovnarkhoz he
 had come to "see the genius-
 like character and wisdom of
 the policy of our party and its
 central committee."
 Khrushchev's opening and
 closing speeches, as well as
 the central committee decision
 issued at the end of the ses-
 sion, restated the USSR's ob-
 jective  of overtaking the
 United States in per capita ag-
 ricultural output and called

 for determined efforts to achieve
 this through organizational and
 operational improvements,  in-
 cluding extensive removals of
 laggard farm leaders if nec-
 essary.   The statements reaf-
 firmed that collective farms
 are basic to the Soviet system
 but envisioned their eventual
 transformation into a "higher
 socialist form" through the ex-
 pansion of communal facilities,
 the gradual "voluntary" sale of
 privately  owned livestock to
 the farms, and the abandonment
 of private plots in favor of
 communal vegetable growing.
 Although Khrushchev has
 secured from the plenum resound-
 ing approval of his agricultural
 polices and renewed condemnation
 of his enemies, the content and
 timing of the plenum, the con-
 tinuing absence of a successor
 to police chief Serov, and the
 decision to dispatch First Depu-
 ty Premier Mikoyan to the United
 States suggest that there may
 be a defensive element in Khru-
 shchev's present position.                                                                The
 American Embassy in Moscow,
 while doubting that Khrushchev
 is facing concerted opposition,
 considers it likely that his
 various  programs  have  antag-
 onized a number of highly placed
 individuals.   In  that  event,
 the  denunciation  of  the
 "antiparty  group"  could  have
 been  a  form  of  intimida-
 t ion .                                                                         (Con-       25X1

 PEIPING INSISTS ON ANOTHER "GIANT LEAP" IN 1959
 The central committee of
 the Chinese Communist party has
 confide'htly announced its de-
 termination to achieve another
 "giant leap forward" in econom-
 ic development in 1959.   It has
 clearly based next year's eco-
 nomic plan on the high produc-
 tion claims for this year, which,
 at least in agriculture, seem
 to have been grossly exaggerated
 for propaganda purposes.   The
 committee urges the nation to
 "go all out and aim high," but
 it injects a minor note of
 caution by insisting that eco-
 nomic work in 1959 should "con-
 form completely,  or as nearly
 as possible, to reality."
 The central committee,  in
 its recent plenum in Wuhan, de-
 cided that this year's "giant
 leap forward" was an "unprece-
 dentedly great success" and gave
 its stamp of approval to some
 of the extreme claims which have
 been advanced in connection with
 the leap.   Some of these claims,
 for example, stated that the
 gross value of industrial pro-
 duction increased more in the
 single year of 1958 than it did
 over the entire period of the
 First Five-Year Plan (1953-57),
 and that the output of steel,
 coal, grain, and cotton doubled
 and that of machine tools trebled
 during the year.   Some of these
 assertions, particularly those
 relating to agriculture, are

 claimed for this year--are still
 exceptionally ambitious.
 The central committee not
 only set the fantastic goal of
 producing 525,000,000 tons of
 grain--which approximates 60
 percent of the rest of the
 world's grain production in
 1957--but also endorsed a scheme
 to reduce cultivated acreage
 on marginal and hilly land
 "where local conditions permit,"
 while increasing the proportion
 of acreage sown to technical
 crops.   Agricultural goals are
 to be met by carrying out farm-
 ing with the "finesse of garden-
 ing" and through further mech-
 anization and electrification
 in rural areas.   Both light and
 heavy industry are to be devel-
 oped with great speed during
 1959, with the iron and steel
 industry as the "key link."
 Policies introduced this year
 of simultaneously developing
 large, medium, and small enter-
 prises and employing both modern
 and crude methods of production
 will be continued.
 For the first time in many
 months, the party struck a note
 of caution and sobriety--albeit
 a minor one--concerning economic
 planning.   It said that too
 much "socialist zeal" had often
 led to exaggeration of successes
 and concealment of shortcomings.
 Leading personnel were told to
 be good at "differentiating
 between real truth and false
 appearances."  The general
 tone of the party's communique,
 however, made it clear that the
 party  itself  was  not  pay-
 ing  close  attention  to its
 own counsel.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY DECISION ON COMMUNES
 Peiping's statement on
 the commune  program, issued
 on 18 December, following a
 central committee meeting in
 Wuhan from 28 November to 10
 December,  makes clear the re-
 gime's intention to continue
 along the broad lines laid down
 in August by the politburo.
 The resolution,  however,  indi-
 cates that practical problems
 encountered during the develop-
 ment of the communes, especially
 in the cities, have forced a
 softening of some of the more
 extreme features.   This step
 appears to have been prompted
 by popular apprehension.   So-
 viet reaction to the communes--
 especially  to the theoretical
 implications of communalization
 and its effect on Eastern Euro-
 peans--has been unfavorable,
 and the very bad Western and
 SECRET
 Yugoslav press has threatened
 to undermine Peiping's relations
 with uncommitted countries.
 The change of pace follows
 Mao Tse-tung's usual practice
 of moving ahead rapidly in a
 new development and then pausing
 to resolve problems and consoli-
 date gains.   This pattern was
 clearly evident in the collec-
 tivization drive of 1955 and
 earlier major programs in the
 countryside.
 The resolution blamed the
 excesses of the commune program
 which are now being modified
 or suspended on misunderstand-
 ings or "incorrect"ideas of
 overzealous  party members--
 although many of these ideas
 were certainly encouraged by
 party leaders themselves during

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 September and October.   Mao
 and other senior party leaders,
 such as Liu Shao-chi, Teng
 Hsiao-ping, and Tan Chen-lin,
 must have condoned, if not en-
 couraged, the impetuosity  of
 local cadres during their numer-
 ous inspection tours of the new
 communes this past fall, but
 there is no suggestion that the
 criticism is directed at specif-
 ic party leaders.
 The resolution provides
 extensive guidance to the teams
 of party and army cadres which
 have already begun a full-scale
 investigation of rural communes.
 It details for the first time
 what the party leadership re-
 gards as good and permissible
 and what it regards as bad or
 premature.   Through these in-
 vestigations and an accompany-
 ing program of "education," the
 regime expects to "tidy up"
 rural communes by next April.
 The resolution chides cer-
 tain cadres who have been "good-
 hearted" but "overeager" and
 orders the softening of some
 of the more objectionable fea-
 tures of the movement to date.
 While reiterating the party's
 determination to abolish the
 old patriarchal family system,
 the resolution insists that
 families  be permitted to live
 together in the new communal
 housing and that parents be
 permitted to decide whether
 their children shall live at
 home or board at the new com-
 munal nurseries or schools. Pos-
 sessions such as houses, bedding,
 furniture, clothing, bank de-
 posits, and funds remitted from
 abroad or within  China are to
 remain as private property.
 The central committee em-
 phasizes the need to avoid
 dampening the production incen-
 tives of the peasar4.ts,   The t .m.e
 is not ripe in China, it says,
 to replace the wage system e:a--
 tirely with the "free-sup%,!.,-"
 system of payment.   On the con-
 trary, wages are to remain the
 main form of remuneration for
 some time to come, although the
 "free-supply" system will con-
 tinue to be used.   Hope is ex-
 pressed that wages for 90 per-
 cent of the members will be in-
 creased annually.
 The peasant's need for ad-
 equate rest is officially rec-
 ognized.     The resolution di-
 rects  that an eight-hour day
 be the rule except during busy
 seasons; in any season, eight
 hours'sleep and four hours for
 meals and "recreation" must be
 guaranteed.
 On the knotty problem of
 allocating a commune's income,
 the resolution offers little
 in the way of practical advice
 beyond the pious hope that both
 the reserves accumulated and
 the funds distributed to members
 should be increased yearly.
 Communes are instructed to em-
 phasize industry but are warned
 that it should in general be
 self-supporting and closely
 linked to the demands of agri-
 cultural production, as well as
 to the mechanization and electri-
 fication of agriculture.   The
 resolution also notes the con-
 tinuing need for commercial ex-
 change among the communes and
 between the communes and the
 state.   Such trade is required,
 for example,  in order for the
 communes to obtain funds with
 which to pay members.   Money
 will play a "positive role" in
 the communes for some time to
 come.
 Statements in the resolution
 on urban communes confirm earlier
 judgments that this phase of the
 movement ran into difficulties
 in the large cities.   Emphasiz-
 ing that urban areas are far more
 complex than rural, it  acknowl-
 edges  that "bourgeois ideology"
 is still prevalent in certain
 urban circles.   Therefore, except

 for necessary preparatory work,
 establishment of communes on a
 large scale in big cities is
 to be postponed until the "skep-
 tics and douxt-ters" have had a
 chance to overcome their mis-
 givings.   The central commit-
 tee's intention ultimately to
 establish urban communes is
 affirmed, however.
