 FAR EAST
 The 48-hour Christmas cease-fire in Vietnam ended
 with routine Communist charges of "grave violations"
 by US forces.   During the period, there were 102 Com-
 munist-initiated incidents, most of minor violations--
 a rate slightly lower than during the truce period
 last year.   Hanoi's effort to take advantage of the
 cease-fire was evident in the sighting of 500 supply-
 laden boats off the coast of southern North Vietnam.
 Another possible Viet Cong attempt to discredit
 the Saigon military regime was reflected in an unsuc-
 cessful attempt on the life of a prominent member of
 the Constituent Assembly--only 20 days after the as-
 sassination of another outspoken assembly critic of
 the South Vietnamese Government.
 The mounting campaign against Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping suggests that the struggle between
 contending forces in Peking may be approaching another
 critical juncture.   Red Guard posters denouncing Liu
 and Teng were followed by a mass rally on 27 December
 at which demands reportedly were made that both men
 be stripped of all power and offices. The posters al-
 leged that they had confessed opposition to the "cul-
 tural revolution" and had pledged loyalty to Mao and
 Lin Piao at party conferences in October and November.
 Having extracted humiliating concessions from
 Macao authorities following riots in early December,
 the Chinese Communists are now pressing for the elim-
 ination of any Chinese Nationalist presence or activ-
 ities in the colony.   Portugal's desire to placate
 Peking may prompt the Taipei government to break dip-
 lomatic relations with Lisbon.
 The Chinese Communists are also seeking to en-
 courage opposition to the Suharto government in Indo-
 nesia on the part of left-wing groups and the overseas
 Chinese community. The Chinese have expressed optimism
 that the power struggle in Indonesia and the country's
 economic problems can be exploited to hasten the down-
 fall of the Suharto government.  Moves by President
 Sukarno and his supporters to counter the government's
 campaign to depose him have sharpened tensions in
 Djakarta.

 VIETNAM
 The Christmas truce period
 was relatively quiet this year.
 Only a few major incidents were
 reported during the 48-hour cease-
 fire.   Once the cease-fire was
 over, however,  the Communists
 launched their first attack of
 the war on an American artillery
 position.
 Many of the 102 incidents
 stemmed from Communist reaction
 to the reconnaissance activities
 of the allied forces.   Friendly
 casualties during the cease-fire
 were 34 killed  (three US)  and 43
 wounded  (23 US).   There were 12
 known Communist losses.
 The Communist attack on a
 US artillery position occurred
 in Binh Dinh Province near Bong
 Son.   Units of the lst Cavalry
 Division of Operation THAYER II,
 supported by artillery, air
 strikes, and heli-lifted rein-
 forcements, repulsed the attack-
 ers, but suffered casualties of
 24 killed and 48 wounded.   The
 enemy force--possibly elements
 of the 22nd North Vietnamese
 Army (NVA).  Regiment of the lst
 NVA Division--began their attack
 with a heavy mortar barrage
 against the American positions.
 During the battle that followed,
 the VC overran several gun em-
 placements, destroying one 155-
 mm. howitzer and damaging several
 more.  A total of 43 enemy troops
 were killed.
 South Vietnamese paratroopers
 began a multibattalion operation--
 code-named DAN CHI 270/D--in the
 Mekong Delta province of Chuong
 Thien on 26 December.   This op-
 eration, the most massive allied
 airborne assault of the war, is
 targeted against the Viet Cong
 bastion in the U Minh Forest.
 Three Viet Cong battalions--the
 303rd,  306th, and 309th--with a
 strength of 1,800 men are believed
 to be operating in the area.
 More than 60 Viet Cong have been
 reported killed and several cap-
 tured.   Friendly losses are
 light.
 North Vietnamese Take Advantage
 Of the Christmas Cease-Fire
 US destroyers, patrolling
 off the southern North Vietnamese
 coast, reported sighting almost
 as many boats in the two days of
 the truce as had been seen since
 the patrolling began on 26 Octo-
 ber.   Included in the 500 or so
 sightings were 15 large steel-
 hulled ships.

 Communist Propaganda Continues
 To Emphasize Guerrilla Warfare
 Both Hanoi and Liberation
 Front propaganda continue to ex-
 tol                     the virtues of guerrilla
 warfare.   One of the latest
 tributes was broadcast by Radio
 CIanoi on 22 December.   It was
 written under the pseudonym Cuu
 Long, an unidenti:=ied author in
 South Vietnam who has written
 extensively on th=_s subject in
 the past few months.
 Although the author made
 the customary obe:.sance to con-
 ventional tactics   he credited
 the guerrillas with more than
 one third of tota_. US/GVN casual-
 ties.   Cuu Long a--.so stressed
 the importance of guerrillas in
 the battle for po_.itical control
 of the rural popu_.ation.   He
 claimed that the Viet Cong no
 longer are relying exclusively
 on the guerrilla warfare of the
 past but are using the superior
 "modern science oj` guerrilla war-
 fare"   combining "widely known
 experience of long standing with
 people's creativeness."
 Cuu Long's eral.te:d claims
 for the capabilit_.es of "modern"
 guerrilla warfare may be designed
 to help justify the new emphasis
 on smaller scale operations.
 Other recent articles in the Viet-
 namese Communist press indicate
 that the decision to re-emphasize
 guerrilla tactics met with con-
 siderable opposition.
 Political Developments in Saigon
 Saigon's already congested
 port situation was further com-
 plicated this week by a strike of
 several thousand dock workers that
 began on 26 December.   Ostensibly,
 the walkout at the city's main
 port was prompted by the layoff
 of some 600 Vietnamese stevedores
 at New Port, a recently contructed
 all-US facility.   The Vietnamese
 workers at New Port had been hired
 on only a temporary basis, but
 local union leaders ordered the
 strike in support of private
 stevedore companies whose con-
 tracts at the main port expire
 this weekend.   US troops were
 moved into the military sector at
 the port to remove cargo essen-
 tial to the war effort.
 Continuous negotiations have
 failed to end the strike.   More-
 over,  the rebel union agitators,
 who are at oods with the presi-
 dent of the national confedera-
 tion of labor unions, have or-
 dered a general strike throughout
 Saigon on 29 December unless the
 US agrees in principle to stop us-
 ing troops for offloading.   The
 Ky government, however, is report-
 edly preparing to intervene for
 fear that a prolonged strike could
 have serious economic repercus-
 sions.

 In a broader sense, the strike
 touches on the sensitivity of the
 Vietnamese to the increasingly
 large role the US is playing in
 the military effort.   There have
 been recent indications that in-
 fluential Vietnamese in and out of
 government are attempting to por-
 tray themselves as champions of
 Vietnamese sovereignty.   Demands
 that commercial aircraft on con-
 tract to the US military pay land-
 ing fees and claims that only the
 Vietnamese Army can carry out
 pacification activities, as well
 as the port strike all reflect
 this sensitivity.

 PEKING KEEPS PRESSURE ON MACAO
 Peking's current demands on
 Macao authorities center on the
 elimination of all Chinese Na-
 tionalist activities in the
 Portuguese enclave.
 The Portuguese appear deter-
 mined to placate Peking, even at
 the risk of provoking the Chinese
 Nationalists to break relations.
 Lisbon has unconditionally ac-
 cepted all the demands of the
 Chinese Communists stemming from
 the recent riots--although some
 details remain to be worked out
 --and is taking steps to prevent
 Chinese Nationalist operations
 in Macao.
 According to
 the- press, the Nationalists have
 protested to Portugal concerning
 the actions of the authorities
 in Macao.

 EUROPE
 The week saw no major new problems develop,
 but a few steps, though limited, were taken to-
 ward resolving some old ones.
 The 21st session of the UN General Assembly
 has ended with more accomplishments to its credit
 than usual and with rather less acrimony than ap-
 peared likely when it convened.   The conclusion of
 a space treaty, the momentum given to a non-
 proliferation agreement,  and the reappointment of
 U Thant to a second term count as successes.   The
 Chinese representation issue was met this year
 with relative ease, while the explosive South West
 Africa issue was handled with less difficulty than
 had been expected.
 The European Economic Community, which began
 the year in crisis, ended it on a comparatively
 productive note, although there are difficult and
 divisive issues immediately ahead, particularly
 with the French.   Agreements within the Community
 on tariff concessions to be offered in forthcoming
 bargaining with the US and others were arrived at
 earlier than had been expected,  and the way has
 been cleared for serious bargaining to begin next
 month.

 LUNA 13 CAPS SUCCESSFUL YEAR OF SOVIET LUNAR EXPLORATION
 The Soviets   ended a year of
 successes in lunar exploration on
 24 December by soft landing Luna
 13, which is sending back pictures
 and soil data from the moon's
 surface.
 Luna 13 was the fifth suc-
 cessful Soviet lunar operation of
 1966 and the second to make a soft
 landing.   A sixth lunar attempt
 --Cosmos 111--failed to leave the
 earth's orbit.
 Lunas 9 and 13 both landed
 in the Sea of Storms,  as did the
 US Surveyor I.   The two Soviet
 capsules were similar and both
 took pictures of surface details,
 but Luna 13 added two soil-
 analysis experiments--one for
 hardness and another for density.
 The data obtained by this method,
 while valuable, does not directly
 measure landing conditions as
 did the US Surveyor I.   The US
 vehicle not only tested soil tex-
 ture and firmness by taking a
 picture of its landing leg resting
 on the surface, but also simulated
 the conditions of an Apollo land
 ing.
 Soviet statements have indi-
 cated that the lunar landing mis-
 sions are intended to compile a
 map of the Sea of Storms.   However,
 this would be a long and difficult
 task because of the limited
 horizon of the camera, which
 sits atop a two-foot sphere.
 The other three Soviet lunar
 operations in 1966--Lunas 10,
 11,  and 12--orbited the moon.
 Only one, Luna 12,  succeeded in
 taking pictures,  and these were
 of poor quality.   Major improve-
 ments will be necessary to ob-
 tain the pictures needed to make
 large-scale maps for cosmonaut
 landings.

 ITALIAN COALITION FACES NEW TEST
 The uneasy partnership of
 Italy's Christian Democrats and
 Socialists is under strain again.
 The two parties' nutual grievances
 are due to be aired in January at
 a top-level coalition meeting
 called to set legislative priori-
 ties.   Unless the political atmos-
 phere cools, the government--which
 also includes the small Republican
 Party--will face a major test at
 that time.
 Last week, Socialist deputies
 --with help from Communists and
 some Christian Democrats--forced
 through an amendment to a farm
 subsidy bill.   The amendment, op-
 posed. by a majority of Christian
 Democrats, called for channel-
 ing EEC parity payments to Italy's
 olive oil producers through a
 government agency rather than
 through a Christian Democratic -
 controlled agricultural consor-
 t--" um.   The issue was   a technical
 one with no direct implications
 for governmental stability.   How-
 ever,  the Christian Democrats
 were disturbed that the Social-
 ists chose to force through the
 amendment with Communist support
 despite prior agreement in the
 cabinet on the original bill.   The
 affair illustrates how easily
 innate suspicions between the
 two parties rise to the surface
 to create political tension.
 The Socialists are dissatis-
 fied with the slow pace of the
 government's legislative program,
 as well as with the complicated
 parliamentary procedures that
 have contributed to delaying pas-
 sage of the Five Year National
 Economic Plan (1966-70).   They
 have also been disturbed by the
 results of local elections in
 November in which they did less
 well than the Christian Demo-
 crats.   Some Socialists believe
 their party should quit the
 coalition now so that it can
 enter the national elections,
 due by 1968, unencumbered by
 participation in a "do-nothing"
 government.
 The Christian Democrats are
 uneasy over the possibility that
 their dominant position in the
 government will eventually be
 challenged by the unified Social-
 ists.  Adding to their concern
 has been an aggressive Socialist
 campaign to extend the party's
 political patronage by putting
 forward candidates for a whole
 series of  subcabinet  posts.
 Moreover, personal jealousies
 against Premier Moro persist,
 as does some belief that a more
 vigorous premier is needed to
 refurbish the party's image in
 the pre-electoral period.   Some
 Christian Democrats argue that
 the party could gain an advan-
 tage by forcing early elections.
 Responsible leaders in both
 parties want to keep the coali-
 tion together until 1968.   How-
 ever,  they will have their work
 cut out for them if they are go-
 ing to get an acceptable compro-
 mise on legislative priorities at
 the top-level session next month.

 NO HOLIDAY PASSES FOR WEST BERLINERS
 The East Germans insisted
 on political conditions for a
 pass arrangement this year with
 the result that, for the first
 time since 1963, no West Berlin-
 ers made holiday visits through
 the Wall.   Previously the West-
 ern side has been able to deny
 that negotiations with the East
 German regime implied recogni-
 tion of its sovereignty by means
 of a so-called "savings clause."
 This was a joint statement that
 both sides agreed to disagree
 on terminology.   This year,  the
 East Germans refused this and
 negotiations ended.
 The stiff East German atti-
 tude was probably in part an ef-
 fort to test the new West German
 Government's stated intention to
 take a more flexible attitude
 toward East Germany.
 The hardening of the East
 German position is probably also
 a reaction to the prospect of im-
 proved West German relations with
 the other countries of East Eu-
 rope, a prospect that is highly
 displeasing to Pankow.
 SECRET
 The East Germans, however,
 have not so far carried over their
 tough attitude on the pass issue
 to other areas of contact with
 West Germany.   They withdrew sim-
 ilar demands for political condi-
 tions in connection with the open-
 ing of a new autobahn bridge on
 the border on 19 December, and
 they are relatively relaxed in
 interzonal trade matters.   The dif-
 ference in approach may be intender
 to buttress the Comzhunists'  con-
 tention that West Berlin is not a
 part of West Germany,  a position
 that has been challenged anew by
 the participation of former Ber-
 lin officials in the new Bonn gov-
 ernment.
 The Bonn government and the
 Senat were willing to make a con-
 cession on the savings clause last
 October in order to obtain a hard-
 ship pass agreement, but they were
 not under enough public pressure
 for a Christmas agreement to do so
 again.   The hardship agreement--
 which provides for emergency passe:
 for such family matters as births,
 marriages, serious illness, and
 death--lapses at the end of Janu-
 ary.   The East Germans presumably
 hope that public pressure will
 force the Senat into concessions
 when negotiations are reopened.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Continued high tensions among the Arab states
 dominated the week's developments.
 King Husayn, still adamant against the entry
 into Jordan of troops from other Arab states, last
 weekend succeeded in persuading the United Arab
 Command to delay a final decision on this move.
 Bomb explosions near government buildings in Amman
 have freshly dramatized the radical nationalist
 pressures he faces.   In Saudi Arabia, Husayn's ally
 King Faysal is also feeling pressure in the form
 of bombing incidents carried out by Yemeni terror-
 ists probably inspired by Nasir.   The incidents have
 been played up by Cairo radio. Nasir has also ac-
 corded Faysal's ousted predecessor, former king
 Saud, a friendly welcome to residence in Cairo.
 Tensions have generally eased in other Middle
 East trouble spots.   In Athens, the "nonpolitical"
 Paraskevopoulos government seems well launched in
 its mission to preside over preparations for gen-
 eral elections next may.   In India, the Punjab
 Sikh leaders' decision not to carry out their plans
 for self-immolation has given Prime Minister Gandhi
 a breathing spell.   Ceylonese Prime Minister Senana-
 yake's opponents appear to be counting on a mid-Janu-
 ary by-election to register protests against last
 week's slash in the rice ration.
 In tropical Africa, Mobutu's government is
 troubling the Portuguese as well as the Belgians.
 Deteriorating Congolese-Portuguese relations have
 most recently been punctuated by raids into Angola
 by Congo-based Angolan insurgents, and Lisbon has
 warned that it would retaliate.   President Mobutu
 has also taken a decisive step toward gaining con-
 trol of the Union Miniere mining company's Congo-
 lese assets.   In Nigeria, the federal regime is
 further developing plans for military action
 against the recalcitrant Eastern Region

 JORDAN D11AYS FINAL DECISION ON ENTRY OF FOREIGN TROOPS
 At a United krab Command  (UAC)
 meeting in Cairo last weekend,
 Jordan parried a final decision
 on stationing other Arab troops
 on its territory.   The UAC meeting
 had been called to carry through
 on the 10 December decision of the
 Arab Defense Council, which Jordan
 had accepted, to deploy Iraqi and
 Saudi troops in west Jordan along
 the Israeli border.
 Jordan won    reprieve by
 playing on Arab fears of another
 war with Israel z.nd by being, in
 effect, more Aral  than the others.
 The Jordanian representative again
 ~axpressed Amman'E agreement to the
 10 December decision but then in-
 sisted upon full implementation
 of the defense council's plan for
 meeting the Israeli threat--a plan
 that calls for additional military
 and financial steps by the other
 Arab states.   Those conditions
 on Jordanian acceptance of foreign
 Arab aid have necessitated another
 higher level mee-:ing of the de-
 fense council that probably will
 be :held early in February.
 Jordan has jeen reinforced
 in its determination to avoid hav-
 ing other Arab fDrces on its ter-
 ritory because of information it
 has received that Palestine Lib-
 eration Organization  (PLO)  troops
 wearing Iraqi insignia would be
 part of the Iraqi contingent slated
 to enter Jordan.   King Husayn
 continues to regard the PLO as a
 subversive menace.
 critical of Jordan's delaying
 tactics.   According to a PLO an-
 nouncement, that organization has
 responded by forming a "secret"
 revolutionary council aimed at
 overthrowing the King.   The PLO
 also claims to be taking "all
 necessary measures" to prepare for
 the entry of its Palestinian army
 into Jordan despite Husayn's op-
 position.
 King Husayn's reorganization
 of the Jordanian Government under
 the same prime minister, Wasfi Tal,
 has had a negative impact on
 Palestinian west Jordan, where
 antipathy toward the government
 has been strongest.   The two
 Palestinians added to the cabinet
 --including the new foreign min-
 ister, Abdullah Salah--have no
 broad base of support on the West
 Bank.
 Terrorist activity within
 Jordan is becoming more serious.
 Four bombs, presumably planted by
 Palestinians, exploded the night
 of 26-27 December in the area of
 Amman where most government minis-
 tries are located.   The following
 night, two more bombs exploded in
 the government's broadcasting
 station.  Jordan has charged that
 a Syrian Army patrol crossed the    25X1
 border into Jordan and murdered
 a Jordanian security guard on
 28 December.

 "NONPOLITICAL" GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER IN GREECE
 A new Greek government
 headed by banker Ioannis Paraske-
 vopoulos has been installed fol-
 lowing the fall of the 15-month-
 old regime of Stephan Stephano-
 poulos.   The old government col-
 lapsed when the conservative Na-
 tional Radical Union  (ERE)  with-
 drew its support, as it had long
 threatened to do.   King Constan-
 tine replaced it with a transi-
 tional administration of nonpo-
 litical personalities which he
 would like to have remain in of-
 fice until general elections can
 be held in late May.
 The withdrawal apparently
 resulted from an agreement between
 ERE leader Kanellopoulos and the
 chief figure in the opposition
 Center Union, George Papandreou.
 Papandreou had been demanding
 elections ever since he fell
 from power in a row with the pal-
 ace in the summer of 1965.F__
 The government crisis has
 left both major parties in dis-
 array.   A caucus of the ERE
 agreed to support Kanellopoulos,
 but his move caught many of his
 parliamentary deputies by sur-
 prise.
 The majority of Papandreou's
 deputies have also agreed to fol-
 low his lead, which calls for
 supporting the new government,
 but a sharp split has developed
 between him and his controver-
 sial son, Andreas.  The younger
 Papandreou's alleged role in
 the conspiratorial military
 "Aspida" group and his hostility
 toward the palace have stirred
 Greek political circles for two
 years.  Now Andreas has publicly
 demanded that his father reverse
 his decision to support Paraske-
 Paraskevopoulos is expected
 to receive a parliamentary vote
 of confidence next week, thanks
 to the backing of both major
 party leaders.   In view of the
 basic instability within both
 parties, however, a withdrawal
 of such support and another
 change in government before
 the elections is possible.

 CONGO INTEJSIFIES CONFRONTATION WITH BELGIAN MINING COMPANY
 President Mobutu of the Congo
 (Kinshasa)   has sharply raised the
 stakes in his duel with the Union
 Miniere mining concern and has
 moved much closer to his goal of
 "Congolizing" the company inside
 the Congo.
 On 23 Decemb~sr Mobutu an-
 nounced the creation of a new en-
 tity, controlled :>y the Congolese
 Government, to tote over the com-
 pany's assets in :he Congo.   This
 new "council of a lmin:Lstration, "
 according to the  jovernment's an-
 nouncement, will                            supplant Union
 Miniere irrevocably on 1 January
 unless the company agrees by then
 to move its headgzarters to Kin-
 shasa.   Simultaneously, Mobutu
 stopped the export--but not the
 production--of copper and other
 minerals mined by Union Miniere.
 Mobutu apparently believes
 that a sufficient number of the
 expatriates  (mostLy Belgians)  in
 the Congo--who ar   crucial to the
 country's mineral production--will
 stay on under the new arrangement..
 While he has step?ed up army and
 police activity i-i the Katanga
 mining region, he apparently is
 drying to minimize open harass-
 ment of the Belgians and has as-
 sured them that h.: wants them to
 remain.   He is al3o giving a ma-
 jority of seats o:a the new "coun-
 cil of administra:ion" to expa-
 triates, including five Union
 Miniere officials now in Katanga.
 Union Minier,~ has several
 strong cards to pLay, but so far
 it has not shown  its hand.   Its
 personnel in Katanga have been
 instructed to cooperate with Congo-
 lese  officials and to concentrate
 on producing copper.
 On the other hand, the com-
 pany's spokesmen have repeatedly
 said there is no chance that it
 will transfer its headquarters
 to Kinshasa.
 The company could also institute
 legal proceedings that would
 hamper the Congo in its efforts
 to make alternative marketing ar-
 rangements.
 There appears to be little
 chance that Mobutu will back down
 to the extent of letting Union
 Miniere run the mines after 1
 January.   Nor does Union Miniere
 seem likely to move its headquar-
 ters to the Congo.   If some way
 out of the impasse is not found,
 all sides will be damaged, the
 Congo perhaps most of all.   If a
 deal is reached,  it probably will
 involve Congolese control of op-
 erations inside the Congo, with
 Union Miniere continuing to mar-
 ket the Congo's mineral products.
 This would give Mobutu a substan-
 tial political victory with mini-
 mal disruption to the Congo's
 portion of the copper-producing
 process.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Most of Latin America followed its traditional
 Christmas holiday pattern by taking time out from
 jousting with internal and international problems.
 However, there were rumblings from two British
 possessions and a former colony that suggested de-
 veloping trouble.
 In the Bahamas, strikes and political infighting
 in preparation for the 10 January parliamentary elec-
 tions produced ugly moods in Nassau and elsewhere
 in the island chain that caused the governor to fly
 to London for consulations and the British to move
 a ship with marines aboard into the area.   The
 strikes  have been settled, however, and Brit:-sh au-
 thorities think local security forces can cope with
 any foreseeable unrest.  Nevertheless, there is some
 talk of assassinations if the opposition Progressive
 Liberal Party believes itself cheated in the coming
 elections and the situation will remain tense until
 well after the voting.
 The British also dispatched a warship to lie off
 St. Vincent in the Windward Islands as a result of
 unrest there.   Here, too, an electoral dispute is at
 the bottom of the problem.   The two major parties
 are embroiled in a legal battle over alleged ir-
 regularities in last August's legislative elections.
 London is involved heavily in this quarrel because
 the dispute could delay the granting of full internal
 self-government to the island, scheduled for February
 1967.
 The former British colony of Guyana came close
 to another government crisis as Premier Burnham
 shuffled his cabinet but stayed short of changes
 that would have jeopardized his party's coalition
 with that of Finance Minister D'Aguiar.   The two men
 have been at odds since before independence and a
 showdown between them may still be ahead.   The big
 danger in this situation is that Cheddi Jagan, the
 pro-Communist leader of the opposition,  is waiting
 in the wings for just such a development.
 The lull in Latin America will soon pass.   One
 predictable event for the new year is Castro's major
 speech on 2 January during the celebration of his
 take-over in 1959.

 ARG=NTINE GOVERNMENT SPLIT OVER LABOR POLICY
 A serious split over labor
 policy has developed within the
 Ongania government as the result
 of a hard-line fz.ction's attempts
 to prevent any compromise with
 the unions and recently intro-
 duced work rules.   In the latest
 incident, armed maritime police
 enforced a  lockout  of longshore-
 men returning to work after their
 union called off the  dock strike
 --hat had begun or 21 October.
 The hard-liners are led by
 '_!Transportation Secretary Antonio
 I,anusse,  who believes that ne-
 gotiations with labor would give
 the impression the government is
 weak and incapable of enforcing
 the new rules, which are designed
 to improve the efficiency of the
 nation's ports and railroads.   It
 seems that Lanusss's faction was
 responsible for tie lockout on
 the docks, as welL as for earlier
 police raids on union meetings in
 Buenos Aires.   Laiusse is appar-
 ently convinced tat President
 Ongania also favo.^s a tough ap-
 proach.   The President, in fact,
 has not yet commi :ted himself to
 either Lanusse or to the moderates,
 led by Labor Secretary Rubens
 San Sebastian, who are prepared
 at least to discuss the issues
 with labor leaders.
 SECRET
 The government's moves
 against the unions are forcing
 the leaders of the General Con-
 federation of Labor, which is
 dominated by Peronist moderate
 Augusto Vandor, to take a stronger
 antigovernment stand than in the
 past.   During the past few months,
 Vandor has urged union leaders
 to avoid a confrontation with
 the Ongania regime and to rely
 on negotiations to achieve labor
 demands.   Now, however, Vandor's
 position is being eroded by the
 tough position of Lanusse and
 his followers.   Some union lead-
 ers, especially Lorenze Pepe of
 the railroad workers, are urging
 labor to plan for strikes, and
 possibly even terrorism and sabo-
 tage, in the face of an inflexi-
 ble government attitude.
 The chances of avoiding a
 major confrontation between the
 crovernment and the labor unions,
 which seemed quite good in Novem-
 ber, have been considerably re-
 duced by the latest series of
 events.   The government can count
 on military backing to enforce
 its position, but a struggle with
 organized labor could put a road-
 block in the way of a number of
 economic and labor reforms con-
 templated by the government.

 BRAZILIAN CONGRESS CONSIDERS CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATION
 The basic text of President
 Castello Branco's new constitu-
 tion has been approved by the
 Brazilian Congress with the ex-
 pected support of progovernment
 party (ARENA)  legislators.   How-
 ever, many influential members--
 including respected ARENA lead-
 ers--are deeply concerned about
 such key provisions of the con-
 stitution as the indirect elec-
 tion of the president, military
 trials for civilians accused of
 crimes against national security,
 and the general expansion of pres-
 idential authority.
 Many members apparently hope
 to be able to modify the draft--
 now returned to committee for
 submission of amendments, which
 must be sponsored by at least one
 fourth of the membership of either
 house.   By law,  the committee must
 complete its consideration of
 amendments by 5 January, Congress
 must vote on them by 19 January,
 and the new constitution--with
 or without amendments--must be
 promulgated by 24 January.   It
 is not likely that the government
 will accept major alterations, but
 it may agree to some liberalizing
 amendments on human rights and on
 the President's authority to is-
 sue decree laws.   Some critics of
 the constitution reportedly hope
 to secure approval of more far-
 reaching amendments later on.
 In addition to the constitu-
 tional debates, Congress on 22
 December received from the Presi-
 dent a draft press law that must
 be acted upon within 30 days or
 become law automatically.  The
 draft, which has drawn immediate
 protests from many press groups,
 provides for increased fines and
 penalties for "abuse of liberty
 of the press," for transmitting
 false news, or for twisting or
 distorting-facts to cause public
 disturbances.  Notoriously slow
 court processes would be speeded
 up, and media accused of calumny
 and defamation--charges almost
 impossible to prove under present
 Brazilian law--would have the
 burden of proving their allega-
 tions.  Further, anonymity (pen-
 names are frequently used by po-
 litical writers in the Brazilian
 press) would be forbidden.  For-
 eigners would not be permitted to
 own "journalistic enterprises"
 nor to distribute national news
 in Brazil.
 Some responsible Brazilian
 newsmen have admitted, however,
 that the law is necessary to
 eliminate abuses of press, radio,
 and television by both newsmen
 and politicians.   They point out
 that the law sets up neither
 mechanisms nor provisions for

 PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CANAL NEGOTIATIONS
 The Robles government is be-
 coming more hopeful over prospects
 for reaching a canal settlement
 with the US next year, and For-
 eign Minister Eleta has scheduled
 a trip to this  country on 31 De-
 cember to try tj speed up the pace
 of the talks.
 Panama City news media,
 largely owned or controlled by
 government officials and members
 of the oligarchy, are giving heavy
 coverage to the negotiations. The
 recent calm and optimistic tone of
 most of the editorials and broad-
 casts contrasts sharply with the
 emotional,  anti-US clamor that
 was touched off in early December
 after a minor incident at the US;-
 leased Rio Hato  training area. At
 that time,  the pilot of a Panama-
 nian aircraft that made an emer-
 gency landing at the site claimed
 he had been "detained" by US
 personnel.   News media and ex-
 treme nationalists charged that
 the country's sovereignty had been
 violated, and the furor over the
 incident was quickly magnified
 into criticism of the US role in
 the treaty talks.   Most media
 portrayed the Robles administra-
 tion as taking a newly vigilant
 and forcefully patriotic stance
 in relations with the US.

 Canal Zone riots.   The television
 station owned by Eleta is stress-
 ing the "desirable pace" of the
 canal talks and is urging the
 public to avoid any "fruitless
 excesses" that would retard
 them.  Leaders of Panama's small,
 fragmented Communist movement
 are making plans for agitation
 during the anniversary period
 and,  as a result of the Rio Hato
 affair,  there is more tension
 this year than last.                   725X1
 In addition to reflecting
 renewed confidence regarding the
 negotiations,  the tone of the
 news media probably indicates
 that Robles and his aides have
 an eye on the approaching third
