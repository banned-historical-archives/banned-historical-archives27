 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS _ IN WORLD C OhIMUNI$M
 2URING NOVEMBER
 World Communism still leans heavily on the gullibility
 of fellow-traveling "liberals" and opportunists to achieve its
 ends. Only by exploiting man's reluctance to face political
 realities have the Moscow tacticians been able to create and
 re-create the illusion of a "united front".  The month of
 November furnished ample demonstrations for an increasing imple-
 mentation of this Communist tactic in Europe and even more
 strongly in the Far East, where it appears to have a good chance
 of success.
 At two high-level. Communist meetings, in Hungary and
 in China, leaders gave new meaning and impetus to the use of
 this device, The Cominform meeting at Galyateto, Hungary, while
 dealing chiefly with the problem of Tito's liquidation, published
 a significant resolution by Togliatti for "unification" of the
 "large masses of the working class" rogardless of their political
 and religious affiliations.  In Peiping, keynote speeches at the
 WFTU's Congress of Asian and Australasian countries} went farther,
 calling for extension of the united front campaign into new
 political and geographical areas,  In both meetings, Communist
 leaders did not hesitate to recommend cooperation with non-
 Communist groups of all complexions so long as they were in
 opposition to the existing regimes.  Confronted with steadily
 diminishing returns from its "defense of the peace's campaign
 in the West, the Kremlin is now seeking to revive the older
 concept of uniting all "moderate" and "democratic" elements
 in a united front.
 While the success of this tactic in politically sophisti-
 cated Europe remains as doubtful as over, its potentialities in
 the Far East, particularly in Southeast Asia, are from the stand-
 point of US security, very serious.  The "directives" for Commu-
 nist conquest along united front lines which were issued in Poi-
 ping, leave no doubt about their Stalinist motivation but are
 sugar-coated with tactical. moderation.  They are almost certain
 to impress large groups of Asians by the powerful and simple

 -  -  m
 principle of "cooperation" among the exploited classes.  At the
 same time, the anti-foreign feelings of these Asian masses are
 ,arefully diverted from the USSR and channelled toward the Western
 powers, notably the US..
 The achievement of the Chinese Communist victory opens
 great opportunities for Communism in the Fax East and will be
 increasingly exploited by the Communists as a means of diverting
 attention from the rising tide of anti-Communism in Europe and
 the stalemate in the Near and Middle Eastern areas.  A compre-
 hensive program for the exploitation of this Communist opportunity
 in the Far F&st has boon devised.  Soviet Politbureau member
 Bllalonkov, in his speech at the occasion of the 32nd anniversary
 of the October Revolution, mado this quite clear when he implied
 that Moscow would by no means rest on the laurels of the Communist
 victory in China.  He characterized China as a springboard rather
 than as a goal achieved and significantly linked India with China
 as decisive factors in the East-West struggle.  Meanwhile,
 Chinese Communist leaders in Peiping will apparently direct their
 efforts toward penetration of Southeast Asia, hoping to acquire
 the same status in that area as the USSR has acquired in China;
 in any case, the Chinese Communist effort in Southeast Asia should
 prove an effective instrument of Soviet expansion.
 From a long range point of view, the magnitude of the
 Far Eastern program is unprecedented in the history of Communist
 expansion.  It dwarfs the scope of Soiriot-Communist endeavors in
 Europe and other parts of the world and is almost certain to achieve
 a large measure of success among the discontented masses of the
 Far Eastern areas.

 SURVEY OF SIGNIFICI~NT TRENDS
 This survey of significant trends
 in the international Communist movement
 which have become apparent during the
 month of November, contains only those
 developments which are believed to have
 an important effect on the potential
 of World Communism.
 1.  UNITED FR0INT TACTICS
 Wherever the power of the Kremlin cannot be backed
 with the threat of action by the Soviet armed forces, where
 the influence of the local Communist parties has yet to be
 firmly established, or where its strength is declining rather
 than increasing, the Communists seek to enhance their status
 by trying to co-operate with sympathetic non'-Communist factions
 who are, at tho moment,, in opposition to their governments...
 Such cooperation may take the form of collaboration with other
 political parties, religious groups, etc., in which case it is
 tormed the "united front from above."  If the collaboration is
 primarily on an individual rather than an organizational basis
 it is called a "united front from below."  Once established,
 either of these united fronts is exploited and dominated by the
 Communists.  Eventually those participating non-Communists who
 have not completely surrendered to Communist discipline will be
 discarded and possibly liquidated.
 . International
 Although the ap nlication of the united front tactics
 within many national areas indicates a shift in Communist party
 tactics, the international front group; continue in their efforts
 to attract non-Communist followers by exploiting the griovances

 and nationalist  tendencies of various social groups.  During
 November, it became apparent that the major front organizations
 were beginning to implement the long-planned coordinated offensive
 in Southeast Asia..  Although the WFTU has been assigned the key
 role in these efforts, all the front organizations will probably
 accelerate their activity in this area in the coming months. .
 Soviet and Chinese Communist labor leaders at the WFTU
 Asian Conference, held in Peiping during November, stressed the
 importance of measures to hasten liberation of "the oppressed
 peoples of Asia," while their speeches at the conference indi-
 cated that the contemplated "assistance" would be extended
 principally through an Asian Liaison Bureau in Peiping, Communist
 controlled national labor federations, and the Chinese overseas
 labor unions. :At the same time, the heavy Chinese representa-
 tion on the conference presidium suggested that the leadership
 in VWFTU penetration efforts in the area will be largely the
 responsibility of the well-disciplined All-China Federation of
 Labor. .
 The Asian Women's Conference, which the Women's Inter-
 national Democratic Federation (W IDS') will hold in Peiping in
 December, will probably provide additional support for the Soviet
 drive in Southeast Asia.
 National
 China
 In his inaugural address to the WFTU-sponsored Trade
 Union Congress of Asian and Australasian countries in Peiping,
 LIU Shao-ch'i, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) leading Marxist
 theoretician, outlined the program which had led the CCP and which,
 he claimed, could lead the Communist parties of other Asian nations
 to victory.  LIU emphasized that the victory could not be achieved
 without the creation of a Communist-led army, the establishment
 of bases for it, and the coordination of military operations with
 the activities of workers and peasants in enemy territory.  LIU
 advocated, as an essential first step, the formation of a united
 front with whatever classes, parties, groups and individuals are

 willing to work against "imperialism and its lackeys."  He
 warned, however, that it was up to the Communist Party to con-
 trol this united front.  This tactic, a "united front from
 above," is particularly applicable to what the Kremlin defines
 as colonial areas.
 This "directive" for revolution in Asia was further
 elaborated upon by LI Li-san, the CCP's principal labor leader,
 who re-stated the united front tactic by asserting that the
 "Chinese working class was able to lead the revolution to
 victory" through its ability to unite with the peasant masses,
 the petty bourgeoisie in the cities, and that part of the
 "national" bourgeoisie which opposes "imperialism."
 Thailand
 Apparently responding to "directives" embodied in the
 statements by Communist leaders in Peiping, Chinese Communists
 in Thailand and other pro-Communist Chinese political groups
 are forming a permanent Democratic Forces Union Committee.  The
 aims of this Committee are, reportedly, to form similar committees
 uniting all Chinese democratic associations in Thailand, and to
 issue a secret propaganda paper.  Dissident elements of the
 Kuomintang are to be included in the organization.  Also, a new
 group of young Thai socialists is reported tentatively willing
 to cooperate with Communists in order to obtain "political and
 social reforms" through a "united Front."  They believe that
 later it will be "time enough" to break with the Communists,
 In view of the new Peiping directives there is a good possi-
 bility that a union will be formed between Chinese Communists
 and the Thai socialist group which won a recent Bangkok munici-
 pal election.
 Indonesia
 A different but hardly loss dangerous trend toward the
 united front tactic is indicated in Indonesia where the "nationalist"
 Tan Malaka Communists are reported to have reached an agreement
 with the Moscow Communists and whore the Darul Isla1  (fanatic

 Mohammedan) forces are reported to have accented Communist leader-
 ship in certain instances.  This strange associationhas developed
 chiefly by the agreement of the parties involved that they cannot
 accept the results of the Hague Round Table Conference.  If this
 move toward consolidation should materialize, a much graver throat
 to the stability of the now Indonesian Federal Government will be
 posed than if these groups acted separately,.
 Iran
 The clandestine Azerbaijan radio transmitting from the
 USSR has urged the formation of   national front in Iran, appeal-
 ing to the "center opposition" elements to support the front.
 The Communist radio declares that a united front of all opposi-
 tion elements is the only effective course of action..
 Fnch Equatorial Africa
 Communist members of the Assohbly of the French Union
 have reached French Equatorial Africa in the course of a propa-
 ganda tour of French North and West Africa.  They are urging that
 Nationalists and Communists unite for purposes of combatting US
 economic penetration of French overseas territories.
 Italy
 The "moderate" united front policy under the Jeader-
 shi  of Togliatti will probably be continued in Italy, at least
 until the spring of 1950.
 This conclusion is based on Togliattits attendance at
 the mid-November meeting of the Cominform in Hungary,. and the
 unanimous adoption there of his resolution calling for the unifi-
 cation of "large masses of the working class" regardless of their
 political, labor-union, or religious orientations.,
 However, the. presence of two prominent Longo followers,
 Dr'Griofrio and Cicalini, at this mating may indicate the existence

 Approved For ReleasW999/09/21: CIA-RDP79-01082Q`000200010003-5
 of an alternative plan of direct action, to be introduced possibly
 in the spring.  (Longo and Secchia were reportedly conferring
 with Satellite envoys in Rome at.the time the Cominform meeting
 was taking place.)
 The Italian communal elections due in March and April
 of 1950 may bring about severe losses for the moderate, mass
 party policy, resulting in a change of leadership from the
 Togliatti group to the direct action policy of Longo and Secohia..
 Such a shift would become even more probable should, by that time,
 the Cominform's winter campaign against Tito have failed and
 guerrilla warfare on the Yugoslav borders become a necessity.
 2. D.ISS~RTSION AND DEVIATION
 Nn-orbit. Areas
 Spain
 Disillusionment with Soviet leadership, resentment over
 Cominform action against Communists who fought in the Spanish
 Civil War,and Spanish regionalism have caused a spread of dissi-
 dence which is weakening the Spanish Communist Party (PCE).. These
 factors are likely to induce among the dissidents a more sympa-
 thetic attitude toward Tito, in view of his service in the Inter-
 national Brigades during the Civil War and his more palatible
 nationalist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism..
 The alleged arrest of Dolores Ibarruri, who reportedly
 has been at odds with Moscow because she objected to the treat-
 ment of Spanish Communists in the USSR, and the ouster of Juan
 Comorera, who resisted the Cominform order to Merge the Catalan
 and Basque Communists with the PCE, have further increased the
 tension within the Party.  Although Ibarruri  has, since her
 alleged arrest, participated in a conference in Moscow, she
 has probably lost favor with the Kremlin and only her ability to

 prevent the complete disintegration of the PCE has caused this
 tolerance.  This struggle for power among the Communist leader-
 ship probably is primarily responsible for the postponement of
 t'--e overdue Party Congress.
 France
 The French Communist Party (POF) is trying hard to
 prevent the spread of Titoism among its intellectual members
 and fellow travelers.  The appointment of Billoux, an ardent
 Stalinist, who will now handle the party's dealings with  intel-
 lectuals (formerly the task of Casanova), will result in efforts
 to return Jean Cassou to the fold.  It was Casou who first broke
 away from the Soviet camp to sing the praises of Tito.
 There is no evidence of critical dissension in the PCF,
 however,   Rumors concerning the removal of Thorez as Secretary
 General of the Party appear to be unfouded   Even thrr,.ugh
 Cachin, after a visit to Moscow, revealed that Stalin has more,
 faith in such militants as Mauvais, Fajon and Marty than in
 Thorez and Duclos, the generous publicity accorded by the party
 organs to Thorez's new book Fils du Peu-.e seems to indicate that,
 at least for the time being, Thorez is not out of favor or about
 to be removed from office.
 Un't"  ed Kingdom
 The Tito-Cominform rift has even reached follow-travel-
 ing circles in the United Kingdom resulting in a split in the
 British-Yugoslav Friendship Society at a meeting on 16 November
 The Stalinists proposed a resolution denouncing Tito and pledging
 support of the true Stalinists in Yugoslavia.  The resolution
 passed by a vote of 72-54, but it reflected such an irreconcilable
 division of opinion that Zilliacus announced that he would form
 a new pro-Tito Society.  The intensity of the division on this
 subject could conceivably affect the UK Communist Party (UKCP),

 Norway
 As a corrollary to the recent expulsion of the leaders
 of the so-called Furubotn faction, the Norwegian Communist Party
 (NKP) is presently in a state of turmoil.  While this situation
 greatly weakens the Party, there is little reason to conclude that
 this state of affairs will be permitted to continue much longer.
 An extraordinary Party Congress, scheduled for February 1950, will
 in all probability confirm the action already taken by Party Chair-
 man LOvlien and his supporters.  Although the dissident element
 may form an independent organization, it is not likely that it will
 assume significant proportions because the LOlvlien group represents
 the official party, retains control of the NKP administrative
 machinery and press, and has almost three months in which to insure
 that the majority of the Congress delegates will be LOviien sup-
 porters.
 India
 P.. C. Joshi,.former secretary-general of the Communist
 Party of India, is reportedly attempting to organize a rival
 organization under the name of the Red Flag Communist Party of
 India.  Joshi,, whose minority faction was recently expelled from
 the CPI for advocating that the party employ non-violent tactics
 at present, may be joined by members of the Andhra Communist Party,
 which was recently expelled from the CPI for its nationalist ten-
 dencies.:                                  If Joshi can weld these diverse elements into an orgm),-
 i:zed political party, such a party may come to have considerable
 importance in Indian politics..

 Dissension within the Communist hierarchy is not limited
 to areas outside the Soviet orbit.  It is also. apparent in the
 Satellite parties where nationalism, opportunism and incompetency
 have resulted in widespread purges designed to strengthen the hold
 of the ruling clique on the state and thereby to consolidate Soviet
 contrc .

 Czechoslovakia
 The Czechoslovak Communist Party will undergo a purge
 in December to "rid the Party of hostile elements."  The purge
 will nrobably be a relatively moderate affair; springing less
 from any specific "nationalist deviation" than the necessity'to
 impress upon Party members the responsibilities of their member-
 ship.
 Bulgaria
 Continuing purges of all ranks within the Bulgarian
 Communist Party are intended to eradicate Bulgarian nationalism
 and facilitate the extension of Soviet control over the Bulgarian
 state apparatus.  Nevertheless, despite the purge, the majority
 of Bulgarian Communists would welcome a greater degree of indepen-
 dence from the Kremlin and this attitude will. probably persist
 as long as Tito is successful in his  defiance of the Soviet Union
 and as long as Soviet exploitation of Bulgaria continues.
 Rumania
 Rumanian Communist leaders, whose firm control has
 prevented the emergence of any widespread anti-Soviet trend within
 the Party, are pursuing a quiet but effective party purge begun
 in June.  The Rumanian purge, which has been conducted, without
 fanfare, does not appear to have produced the feeling of terror
 that has developed among all ranks of the Bulgarian Party as a
 result of the ruthless Bulgarian purge:  As a result, the Rumanian
 Party will emerge from the current shake-up a stronger and even
 more reliable instrument of Soviet policy than at present.

 nationalist Communists Goriulka, Spychalski, and Kliszko, as well

 as the removal of lesser Communists and former Socialists from
 their Government and party jobs, indicates that the Polish Commu-
 nist Party is endeavoring to tighten its control of the Govern-
 ment and Party apparatus,  Besides dismissal from the Communist
 Party and Government of unreliable and deviationist elements,
 other steps recommended by President Beirut for Polandts first
 purge include:  (1) demotion of some party members to candidate
 status, (2) new elections of party officials throughout the party
 hierarchy from cell groups through provincial committees, and
 (3) the development of mass party training, stronger cadres, and
 greater self-criticism.
 3.  CHANGE IN TACTICS
 Greece
 The Greek Communist leadership has finally formalized
 the shift in emphasis away from military matters which has been
 taking place since last Augustt.s defeats.  On 4 November, after
 all hopes of a favorable UN compromise of the Greek issue had
 faded, the "Free Greece" radio announced that the party Central
 Committee, meeting on 9 October, had decided on a "temporary with-
 drawal" of the main guerrilla forces to prevent their annihilation
 and a shift in the party effort's "center of gravity" to political
 and economic struggles.  The approximately 1,400 guerrillas still.
 in Greece have evidently been instructed to reorganize into small
 squads under political commissars, for sporadic sabotage and
 terrorism.  The rebuilding of the Communist intelligence, supply,
 and recruiting network, broadcast on 25 .November, outlined a broad
 program for utilizing labor unrest as a basis for an "open political
 struggle."
 At the moment, the Communists are too weak to match
 these words with deeds.  Nevertheless, the preliminary work now
 being done may yield significant results in coming months,  If
 winter conditions hamper Greek security forces, guerrilla organizers
 will enjoy a certain freedom of action in outlying communities.
 In the cities, the long-deferred surge of labor agitation for higher
 wages--while not inspired by the Communists--may eventually pro-
 vide them with a substantial labor following, if government in-
 eptitude in handling the situation continues.  Gradual government

 release of former political prisoners will undoubtedly contribute
 to the Communist political reserve.  Meanwhile, the guerrillas
 outside Greece, although they pose problems of morale and dis-
 cipline, still represent a force-in-being of some 12,000.
 4.  NN.AREAS OF MANIFESTED COMMUNIST INTEREST
 Tibet - Nepal
 Communist control of Tibet, which may be effected in
 1950 through occupation of that country by forces of the Chinese
 Communist regime, under pretext of reestablishing the Panchen
 Lama (now a tool of the Chinese Communists), would. not only increase
 Communist pressure along India's borders, but also would allow added
 infiltration of foreign Communist agents into India and render easier
 the subversion of elements of northoo,storn Ind .snot heretofore easily
 reached.  The significance to India of Chinese Communist control in
 Tibet does not lie in the long but seldom-crossed common frontier
 to the northwest between India and Tibet.  Rather i-U concerns the
 effect of Communism in Tibet on the neighboring country of Nepal
 and on the semi-independent Indian State of Sikkim, ':c nth of those :teas
 possess well-developed communication with Tibet,  '- .nd
 both have much in common, culturally and racially, with the Tibetans.
 These peoples, at the same time, have similar ties with the neigh-
 boring hill tribes within India proper; ahould they espouse Commu-
 nism, subversion of the populations to the South and East within
 the Indian borders would become a much easier task. Considerable
 social unrest already exists in both places.  In Sikkim, there is
 popular dissatisfaction with both the Maharaja and the Government
 of India, which took over the administration of the state last
 June when an insurrection led by the Sikkim State Congress appeared
 imminent.  In Nepal, there appears to be sufficient social malaise
 to render the people of the country vulnerable to the type of
 proselytizing which could be expected if their Tibetan neighbors
 adopt Communism; moreover., some dissident elements have already
 shown a pro-Communism bias.

 5.  SOVIET FINANCING OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES
 Tha i land
 Two independent reports indicate that Soviet sources
 occasionally give financial assistance to the Vietnam News Service
 in Bangkok and have subsidized several Bangkok Chinese language
 papers among which is the leading Communist-line CHUAN MIN PAO.
 This information constitutes the first evidence that direct Soviet
 financial support is being accorded to either presumably sympa-
 thetic news agencies or definitely nro-Communist newspapers in
 the Fngkok area.  While this information is still unconfirmed,
 certain credence is lent by several other reports of-Chinese
 Communist financial support of a group of Thai language newspapers.
 Apparently the USSR Legation, while ostensibly maintaining the
 position of an observation post in Bangkok, has actually entered
 other fields of activity, even if only on a very limited basis.
 Iran
 Soviet financial aid was reportedly given to at least
 one of the parliamentary opposition candidates who is said to
 have been involved in the plot against Minister of Court Hajli,
 who was assassinated in early November.  If true, this support is
 another indication of the renewed vigor with which the USSR is
 trying to exploit the unrest precipitated by the pf;r;1.in,mentary
 elections and by Hajli's murder,

 previously focussed - largely without success - in Western Europe
 and the US, shifted to the economically underdeveloped areas of
 Asia, Africa and Latin America.
 Latin America
 Continuation of the "peace" campaign was chiefly
 noticeable in Latin America where "peace" speeches were made by
 Communists in Uruguay, Brazil and Chile.  Communist peace propa-
 ganda appeared in Mexico and Cuba in connection with other Commu-
 nist activities.  Formation of a "Peace Committee" in Mexico was
 started and rumors of the creation of a similar committee in Peru
 wore reported.  Several local "peace" committees were reportedly
 set up in Venezuela.  This campaign is probably being used to
 coordinate and strengthen the Latin Ara;rican Communist movement,
 following intimations by Moscow which wore critical of Latin
 American Communist activities.
 India
 Opposition to Nehru's commitment of India to the Anglo-
 American bloc was the theme of the manifesto unanimously adopted
 at the All-India Conference of Partisans for Peace held in Calcutta
 from November 24-27.  Organizations participating in the conference
 included the Communist Party of India, the All-India Trade Union
 Congress, the All-India Students Federation, the Progressive Writer's
 .'Psoeiation, the Friends of the Soviet Union, the Indian People's
 Theatre Association and the All-India Kisan Sabha.  The confor6nce
 ended with a torchlight procession in which illuminated portraits
 of Stalin, Lenin, Paul Robeson, Mao Tse-tung and Ana Paukor wore
 carried.
