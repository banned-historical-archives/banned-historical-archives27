 The International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), after a period
 of several years of waning influence and activity, has, within the past
 year, given evidence that it intends to pursue a far more active role a-
 mong journalists of the world than it has in the past.
 Indicative of this have been the following events:
 1.  Election of a new Secretary General.
 2.  Decision to hold a Congress (2 years overdue).
 3.  Establishment of an International Solidarity Fund to aid
 "persecuted" journalists.
 4.  Re-application to the UNESCO for Consultative Status.
 5.  Planning of an international meeting of journalists.
 6.  Discussion of the establishment of an international institute
 of journalism.
 7.  Publication of a new monthly organ in five languages.
 The fact that the new IOJ publication is now printed in Spanish
 indicates that Latin America will be among the areas of increased activity.
 This view is further borne out by the report that Chilean and Brazilian
 representatives attended the most recent meeting of the Executive Com-
 mittee of the IOJ.  Neither of these two countries have been identified
 with the activities of the IOJ in the past.
 There is also evidence that countries of the Middle East will come    25X1C10 b
 in for greater attention by the IOJ.                    _
 Recipients of this study are requested to forward to headquarters
 all pertinent material relating to the IOJ so that the examination of
 the IOJ begun in this study may be continued.

 The International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), not to be con-
 fused with the non-Communist International Federation of Journalists, is
 an international Communist-front organization whose membership is composed
 of professional journalists in various parts of the world, principally in
 the U.S.S.R. and the "People's Democracies."
 Although originally conceived of as a nonpolitical organization the
 IOJ soon fell under Communist influence and control and since 1947 has
 been used as an instrumentality of Soviet propaganda.
 The professed aims of the IOJ--freedom of the press, promotion of
 international friendship and'understanding through free interchange of
 information, promotion of trade unionism among journalists, support of
 "persecuted" journalists--have been-consistently distorted by the IOJ to
 support Communist objectives and to promote the Communist concept of the
 role of the press and other matters affecting freedom of information,
 responsibility of journalists, etc.
 At the same time the IOJ has sought to stigmatize the press of Western
 countries as being in the hands of capitalist monopolies which forced
 journalists to glorify war and incite animosity and distrust among nations,
 and which did not permit journalists to express their own opinions on war,
 peace, freedom, and slavery.
 On the other hand, the IOJ has completely evaded the issue of govern-
 ment control and censorship over the press in Communist countries, or else
 has characterized it as a press responsible to the people and engaged in
 the promotion of peace.
 The IOJ was founded in June 1946 in Copenhagen at the World Congress
 of Journalists.   It was an outgrowth of the prewar International Federation
 of Journalists (founded 1926) and the wartime Journalists of Allied or
 Free Countries, both of which  met and then formally dissolved immediately
 preceding the Congress.  One hundred and ten representatives from the
 following countries took part in the Congress:  Australia, Belgium, Czech-
 oslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Greece, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, New
 Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland,. South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, the United
 Kingdom, the U.S.A., and Yugoslavia.  The U.S.S.R. was represented by
 David ZASLAVSKY of Pravda and Red Army correspondent ZURKOV, fnu, but was
 not formally a member.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400220001-2
 The provisional constitution of the IOJ adopted by the Congress did
 not disclose any political objectives, but limited the aims of the organ-
 ization to those which were the legitimate concern of journalists, name-
 ly:
 1.     The protection of freedom of the press and of journalists, and
 the defense of the public's right to accurate information.
 2.   The promotion of international friendship and understanding
 through free exchange of information.
 3.   The promotion of trade unionism among journalists.
 The provisional constitution also stipulated that the IOJ would be
 composed of national organizations of working journalists whc subscribed
 to trade union principles, with only one organization from each country
 eligible for membership.
 Headquarters of the. IOJ were temporarily established in London, and
 Archibald KENYON of the British National Union of Journalists was named
 President, with Keith BEAN of Australia as Secretary General.
 The following were elected as Vice Presidents:
 U.S.A.:     Milton MURRAY of the American Newspaper Guild
 Norway:     Tor GJESDAL
 France:     Eugene MOREL
 U.S.S.R.:     SVERLOF (Probably Alexander SVERLOF of Tass)
 The election of SVERLOF was apparently done in the expectation that
 the U.S.S.R. would fulfill membership requirements.
 The 21d Congress of the IOJ took place in Prague.3-6 June 1947, and
 was attended by 250 journalists representing more than 25 countries.  The
 Soviet delegation was composed of SVERLOF, Pave] YUDIN, AlexeiSURKOV, and
 the delegation head, David ZASLAVSKY (ZASLAVSKIY).
 The stated purpose of the Congress was to discuss freedom of the
 press, to work out principles and means of protection of freedom of infor-
 mation, and to make plans for a new constitution.
 The attitude of the U.S.S.R. at the Congress at first threatened to
 disrupt the organization.  Although it had been represented at the founda-
 tion congress in Copenhagen, the U.S.S.R. was not a member of the IOJ and
 Approved For Releas                             000400220001-2
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400220001-2
 had not responded to invitations to make its position clear.  ZASLAVSKY
 explained that the Soviet Union had looked upon itself as a member by
 reason of its attendance at the Copenhagen Congress, and gave assurances
 that thereafter it would fulfill all the obligations connected with mem-
 bership.  The U.S.S.R. was accordingly recognized as a full member of the
 IOJ without further negotiation.
 By taking advantage of the lack of preparation and indifference of
 their opponents, the Communist bloc was able to maneuver itself into a
 position of control from this point on.
 The entire conference was marked by stormy debates and bitter
 wrangling on every issue.  Even the applications for membership of in-
 dividual countries caused many arguments.
 In the final result the applications for membership of Bulgaria,
 Hungary,  Palestine, the Philippines,  Rumania, Venezuela, and the exiled
 Spanish Republican journalists (with'headquarters in Paris), were ap-
 proved.                             The applications of Egypt and Iran were referred to the Execu-
 tive Committee for further negotiation.
 There was also a wide divergence of opinion on the meaning of freedom
 of the press.  Thus, the resolution on press freedom which was proposed
 at the Copenhagen Congress and adopted unanimously at the Prague Congress
 declared that freedom of the press is a fundamental principle of. democracy
 and urged journalists to do their utmost to resist any measures to curb
 freedom of the press.  At the same time, however, it put the conference
 on record as recognizing that
 "  ... press freedom can never be fully assured while news-
 papers, news agencies, and broadcasting systems are solely
 in the hands of individuals or private monopolies. with no
 responsibility to the people ...
 The fact that the resolution obtained a favorable vote from the
 non-Communists at the Congress is another glaring instance of how ineptly
 the Western point of view had been presented in the IOJ.
 Also discussed during the Congress was the affiliation of the IOJ
 with the World Federation of Trade Unions, but no agreement was reached.
 One of the amendments to the constitution of the IOJ sought to change
 the system of voting from one vote per country to a proportional system
 of 1 vote for-each 1,000 members, with a maximum of 10 votes.  The Com-
 munist bloc was able to forestall this effort, which would have given them

 L
 less weight in all IOJ deliberations, and it was finally decided to defer
 a decision on the matter until the next IOJ Congress, which was to take
 place in Brussels in 1949.
 The Congress also decided to transfer the headquarters and funds of
 the IOJ to Prague.
 Election of new officers produced the following results:
 President:         Archibald KENYON (Great Britain)
 Vice President:          Milton MURRAY (U.S.)   (Later succeeded by Harry
 MARTIN. of the American
 Newspaper Guild)
 Eugene MOREL (France)
 Pavel YUDIN (U.S.S.R.)
 Gunnar NIELSON (Denmark)
 Secretary General: Jiri HRONEK (Czechoslovakia)
 As a result of the Prague Congress the IOJ emerged with its key posi-
 tion (the secretary generalship), its headquarters, and a majority vote
 in the hands of the Communists.
 The Congress accomplished little in the way of practical achievement.
 At the conclusion of the Congress Milton MURRAY charged that the IOJ had
 been brought completely under Soviet domination and expressed doubt that
 it could function freely enough in the future to ensure a free press.
 Similar views were expressed by Archibald KENYON, who stated:   "We have
 seen at this conference maneuvers which are a disgrace to democracy.  We
 have sat here four days and accomplished nothing.   If that is the way the
 organization is going to be conducted, then the sooner we breakup the
 better."
 On 21 June 1947 the International Executive Board of the American
 Newspaper Guild announced that it had voted to withold per capita pay-
 ments to the IOJ until at least 1948, as a result of the report received
 from Milton MURRAY concerning Soviet domination of the IOJ.
 On 1 July 1947 the headquarters of the IOJ was physically transferred
 from London to Prague III, Lutzowova 5.
 On 23-24 February 1948 the Executive Committee of the IOJ met in Brus-
 sels.  The meeting was attended by representatives from the U.S.A., Austria,
 Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland,
 Rumania, Bulgaria, Great Britain, and Spain (exiles).

 The primary purpose of this meeting was to formulate plans for IOJ
 participation in the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information
 tQ be held in Geneva on 23 March 1948, and for which the IOJ had been in-
 vited to undertake preparatory work.
 Other items of the agenda included:
 1.  Affiliation of the IOJ with the World Federation of Trade Unions
 (WFTU).
 2.  Incorporation of the International Radio Journalists' Federation
 into the IOJ.
 3.  Procedure for protecting journalists.
 The Executive Committee decided to send four representatives from
 the IOJ to attend the Geneva conference, and prepared a list of proposals
 to be submitted.   (See Section VI.)
 In connection with the affiliation of the IOJ with the WFTU, the
 Executive Committee instructed Jiri HRONEK, IOJ Secretary General, to
 obtain further information on the method of affiliation.  HRONEK sub-
 sequently reported-that the WFTU had advised that it was not contemplating
 setting up a-trade department for journalists, but that possibly the IOJ
 could be included in one of the other trade departments to begin func-
 tioning soon.   (Note:  While the IOJ "cooperates" with the WFTU, it has not
 become affiliated with it.)
 The Executive Committee decided against the incorporation of the
 International Radio Journalists' Federation into the IOJ, and apparently
 gave no serious consideration to the procedures to be adopted for .the
 protection of journalists, the remaining item on the agenda.
 The next meeting of the Executive Committee of the IOJ took place in
 Budapest on 16-18 November 1948 and was attended by representatives of ap-
 proximately 16 countries, with Eastern. European countries being in the
 majority.  Representatives from the U.S.S.R. included Pavel YUDIN and
 David ZASLAVSKY.  Greece refused to attend.
 The proposed agenda for this meeting included the following items:
 1.  Report by the Secretary General on activities of the IOJ.
 2.  A complaint filed by the American Newspaper Guild against the
 Secretary General, together with a proposal to transfer the head-
 quarters of the IOJ from Prague.

 3.   Proposal against "warmongering" in the press.
 it.  Protection of "persecuted, progressive" journalists.
 5.   International exchange of journalists.
 Item No. 2 of the proposed agenda had been submitted by Harry MARTIN,
 President of the American Newspaper Guild, who charged Jiri HRONEK with
 participating in and approving the purge of Czech journalists (during
 the coup) and questioned whether funds of the IOJ were safe in Prague.
 At the meeting, however, MARTIN did not demand the inclusion of this
 item and it was not included in the formal agenda.
 The meeting accomplished little in the way of practical results due
 to the acute political differences which arose between East and West, and
 the discussions which took place only accentuated these differences.
 An unsuccessful attempt was made to eliminate the questions of op-
 position to "warmongering" in the press and opposition to the "persecution"
 of "progressive" journalists.  MARTIN requested that these questions be
 postponed until the 3d Congress, while the British delegate objected to
 the discussion of these questions on the ground that they were political
 questions and that the IOJ should not deal with politics but confine it-
 self to trade union matters.
 Despite these efforts, and over the objection of the American, Brit-
 ish, Belgian, Dutch, and Swedish delegates, all of whom withdrew from the
 discussions, the Executive Committee passed a strongely worded resolution
 on warmongering which had been submitted by the Polish delegate, Joseph
 KOWALCZYK.  As a result Harry MARTIN withdrew from the conference.
 This resolution, which branded a number of American and other jour-
 nalists as "foul warmongers" who had sold their pens to the newspaper
 monopolies and had used the sacred right of freedom of the press to the
 detriment of humanity, stated the following:
 "The world has been living during the last few years
 in an atmosphere of steadily increasing anxiety and ten
 sion caused by the war of nerves or 'cold war' which is
 led with growing and irresponsible ruthlessness by the capi-
 talist groups of Western countries.
 "The Executive Committee thinks ... that a paramount
 role is played by powerful news agencies and press organs

 wielded by capitalist press monopolies.  By means of false
 information, calumnies and open instigation to 'atomic war,'
 they foment a war psychosis  ...  .
 "This war propaganda hays attained its climax in the
 United States, Turkey, and The Netherlands, where in col-
 umns of daily newspapers open appeals to war can be read
 and where false and tendentious information and calumnies
 directed against the USSR and people's democracies are the
 usual method of informing people about life in the latter
 countries."
 The resolution also called upon the national organizations to expel
 from their ranks those journalists who "have soiled themselves with prop-
 aganda for war, racial and national hatred, misinformation and slander."
 A Hungarian resolution on the "persecution of progressive" jour-
 nalists was also adopted in the same manner.  This resolution demanded
 an investigation of the murder of George POLK, and protested the mistreat-
 ment of such "progressive" journalists and writers as Howard FAST, Gerhardt
 EISLER and John GATES in the United States, Marino GLEZAS in Greece, and
 the suppression of "progressive" newspapers in Austria.
 The Executive Committee adopted the proposal for an international
 exchange of journalists, and also observed that the IOJ had hitherto
 waged an insufficiently active struggle for peace.
 The net result of this meeting was that instead of promoting inter-
 national cooperation among journalists, it only succeeded in increasing
 friction.
 The next meeting of the Executive Committee took place in Prague
 on 17-19 September 1949, and was presided over by Pavel YUDIN of the
 U.S.S.R.
 The primary purpose of the meeting was to prepare for the 3d Congress
 of the IOJ, scheduled to take place in Brussels 5-7 December 1949.  The
 Executive Committee decided that as a result of nonpayment of dues the
 American Newspaper Guild had placed itself outside the ranks of the in-
 ternational organization and would have no voice in the forthcoming Con-
 gress, or proposals concerning the agenda.   It also adopted a Hungarian
 resolution to expel Yugoslavia at the Congress.
 Another decision was to invite tc the forthcoming IOJ Congress rep-
 resentatives of the World Peace Movement and other "progressive" international

 organizations.  The text of an appeal to all journalists in connection
 with International Peace Day (2 October 1949) was also adopted.
 Without referring to the Congress of the IOJ, as provided by its
 statutes, the Executive Committee accepted for membership journalists'
 unions from Albania, the "liberated" areas of China, the Eastern Zone
 of Germany, and "democratic" Greece.
 All those who spoke at the meeting condemned what was described as
 attempts of leaders of the American Newspaper Guild and the British Na-
 tional Union of Journalists directed towards splitting the IOJ, and em-
 phasized that the leaders of these organizations had gone over to the
 service of the instigators of a new world war.
 This Executive Committee meeting was apparently called without the
 prior knowledge of its President, Archibald KENYON, and he subsequently
 declined to attend the meeting, describing it as a "political maneuver."
 KENYON resigned from the IOJ and with him the British National Union of
 Journalists.
 In his letter of resignation to Jiri HRONEK, Secretary General of
 the IOJ, KENYON stated:
 "The so-called World Peace Movement is universally
 known to be inspired and organized by the Cominform and
 their adherents in various guises.
 "To bring it into the IOJ is to destroy the only pos-
 sible basis of cooperation among journalists representing
 in democratic countries a press in which all sorts of po-
 litical opinion can be freely expressed and, in the party
 dictatorship countries, a press which reflects only a com-
 pulsory unanimity of political opinion.
 "The Executive Committee having agreed to take part in
 a political movement and thus use the IOJ as a party pup-
 pet, I must dissociate myself completely from this degrada-
 tion of principle and purpose."
 One of the original purposes of the IOJ was to promote international
 cooperation among journalists in matters which affected their professional
 interests.  This had been an important factor in maintaining unity in the
 organization in the face of mounting tension on political issues which
 came to pervade its proceedings.

 NO
 By the latter part of 1949, if not before, it was apparent that the
 IOJ had lost its original character as an international trade union body
 of journalists and. had become an organ, of Communist propaganda.
 The non-Communist affiliates of the IOJ were therefore left with no
 alternative but to withdraw from the organization.  Following the resigna-
 tion of the British National Union of Journalists an exodus of non-Com-
 munist affiliates took place, leaving the IOJ as an organization composed
 almost exclusively of Communists and fellow travelers and with a virtual
 monopoly of the international representation of journalists.  Several
 years were to elapse before a new, non-Communist international organization
 of journalists was created.
 By the end of 1949 national journalist organizations from the fol-
 lowing countries had left the IOJ:  Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Great
 Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, the United
 States, and Finland (Finnish Journalists' Association).  Yugoslavia with-
 drew prior to its formal expulsion, whereas Australia had disaffiliated
 as early as April 1948.  On the other hand, Israel did not withdraw until
 1952.
 The 3d Congress of the IOJ was not held in Brussels in 1949, as
 previously planned, due to the withdrawal of the Belgian Journalists'
 Union, which had extended the invitation at the Prague Congress in 1947.
 The Congress was rescheduled to be held in Paris in March 1950 with
 the CGT Syndicat National des Journalistes as hosts.  However, protests
 by the non-Communist journalist unions of France led the French govern-
 ment to decline the issuance of visas to Jiri HRONEK, Secretary General
 of the IOJ, and other delegates from Satellite countries, and again the
 Congress was postponed.
 The 3d Congress was finally held in Helsinki on 15-17 September 1950..
 Host organization for the Congress was the General Newspapermen's Union
 of Finland, composed exclusively of Communist and Communist-front jour-
 nalists.  The Finnish Journalists' Association, which withdrew from the
 IOJ at the same time as other free newspaper groups, did not participate
 in the Congress.
 The Congress was attended by 62 delegates and guests, which included
 representatives of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace, World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions, World Federation of Democratic Youth, Women's Inter-
 national Democratic Federation, and the International Union of Students.

 justify his claim to speak for American journalists.
 Effective Soviet direction of the Congress, which resembled a "Peace
 Congress" rather than a meeting of professional men, was exercised by
 the delegates Boris BURKOV and David ZASLAVSKY.
 The agenda for the Congress included the following items:
 1.  Report of the Secretary General.
 2.  Tasks of democratic journalists in the fight for peace.
 3.  The moral and material conditions of journalists in various
 countries.
 4.  Change in statutes.

 One of the first acts of the Congress was to admit to membership in
 the organization the Vietnam Journalists' Union, the Free Journalists of
 Democratic Korea, and the Journalists' Union of the Mongolian People's
 Republic.
 The Congress also endorsed the participation of the IOJ in the
 Partisans of Peace Movement, and launched a bitter attack on journalists'
 organizations in capitalist countries, which they accused of having
 sabotaged the work of the IOJ, and, when exposed, having proceeded to an
 open schism.
 The Congress protested the persecution of "honest" journalists and
 pledged itself to do everything to liberate its imprisoned colleagues.
 The Executive Committee was instructed to study the creation of an in-
 ternational fund for the aid of persecuted journalists.   "Democratic"
 journalists were called upon to struggle against the instigators of a new
 war, and war propaganda, and the Executive Committee and Secretariat
 were charged with the preparation of a black list of warmongers.
 In other actions Yugoslavia was formally expelled, and the Executive
 Committee was instructed to reconsider the raising of dues and to re-
 determine the assessment of different organizations,
 Changes in the statutes were also voted on.  The preamble of the
 new statutes stated that the main aim of the IOJ was the struggle for
 peace all over the world, and for a better future for humanity, and to
 attain this end the IOJ would cooperate with other international organiza-
 tions which fight for peace.  Those enumerated were the Peace Movement,
 World Federation of Trade Unions, Women's International Democratic Federa-
 tion, World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union
 of Students.
 The aims and tasks of the IOJ as outlined in the new statutes are
 as follows:
 1.    The maintenance of peace and the broadening of friendship among
 the peoples, as well as international understanding through free,
 accurate, honest informing of public opinion.  The struggle
 against the spreading of war psychosis and war propaganda, against
 fascist propaganda of any sort, against national or racial hatred,
 and against the creation of international tension by means of
 falsehoods and calumnies.
 2.   The protection of freedom of the press and of journalists against
 the influence of monopolies and financial groups.  The defense of

 the right of each journalist to write according to his conscience
 and conviction.  The protection of the rights of colonial peoples
 and of national minorities to publish in their native language.
 Support to journalists who have been persecuted for having taken
 up their pens in defense of peace, progress, justice, and the
 liberty and independence of their country.
 3. The protection of all journalists' rights.  The struggle for
 bettering material conditions of their existence..  The gathering
 and dissemination of all information concerning the living con-
 ditions of journalists in all countries (collective agreements,
 salaries, right to organize, etc.).  Support for the trade union
 movement in the struggle for journalists' union demands.
 4.  The protection of the people's right to receive free and honest
 information, the struggle against falsehood, calumnies, and
 systematic misinformation by the press, as well as against every
 form of journalistic activity in the service of individuals or
 particular groups of society whose interests are contrary to
 those of the working masses.
 Another change in the statutes involved membership in the IOJ.  Pre-
 viously, membership in the IOJ had been restricted to national organiza-
 tions of journalists.  However, the new statutes permitted membership not
 only of national organizations of journalists, but also of national groups
 and individual members.  Presumably this change in the statutes was adopted
 to counteract the effect of the large loss of membership in the IOJ oc-
 casioned by the withdrawal of the non-Communist affiliates, and also to
 enable the IOJ to secure representation in countries where it did not
 have organized national affiliates.
 Elections of new officers by the Congress produced the following
 results:
 President:             Jean-Maurice HERMANN (France)
 Vice Presidents:        Konstantin SIMONOV (U.S.S.R.)
 HU Ch'iao-mu (Communist China)

 Places were left open for one vice president each from.the United
 States and Great Britain, to be filled at a later date.
 The new president, Jean M. HERMANN, in the name of the French dele-
 gation invited the IOJ to hold its next Congress in 1952 in Paris.
 On the morning following the close of the Congress the Executive
 Committee of the IOJ met to act on organizational tasks which resulted
 from the resolutions of the Congress.  The Executive Committee also de-
 cided on an Editorial Board for the IOJ'publication.   Jiri HRONEK was
 appointed editor-in-chief, with Josef KLANSKY, also of Czechoslovakia,
 as secretary.
 In about February 1951 the headquarters of the IOJ was moved from
 Lutzowova 5 to Opletalova 21, Prague II.
 On 2 March 1951 the Bureau of the IOJ convened in Berlin.  The
 principal discussion appears to have concerned ways and means of imple-
 menting the decisions of the World Peace Council.  Apparently no decisions
 were reached, for it was decided to refer the subject to the next meeting
 of the Executive Committee.
 The next meeting of the Executive Committee took place in Budapest
 on 10-12 May 1951.  The dominant theme of the meeting was that the task
 of all honest journalists was the struggle for peace, and a resolution
 supporting the peace campaign was passed.    The President of the IOJ,
 Jean-Maurice HERMANN, stated that in accordance with the resolution a
 list of journalists guilty of incitement to war would be published.
 The delegates were called upon to draw up such lists for their respective
 countries and to forward them to the Secretary General.   (There is no
 evidence that such a list was ever published.)
 From this time until the fall of 1953 the IOJ appears to have been
 dormant.  The 4th Congress, originally scheduled to take place in Paris
 in 1952, did not take place, although IOJ statutes call for a Congress
 to be held every 2 years.  During this same period the Secretary General
 of the IOJ, Jiri HRONEK, apparently fell into disfavor for reasons which
 are not presently clear.
 In October 1953 the IOJ began to show signs of'rejuvenation.  A
 meeting of the Executive Committee was held in Prague on 7-9 October at
 which representatives of 12 countries were reported to have attended.
 Among those present were:

 K. M. SIMONOV (U.S.S.R.)
 D. F. KRAMINOV (U.S.S.R.)
 LI Chung-Chi (Communist China)
 Leuben VELEV (Bulgaria)
 Shevket MUSARAI (Albania)
 During the session questions concerning the organization were dis-
 cussed, including the question of issuing an IOJ bulletin in five lan-
 guages.  All speakers stressed that in the past 2 years the organiza-
 tion had contributed little to strengthening cooperation among journalists
 of various countries.
 Various decisions were made aimed at making the IOJ more effective
 as an organization which "unites democratic journalists of many countries
 of the world who fight for peaceful cooperation, for a dignified and
 honest practice of the profession of journalism."
 The Executive Committee issued an appeal to journalists of all coun-
 tries which emphasized the great responsibility of journalists to mankind,
 the possibilities of peaceful coexistence, and the hope that the horrors
 of a new world war can be averted.  The appeal further invited journalists
 of all countries to cooperate closely for the realization of these noble
 principles.
 To serve this purpose the IOJ would help to make possible visits of
 journalists of all countries to other countries, as well as the exchange
 of information.
 The Executive Committee also issued a protest against the persecution
 of journalists for "truthful" reporting which aimed at the lessening of
 international tension.  The protest stated that journalists who endeavor
 to give true and objective information are entitled to expect support for
 their personal and professional rights.   It added that such journalists
 would be fully supported by the IOJ, which had established for this pur-
 pose an "international fund of solidarity."
 In other actions the Executive Committee elected Jaroslav KNOBLOCH
 of Czechoslovakia to succeed Jiri HRONEK as the new Secretary General of
 the IOJ, and decided to call the 4th Congress of the IOJ for the first
 half of 1954.

 This Congress (2 years overdue) was originally scheduled to be held
 in Sofia in May 1954.  The IOJ subsequently announced that the Congress
 had been postponed for "technical" reasons.  No information is presently
 available as to when and where the Congress will take place.
 In November 1953 the IOJ began publishing a new monthly organ, en-
 titled The Democratic Journalist, in five languages (French, German,
 English, Russian, and Spanish), with Jaroslav KNOBLOCH as the responsible
 editor.  During this same month Spanish-language editions of this publica-
 tion appeared in Panama, having been mailed by the IOJ in Prague to a
 number of Panamanian newspapers, including some that had been defunct
 for many years.
 The next (and most recent) meeting of the Executive Committee of the
 IOJ took place in Budapest on 15-17 October 1954, and was attended by
 representatives of journalists' organizations from the U.S.S.R., Communist
 China, France, Finland, German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 Rumania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Hungary, and by several Austrian, Danish,
 Chilean, Brazilian, and Indian journalists.
 The principal item on the agenda concerned the preparation for an
 international meeting of journalists, and for this purpose a special
 committee was appointed to make the arrangements.
 The Executive Committee. also authorized the IOJ Secretariat and the
 National Federation of Hungarian Journalists to examine the desirability
 of eventually establishing an "international institute of journalism,"
 and to submit the matter for further discussion at the next meeting of
 the Executive Committee.   Presumably, this institute would be located in
 Hungary if established.
 In addition, the Executive Committee passed resolutions regarding
 an increase in the exchange of news, and the strengthening of the Asian
 and Latin American journalists' movements.
 The first indication that an international meeting of journalists
 was contemplated by the IOJ (the first in its history) occurred in August
 1954 when it was reported that Jakov SILBER, chief editor of Kol.Haam in
 Tel Aviv, had been requested. by the IOJ to recommend a number of Middle
 Eastern journalists to be invited to attend a wide international meeting
 of journalists for the purpose of a free exchange. of opinion on important
 problems concerning the members of the journalist profession.

 SILBER was requested to recommend the following number of jour-
 nalists from each of the countries listed and, if possible, to furnish
 the characteristics of all persons recommended:
 Israel (7)                    Saudi Arabia (3)
 Iran (7)                      Lebanon (3)
 Syria (7)                     Egypt (7)
 Iraq (7)                      Turkey (12).
 In December 1954, the "Initiating Committee for a Broad International
 Meeting of Journalists," issued an appeal.  According to this appeal, the
 committee believed that the conference could be held toward the end of
 1955 either in the East or West, as would be more convenient for the
 majority of participants.
 The appeal went on to say that the conference could be organized
 in such a way that participants would have a chance to devote part of
 their time to becoming acquainted with the life in some country of interest
 to them and gathering firsthand impressions and accurate information
 necessary for writing articles or books imbued with concepts of true,
 objective reporting.
 In order to assure the broadest possible participation of journalists
 from the whole world, the appeal suggested that preparatory committees
 could be set up in those countries where it would serve a purpose.  These
 committees would be responsible for sending delegates to the international
 meeting, and possibly also for arranging a collection to cover the costs
 involved in the journey and stay of such delegates.
 The appeal concluded by urging journalists to take part in the
 international conference and to inform the committee of their opinion
 as to the topics for discussion and the date and place the conference
 should be held.  For all questions pertaining to the international con-
 ference the journalists were requested to write to the following address:
 Opletalova 5, Prague II.
 The above address is the international headquarters of the IOJ, but
 this fact was not mentioned in the appeal.
 The list of members of the Initiating Committee for a Broad Inter-
 national Meeting of Journalists will be found in the Appendix.
 In 1948 the IOJ claimed a total membership of 58,000, of which 14,000
 were from the U.S.S.R.   The withdrawal of the non-Communist affiliates,
 however, would have reduced this figure to approximately 22,000.   In
 November 1954 the IOJ claimed a membership of 56,000, but this figure ap-
 pears to be greatly exaggerated.

 II.  SOVIET DIRECTION OF THE IOJ AND POSSIBLE USE FOR ESPIONAGE PURPOSES
 According to one source the activities of the IOJ are controlled and
 directed by M.A. SUSLOV, chairman of the "International Bureau" of the
 Central Committee of the CPSU.  While this report is lacking in specific
 confirmation, it is in line with several other reports which state that
 SUSLOV is head of the Foreign Section of the Central Committee of the CPSU
 and in this capacity directs the activities of various international Com-
 munist-front organizations;
 According to the source, SUSLOV's "man of confidence" in Prague is
 Bruno KOHLER, and one of the principal functions of the Union of Czech-
 oslovak Journalists is to serve as a sort of base for the IOJ, supplying
 it with the necessary funds to fulfill the IOJ's propaganda and infiltra-
 tion assignments in the West.
 KOHLER, a former member of the Executive Committee of the Communist
 International, is presently a secretary of the Central Committee of the
 Czechoslovak Communist Party.  His wife was formerly Klement GOTTWALD's
 personal secretary.  Both are suspected of being Soviet agents.
 The source has further stated that Emmanuel D'ASTIER de la Vigerie
 is the IOJ "man of confidence" in France and is reported to have large
 funds with which to "corrupt" Western newspapermen.
 Emmanuel D'ASTIER de la Vigerie, who is active in several Communist-
 front organizations, is a director and one of the principal shareholders
 of the crypto-Communist newspaper Liberation, organ of the Union Progres-
 siste.  He is reported to be married to Lioubova KRASSINE, daughter
 of the first-Soviet ambassador to France.   Jean-Maurice HERMANN,
 President of the IOJ, is also reported to be one of the principal share-
 holders in Liberation.
 According to another source, Liberation was one of the French news-
 papers which received regular subsidies from the Czech Embassy in Paris.
 These subsidies from the Czech Embassy not only included cash, but news-
 print was also made available at nominal prices and occasionally checks
 were given to the newspaper purporting to represent funds collected from
 unions, etc.
 According to this same source, Liberation is controlled and directed
 by the French Communist Party and Jean-Maurice HERMANN is chief liaison
 with the FCP.

 The home of Emmanuel D'ASTIER de la Vigerie and the offices of Liber-
 ation were searched by French police in October 1954 in connection with
 the investigation of leaks from the French National Committee of Defense.
 The results of the search have not been disclosed.  D'ASTIER himself was
 among those called to testify before the French military magistrate con-
 ducting hearings on the matter.
 The findings of the military magistrate have not been made public
 as yet and the real facts in the case are still obscure.  According to
 some French press reports, which may or may not be correct, D'ASTIER
 received directly from Roger LABROUSSE, an employee of the Secretary of
 the National Committee of Defense, a report on the May 1954 meeting of
 the Committee, which D'ASTIER then transmitted to the FCP. D'ASTIER sub-
 sequently placed Andre BARANES, a Communist journalist and an employee
 of Liberation, in contact with LABROUSSE and it was BARANES to whom
 LABROUSSE gave subsequent reports on Committee meetings.   BARANES report-
 edly transmitted these reports directly to a FCP member of Parliament
 (presumably Jacques DUCLOS, who was also called before the military
 magistrate).
 Whether these reports ultimately reached Soviet or Satellite intel-
 ligence services has not been disclosed.
 BARANES also maintained police contacts with FCP approval.  A series
 of reports, purporting to represent information from the Political Bureau,
 were prepared by the FCP as deception material and given to BARANES for
 transmittal to Jean DIDES, a police inspector.  DIDES and BARANES were
 both arrested.

 III.  HEADQUARTERS AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE IOJ
 The headquarters of the IOJ was last reported to be located at
 Opletalova 5, Prague II.   Its present Secretary General is Jaroslav
 KNOBLOCH of Czechoslovakia.   Josef KLANSKY, also of Czechoslovakia, is
 Executive Secretary, or Assistant Secretary General.
 The Editorial Board of the IOJ publication, The Democratic Jour-
 nalist, of which KNOBLOCH is the responsible editor, is also located at
 Opletalova 5, Prague II.
 According to IOJ statutes, membership in the IOJ is composed of:
 a.  National unions of journalists
 b.  National groups of the IOJ
 c.  Individual members.
 In countries which are represented in the IOJ by national unions
 affiliated with the IOJ, no IOJ group can be formed and no individual
 adherence can be accepted to membership in the IOJ.  Admission of new
 members is effected through the Executive Committee, subject to final
 ratification by the Congress.
 The highest organ of the IOJ is the Congress, which is supposed to
 meet every 2 years.  The Congress is composed of delegations from the
 national organizations, national groups, and individual members.  Groups
 with less than 20 members, and individual members, have consultative voice
 only at the Congress.  The basis of representation at the Congress is
 established by the Executive Committee, which also prepares the agenda
 of the Congress.
 Between sessions of the Congress the Executive Committee acts as
 the supreme organ of the IOJ.   It is composed of representatives of the
 national organizations and of each national group, but national groups
 are not entitled to vote if they number less than 20 members.  The Ex-
 ecutive Committee is called into session at least once a year.
 Between sessions of the Executive Committee, current business of the
 IOJ is carried on by a Bureau which is composed of the President, six Vice
 Presidents, and the Secretary General, all elected by the Congress.

 Relations within the IOJ between organizations, groups, and in-

 direction of the Secretary General.  The General Secretariat edits the
 IOJ journal and also keeps the national organizations and groups in-
 formed of all its activity.

 IV.  IOJ FINANCES - INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY FUND
 The General Secretariat is charged with the financial administration
 of the IOJ.
 Insofar as overt finances are concerned the IOJ does not appear to
 have extensive funds at its disposal with which to carry out its obliga-
 tions.  According to one source the necessary additional funds are sup-
 plied by the Union of Czechoslovak Journalists, but no information is
 available as to the amounts supplied.
 In 1947, when membership in the IOJ was restricted to nationally
 organized affiliates, membership dues for each affiliate were established
 on the basis of 122$ per capita.  The claimed membership of the IOJ
 at that time was 58,000.  Assuming-that all affiliates were current in
 their dues payments, which was not the case, total annual receipts from
 this source would have amounted only to approximately $7,250.00.
 During the first 3 months after moving to Prague in July 1947, the
 IOJ was financed entirely by the Union of Czechoslovak Journalists.
 The 1948-49 budget of the IOJ was about $5,000.00.  Apparently
 this sum was not sufficient, for the IOJ subsequently found it necessary
 to increase dues to 182$ per capita in order to raise sufficient funds
 to cover expenses of the IOJ delegation to the Geneva Conference on Free-
 dom of Information.
 In 1950, when the IOJ statutes were changed to include membership
 not only of national affiliates but group and individual memberships as
 well, it became apparent that a new method of assessment was necessary.
 The 1950 Congress of the IOJ instructed the Executive Committee to ex-
 amine the question of raising dues and to re-determine the assessment
 of different organizations.
 The IOJ has made no announcement as to what action the Executive
 Committee took on the matter, if any, and no information is presently
 available regarding current assessments or the present financial status
 of the IOJ. ~t
 From- the very beginning the question. of protection of "persecuted"
 journalists has come up for discussion on a number of occasions at meet-
 ings of the IOJ, without any concrete action being taken.

 -111, TMQ_.QQLTR0T.
 At the Helsinki Congress in 1950 the IOJ again protested the
 "persecution" of "honest"                                                            journalists and for the first time instructed
 the Executive Committee to study the creation of an international fund
 with which to aid persecuted journalists.
 No immediate action appears to have been taken and it was not until
 over 3 years later that the IOJ was able to announce the establishment
 of such a fund.  This occurred at the Executive Committee meeting which
 took place in Prague in October 1953.
 The Statute of the International Solidarity Fund as announced by
 the IOJ at this meeting is as follows:
 "1.    The aim of the Fund:
 To render aid to the journalists, regardless of their nationality,
 religious  and political conviction, who are subjected to any
 type of discrimination and persecuted for truthful reporting,
 for utterances made for the benefit of peaceful cooperation
 among nations, and for protection of national sovereignty and
 democratic rights of nations.
 "2.   The means of the Fund:
 a.   The Fund is allotted the tenth part of every year's member-
 ship fees received by the IOJ, i.e., cash from the IOJ mem-
 ber organizations.
 b.   Besides that, IOJ member organizations and journalists,
 whether or not they are members of the national IOJmember
 organizations, will contribute to the assets of the Fund by
 both individual and collective donations, the extent of
 which depends in every case on their good will and material
 possibilities.
 "3.   Ways of rendering aid:
 Aid from the Fund can be rendered
 a.    Following a proposal of an organization which is a member
 of the IOJ;
 b.    Following a request of other democratic organizations and
 of offices of individual papers and other periodicals;

 c.   Following a request from individual journalists, who are
 subjected to persecution for the activity quoted in the
 paragraph on the aims of the Fund.  Aid will be rendered
 in accordance with decisions made by the IOJ Executive Com-
 mittee."
 In December 1953 the IOJ announced that the Union of Czechoslovak
 Journalists had contributed 50,000 crowns, and in February 1954 that the
 Hungarian affiliate had contributed 24,042.60 crowns to the Fund.
 It was also announced that the family of Emil ARNOLD was the first
 recipient of a grant from the Solidarity Fund.  ARNOLD, a member of
 the Swiss Labor Party (Communist), and editor of Vorwaerts, was sentenced
 to 8 months in prison in 1953 for making defamatory statements against
 the Swiss government in the Communist press and in lectures behind the
 Iron Curtain.

 Since the time that the Communists assumed control of the IOJ they
 have consistently made use of its position as an international organization
 to follow and promote the Soviet propaganda line on such subjects as the
 Korean war, the peace campaign, colonialism, etc., both among Journalists
 and the reading public at large.
 Within its own specialized field, that of journalism, the activities
 of the IOJ have largely been confined to the issuance of propaganda
 articles and statements by its leaders, and to resolutions by its ex-,
 ecutive bodies.  It has consistently sought to portray the non-Communist
 press as being in the hands of capitalist monopolies which corrupted the
 souls of people, their pens, and their thoughts, serving not Truth, but
 the Lie.  Variations of this theme have been that the Western press is
 not a free institution but an instrument in the hands of the capitalists
 employed to create a war hysteria and to disseminate calumnies and false*
 hoods against the U.S.S.R. and the People's Democracies.
 At the same time the IOJ has extolled the virtues of the Communist
 and "democratic" press which, according to the IOJ, is engaged in the
 promotion of peace and is responsible to the people.
 The IOJ has never acknowledged the absence of a free press in Com-
 munist-controlled countries, and has evaded the question of how freedom
 of the press can be reconciled with governmental or party monopoly of
 that institution.
 In the day-by-day workings of the office of the Secretary General,
 the position of the IOJ has been exploited to call attention to and pro-
 test against alleged violations of freedom of the press in non-Communist
 countries and, conversely, to cover its.systematic violation in the con-
 trolled press of Communist countries.  During his period of office, Jiri
 HRONEK, former Secretary General of the IOJ, launched a series of protests
 to various non-Communist governments, and on occasion to the United
 Nations, against purported violations of press freedom (such as visa
 restrictions for journalists, suppression of certain newspapers, arrest
 of journalists for "truthful" reporting, etc.).
 In no instance was action taken by the IOJ in any specific case to
 open the issue of censorship or governmental control of the press and
 of journalists of Communist countries.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400220001-2
 A particularly flagrant case occurred after the Communists acceded
 to power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, after which the Union of
 Czechoslovak Journalists expelled a number of non-Communist journalists.
 The only response by HRONEK to a series of protests by individuals and
 from the British, Danish, Dutch, and Swedish journalist organizations
 was merely to pass these on to the Czech affiliate with a request
 for a statement of its position.   The reply of the Czech affiliate,
 which was published in the IOJ Bulletin, was that the journalists had
 not been expelled for political views but for violation of the Czech
 journalists' act, which required objectivity in reporting.  These jour-
 nalists were stated not to have acted responsibly to the public, to have
 undermined alliances, slandered allies, and instigated reaction, and to
 have undermined the strength of the nation and endangered its security
 by false reporting.  The reply further stated:   "The Union of Czechoslovak
 Journalists will continue to defend freedom of journalist work which will
 be determined by the individual responsibility of journalists toward their
 people and their state."
 As to the question of suspended newspapers, the Czech affiliate simply
 stated that the political parties which published them decided to close
 them down because readers refused to read papers which attacked the
 people's democracy of the republic.

 VI.  RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
 In 1947 the IOJ was granted Consultative Status B in the proceedings
 of the Economic and Social Council of the U.N., and was later invited to
 undertake preparatory work for the World Conference on Freedom of Informa-
 tion to be held in Geneva in March 1948.  For this purpose the IOJ was
 granted Consultative Status A.
 To prepare for this conference the IOJ called a meeting of its Ex-
 ecutive Committee, which was held in Brussels on 23-24 February 1948.  The
 Committee decided to send Harry MARTIN (U.S.), Pavel YUDIN (U.S.S.R.),
 Jiri HRONEK (Czechoslovakia), and Archibald KENYON (Great Britain) as
 representatives of the IOJ to the conference; it also prepared a list of
 proposals to be submitted, of which the following were the most important:
 1.  An investigation of cartelization.in the field of mass communica-
 tion.
 2.  Formulation of plans to abolish censorship or the subjection of
 censorship practices to international rules and regulation.
 3.  The formulation of a code of conduct for the guidance of jour-
 nalists in their newspaper work.
 4.  The establishment of a "Court of Honor" in the United Nations--
 in cooperation with the IOJ--which would counteract the publica-
 tion of mendacious news stories by investigating to determine the
 pertinent facts and publish them for the benefit of the reading
 public.
 No final action was taken by the conference, and the subject of free-
 dom of information is still under discussion within the United Nations.
 On 20 July 1950 the UNESCO deprived the IOJ of its right to participate
 as a consultant in the Council's work, on the grounds that the IOJ took
 advantage of its consultative status merely to denounce other organizations
 and certain groups of governments, and did not contribute to the work of
 the Council.
 This action was protested by the IOJ, and at the Helsinki Congress in
 September 1950 a resolution was adopted which stated, in part, as follows:
 "The Congress confirms that this activity has never
 differed and will never differ from the principles on which

 the UNO itself is founded.   It protests against a decision
 which there has been no attempt to justify with concrete
 grievances..  In the conviction that this is only a tempo-
 rary episode in the world-wide attack which has been
 launched against the principles of peace and liberty by
 the forces who consider the application of these princi-
 ples to be a hindrance to the psychological preparation for
 a third world war, the Congress affirms its belief that a
 constant and friendly collaboration between the IOJ and
 other international organizations, and especially with the
 UNO, is more necessary than ever, and it will act accord-
 ingly.   The Congress calls on the member organizations to
 try to ensure that their national delegations in the UNO
 make representations on the subject of the decision taken
 against the IOJ and demand its abrogation."
 The IOJ was unsuccessful in the latter respect.  On 20 January 1954
 the IOJ, through its Secretary General, again petitioned the United Nations
 for permanent Consultative Status B in the Economic and Social Council of
 the U.N.   According to the IOJ, the appeal was prompted by its desire
 to participate in U.N. discussions on freedom of information to take place
 during 1954.
 No action has as yet been taken by the U.N. on the IOJ appeal.

 is presented in the following pages.
 HERMANN, Jean-Maurice (France)
 Secretary General of the CGT Syndicat National des Journalistes and
 President of the Communist front, International Organization of Jour-
 nalists (IOJ), Jean-Maurice Hermann is a former Socialist who, since
 World War II, has been closely affiliated with the French Communist Party
 (FCP) and is considered to be a crypto-Communist.  He is editor-in-chief
 of the Communist "international labor" publication, Cahiers Internationaux,
 organ of the Association pour 1'Etude des Problemes Economiques -et Sociaux
 and of the Societe de Publications et d'Etudes Socialistes, and is a

 was an editor of Action, now defunct weekly organ of the French Peace
 Movement.  Prior to World War II, Hermann served as an editor of the
 Socialist Party organ, Le Populaire.
 Hermann, who is believed to have been a deportee to Germany during
 the Occupation, was named to the Paris Consultative Assembly in July 1945
 as a representative of the resistance group Mouvement de Liberation
 Nationale (MLN).  When the Mouvement Socialiste  nitaire et Democratique
 was transformed into the Parti Socialiste Unitaire (PST [7     September
 1948, Hermann, previously a member of the extreme left wing of the French
 Socialist Party (SFIO), was elected to its political bureau.  In the same

 year he was named to the Permanent Committee of the French National Peace
 Movement and, in December 1951, was identified as one of the Vice Presi-
 dents of the FCP Resistance front organization, Federation. Nationale des
 Deportes, Internes et Resistants Patriotes (FNDIRP .  He is also under-
 stood to be on the Directing Committee of the Communist affiliate, Union
 Progressiste.
 Hermann is known to have attended the IOJ Executive Committee meet-
 ings of November 1948 and May 1951 at Budapest and the Third IOJ Congress
 at Helsinki in 1950, at which he was elected IOJ President.   In June 1948
 he served as a delegate to the International Conference of Left-Wing
 Socialists in Warsaw and, in December of that year, returned to Poland
 for the Union Congress of the Polish workers' parties.   In 1949 he ac-
 companied the late World Peace Council leader, Yves FARGE, and the late
 French Communist poet, Paul ELUARD, on a tour of "free Greece," and in
 1950 traveled to the U.S.S.R. for the Moscow May Day celebrations.
 Hermann was born 28 February 1905; he has resided in Paris for a
 number of years.
 SIMONOV, Konstantin (Kirill) Mikhailovich (U.S.S.R.)
 A leading figure among Soviet poets, Journalists, dramatists, and
 novelists, Simonov has been a Deputy Secretary General of the Union of
 Soviet Writers since 1946 and has long been one of the principal propa-
 gators of the Soviet Communist Party's cultural line.  At the 19th CPSU
 Congress in October 1952 he was elected a candidate member of the Party
 Central Committee.  Simonov, who became internationally famous for his
 writings during World War II, has also been a prominent official in the
 Soviet "peace" campaign, in the Communist-dominated International Organi-
 zation of Journalists (IOJ), and in other cultural and "front" organiza-
 tions.  He is particularly noted for the virulence of his attacks against
 the United States.
 K. M. Simonov was born in November 1915 in Petrograd (now Leningrad),
 the son of a laborer.  He went to middle school, then worked in a machine
 factory, and was employed during 1934-35 as a mechanic in a manufacturing
 plant. He is said to have first shown his literary talent in connection
 with Komsomol activities and as a workers' correspondent.  At the age of
 19 he received a scholarship from the Gorki-founded Moscow Literary Research
 Institute of the Union of Soviet Writers, which was established after the
 1932 literary reform to indoctrinate young Soviet authors. Here he studied
 from 1934 to 1938, at first at night school, later full time.  He is also
 a graduate of the Faculty of Literature of Moscow State University.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400220001-2
 In 1939 Simonov was appointed a troop unit newspaper reporter and
 covered the Normankan River Campaign against the Japanese in Mongolia.
 During World War II he served as a war correspondent for Red      and
 Pravda with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and in this capacity traveled
 to nearly all the war fronts (the Balkans, Austria, Czechoslovakia,
 Poland, Germany, and Finland).
 After the war Simonov emerged as a dominant figure in the Union of
 Soviet Writers, being elected a Deputy Secretary General in a shakeup of
 that organization's directing group in 1946.
 In addition to his position as a Deputy Secretary General, Simonov
 served as Chief of the Poetry Section of the Union of Soviet Writers, and
 in 1947 became Chairman of the Union's Foreign Division.  He also was
 made Chief of a new Foreign Publishing House (foreign books to be trans-
 lated into Russian).   In 1947 he was made a member of the new All-Union
 Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, and
 was identified as chief editor of Navy Mir (New World), the monthly
 literary-artistic and social-political organ of the Union of Soviet Writers,
 being later replaced by A.T. TVARDOVSKI but remaining on the Editorial
 Board.
 In February 1950 Simonov replaced V. ERMILOV as editor-in-chief of
 Literary Gazette, after that periodical had undergone attack for incon-
 sistency in dramatic criticism and for displaying no inclination to self-
 criticism.
 Since the end of World War II, Simonov has made numerous trips
 abroad.  In May 1945 he recited his poems at a cultural workers' meeting
 in Prague and the following year was in Japan to study cultural, scientific,
 and social conditions; he also visited France and the Balkans.  With Ilya
 EHRENBURG and Maj. Gen. Mikhail R. GALAKTIONOV he came to the United
 States early in 1946 at the invitation of the American Society of News-
 paper Editors, and visited San Francisco and Hollywood.  Their subsequent
 visit to Canada in June appeared to heighten anti-Soviet sentiment already
 stimulated by the espionage investigations, and they accused the Canadian
 people of being cold and inhospitable and made a very unfavorable impression
 on the Canadian press.   In March 1947 Simonov was a member of a delegation
 of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet visiting Great Britain at the invitation
 of the British Parliament; in September of the same year he attended a
 Congress of the People's Front of Yugoslavia, Belgrade.   In 1949 he went
 with a cultural delegation to the Belgian-Soviet Friendship Society's Na-
 tional Congress at Brussels in April, to the Second Congress of the German
 Society for Cultural Study of the Soviet Union at Berlin in July, and with
 a cultural delegation to China in October.  He headed cultural delegations

 to the Mongolian People's Republic in March 1952, and to the United
 Kingdom for British-Soviet Friendship Month, December.
 At the start of the Soviet "peace" campaign Simonov was made Deputy
 Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, elected in July 1949, to arrange
 the convocation of the first All-Union Conference of Partisans for Peace,
 and served on the Presidium of the resulting conference.  Since that
 time he has been a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Committee for
 Defense of Peace.  He attended the second All-Union Conference of the
 Committee in Moscow, 1950.  He was a delegate to the Cultural and Scien-
 tific Conference for World Peace, New York, 1949; the British National
 Committee of Partisans for Peace meetings, March 1950; the Second World
 Peace Congress, Warsaw, November 1950; and the People's Peace Congress,
 Vienna, December 1952.  His other major international activity has been
 as a Vice President of the Communist-dominated International Organization
 of Journalists; he was elected at the organization's Third Congress in
 Helsinki, September 1950 and led a delegation to its Executive Committee
 meeting in Budapest, May 1951.  In 1953 he headed a Commission to organize
 the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the birth of the poet V. V.
 MAYAKOVSKI,
 From 1946 to 1954 Simonov served as a deputy to the Council of the
 Union, U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, from Yartsevo Okrug, Smolensk Oblast,
 RSFSR, and from June 1950 until 1954 was a member of the Council's Foreign
 Affairs Commission.  He was not a candidate for the Supreme Soviet in
 the elections held in March 1954.
 According to an unconfirmed Soviet source Simonov's wife, Valya,
 is the daughter of a prominent Moscow actress and the widow of a famous
 pre-World War II Soviet test pilot who was killed testirj.6 a plane.  Valya,
 also an actress, has been described as a "bad woman" who peroxides her
 hair, goes with men other than her husband, and has an obnoxious, over-
 bearing manner.  Simonov and his wife are reputedly very wealthy.

 V. V. MAYAKOVSKI
 KOWALCZYK, Josef (Poland)
 Born about 1891, Josef, Kowalczyk is reported to have been in a Soviet
 labor camp as of 1915.  The first postwar record of him appears in the
 form of an article published under his name in the theoretical journal
 of the Polish Workers'  (Communist) Party (January 1917).  The same year he
 was elected Deputy Chairman of the Trade Union of Polish Journalists.
 This organization presumably sent him as, its delegate to the Conference
 of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), held 16-18 No-
 vember 1918 at Budapest.  At this meeting, he strongly attacked Western
 journalists (including the Greeks) for their "subservience td imperialism."
 Kowalczyk also attended successive meetings of the IOJ at Prague in 1949,
 Helsinki in 1950 (where he was elected a Vice President of the organiza-
 tion), and at Budapest in 1951.
 At the December 1918 Congress of the Polish United Workers' (Com-
 munist) Party (PZPR) Kowalczyk was elected to the Central Commission of

 Party Control; he was re-elected to the same body at the March 1954 Con-
 gress.                   In 1948 he was also appointed Director of the Central Committee's
 Education Section.   In the latter capacity, he has participated in a con-
 ference on parent committees in schools, the anti-illiteracy campaign, the
 fifth plenum of the Central Committee, a meeting of the Polish Teachers'
 Association, convocations of the Society for Universal Knowledge, and a
 youth rally commemorating the Komsomol's foundation.  He was last iden-
 tified as Director of the Education Section of the Central Committee when
 he attended the 3d Communist Party conference in Szczecin (Stettin) Prov-
 ince.                   He may still hold this position, since no other individual has been
 identified in it to date.
 Apart from his original contribution to Nowe Drogi in 1947, Kowalczyk
 has written other articles for that periodical and contributed also to the
 Cominform Journal and the Polish Communist Party's principal daily news-
 paper.                   It should be noted that Kowalczyk is the author of Boleslaw
 BIERUT's biography.  He has most recently been identified as special
 correspondent for Trybuna Ludu, covering the Geneva Conference (May 1954).

 President, All-China Journalists' Association.
 Vice President, International Organization of Journalists.
 Member, Executive Board, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
 Member, National Committee, China Peace Committee.
 Communist Party propagandist and historian as well as a sometime
 personal secretary to MAO Tse-tung, Hu Ch'iao-mu is the author of Thirty
 Years of the Communist Party of China, the first official outline history
 of the party prepared by the Chinese Communists themselves.  That Hu was
 entrusted with the compilation of such a document reflects favorably not
 only on his acknowledged ability but also on the trust in which he is
 held by MAO.  One close observer of the Chinese Communist movement has
 commented that as a result of his having served as MAO's secretary in
 Yenan, Hu is.presumably trusted by the former in drafting party editorials
 on policy matters.  The same observer has also described Hu as one of MAO's
 own theoretical braintrusters.
 Hu-Ch'iao-mu, whose real name is Hu Ting-Hsin, was born about 1911
 in Yen-ch'eng Hsien, Kiangsu Province.  His father, Hu Chi-tung, was a
 wealthy landowner and a sometime member of the Peking Parliament.  In
 1924 Hu entered the Kiangsu Provincial 8th Middle School in Yang-chou,
 where he is said to have compiled an outstanding academic record.  Six
 years later he was admitted into the physics department of Tsinghua
 University in Peiping, and there seems to have become interested in Com-
 munism.   It seems probable that Hu joined the Communist Party while a
 student in Peiping, though data reporting such an event are not now avail-
 able.  In 1932, because of his activities, Hu was forced to leave Tsinghua;
 he went then to the Shanghai area, and for a very brief period studied at
 Chekiang University.  Thereafter and until 1937 he was in Shanghai, where
 he is reported to have been engaged in "ideological and cultural activities
 in the revolutionary movement."
 Shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Hu went to Yenan,
 where he was first in charge of a Communist Party youth training class in
 An-wu-pao.  Subsequently he was dean of school affairs of the Tse-tung
 Youth Cadre Training School in Yenan.  Throughout the early Yenan period
 Hu appears to have been concerned primarily with the party's youth move-
 ment.  He is reported to have prepared much literature for the guidance of
 the youth movement, and to have edited the magazine Chun -kuo Chin -nien
 (China Youth).  Prior to 1945 he had become personal and or political
 secretary to MAO Tse-tung.  While one report places this occurrence about
 1938-1939, it would appear to have been at some later date, perhaps about
 1942-1943.  In that capacity he accompanied MAO to Chungking in August
 1945 when the latter went to the Nationalist capital for postwar talks
 with CHIANG Kai-shek.   In Chungking, in addition to his services to MAO,

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400220001-2
 Hu became responsible for the editorial policy of the Hsin-hua Jih-pao
 (New China Daily), local organ of the Communist Party.
 The date of Hu's departure from Chungking is unknown.  Likewise, data
 are not currently available which describe his activities between 1945
 and 1949. In April 1949 he was elected to the Central Committee of the
 China New Democratic Youth League, and 2 months later was named to the
 All-China Federation of Democratic Youth's National Committee.  He served
 in those capacities until the summer of 1953 but was re-elected to neither
 body when organization congresses were held that year.  On 15-19 June
 1949 Hu was a delegate from the A11-China Federation of Democratic Youth
 to the Preparatory Committee meetings of the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference.   July 1949 saw him active in the preparatory meet-
 ings of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the All-China Jour-
 nalists' Association.  On 14 July 1949 he was first identified as director
 of the official New China News Agency, a position, however, which he had
 relinquished by December of that same year.
 Since September 1949 Hu has been a member, representing the All-China
 Journalists' Association, of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference.  At the conference's first plenary session in September 1949
 he was elected to the conference's National Committee, and since February
 1953 has served as a standing member of the National Committee.  With the
 establishment of the Central People's Government, Hu was assigned posi-
 tions as member and Secretary General of the Culture and Education Com-
 mittee, and as Director of the News Administration.  Hu still retains his
 membership on the Culture and Education Committee, but was relieved as the
 Committee's Secretary General in November 1952 and as Administration Di-
 rector in August 1952.
 The year 1950 saw his identification as (1) Deputy Director of the
 Propaganda Department, Communist Party;. (2) member of the National Com-
 mittee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against Ameri-
 can Aggression; (3) President of the All-China Journalists' Association;
 and (4) member of the Executive Board of the Sino-Soviet Friendship As-
 sociation.   In 1950 Hu was also elected one of the Vice Presidents of the
 International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) at the 3d IOJ Congress
 held in Helsinki in September.  His most recent concurrent appointment
 came in January 1953, when he was named to membership on the Committee
 for Drafting the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
 From the information currently available, Hu is not believed to have
 been outside China, though he is known to speak English.  He has been
 described as short and sturdy.  It would appear that at one time he was
 known as CH'IAC Mu.  He is not, however, identical with CH'IAO Kuan-hua,

 VIII.  NATIONAL AFFILIATES OF THE IOJ
 In January 1954 the IOJ claimed affiliates or individual membership
 of journalists in the following 35 countries:
 Africa
 France
 Poland
 Albania
 East Germany
 Rumania
 Algeria
 The Netherlands
 Sweden
 Australia
 Hungary
 Switzerland
 Austria
 India
 Trieste
 Brazil
 Iran
 Tunisia
 Bulgaria
 Israel
 U.S.S.R.
 Communist China
 North Korea
 United Kingdom
 Czechoslovakia
 Mongolia
 U.S.A.
 Denmark
 Norway
 Uraguay
 Ecuador
 Paraguay
 Vietnam
 Finland
 Peru
 This claim by the IOJ, while possibly technically correct, gives
 an impression of strength and wide representation which the IOJ does not
 in fact possess.
 In a majority of the countries named the IOJ does not have sufficient
 representation to justify the existence of-an organized affiliate and
 representation is maintained through individual memberships, which in
 many instances are believed to consist of only a handful of journalists,
 and in some cases possibly a single individual.
 Those countries in which the existence of organized national affiliates
 of the IOJ have been identified are presented in the following pages.  Where
 available, the name of the national affiliate, address, official publica-
 tion, estimated membership, and national officers are given.  Complete in-
 formation was not available in many instances.   In other cases the information

 A Union of Bulgarian Journalists was reported to be in existence
 as of 1949, but there has been no information to indicate that this organiza-
 tion is still in existence.  More recently the Bulgarian press and IOJ
 publications have referred to the Central House of Journalists.  Presumably
 this is the organization which now represents Bulgaria in the IOJ.

 writing, etc., each of which has its own executive committee.  Presuma-
 bly a journalists' section also exists within the Union of Soviet Writers.
 The Union of Soviet Writers was founded in 1934 at a Congress of
 Writers under the chairmanship of Maxim GORKY.   The Second All-Soviet
 Congress of Writers (the first in 20 years) took place in December 1954.

 ZASLAVSKIY             Seventy-five year old D.I. Zaslavskiy? who has
 (Zaslavsky) David    been described by MOLOTOV as "a champion writer,"
 Iosifovich           is one of the leading Soviet Journalist-propa-
 gandists.                                                    He has served on the Editorial Board
 of Pravda since at least 1943 and for the past
 three decades has been a prominent writer for
 Soviet publications.  He has also been identified
 as a member of the Editorial Board of Krokoi  ,
 a satirical publication put out under the auspices
 of Pravda, and as the Head of the Chair of Jour-
 nalism at the Higher Party School (under the CPSU
 Central Committee) in Moscow.  Endowed with a
 sarcastic, embittered, yet witty style, Zaslavskiy
 has long served as the Communist Party's "lead"
 propagandist in attacks on U.S. personalities,
 policies, and economic and political institutions.
 He has also gained international recognition as
 one of the USSR's "most prominent commentators on
 foreign affairs."  A one-time critic of the
 Bolsheviks and supporter of the KERENSKIY govern-
 ment, Zaslavskiy reconsidered his political posi-
 tion in 1919 and later became one of the most
 militant supporters of the Soviet regime.
 Zaslavskiy has traveled considerably and until
 recently was very active in organizations such
 as the International Organization of Journalists
 (IOJ).  He was sufficiently prominent to have a
 biography included in the first edition of the
 Bol'shaya Sovetskaya Entsiklo edi a (Volume 26,
 published in 1933).  Although his biography has
 been dropped from the second edition of the
 Encyclopedia, Zaslavskiy has continued to submit
 signed articles to Pravda.

 David Iosifovich Zaslavskiy was born in 1879 in
 so-called Russian Poland.  He was educated at
 the Kiev Gymnasium and University and became a
 "revolutionary" in 1900, probably toward the end
 of his scholastic career.  In 1903 he joined the
 Polish Jewish Social Democratic Party (Bund), a
 self-styled Marxist group temporarily aligned with
 the Bolsheviks.  The following year Zaslavskiy
 began his journalistic career on the Vilenskaya
 (Wilno, Poland; now Vil'nyus, Lithuanian S.S.R.)
 newspaper, Severo-Zapadnvy Golos (Northwestern
 Voice), and later worked on the Kievayie Otkliki,
 the Kievskaya Mysl', Dne, and other journals.
 He reportedly attended the 5th Congress of the
 Bolshevik Party in London in April 1907.  In
 1916 Zaslavskiy became a member of the Central
 Committee of the Bund and probably participated
 in making its 1917 decision to denounce the
 Bolshevik program and to withdraw the Bn  from
 the Revolutionary Committee.  At this time (1917-
 18).Zaslavskiy sharply criticized the Bolsheviks
 and supported the KERENSKIY government.  With
 the flight of KERENSKIY and the victory of LENIN
 over oppositional forces however, Zaslavskiy ex-
 perienced a political "revelation" and in 1919
 became an ardent supporter of the new Bolshevik
 regime.
 Between 192+ and 1928 Zaslavskiy worked on the
 newspapers Leningradskaya Pravda, Krasnaya Gazeta,
 and Izvestiya.  In 1927 as a special correspondent
 for Izvestiya in Shanghai, he applied to the
 American Consulate General there for a visa to
 visit the United States for the purpose of "writ-
 ing articles ... on economic and literary sub-
 jects."  The request was refused.
 From 1928 until the present time Zaslavskiy has
 been associated with Pravda.  During World War
 II he wrote on selected topics in international
 affairs and may have worked as a war correspond-
 ent; but one report of the war period suggests
 that he also served on the editorial board of
 Pravda.  He was awarded the Order of Lenin in
 1944 and in 19+5 received, along with other

 After the war Zaslavskiy continued as a top-
 notch poison-pen artist on. the Pravda staff
 and also engaged in radio diatribes directed
 mostly at the U.S.  From 19+6 to 1951 he traveled
 throughout Europe and spent considerable time
 at international conferences.  He was a delegate
 to the 1st Congress of the International Jour-
 nalists' Organization, which was held in Copen-
 hagen in June 1946, and attended subsequent
 conferences of the IOJ in November 19+8 at Buda-
 pest, in September 19-9 at Prague, in September
 1950 at Helsinki, and in May 1951 at Budapest.
 By 1950, Zaslavskiy was a member of the Presi-
 dium of the IOJ, and in 1951 reportedly was ex-
 ercising (along with Soviet writer Boris BURKOV)
 effective control of the IOJ Congress.
 Zaslavskiy gave a series of lectures in Belgium
 during February 19+8 under the auspices of the
 Amities Belgo-Sovietiques; was a delegate to
 the International Congress of Cultural Workers
 in Defense of Peace at Wroclaw (formerly Breslau)
 in August 1948, and traveled to Bulgaria in mid-
 1949 in connection with joint Soviet-Bulgarian
 cultural activities.  A member of the All Union
 Society of Soviet Writers., Zaslavskiy, in August
 19+9 led a delegation of Soviet literary figures
 on a tour of Poland, where they reportedly schooled
 Polish writers in Soviet newspaper and propaganda
 techniques.  Two months later he was in Helsinki,
 where he attended the 3d Congress of the Finland-
 U.S.S.R. Society.  The following October Zaslavskiy
 was elected to membership in the Soviet Committee
 for the Defense of Peace at the All-Union Confer-
 ence of Partisans for Peace held in Moscow, and
 in November 1950 was selected as a delegate to
 the Second World Peace Congress, which met in
 Warsaw.

 Zaslavskiy often has made use of his presence
 at international gatherings to attack the U.S.,
 and especially to jibe at the American press,
 which he claims is completely controlled by
 "powerful monopolies" and prints only rumors
 and gossip.  On the other hand, he preaches
 that the Soviet Union offers the greatest free-
 dom of the press in the world and that "with-
 out fear of exaggeration ... the first issue
 of Pravda was the most important milestone in
 the world of the press since Gutepburg finished
 his first press."
 Zaslavskiy has been described as "squidlike in
 appearance" with a "high, bald dome," a long,
 hooked nose, and small, darting eyes which us-
 ually display a mischievous twinkle but which
 reveal a "sudden abject fear" if he is spoken
 to unexpectedly.  Zaslavskiy's writings are
 often punctuated with references to Russian as
 well as foreign literature.  According to re-
 ports and observations, it would seem that he
 has a good command of the English language,
 which he reads fluently.
