 Jordan's King Hussayn and Irpq's Faysal have been
 meeting to discuss ways and means of defending their
 positions against the pressures developed by the Egyp-
 tian-Syrian union.  Proclamation of an Iraqi-Jordanian
 federation is expected from the meeting.  King Saud
 did not participate.  He and President Chamoun of
 Lebanon have notified Hussayn that they cannot delay
 recognition of the Egyptian-Syrian union beyond the
 21 February plebiscite.  Although the USSR has remained
 officially  silent  on  the union, TASS has broadcast
 25X1     a cautious endorsement.
 EAST GERMAN PARTY PURGE  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  . .  .  . .  Page  3
 Stalinist East German party boss Walter Ulbricht
 has purged three leading Communists and has survived
 the most serious challenge thus far to his leadership,
 but the opposition has not yet been quelled.  The
 ousted men had advocated a more moderate approach to
 the country's political and economic problems; for
 this they were charged with opportunism, revisionism,
 and ideological shortsightedness.  The Kremlin con-
 tinues its support of Ulbricht and the repressive
 policies he personifies, probably in the belief that
 any relaxation in East Germany would be interpreted
 by the peoples of Eastern Europe as a sign of weakness
 which could set off a chain reaction of demands for
 25X1     further liberalization.

 INDONESIA     .  .    .  .  .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  Page  6
 The Indonesian central government's strong rejec-
 tion of the 10 February demand of Sumatran dissidents
 for the resignation of the Djuanda cabinet appears to
 have intensified already existing disunity among the
 rebels.       The central government may attempt to exploit
 this disunity by sending some troops to areas where
 foreign economic interests are concentrated.  Pres-
 ident Sukarno is expected to return to Djakarta by 16
 February, and further definite steps probably will a-
 wait his arrival.  The formation of a new cabinet or
 the reshuffle of the present one seems probable.
 25X1
 PEIPING'S PROPOSAL ON TROOP WITHDRAWALS IN KOREA  .  .  .  .  .   Page   6
 Peiping's offer to "break the deadlock" between
 East and West in Korea by discussing with the North
 Koreans the withdrawal of Chinese forces appears to
 be the opening maneuver in a major diplomatic and
 propaganda campaign to get UN troops out of South
 Korea.  Chou En-lai, who has advanced his scheduled
 trip to Pyongyang from next spring to this month,
 will head the highest Chinese Communist delegation
 ever to visit North Korea.   While Chou is in Korea,
 the Communists may well announce Peiping's willing-
 ness to withdraw Chinese forces if the UN forces
 25X1     also leave.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 CHINESE COMMUNIST CABINET SHAKE-UP  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page   1
 Chou En-lai's replacement as foreign minister by
 Chen Yi is the most noteworthy move in a reshuffle of
 the Chinese Communist Government which has abolished
 eight cabinet-level organizations "in the interest of
 greater efficiency" and affected ten others.   Chou
 retains the-post of premier, however, and the move
 does not indicate he has slipped from his number-three
 position in Peiping's hierarchy.   Chou's decision to
 step down is probably intended to lighten the burden
 of routine business and conserve his energy for polit-
 ical  fence-mendinz  with "I the Chinese Communist

 CHEN YI:      PEIPING'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  2
 Chen Yi, Peiping's new foreign minister, probably
 will be somewhat less competent than his predecessor,
 Chou En-lai.   Essentially Chen will continue to be--
 as he has been for the past four years--a spokesman
 for Chou.     While Chen is regarded as socially adept,
 it is doubtful he has Chou's skill as a negotiator or
 25X1     his capacity for work.
 KHRUSHCHEV CONGRATULATES SOVIET INTELLIGENTSIA .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  3
 Khrushchev dominated a large Kremlin reception
 given on 8 February by party and government leaders
 for outstanding members of the Soviet intelligentsia.
 He radiated satisfaction with recent achievements of
 Soviet intellectuals in the fields of science, culture,
 and education, and implied that "revisionist manifes-
 tations" are a thing of the past,.since the intellectuals
 have heeded the friendly counsel-of the party.  However,
 the campaign to isolate and "reform" remaining dissidents
 will undoubtedly continue.
 STABILITY IN MIDDLE ECHELONS OF.SOVIET PARTY REVEALED .,.... Page  4
 Republic party congresses anu regional conferences
 held throughout the Soviet Union during January and Feb-
 ruary reveal a fairly stable situation in the middle
 echelons of the Soviet Communist party.   Such changes
 as were made in the provincial party leadership were
 prompted primarily by economic considerations.  The
 majority of personnel shifts have taken place in Kazakh-
 stan, where the 1957 harvest from the virgin lands failed
 25X1     to  meet  expectations.,
 SOVIET RESEARCH IN CONTROLLED THERMONUCLEAR REACTIONS   .  .  Page  5
 25X1
 The USSR has for several years been conducting
 research on controlling thermonuclear reactions.  The
 program is in the hands of competent scientists and
 technicians who have adequate equipment,  facilities,
 and financial support.   Soviet progress thus far is
 probably on a par with that in the West, and the USSR
 is likely to reach the goal of harnessing hydrogen
 fusion at about the same time as the West.                                    25X1
 YUGOSLAVS AGAIN STRESS ADVANTAGES OF TITO'S COMMUNISM   .  .  Page  6
 Apparently as a prelude to the seventh congress
 of the Yugoslav Communist party scheduled for April,
 Belgrade has again begun to stress the superiority of
 the Yugoslav road to socialism.  This could exacerbate
 ideological differences with Moscow and upset the Yugo-
 slav-Soviet modus vivendi.

 SOVIET BLOC PLANS FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 The Soviet bloc Council for Mutual Economic Assist-
 ance (CEMA) is becoming an important factor in Soviet
 bloc economic activity for the first time since its in-
 ception in 1949.  At a CEMA meeting in December 1957,                         it
 was agreed that members would coordinate their economic
 planning for a 15-year period beginning in 1960, leading
 ultimately to the development of an integrated bloc
 economy.   Last December at least eight CEMA conferences
 were held dealing with specialization of production and
 the use of common industrial standards                                        25X1
 BULGARIAN REGIME REPRESSES UNRULY YOUTHS .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  8
 Incidents of "hooliganism," a plague in all the
 satellites, flared up in Bulgaria in late January and
 evoked severe countermeasures by the regime.  Two hooli-
 gans are to be shot for,the murder of a young worker,
 and thousands of juvenile delinquents have been deported
 from Sofia and other Bulgarian cities to "places of work"
 in the countryside.  The regime apparently is planning a
 concentrated effort, possibly involving police terror
 tactics, to control its youths.
 FLOW OF REFUGEES FROM EAST GERMANY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The flow of refugees from East Germany continued
 at a high level in 1957, when more than 261,000 East
 Germans asked for asylum in West Germany.      While the
 total figure is not a record high, an unprecedented
 number of youths of military age escaped, as did large
 numbers of persons with skills and training important
 to the East German economy.  The recent purge in the
 East German Communist party leadership and the expected
 hardening of domestic policies will probably result in
 an increase in the refugee flow unless border controls
 are tightened.

 THE ARGENTINE ELECTIONS OF 23 FEBRUARY .         .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 In Argentina's first presidential campaign since
 the overthrow of Peron, Arturo Frondizi, the demagogic
 leader of the Intransigent Radical party, now leads
 the field of candidates as a result of last-minute sup-
 port from Peronista groups and from.the Communists.
 This situation is likely to cause unrest and plotting
 among ultraconservative military elements.  President
 Aramburu still appears, however, to have decisive
 military backing for his promise to turn over power on
 1 May to whatever government is elected on 23 February.

 Mounting African agitation for rapid political
 advancement has caused a deterioration in the political
 and security situation in the British colony of Kenya
 in recent weeks.  The government, alarmed by rising
 tension and a series of disruptive events, has in-
 creased its vigilance and taken a number of repressive
 countermeasures.  The Kenya police commissioner be-

 Noon's two-month-old government.   Noon's government
 now appears to have a comfortable margin of supporters,
 but loyalties can shift rapidly once the parliamentary

 Since beginning his new term last December,
 Philippine President Garcia has been occupied pri-
 marily with pressing economic problems.                               In the pol-
 itical area, he has moved slowly, but an undercurrent
 of difficulties with Congress has developed.                  No firm
 steps have been taken to find a solution of out-
 standing issues, such as the suspended ne otiations

 The Khrushchev-engineered industrial reorgani-
 zation, still in its early stages, apparently has not
 yet succeeded in significantly paring the number of
 Soviet industrial administrators.               Many of the hun-
 dreds of thousands of such personnel from the abol-
 ished ministries have remained in Moscow and other
 major cities, and the regional councils of national
 economy (sovnarkhozy) are being staffed largely by
 local personnel.   Identifications to date of top
 sovnarkhoz officials show that experienced industrial
 managers, rather than party careerists, have received
 most of the council chairmanships.  A considerably
 strengthened regional party apparatus and a revamped
 State Planning Commission are combating the problem
 AFGHANISTAN'S DEBT TO THE SOVIET BLOC   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 Afghanistan probably has committed Soviet bloc
 funds amounting to about $54,000,000 since 1954.
 Under the Soviet $100,000,000 credit extended in
 January 1956,the Afghan Government in 1957 committed
 approximately $11,000,000 for construction on three
 large undertakings.  At least $2,000,000 had been used
 for three relatively small construction contracts and
 20 project surveys in 1956.   The government has also
 used about $41,000,000 under several minor bloc cred-
 its extended in 1954,  the Soviet arms agreement of
 1956, and a Czech arms agreement.

 OUTLOOK FOR THE WEST INDIES FEDERATION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  Page  8
 The new West Indies Federation formed on 3 January,
 which will hold its first parliamentary elections next
 month, faces major tests of economic and political sta-
 bility before it can attain its ultimate goal of inde-
 pendence within the Commonwealth.  As a whole, the ten
 constituent colonies lack natural resources to support
 their 3,000,000 people.  Jamaica sees its relative pros-
 perity threatened by the planned customs union, and the
 sense of common interest is so little developed through-
 out the colonies that most prominent politicians refuse
 to surrender local office to run for federal posts.
 Difficulties in its relations with the United States
 are possible as a result of the federation's request
 for the US naval base on Trinidad as the site for its
 capital.
 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA .  .

 One of the most difficult problems facing the ' Inter-
 national Conference on the Law of the Sea, to begin in
 Geneva on 24 February under UN sponsorship, will concern
 the limit of territorial water over which a state has full
 sovereignty.  Conflicting interests have long given rise
 to numerous disputes in this sphere, most recently in-
 volving the waters of the Soviet Union, Indonesia, Iceland,
 and the Gulf of Aqaba.   The conference at Geneva will also
 attempt to draw up agreements on numerous other aspects of

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 x':>nch bombing on 8
 February of t Ae Tunisian bor-
 der village of Sakiet Sidi
 Youssef has aroused a storm of
 protest throughout the Moslem
 and Asian worlds.   Heavy empha-
 sis is given to the allegation
 that the action,  which destroyed
 three fourths of the village
 and resulted in some 70 dead
 and over 100 wounded,  is a typ-
 ical act of colonialist aggres-
 sion and to the fact that 17 of
 the 25 French aircraft involved
 in the air strike were manufac-
 tured in' the United States.
 The call of Algerian rebel
 spokesman Mohamed Yazid for the
 closing of American bases
 throughout North Africa will
 find a ready echo among nation-
 alist extremists in Morocco and
 to a lesser extent in Libya.
 Although some Tunisians
 have staged demonstrations and
 called for arms to use against
 the French, President Bourguiba
 has kept the local situation
 under control.   Precautionary
 measures--including the expul-
 sion of 150 French residents
 from three border provinces
 where tension is particularly
 high--are being taken to assure
 the safety of the 90,000 French
 nationals who reside in Tunisia.
 At the same time, Tunis has
 used the incident to interfere
 with France's long-term inter-
 ests in the country by asking
 Paris to close four of its ten
 consulates.
 French officials in Tunis
 are seeking comfort from the
 fact that Bourguiba has not yet
 presented a formal demarche to
 Paris that all French troops--

 Bourguiba plans to ask the coun-
 cil to order all French forces
 to leave Tunisia.       He would
 withhold his appeal if Paris
 would publicly declare an in-
 tent to pull its forces out of
 Tunisia and begin by removing
 its troops now in southern Tuni-
 cia _
 On 13 February he announce
 that he would "withdraw  his
 complaint  to  the Security
 Council" if  France accepted
 American mediation.
 Premier Gaillard appears
 largely concerned with appeas-
 ing his rightist support which
 insists on a firm stand against
 any position implying France is
 at fault.   He is unlikely to
 agree to withdraw from Bizerte.
 Paris has offered to negotiate
 "all issues" with Bourguiba,
 but there is little likelihood
 of  any  major  concessions--
 particularly through the UN--
 at this time.   The Tunisian
 President, faced with mounting
 criticism at home and abroad
 that he has been too lenient        25X1

 the Kings hope will be a. bar-

 economic attraction of Egyptian-
 Syrian union, especially for
 Le".canon's Moslem population, has
 urged Hussayn to hasten  the
 federation of Iraq and Jordan
 as a counterweight.  At  the
 same time, he too has notified
 Hussayn that Lebanon cannot de-
 lay recognition of the UAR after
 21 February; this may entail
 the resignation  of  strongly
 pro-Western Foreign  Minister
 Malik and probably would signal
 the  beginning  of  a trend of
 Lebanese policy toward accom-
 modation with Cairo and Damas-
 cus.   Syrian President Quwatli
 has already stated cryptically
 that the UAR is the best "guar-
 antee" of Lebanon's borders,
 and has urged Lebanese adherence,
 In Cairo, talks have con-
 tinued between the   Egyptians
 and Yemeni  representatives
 headed by Crown Prince Badr.
 Several observers have comment-
 ed that the Yemenis obviously
 do not know what they are doing,
 and Nasir is reported  to  be
 wary of assuming still another
 burden in. addition to Syria's
 problems.
 These problems are probably
 very much with the  Egyptian
 leader, since decisions  must
 be made soon on the major posts
 to be occupied in the new UAR
 political and military structure.
 Nasir is said to have been sur-
 prised by the sudden departure
 of Syrian Communist party leader
 Bakdash for the USSR, on  the
 ground that nothing had been
 done yet to make him flee.   At
 least one roundup of local Com-
 munists has been reported from
 Damascus, however, although the
 Communist press there is still.
 fighting a kind of rear-guard
 propaganda battle against the
 temporarily  triumphant  Baath-
 ists.
 Nasir probably remains
 concerned  that the USSR not
 receive the impression that his
 moves   are being made at Western
 inspiration.   Although the USSR
 has remained officially silent,
 TASS has broadcast a cautious
 endorsement.   Chinese Communist
 Premier Chou   En-lai and the
 Eastern European press  have
 given the UAR a warmer welcome.
 The USSR  therefore  probably
 is preparing   to  recognize
 the new  state soon  after Nasir
 is  formall    roclaimed  resi-
 dent .
 Stalinist East German party
 boss Walter Ulbricht has purged
 three leading Communists and
 has survived the most serious
 challenge thus far to his lead-
 ership, but the opposition has
 not yet been quelled.   The oust-

 moderate approach to the coun-
 try's political and economic
 problems; for this they were

 would have changed the party
 line, of holding "revisionist"
 views and "faulty ideological
 interpretations," and of oppos-
 ing Ulbricht on fundamental
 issues.   It was charged that if
 their ideas on the Polish and
 Hungarian developments in 1956
 had been followed, there would
 have been "counterrevolutionary
 actions which would have had to
 be beaten by armed forces."
 Woliweber was specifically ac-
 cused of neglecting his duties
 as state security minister and
 of attempting to recruit party
 members for the Schirdewan
 faction.
 Oelssner was absolved of
 association with the Schirde-
 wan-Woliweber group.   He was
 charged with favoring an in-
 crease of trade with the West
 rather than with the bloc, with
 opportunistic distorting of the
 party's agricultural policy,
 and with opposing Ulbricht's
 government decentralization
 scheme.   His crimes also in-
 cluded "repeated violations of
 the discipline of the polit-
 buro and refusal to conform to
 the collective /wi117 of the
 politburo."
 The central committee also
 elected loyal Ulbricht adher-
 ents to top party posts.   Sec-
 retariat member Alfred Neumann
 was raised from candidate mem-
 ber to full member of the polit-
 buro, and politburo candidate
 Erich Honecker was named to the
 party secretariat.   Two obscure
 party functionaries, first sec-
 retaries of district party
 organizations, were promoted to
 the party secretariat.   Erich
 Apel, minister for heavy ma-
 chine construction, was named
 to head an economic commission
 of the politburo.
 0
 unfavorable reactions may
 be expected in important
 districts where Schirdewan has
 many supporters.
 Many party functionaries be-
 lieve the purge has only started,
 and there are indications that
 another party meeting will be
 held soon, possibly to continue
 the purge.   Some party officials
 believe that others destined to
 be purged are Culture Minister
 Becher,  Deputy Prime Minister
 Fritz Selbmann, and Prime Minis-
 ter Otto Grotewohi.   The govern-
 ment announced on 12 February
 that Grotewohi had left Berlin
 for "a health cure" of several
 weeks, touching off rumors that
 he has already been purged.
 Ulbricht will probably try to
 eliminate all opposition elements
 before the fifth party congress
 scheduled for July, at which time
 the entire membership of the cen-
 tral committee will be elected
 and a new politburo named.
 Moscow was probably motivated
 in its decision to support Ul-
 bricht by a desire to reiterate
 to the satellites the importance
 of party unity, a theme that has
 been emphasized in Kremlin pro-
 nouncements for nearly a year,
 particularly at the meeting of
 Communist leaders in Moscow
 last November.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 February 1958
 INDONESIA
 The 10 February broadcast
 of Lt. Col. Hussein demanding
 that the Djuanda cabinet resign
 within five days was rejected
 the following day by Djakarta.
 The Djuanda government further
 countered by announcing the dis-
 honorable discharge of dissident
 Colo-eels Hussein, Djambek, Sim-
 bolon, and Lubis.   Army Chief
 of Staff General Nasution has
 personally assumed formal re-
 sponsibility for the Central
 Sumatran command of Hussein.
 0
 Lt. Col. Bar Tian in South
 Sumatra, who has cooperated ex-
 tensively with the dissidents
 but has steadily refused to sup-
 port the declaration of a rival
 government, may assume the role
 of intermediary between Central
 Sumatra and the Djakarta govern-
 ment.   Barlian made an appeal
 on 13 February from Palembang
 for a peaceful settlement and
 negotiations "inspired by toler-
 ance."   His plea followed bel-
 ligerent statements from both
 Nasution in Djakarta and dis-
 sident Colonel Djambek in Padang,
 Central Sumatra.
 Barlian's statement may al-
 so be related to reports that
 Djakarta may send limited num-
 bers of troops to disaffected
 areas where foreign economic in-
 texrests are concentrated.   Al-
 though the government's reported
 move probably is intended to en-
 sure continued foreign remit-
 tances to Djakarta, the presence
 of Javanese troops could provoke
 isolated incidents, possibly
 leading to localized conflict.
 A period of political and mili-
 tary maneuvering is probable,
 however, with all factions hop-
 ing to avoid violence.
 President Sukarno is ex-
 pected to return to Djakarta on
 16 February.
 Hatta,  to whom dissidents
 and non-Communists generally have
 looked to guide them out of pres-
 ent economic and political con-
 fusion, has stated he does not
 want to participate in a succes-
 sor to the D'u nda cabinet.

 will "take the initiative" in
 promoting withdrawals.
 The Communist campaign was
 timed to provide a contrast to
 recent combined UN-South Korean
 military maneuvers and the in-
 troduction of 280-mm. atomic
 cannon and rockets in the South.
 Peiping is apparently moving
 with some urgency.   Premier Chou
 En-lai's trip to North Korea,
 originally planned for April or
 May, was advanced to mid-Feb-
 ruary, probably after conclu-
 sion of the National People's
 Congress now meeting in Peiping.
 Chou's entourage will include
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi and
 Chief of Staff Su Yu, the high-
 est-level Chinese delegation
 ever to visit North Korea.
 At Pyongyang, Chou may an-
 nounce an agreement on Chinese
 withdrawal in a, formulation made
 contingent on parallel departure
 of UN forces.   Chou could also
 announce token withdrawals of
 Chinese forces to support Pei-
 ping's gesture of "initiative."
 In view of   current  Communist
 propaganda calling for "simul-
 taneous" withdrawal of UN                                                                  and
 Chinese forces, it seems un-
 likely Chou will announce uni-
 lateral withdrawal of all Chi-
 nese troops.
 The Communists seem to be-
 lieve that the withdrawal of
 some Chinese troops from North
 Korea would not turn the mili-
 tary balance in favor of the
 South Koreans,   Since 1953 the
 North Korean Army, with consid-
 erable Soviet aid, has steadily
 improved its capability.   Al-
 though the army totals 333,000
 as against 613,000 South Korean
 troops, it has overwhelming
 firepower, superiority in heavy
 artillery, and its air force in-
 cludes 445 jet fighters and 75
 IL-28 jet light bombers, com-
 pared with South Korea's 80 jet
 fighter-bombers.   If called on
 to offset any imbalance  in'
 forces, the Chinese could move
 down from Manchuria at least
 250,000 troops within 8 to 14
 days.
 In the South, President
 Rhee might regard UN and Chi-
 nese Communist withdrawals as
 increasing his own freedom of
 action, but would seek to pre-
 vent UN withdrawals until he

 Last summer, Rhee advocated
 withdrawal of  all    foreign
 troops because "they keep us
 divided," but his  statement
 was apparently not intended to
 imply a basic change in South
 Korean policy, which insists
 that UN troop  withdrawals
 should follow the withdrawal
 of all Chinese forces and the
 holding of UN-supervised elec-
 tions in the North.
 The launching of the Com-
 munist campaign comes at a
 SECRET
 time when Moscow is pressing
 the West for a summit confer-
 ence.   The Russians themselves
 have not sought to include a
 Far East item on the agenda
 for such a conference.   How-
 ever, the reopening of the Ko-
 rean problem by Peiping pro-
 vides the USSR with a bargain-
 ing point in its efforts to
 get the West to modify its de-
 mands for inclusion of the Ger-
 man  issue  and  the status

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 3 '   Eli
 13 February 1958
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 CHINESE COMMUNIST CABINET SHAKE-UP
 Chou En-lai's resignation
 as foreign minister, a post he
 had held concurrently with the
 premiership since 1949, is the
 most noteworthy move in a re-
 shuffle of the Chinese Commu-
 nist Government which has abol-
 ished eight cabinet-level or-
 ganizations and affected ten
 others.   Chou's decision to
 lighten his burden--which he
 hinted at as long ago as Novem-
 ber 1956--does not indicate he
 has slipped from his position
 as number-three man in the Pei-
 ping hierarchy.   Rather, it may
 mean he foresees the development
 of a more fluid situation in
 Peiping and is taking precau-
 tions.
 Chou's move appears de-
 signed primarily to relieve the
 pressure under which he has been
 operating for the past nine
 years and to conserve his ener-
 gy for political fence-mending
 inside the Chinese Communist par-
 ty.   Chou,who reportedly works
 an average 14-hour day and has
 sometimes been ill, probably
 has been forced to slight party
 affairs for several years.
 With Mao Tse-tung aging,
 Chou now may want more time
 available for work in his party
 job as a member of the polit-
 buro standing committee, the
 core of party power.   Chou may
 mean to ensure that he gets a
 "proper" share in any division
 of powers with Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping--who rank  re-
 spectively just before and just
 after Chou among Mao's chief
 lieutenants.
 The  present  drive to
 "streamline" the governmental
 machinery may have been a factor
 in the timing of Chou's move.
 The bureaucracy is an important
 buttress to his power, and Chou
 would almost certainly prefer
 to keep the job of tinkering
 with it in his own hands, More
 than 800,000 middle- and low-
 level functionaries have already
 been reassigned or downgraded.
 Cabinet-level changes announced
 on 11 February at the National
 People's Congress have abolished
 the National Construction Com-
 mission, a special-purpose body
 responsible for coordinating
 the construction plans and ac-
 tivities of all industrial min-
 istries, and done away with sev-
 en ministries by consolidating
 their operations in the inter-
 est of greater efficiency. The
 status of some cabinet officials
 is in doubt, including that of
 some party men with standing
 at and near the central commit-
 tee level.
 There are no indications
 that Chou's status has suffered.
 Chou has apparently been on the
 right side--i.e., Mao's side--
 in major policy disputes in the
 party during the past year. The
 resignation--announced as being
 on Chou's initiative--came the
 day after he delivered a major
 foreign policy speech at the
 National People's Congress on
 10 February.   The new foreign
 minister, Chen Yi, was probably
 his personal choice for the job.
 Moreover,  Chou retains his post
 as premier and thus directs
 the Foreign Ministry.
 It is expected that Chinese

 CHEN YI:   PEIPING'S
 Marshal Chen Yi, Peiping's
 new foreign minister, probably
 will be somewhat less competent
 than his predecessor, Chou En-
 lai.                Chen in this post will
 continue to be a spokesman for
 Chou.
 Chen, now about 57, was
 close to Chou in the early days
 of the Chinese Communist move-
 ment.   He rose as a military
 leader under Mao Tse-tung, and
 was also associated with Liu
 Shao-chi, now Mao's first lieu-
 tenant.   Chen made his reputa-
 tion in operations against the
 Japanese and the Chinese Nation-
 alists in the period 1938-1949,
 although some military observ-
 ers have suspected that most
 of the credit belonged to  his
 deputy,  Su Yu, now chief of
 staff.
 With the Communist occupa-
 tion of Shanghai in 1949,              Chen
 became mayor of that city, while
 retaining his posts as command-
 er of the Third Field Army and
 second secretary of the party's
 East China Bureau.   He became
 first secretary of that bureau
 in 1952 and visited the USSR
 in the same year.
 With the dissolution of
 the field armies in 1954, Chen
 was brought to Peiping as a
 vice premier under Chou. Since
 that time, Chen has appeared to
 be'primarily a utility man for
 Chou, acting for him in a varie-
 ty of foreign and domestic mat-
 ters.   He visited Eastern Europe
 in 1954, accompanied Chou to
 pand its influence through Asia
 and the Middle East, violently
 rejected the "two Chinas" con-
 cept, and offered to take the
 "initiative" in the removal of
 foreign  troops  from  Korea.

 first major address on inter-
 national relations at the Chi-
 nese Communist party's eighth
 congress in September 1956. He
 was named to the party polit-
 buro at that time.
 Chen was ill in late 1956
 and the early part of 1957, but
 has been active since  then. Dur-
 ing his convalescence, he pro-
 duced an article on the history
 of Communist-Nationalist  co-
 operation.   One factor in Chen's
 appointment as foreign minister
 may be a belief that Chen would
 be more suitable than Chou for
 renewed overtures to the National-
 ists  on the status of Taiwan.

 Chen may be less doctri-
 nai.re than most other Chinese
 ers regard him as unreliable.
 Indeed,  Peiping may hope to ex-
 ploit this feature of Chen's
 reputation, together with his
 Communist leaders.   Twice in
 1957 he published articles sug-
 gesting that it had been--and
 still was--hard for him to mas-
 ter the Communist world view.
 However, Chen's appointment to
 the foreign minister's post
 would seem to dispose of any
 suspicion that other party lead-

 social assets, in dealing with
 Western officials.
 Khrushchev dominated a
 large Kremlin reception given
 on 8 February by party and gov-
 ernment leaders for outstanding
 members of the Soviet intelli-
 gentsia.   He radiated satisfac-
 tion with recent achievements
 of Soviet intellectuals in the
 fields of science, culture, and
 education, and implied that
 "revisionist manifestations"
 are a thing of the past since
 "It is  true that individual writers  had cer-
 tain hesitations.  During  frank talks  at the previ-
 ous reception                             (in ! y 1957),   we advised these com-
 rades           to sweep  aside  false                       conceptions,   to think
 critically  about the fabrications  of revisionists,
 and to  examine life more deeply  in order to under-
 stand the Soviet reality and its natural laws.   . . .
 "It is pleasant to note that our writers  have
 correctly  understood the  contents of  that talk and
 have  taken an  active part  in the struggle    of  the
 party against any manifestations of revisionism. The
 writers have rallied  still closer around the Comru-
 nist party."
 the intellectuals have heeded
 the counsel of the party.                                     How-
 ever,  the campaign to isolate
 and "reform" the remaining dis-
 sidents will undoubtedly con-
 tinue.
 The opening address at the
 reception was delivered by par-
 ty secretary Suslov, who ap-
 parently bears at least partial
 responsibility for the regime's
 ideological and cultural policy.
 Following Khrushchev's speech,
 toasts were offered to specific
 sectors of the intelligentsia
 by Bulganin, Pospelov, Mikoyan,
 Suslov, and Voroshilov.   The
 toasts were accepted by leading
 intellectuals representing their
 fields, each of whom expressed
 gratitude for,  in the words of
 composer Dmitri Shostakovich,
 "the daily fatherly, attentive,
 and true guidance" of the party
 and government.
 In contrast with his talks
 to writers and artists during
 the past spring and summer, when
 he remonstrated with them for
 works produced during 1956 and
 early 1957 which "blackened"
 Soviet society,  Khrushchev men-
 tioned the intellectual waver-
 ings of last year only in pass-
 ing..   For the scientists,  who--
 Khrushchev says--made the Rus-
 sian word "sputnik" part of the
 world vocabulary, there is noth-
 ing but praise.
 Khrushchev congratulated
 the Soviet intelligentsia for
 its "high ideological maturity"
 and its ability to profit from
 party criticism.   He called for

 the need for an "optimistic ap-
 proach" to art, i.e.,  "socialist
 realism."
 Although Khrushchev and
 the top leadership apparently
 feel confident enough at this
 time to talk only of successes,
 daily criticism and correction
 of recalcitrants will continue
 to be carried on by reliable
 editors of cultural and profes-
 sional journals and lesser par-

 the regime continues to restrain
 intellectuals, from interpreting
 too freely the post-Stalin re-

 STABILITY IN MIDDLE ECHELONS OF SOVIET PARTY REVEALED
 Republic party congresses
 and regional conferences held
 throughout the Soviet Union dur-
 ing January and February reveal
 a fairly stable situation in the
 middle echelons of the Soviet
 Communist party.   Such changes
 as were made in the provincial
 party leadership were prompted
 primarily by economic considera-
 tions.   The majority of person-
 nel shifts have taken place in
 Kazakhstan,  where the 1957 har-
 vest from the  virgin  lands
 failed to meet expectations.
 Regular biennial Communist
 party congresses were'held dur-
 ing January and February in the
 Soviet republics of Latvia,
 Estonia, Lithuania,  "Armenia,
 Moldavia,   Turkmenistan, Tad-
 zhikistan, Azerbaydzhan, and
 Georgia.   The average rate of
 turnover among members of the
 republic central committees was
 approximately 25 percent--about
 normal for a two-year period--
 and apparently all party bosses
 --first secretaries--of these
 republics have been re-elected.
 The only significant per-
 sonnel shifts which figured in
 the party congresses occurred
 in the agricultural republics
 of Moldavia and Turkmenistan,
 where top government leaders
 were removed, apparently as a
 result of economic shortcomings.
 In Moldavia, Gerasim Rud,  a
 candidate member of the all-
 union party central committee
 was replaced as premier and
 dropped from the party bureau
 just prior to the congress. He
 was  replaced  by  Aleksandr
 Diorditsa, a deputy Premier and
 former minister  of finance.
 Balysh Ovezov was similarly re-
 placed as premier on the eve of
 the Turkmen party congress,  at
 which he was severely criticized
 and dropped from the bureau of
 the central committee.   His suc-
 cessor is Dzhuma Karayev, for-
 mer party first secretary of
 Tashauz Oblast in the Turkmen
 Republic.
 In lieu of republic con-
 gresses in the larger Soviet
 republics--the RSFSR,   the U-
 kraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
 Belorussia, and Kirgiziya--
 some 60 party conferences have
 thus far been held in the oblast
 and territorial subdivisions of
 these republics.   With the ex-
 ception of Kazakhstan, there was
 no indication that Moscow was
 seriously dissatisfied with the
 direction of local party affairs.
 The conferences produced a normal
 amount of turnover in the party
 committees and were followed by
 the re-election of the local
 leadership.

 organizations has thus far re-
 sulted in shifts of seven ob-
 last party first secretaries.
 Such changes were to be expected
 in view of the replacement un-
 der criticism in December of
 Kazakh party leader Yakovlev
 by Nikolay Belyayev, one of
 Khrushchev's top lieutenants on
 the Soviet party presidium and
 an agricultural specialist.   The
 changes in Kazakhstan were at-
 tributed to the republic's.fail-
 ure to meet the 1957 economic
 goals-levied on it by Moscow.
 The Kazakh Gosplan chairman
 stated at a recent session of
 the republic Supreme Soviet
 that in the previous year the
 republic had not fulfilled its
 grain delivery plan, a failure
 not entirely caused, he said,
 by unfavorable weather condi-
 tions.   He added that where
 good organization existed and
 leaders showed concern, har-
 vests had not  been  too bad.
 SOVIET RESEARCH IN CONTROLLED THERMONUCLEAR REACTIONS
 Soviet scientists have for
 several years been conducting
 research on controlling thermo-
 nuclear, reactions.  Technical re-
 ports released by the USSR and
 statements made by Soviet sci-
 entists indicate that the pro-
 gram is probably comparable to,
 and possibly more extensive
 than, that in the United States,
 and that the Russians have made
 significant progress in this
 field.
 The first information on
 the Soviet program came from the
 Soviet physicist I. V. Kurchatov.
 In a lecture at Harwell, Eng-
 land, in April 1956, he described
 experiments involving the study
 of high current discharges in
 gases,, ,and gave the result  of,
 these `experiment s.'  He said-the
 research was based on a study of
 .the so-called "pinch effect,"
 or contraction of ionized gas
 (plasma) under the influence of
 self--induced magnetic fields.
 He said also that a temperature
 of about .1,000,000 degrees cen-
 tigrade had been obtained and
 neutrons observed.   Statements
 by Soviet scientists later in
 1956 and early 1957 revealed
 that at that time they considered
 this approach at a dead end,
 probably because of an inherent
 instability  in  the  "pinch
 effect."
 Western scientists, at an
 international meeting at Venice
 in mid-1957, reported stabilized
 "pinches" and the methods for
 obtaining them.   These methods
 permitted American?and British
 scientists to obtain their re-
 cently annouhced successes in
 their controlled thermonuclear
 reaction research.   These revela-
 tions certainly provided the
 Russians with information which
 would have permitted them to re-
 orient their work on the '"pinch."
 Thus the Soviet program is
 probably'following a pattern.
 very much like that of the United
 States.   American '..scientists,
 having studied Soviet techniYca'1
 reports and having talked with
 Soviet scientists, have con-
 cluded that the Soviet program
 is in the hands of competent
 scientists and technicians who
 have adequate equipment, facili-
 ties, and financial support.
 Soviet progress thus far is prob-
 ably on a par with that in the
 West, and the USSR is likely
 to reach the goal of harnessing
 hydrogen fusion at about the
 same time as the West.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 February 1958
 YUGOSLAVS AGAIN STRESS ADVANTAGES OF TITO'S COMMUNISM
 Recent Yugoslav emphasis
 on the advantages of President
 Tito's road to socialism draws
 attention once  again to  the
 ideological differences between
 Belgrade and Moscow and  could
 upset  their  modus  vivendi.
 Since the Hungarian uprising
 in 195f, Yugoslavia had been
 relatively quiet on this sub-
 ject.                 The USSR has stepped up
 its campaign against "revision-
 ism" and "opportunism," but has
 refrained  from  any  direct
 counterattack against Yugoslav
 theories which would doubtless
 result in disruptive polemics.
 The new Yugoslav "sales
 campaign" is undoubtedly in-
 tended for the most part as a
 prelude to the seventh  con-
 gress of the League of Yugoslav
 Communists scheduled for April.
 Advance statements indicate
 that Tito'will  make a  major
 effort to publicize his unique
 system of workers' self-manage-
 ment and government, and there
 is little reason to believe
 that the Yugoslavs contemplate
 any significant  concessions
 to make  their ideology more
 compatible with  the Soviet
 brand.  Vice President Colako-
 vic stated in  the Yugoslav
 party's  theoretical journal
 Komunist on 1 January that
 only th  Yugoslavs and  the
 Chinese "have been courageous
 enough to march along unpaved
 roads."  He added that the
 lessons of Hungary prove that
 certain  Communists "should
 change their attitudes and
 judgments," and that dogmatism
 and not revisionism, as claimed
 by the USSR, is the paramount
 danger to socialism.
 Komunist continued Yugo-
 slav efforts to proselytize
 within the bloc, declaring on
 SECRET
 10 January that only a system
 of workers' self-management
 as practiced in Yugoslavia is
 conducive to the Communist ideal
 of the gradual withering away
 of the state.   In  a  major
 speech launching the campaign
 for the election of deputies
 to the Yugoslav National Assem-
 bly in March, Vice President
 Vukmanovic-Tempo declared that
 Yugoslavia's "socialist democ-
 racy...surpasses  by far all
 the social systems which have
 made their appearance  in his-
 tory."
 In effect denouncing the
 "rules" set forth in the 12-
 party declaration  of                                                             the
 Soviet bloc issued last Novem-
 ber in Moscow, but not signed
 by Yugoslavia, Vukmanovic in-
 sisted that the Belgrade and
 Moscow declarations  of 1955
 and 1956 alone form the basis
 for relations between socialist
 states.   In that portion of
 his speech dealing with Bel-
 grade's relations with Eastern
 Europe, Vukmanovic reaffirmed
 his government's right to
 examine critically Moscow's re-
 lations with its  satellites.
 Moscow probably is dis-
 turbed by Yugoslavia's revival
 of praise for its contributions
 to socialism.  The Soviet leaders
 reacted to Tito's efforts in
 1956 to sell his system in the
 satellites with a secret letter
 to the satellite parties  de-
 nouncing Yugoslavia as a model
 for socialism.  No compromise
 seems  possible at this time
 on fundamental ideological dif-
 ferences, but Soviet leaders
 may decide that another effort
 is warranted to discuss  dif-
 ferences with Tito through bi-
 lateral  talks prior  to                                                               his
 congress.

 13 February 1958
 The Soviet bloc Council
 for Mutual Economic Assistance
 (CEMA) is becoming an important
 factor in Soviet bloc economic
 activity for the first time
 since its inception in 1949.
 At a CEMA meeting in December
 1957, it was agreed that mem-
 bers would coordinate their
 economic planning for a 15-
 year period beginning in 1960,
 leading ultimately to the de-
 velopment of an integrated
 bloc economy.   Last December
 at least eight CEMA conferences
 were held dealing with speciali-
 zation of production and the
 use of common industrial stand-
 ards.
 These developments are in
 contrast to the past Soviet
 practice of emphasizing bilat-
 eral relations with the satel-
 li.tes.   The function of CEMA
 has:been limited by the USSR
 to a partial coordination of
 trade within the bloc, which
 led chiefly to a shift of East
 European trade from the West
 to the USSR.   Soviet reluctance
 to provide the satellites with
 the economic data necessary for
 joint planning has discouraged
 integration, as have.Soviet
 demands on the satel-
 lites for raw materi-
 als..   Furthermore,
 individual satellite
 efforts to speed
 industrialization
 have led to unbal-
 anced national
 economic growth and
 to much duplication
 of effort which of.;.
 ten worked against
 cooperation within
 the bloc.
 CEMA now is to
 ensure an increasing
 bloc-wide division
 of labor to--make the
 most efficient use
 of resources.   The
 ultimate goal is a "unified
 socialist economy to surpass
 the most developed countries
 in the per capita output of
 goods."   Moreover,  increased
 specialization of production
 within the bloc would lead to
 increased interdependence,
 making it more difficult for
 countries such as Poland to
 pursue independent policies
 at variance with those of the
 USSR.
 One of the more signifi-
 cant developments concerning
 internal bloc specialization
 and standardization has'been
 the direct cooperation between
 ministries of the Eastern European
 countries undertaken in late
 .1957.   Polish and Czech person-
 nel responsible for shipping,
 land transport,  mining,  chemi-
 cals, and heavy machinery now
 work together to reach solu-
 tions to common problems arising
 in these fields.   Under a Polish-
 Czech pact reached in December,
 some industrial enterprises will
 be jointly constructed.
 Soviet bloc trade rela-
 tions with the non-Communist
 world are being coordinated

 to change "the path of isolated

 of CEMA reportedly discussed
 the establishment of an inter-

 responsibility   for handling

 in addition to the existing bi-

 BULGARIAN REGIME REPRESSES UNRULY YOUTHS
 Incidents of "hooliganism,"
 a plague in all satellite re-
 gimes, flared up in Bulgaria
 in late January and evoked se-
 vere countermeasures by the re-
 gime.                  Two hooligans hero con-
 demned to death on 5 February
 for the murder of a young work-
 er.                  Other repressive measures
 are reported to have included
 the deportation of thousands of
 juvenile delinquents from Sofia
 and  other  Bulgarian  cities
 early this month to.state farms
 and other "places of work" in
 the countryside.
 The hooligans are youths
 who  refuse to concern them-
 selves with politics or perform
 what the regime considers "so-
 cially useful  labor."  They
 emulate the dress and habits of
 Western "cats" and normally
 engage in petty crime. Their
 existence in numbers in the
 bloc reflects the failure of
 Communism to capture the in-
 terests and loyalty of many of
 its youths.   In Bulgaria, this
 failure is probably aggravated
 by low living standards--among
 the lowest in the satellites--
 and a chronic unemployment prob-
 lem.
 The last knows outbreak of
 hooliganism in Bulgaria occurred
 in September 1957 when police
 attempts to restrain avid "rock
 'n rollers" demonstrating their
 approval of a Czech jazz band
 resulted in a near riot.   All
 bands were ordered henceforth
 to clear their repertoires with
 a special committee.
 The problem of hooliganism
 was serious enough  to be de-
 bated by the Bulgarian National
 Assembly on the  day the two
 hooligans were sentenced to
 death.   Juvenile delinquency,
 according to the assembly, can
 be prevented primarily through
 "labor and the Communist educa-
 tion of young children," the
 same ineffectual policy that
 has been followed.   However,
 since it was decided during
 the session to set up special
 commissions in all districts
 "for the struggle against
 juvenile delinquency," it would
 appear that the Bulgarian re-
 gime plans, through better or-
 ganization, to make a more con-
 centrated effort to control
 youth than in the past.
 It will probably use
 police terror tactics as in
 the past to try to bring its
 youths into line.

 THE ARGENTINE ELECTIONS OF 23 FEBRUARY
 In Argentina's first presi-
 dential campaign since the
 overthrow of Peron,          Arturo
 Frondizi,  demagogic candidate
 of the Intransigent Radical
 party, appears to have pulled
 into the lead.   The multiparty
 campaign will also result in
 the election of a new congress.
 Frondizi's lead results pri-
 marily from last-minute support
 by Peronista groups and by the
 Communist party.   This align-
 ment is likely to lead to un-
 rest and plotting among ultra-
 conservative military elements.
 Provisional President Aramburu
 still appears, however, to have
 decisive military support for
 his promise to hold the elec-
 tions as scheduled on 23 Febru-
 ary and to turn over power to
 the elected government on 1
 May.
 Frondizi's principal op-
 ponent,  the more moderate
 Ricardo Balbin of the Popular
 Radical party,  was the favorite
 in the race until early Febru-
 ary.   On the basis of the
 party's showing in the July
 1x57 constituent assembly elec-
 tions,  the Popular Radicals
 held a substantial lead in the
 federal capital and the popu-
 lous provinces of Buenos Aires,
 Cordoba, and Santa Fe, and
 were thus expected to control
 the needed absolute majority
 in the electoral college which
 will be convened on 17 March.
 The strength of the Communists
 and Peronistas is also concen-
 trated in these provinces,
 SECRET
 however,  and their support for
 Frondizi there would probably
 put him in control of the
 majority.
 The Peronistas are still
 squabbling among themselves,
 but as little as 25 percent of
 their voting strength would as-
 sure Frondizi of victory and,
 under the present electoral
 system,  would give his party
 over half the seats in the
 new congress.
 Balbin's chief hope now
 is that segments of the smaller
 moderate parties will abandon
 their own presidential candi-
 dates and vote for him as a
 reaction to the extremist sup-
 port for Frondizi.   Both Balbin
 and Frondizi are running on
 nationalistic platforms, but
 Balbin is considered personally
 more moderate and more friendly
 to the United States as well
 as being anti-Peronista.
 Peron's manifesto of 4
 February in which he instructed
 his followers to vote "in an
 appropriate manner against the
 tyranny" has been widely inter-
 preted as a tacit endorsement
 of Frondizi in contrast to the
 order last July for Peronistas
 to cast blank ballots.
 Despite Frondizi's denials,
 many sources believe Peron's
 statement reflects a secret
 agreement by which Frondizi
 would be obliged to permit
 legalization of the Peronista

 party and reintegration of pro-
 Peronistas into the armed for-
 ces.   While most government
 and political leaders probably
 do not believe the opportunis-
 tic Frondizi would fully honor
 an agreement with Peron or
 anyone else, his election
 would probably lead to a period
 of uncertainty as to whether
 the conservative  i itar  would
 attempt a coup.
 Prospects for stability
 and orderly constitutional
 evolution in the British colony
 of Kenya have recently deteri-
 orated as a result of increased
 African agitation for a larger
 voice in the government.
 Spearheading the drive on
 the political level are the
 eight elected African members
 of the Legislative Council who,
 since their election last March,
 have refused to associate them-
 selves with Kenya's quasi-
 executive organ.   Their minimum
 price for cooperation, they in-
 sist, is that 15 more elective
 African, seats be added to the
 58-member multiracial council.
 Their position appears to have
 received widespread support
 from the politically conscious
 minority among the colony's
 approximately 6,000,000 Afri-
 cans.
 In an effort to compromise
 the issue and avert a consti-
 tutional impasse,  Britain last
 November scrapped the Lyttleton
 plan--implemented in 1954 and
 supposedly untouchable until
 1960--and announced that six
 new elected African members
 would be added to the council.
 However,  the African leaders--
 whose most articulate spokes-
 man is Kenya Federation of
 Labor chief Tom Mboya--unani-
 mously condemned the new British
 proposals   which included other
 features apparently designed
 in part to strengthen London's
 influence locally.   Neverthe-
 less,  the African leaders have
 not so far encouraged a boy-
 cott of the elections for the
 new council constituencies
 scheduled for March.
 25X1
 Rising tension in the
 Nairobi area and the develop-
 ment of serious disorders at a
 23 January meeting organized by
 Mboya have prompted the Kenya
 administration to prohibit
 Africans from holding public
 political gatherings in the
 capital.   Africans have also
 been barred from carrying weap-
 ons  after dark,  and the Kenya
 police commissioner believes
 it may eventually become neces-
 sary to impose martial law.
 Licenses to make political
 speeches have been obligatory
 for some time, and colony-wide
 African parties have not been
 permitted for several years.
 Since mid-January the
 government has discovered and
 suppressed two new subversive
 African secret societies with
 anti-European objectives and
 ritualistic characteristics
 similar to those associated with
 the recently defeated Mau Mau.
 Although the new movements
 have apparently not become wide-
 spread like the Mau Mau,  they
 are centered in the Kikuyu
 tribe--Kenya's largest--and
 another closely related tribe.
 Kenya officials,  apprehen-
 sive that the African drive for
 rapid political advancement
 might remove all chances for
 orderly development, are trying
 to facilitate the election

 pears unlikely to succeed.   One

 candidates has recently de-
 clared his support of Mboya's
 aims and indicated his belief
 that the expanded African bloc
 in the council will present a
 solidly united front.
 PAKISTAN'S GOVERNMENT COALITION MAY BE THREATENED
 The budget session of
 Pakistan's National Assembly
 opening on 17 February may see
 attempts by those outside the
 coalition, probably supported
 by President Mirza, to break
 up Prime Minister Noon's two-
 month-old government.   In addi-
 tion, the budget itself will
 have special importance this
 year as a test of the govern-
 ment's ability to deal effec-
 tively with the deteriorating
 economic situation.
 Noon's six-party coalition
 was formed in mid-December af-
 ter his Republican party caused
 the fall of former Prime Minis-
 ter                Chundrigar's government
 by withdrawing from the Repub-
 lican-Moslem League coalition.
 Despite the strong opposition
 of Mirza, original patron of
 the Republican party, the Repub-
 licans formed a new coalition
 with nearly all groups then in
 opposition and assumed office
 with a relatively safe majority
 in the National Assembly.
 Political maneuvering in recent
 weeks reflects Mirza's desire
 to replace the present govern-
 ment, probably by promoting
 defections from the Republican
 party to the Moslem League,
 with one he can control to suit
 his own political interests.
 Mirza's scheming against
 the coalition apparently is
 motivated primarily by fear of
 H. S. Suhrawardy, powerful
 leader of the Awami League who
 was ousted as prime minister in
 October.   Suhrawardy exerts a
 controlling in'Lluence over
 Noon's government by providing
 essential support without al-
 lowing his party to join the
 cabinet.   If national elections
 are held under this government
 next November as promised,
 Suhrawardy probably would emerge
 with dominant political strength.
 He would then be in a position
 to throw his support to some
 candidate other than Mirza
 in the parliamentary voting for
 president.
 Noon's government cannot
 be unseated easily, since it
 appears to have a comfortable
 margin of supporters united by
 their opposition to the Moslem
 League and its negotiations
 with Mirza.   Loyalties can
 shift rapidly, however, once the
 parliamentary maneuvering be-
 gins.   The absence of Suhrawardy,
 who will be in Europe for medi-
 cal treatment until late March,
 is likely to weaken the coali-
 tion's unity.
 Should the present govern-
 ment fall, Mirza would be in a
 position to claim that all
 political parties have failed to
 provide stable leadership and
 that his only alternative is
 resort to authoritarian rule.
 There is some evidence,  however,
 that he no longer commands the
 general support necessary for
 such a move.

 13 February 1958
 Since beginning his second
 term in December,  Philippine
 President Garcia has been pre-
 occupied largely with economic
 problems.   His administration's
 major actions have been emer-
 gency measures to meet growing
 inflationary pressures, the
 rapid decline of the country's
 foreign exchange reserves, and
 the prospects of a serious rice
 shortage resulting from drought
 and speculation.   An austerity
 program, involving some slow-
 down of economic development,
 has been launched through cred-
 it and import cuts, reduced
 government spending, and curbs
 of illegal foreign exchange
 transactions.   Whether the
 program can be enforced is
 still uncertain.   The probable
 need to increase rice imports
 has aggravated economic diffi-
 culties.
 The Philippines may hope
 eventually to resolve its
 economic problems through a
 currency stabilization loan
 from the United States.   Garcia
 may be contemplating early peso
 devaluation to precede such
 a request.   So far, Garcia
 has sought only a loan to con-
 struct a steel mill and indi-
 cated he may seek a loan for
 economic development, allow-
 ing use of foreign exchange
 earnings for more immediate
 needs.

 have been foreshadowed by the
 anti-Garcia flavor of disputes
 over organization of the lower
 house in the first week of the
 new congressional session.   Al-
 though Garcia apparently hoped
 to include Vice President Maca-
 pagal, a member of the opposition
 Liberal party, in his cabinet,
 both the Liberals and adminis-
 tration  Nacionalistas have op-
 posed such a development, and
 Macapagal has already moved to
 assert opposition leadership.
 Although Garcia has ex-
 pressed his intention to reopen
 talks with the United States
 on military bases on the diplo-
 matic level, such a move has
 been delayed by his failure to
 name a permanent foreign af-
 fairs secretary.   Garcia's
 attitude toward a final bases
 settlement, moreover, remains
 uncertain in view of his hesi-
 tation to dissolve the Philip-
 pine panel which handled the
 suspended 1956 talks, and by
 recent indications that he will
 elevate Under Secretary of
 Justice Jesus Barrera to the
 cabinet.   As a member of the
 panel, Barrera proved the major
 obstacle to an acceptable re-
 vision of terms governing juris-
 diction over American military
 personnel, and, as secretary of
 justice,  he would be in a posi-
 tion to cause trouble on this
 question.
 In the political field,
 Garcia has moved slowly.   He
 has yet to fill several cabinet
 posts and, when he does so,

 heavily on consultations with

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN THE SOVIET INDUSTRIAL REORGANIZATION
 The Khrushchev-engineered
 industrial         reorganization  in
 the USSR, still in its early
 stages, apparently has not yet
 succeeded in  significantly
 paring the number of economic
 administrative personnel.   Many
 of the hundreds of thousands
 of administrators from  the
 abolished ministries have re-
 mained in Moscow and other ma-
 jor cities and 104 regional
 councils of national economy
 (sovnarkhozy) are being staffed
 largely by local personnel.
 Identifications to date of top
 sovnarkhoz officials show that
 experienced industrial man-
 agers, rather than party  ca-
 reerists, have received most
 of the council chairmanships.
 While the reorganization may
 ameliorate some administrative
 difficulties stemming from the
 overcentralization of the econ-
 omy, it heightens the problem
 of "localism" which the regime
 is combating through a strength-
 ened party apparatus and a re-
 vamped State Planning Commis-
 sion - (Gosplan) .

 Personnel Problems
 There is abundant evidence
 that most employees of the abol-
 ished ministries have been loath
 to leave Moscow, where decisions
 are made and promotions doled
 out.  itccording to a statement
 in late October by the  first
 deputy chairman of the Moscow
 City Soviet, very few officials
 of the former ministries had
 left Moscow and he did not ex-
 pect many to do so.   Apparently
 many of the administrators who
 did have to leave for the prov-
 inces have left their families
 in Moscow and will attempt to
 return to the capital at the
 first opportunity.
 Of 20 former USSR minis-
 ters whose present positions
 have been identified, 11 have
 remained in Moscow as ministers
 of the Russian Republic (RSFSR)
 or as deputy chairmen of the
 USSR and RSFSR Gosplans, and
 only four have appointed sov-

 whose present jobs are known,
 nine have been assigned jobs
 in Moscow and 22 have become
 chairmen and deputy chairmen
 of sovnarkhozy.  Many of these
 ministers and deputy ministers
 have suffered a diminution of
 prestige.
 Throughout the late summer
 and fall there have been nu-
 merous complaints in-the,'press
 about staffing difficulties in
 the sovnarkhozy.  As late as
 13 October, four months after
 the reorganization was to have
 been accomplished, the Kirov
 Sovnarkhoz had yet to fill 73
 jobs.   This derived in  part
 fro)n the dearth of former,min-
 isterial personnel available
 for these particular positions.
 The chairmen of the Ivanovo
 Sovnarkhoz in June stated that
 only 15 of the 650 staff mem-
 bers of the sovnarkhoz  had
 come from Moscow.  Only 18 out
 of an expected 83 Moscow spe-
 cialists had arrived in the
 Kemerovo Sovnarkhoz.
 Aside from the reluctance
 of people to leave the capital
 cities, another factor in the
 staffing picture has been the
 resistance of provincial of-
 ficials to persons from  the
 central industrial  apparatus
 who are not familiar with local
 conditions.   Officials in the
 city of Chelyabinsk recently
 at moe
 of the ex-ministry people would
 be useless in the sovnarkhozy
 since they have been two  far
 removed from the conditions oar
 industrial work to be of much
 immediate use.
 Most sovnarkhoz staffs
 have  been  filled  by  local
 people, not only ,administrative
 personnel ' but' in some cases
 specialists and engineers pre-
 viously directly involved in
 production.  The chairman of
 the Zaporozhye Sovnarkhoz,
 complaining about withdrawing
 engineers from producti.on,wrote
 in Party Life: "We attempted
 to take as-few specialists as
 possible from enterprises; un-
 fortunately, we did not suc-
 ceed."  Thus it would appear
 that the number ofISoviet in-
 dustrial administrative per-
 sonnel,has not been substantial-.
 ly..reduced.
 .  The Central Statistical
 Administration itself reported
 on 27 January that only 56,000
 employees of the former minis-
 tries, departments, and other
 administrative organizations
 had  been freed to. work di-
 ret t1y in industry.
