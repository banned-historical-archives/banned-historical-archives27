 to be against something or to react: We must
 act * * *.   I agree-but his boss does not
 seem to agree. We don't act.
 To me, the way to ultimate victory is a
 positive program to persuade our allies to ban
 all  strategic  trade  with  the  Sino-Soviet
 bloc,  including  Yugoslavia,  Poland,    and
 Cuba.  As for ourselves, I would harden our
 export policy and likewise let it be firmly
 known to neutrals and friendly nations alike
 that all aid to them will stop unless and
 until these nations firm up their policies in
 harmony with ours.
 The Select Committee on Export Controls
 of the House of Representatives will shortly
 be submitting a complete report to the
 Congress.
 Meanwhile, its chairman, Mr. KITcHIN,
 made  a  statement giving his  opinion  as
 follows:
 "First. The economic phase of this prolong-
 ed, tense cold war is becoming more im-
 portant each day.  As our military posture
 and that of the Soviet bloc approach a
 stalemate, due to the absolute destructive
 power-of each to annihilate civilization in a
 nuclear military conflict, the economic phase
 attains the status of a prime and strategic
 operation.
 "Second. Continued  emphasis  must  be
 placed on the vital area of trade, with the
 Sino-Soviet bloc.  The cooperation of our
 Western allies is of paramount importance.
 "Third. There must be a readjustment of
 our thinking as regards our present status
 quo attitude.  It. is imperative that we ac-
 quire a realistic appreciation that while we
 are maintaining the peace we may be losing
 the cold war.
 "Fourth. A strong and affirmative policy
 on foods and fibers to the bloc must en-
 compass a philosophy of peace for food as
 well as food for peace."
 George Washington once expressed confi-
 dence the American people would always do
 the right thing if they had the facts.
 Our export policy is not favorable to an
 informed opinion.
 The Government has shrouded much of
 the export control policy in secrecy.
 The people are unaware to a great extent
 of the functioning of the Cocom program and
 only occasionally when word leaks out of
 transactions such as the sale by England to
 Red China of planes, do they learn of its
 ineffectiveness.
 Some matters involving security,-of course,
 cannot be published, but secrecy is greatly
 overdone.  The privilege is often used to
 cover up mistakes and to try and avoid em-
 barrassment over error and weak decisions
 of both ourselves and our allies.
 This attitude prevents mobilization  of
 public opinion against continuing policy
 failure and ineffective administration.
 What we need, it seems to me, is full
 and frank disclosure of the facts.  The peo-
 ple should have the truth.  If they had
 it, I am sure there would be a stiffening
 of policy and a demand for stern measures
 by the entiie free world.
 Let the peoples under the yoke of com-
 munism earn anew their freedom by hunger,
 hardship, and harsh sacrifice.  Let the peo-
 . ples under the threat of communism do
 the same.

 resolutions of the Punta del Este Conference

 victory for freedom and decency. over the
 Castro brothers. Fidel and Raul, provided
 swift, decisive actions implement the de-
 claration that the Soviet Sauleiters of Cuba
 no longer enjoy the protection of the law."
 The Maryland author, educator, and diplo-
 mat added:
 "There is now moral, ethical, and juridical
 basis for the apprehension and arrest of the
 Marxist-Leninist, criminal conspirators who,
 by an adroit admixture of deceit and vio-
 lence,                                                                     seized  power over a good  neighbor

 captive nation. The Cuban people have the

 brothers, in the eyes of the law, are worse
 than the unlamented, Cuban military dicta-
 tor, Gen. Fulgencio Batista.  The latter, al-
 though a tyrant, never merited the outlaw
 status that has been established with regard
 to Fidel Castro. .The bearded prophet can
 masquerade no longer as the Robin Hood of
 Latin America.  He has been indicted, tried,
 and convicted by his peers.  Only the pen-
 alties need to be spelled out and applied.
 "Apparently, Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 whose skill and patience were submitted to a
 severe test in Uruguay, has determined`that
 a complete program of action must be sched-

 A clue to the Western Hemisphere situation
 can be noted in the presence of Franciso

 in the Fidel Castro stronghold in Havana.
 But Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, ex-President. of

 House Resolution 543 To Authorize the
 Committee on Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce To Conduct an Investigation
 and Study of the Adequacy of the Reg-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JAMES E. VAN ZANDT
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 22, 1962
 Mr. VAN ZANDT. Mr. Speaker, when
 I introduced House Resolution 543 on
 February 12, 1962, I stated its purpose is
 to direct the Committee on Interstate
 and Foreign Commerce to make an in-
 tensive review, of the manner in which
 the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Fed-
 eral Aviation Agency have regulated the
 nonsked airline industry.  It is my be-
 lief, based on the evidence before our
 special subcommittee of the House Com-
 mittee on Armed Services, as well as
 my own investigations, that the Imperial
 Airlines accident is attributable to the
 loose regulation of these carriers by the
 CAB and the FAA, as well as the poor
 management of the carrier.
 In view of the magnitude of our sched-
 uled air carrier industry, I am not per-
 suaded that there was a demonstrated
 need for these nonscheduled certificates,
 and in holding them illegal, the court of
 appeals disagreed with the CAB, too, in

 Representative Moss wrote Mr. Brucker
 that the letter requesting the Army to sup-
 press the air raid warning report was sent
 in August to Lt. Gen. Arthur G. Trudeau,
 Army Chief of Research.
 Representative Moss said the report was
 not secret, but had been withheld from the
 press.  He asked Mr. Brucker to cite "spe-
 cific statutory authority for withholding it
 from the public."
 SIRENS IGNORED
 The study, stamped "For official use only,"
 said a large proportion of the Nation's air
 raid sirens were not loud enough to alert
 the civilian population.  It urged develop-
 ment of a low-cost alarm system which could
 be installed in every house and building in
 the United States.
 It also concluded that the average Ameri-
 can citizen-even when he hears a siren-
 usually ignores its warning because of the
 large number of practice alerts and siren
 tests.
 Concerning Conelrad, the report noted that
 the radio system's original purpose of pre-
 venting enemy aircraft from using radio
 beacons for navigation was designed to de-
 fend against manned bombers and would
 be meaningless in the age of missiles.

 Representative Moss said in a statement
 that "political facesaving has been claimed
 by an administration bureaucrat as justifica-

 "These are dangerous games for politicians
 to be playing," Representative Moss said.
 "To suppress public information because
 someone might be embarrassed is a threat to
 the fabric of democratic self-government."
 Earlier this month Mr. Hoegh denied that
 he had tried to suppress the still-secret re-
 port, prepared under contract for the Army
 by the Operation Research Office of Johns
 Hopkins University.  Army officials have said
 the report will not be made public until they
 have had an opportunity to review it.
 CALLS SYSTEM OBSOLETE
 The study, written under the direction of
 Theodore J. Wang, asserts that the present
 air-raid warning system does not provide pro,
 tection in the age of intercontinental bal-
 listic missiles.  It says the Conelrad radio
 system, mainly designed to prevent enemy
 planes from navigating on commercial radio
 beacons, is obsolete in the era of pilotless
 missiles.
 It also says present-day sirens are incapable
 of warning large segments of the U.S. popu-
 lation and recommends a buzzer system be
 .established in all homes and public buildings.
 Representative Moss said subcommittee in-
 vestigators had discovered that the author of
 the report was invited to present his findings
 at a national conference of the U.S. Civil De-
 fense Council in September.  He said Mr.
 Hoegh, learning about the proposed presenta-
 tion, called on the Army to consider the pro-
 priety of the study.
 "But, before the Army had a chance to
 act," Mr. Moss said, "Hoegh moved on his
 own to make certain the scientist's findings
 would be suppressed."
 Representative Moss said the author of the
 report was told after a meeting between Mr.
 Hoegh and the conference officials that he
 would not be on the program.

 ARMY   RELEASES   REPORT   ATTACKING   AIR-
 WARNING  SETUP AS INADEQUATE
 The Army-under pressure from congres-
 sional investigators-yesterday removed the
 wraps from an unclassified report which said
 the Nation's air raid warning system is in-
 adequate in the missile age.
 The report, prepared under contract with
 the Operations Research Office of Johns Hop-
 kins University, called on the Office of Civil
 and Defense Mobilization to set up a na-
 tional buzzer alarm system in private homes
 and public buildings.
 Earlier this week, Chairman JOHN E. Moss,
 Democrat, of California, of the House Gov-
 ernment Information Subcommittee accused
 OCDM Director Leo A. Hoegh of pressuring
 The Defense Department is preparing to
 scrap the existing conelrad system for broad-
 casting information to the American public
 by radio in the event of nuclear war.
 In its  place,  the  Department  plans to
 establish a greatly modified system designed
 to overcome acknowledged weaknesses in the
 present setup and to allow local authorities
 greater control over broadcasting of public
 information.
 Officials of the Department's Office of Civil
 Defense have refused to comment on the im-
 pending changes.  However, it is known that
 OOD has won the approval of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff and the Federal Communications
 Commission for a drastic overhaul of the
 system.
 REASONS FOR SECRECY
 Reliable sources say the secrecy surround-
 ing the project is due to the fact that details
 have not been fully worked out.  In addi-
 tion, these sources report, Pentagon officials
 are reluctant to discuss the matter because
 the Canadian Government has not yet ap-
 proved changing the system.  Conelrad is a
 joint United States-Canadian venture.
 Official announcement of the new system,
 it is said, will not be made until these two
 problems are resolved.
 The present setup, established in the early
 1950's, represented an attempt to reconcile
 certain conflicts between military and civil
 defense officials.
 The Government recognized that it had
 to have a means of getting information to
 the public before, during, and after an enemy
 attack.  But the Air Force, concerned at that
 time with defense against manned bombers,
 insisted that any broadcasting system con-
 tain  safeguards to  prevent  enemy planes
 from picking up a radio signal and using it
 as a guide to their target.
 The result was a, plan under which the
 FCC set aside two airwave frequencies for
 exclusive civil defense use on a nationwide
 basis.  These frequencies, 640 and 1240, have
 since been widely publicized as the conelrad
 stations to which the public should turn
 for emergency information.
 The Government then selected a number
 of radio stations (theoretically there is one
 in every American municipality or county)
 that could change over from their regular fre-
 quencies to one of the two conelrad frequen-
 cies during an emergency.
 These stations were then assigned to two
 conelrad nets, a national net embracing every
 participating station in the country and a
 regional net including all participating sta-
 tions within a specified area.
 The nets were to work this way:
 The national net has a secret control center
 in direct contact with the North American
 Air Defense Command and the White House.
 From it, mesages of national importance can
 be sent out simultaneously through every
 conelrad station in the country,
 REGIONAL NETS
 the Army into withholding the. report from    Similarly each regional net has its own
 the public.                                    control center to originate messages of a

 A1353
 Thus District officials wishing to relay in-
 formation to District residents would have to
 submit the message to the control center for
 transmission:  The message when sent would
 be heard not only on conelrad stations in the
 Washington area but also on those in Balti-
 more, Richmond, and every other station in
 the net.
 The system contains three safeguards to
 prevent enemy planes from using an inter-
 cepted signal to "home in" on a target:
 The conelrad frequencies are on a low=
 power transmission system that gives off a
 weak signal.  This signal, which carries for
 about 50 miles from the outlet station, is
 considered sufficientto reach everyone within
 a specific locality but not strong enough to
 be intercepted by enemy planes from a great
 distance.
 The fact that a multiplicity of stations
 would be broadcasting simultaneously on the
 same two frequencies would hamper enemy
 navigators in their attempts to follow the
 signal to a specific source.
 No city, State, or other political jurisdic-
 tion can be mentioned by name over conel-
 rad.                                                                                                                             This is to prevent enemy planes from
 identifying a signal with a specific locality.
 These elaborate safeguards have been a
 continual source of frustration from the out-
 set to State and local civil defense authori-
 ties.  Among their specific complaints:
 The necessity of originating local messages
 from a control center that might be several
 hundred miles away from the community for
 which the message is intended represents a
 roundabout and time-consuming process.
 Competition with national messages that
 take priority and with the other political
 jurisdictions in the regional net for time on
 the air would also delay urgent messages,
 perhaps keeping them from being delivered
 in time.
 The Individual trying to get local informa-
 tion over his radio would be confused by
 messages intended for other jurisdictions
 within the regional net.
 This last complaint is perhaps the most
 serious against the system, since communi-
 ties cannot be identified by name in conel-
 rad messages.
 Thus a message intended for District resi-
 dents  could be identified only as coming
 from "Commissioner Tobriner" (Walter To-
 briner, Chairman of the District Commis-
 sioners).  Such a system is highly danger-
 ous, civil defense officials contend, because .
 large segments of the public cannot be de-
 pended upon to know the name of their local
 and State authorities.
 Acknowledgment of these weaknesses by
 the Defense Department has finally led to
 the decision to overhaul the system.  In this,
 the Department has been aided by a recent
 relaxing of the Air Force's formerly inflexible
 insistence on retaining the system's safe-
 guards.
 This change of heart has been prompted
 by the Air Force's feeling that the main
 threat of attack will soon come from guided
 missiles, which cannot make use of radio
 signals, rather than manned aircraft.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF     -
 HON. GEORGE HUDDLESTON, JR.
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 22, 1962
 Mr. HUDDLESTON.  Mr. Speaker, I
 am very pleased to call to the attention
 of the House the festival of arts program
 that is going on in Birmingham right
 Among the thousands of letters to       been and is being widely imitated in
 American newspaper editors is one from  other cities throughout the country and
 the pen of Raye O. Lawson of the World- we in Birmingham are glad to share our
 Wide Detective Service, Inc., Richmond,
 Va., which appeared in newspapers in
 the State of Virginia.  The brief, yet
 thought-provoking title, "Just 74 Boys"
 Is followed by a penetrating and poignant
 description of the crash of the Imperial
 Airlines cargo plane which is attributed
 to the frenzied desire of the Federal
 Government to spend money for every
 conceivable type of program; yet when
 it comes to safeguarding human lives
 they are sacrificed on the altar of mam-
 mon on the flimsy pretext-"the Gov-
 ernment has to save money."
 The letter written by Raye O. Lawson
 To the EDITOR :
 They are expendable.
 Seventy-four young men, more boys, many
 'fresh from high school graduation, full of
 hope, with their boyish ambitions and young
 Interests,  several of  them  an  only  child,
 perish like trapped rats in the flames of a
 burning air boxcar.       To the parents, the
 moms and dads who had reared and loved
 these kids they were their all, their life.
 To the Army they were  expendable.
 The Government has to save money, the
 Army with all its planes, with good airlines,
 with  regularly  scheduled routes,  and  ex-
 perienced pilots, the Army contracts with
 shoestring contract haulers.  Money to go t9
 the moon, money for flying VIP's in the best
 of planes, money for junkets for "two bed-
 room Charlies," but for these kids the Army
 had to economize. They were just 74 future
 soldiers.                               -
 In the old days it was 40 homme or 8
 experience with others.  For those that
 are not familiar with the festival of arts,
 I should explain that it lasts for nearly
 all of the month of February and it is a
 period crowded with artistic and cultural
 events.
 The. citizens of Birmingham and all of
 Alabama are proud of the wonderful
 traditions of the festivals of arts that
 have been built over the years.  It is,
 I believe, getting better each year and
 although Birmingham is the youngest of
 the world's great cities we have built a
 fine reputation for encouraging and'pro-
 moting the arts.  We have art shows
 presenting only our local artists that fill
 our fine museum, during the festival.
 Our local musicians are kept busy trying
 to keep up with the demand for their
 talents.  There is a variety of competi-
 tions that are widely participated'in by
 people from all over Alabama. I could
 go on for a long time about our great
 festival but I just want to commend the
 following article to the attention of the
 Members.  The article appeared in the
 Birmingham magazine for January and
 gives a good account of the success of
 the festival of arts:
 AN  AMERICAN  RENAISSANCE:  BIRMINGHAM'S
 FESTIVAL OF ARTS
 or
 and full symphony orchestra will perform
 together in the difficult Puccini Triptych,
 "Gianni Schicchi," "II Tabarro," and "Suor
 Angelica."    Four   of  Birmingham's   five
 theater groups will present O'Neill's "Be-
 yond the Horizon," "Troilus and Cressida,"
 the religious drama "Everyman,", and Wild-
 er's "Our Town."
 The community's three ballet companies
 will be presented in performances.  A special
 flamenco exhibition has been arranged by
 the Birmingham Classical Guitar Society.  A
 string trio will present the festival's award-
 winning chamber music composition.
 The festival calendar  also  includes the
 world's largest camellia show, antique and
 coin collections, young artists concerts, cul-
 tural lectures and films, exhibits and tours
 of Birmingham churches and artists' studios.
 Eighty chairmen head the many events
 that are part of the festival.
 These chairmen and their committees in-
 clude public officials, civic and business
 leaders, artisans, professional men, spiritual
 leaders, laborers, students, homemakers, club
 members, and others.
 Nearly 500 persons are  involved in the
 steering organization of the festival.  Fes-
 tival events have an attendance of more
 than 75,000.   It is estimated that 10,000
 more are engaged in the many details inci-
 dental to an event of such broad scope.
 Thus nearly 100,000 people from all walks
 of life in Birmingham have a part as specta-
 tor or participant in a festival that makes
 culture an exciting, enjoyable experience for
 increasing numbers.
 The recently established festival of arts
 office at city hall encourages continuation of
 long range planning for the festival each
 year.  Mayor Arthur J. Hanes, whose office
 adjoins the festival office, is cochairman of
 the 1962 festival.  He probably would not
 have considered himself a candidate for cul-
 tural leader in the late thirties when he
 was a star college gridder.
 But  Birmingham's  advancement in  the
 arts has made Hanes, as it has other leaders
 and citizens, acutely aware of the value of
 culture to a community.
 Mayor Hanes observes, "When industry
 considers expansion, it looks for cities with
 a good educational system and active cul-
 tural opportunities as well as a suitable busi-
 ness climate." ?
 Interest of civic and business leaders in
 the festival is indicated by the fact that

 Interest of youth in the festival is aroused
 by such events as a performance by the 85-

 scouts for  participation in  a nationwide
 project, and additional youth-slanted activi-
