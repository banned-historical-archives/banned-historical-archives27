FROM 
SUBJECT : 
C/METAS 
Annual Defense Report 
1. You asked me to look through the attached DoD Budget 
document to see if anything in it might impact on the DDA or 
the Agency. 
2. Section I (what I call the "Doom and Gloom" section) 
spells out the perceived threat and the necessary U. S. Defense 
strategy to meet that threat. There are many comparisons 
between U. S. and U.S.S.R. expenditures for defense, various 
weapons systems, manpower commitments, etc., which may or may 
not be valid, but they serve to justify and increase in U. S. 
defense spending. 
3. Section II addresses individual defense programs 
(i.e., nuclear forces, conventional forces, security assistance, 
etc.), the basis for the programs and individual justifica-
tions which relate to the picture drawn in Section I. 
4. It is written in very broad, general terms, addresses 
overall programs rather than specific elements, and deals 
very heavily in military strategy. I did not find anything 
that would be of specific interest to the DDA. To the extent 
that CIA's intelligence collection and production on Soviet 
military (force strengths, capabilities and intentions) support 
DoD policy decisions, that impact has probably already been 
made. 
5. One interesting point, however, that I was not aware 
of before is the fact that DoD incorporates U. S. inflation 
into their budget estimates.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
FY 1978 DEFENSE REPORT  
The task of the U.S. Department of Defense -- indeed the first 
responsibility of the United States government -- is to protect the lives 
and liberties of the American people in a world that is difficult, tense, 
and even dangerous for those who seek to live in freedom and dignity. 
The FY 1978 Defense Report sets forth the conditions we face, together 
.with U.S. national security goals and needs. This summary describes the 
main trends in the international environment and the path we are taking to 
meet the dangers and opportunities of the period ahead.

the morale of the men and women of the U.S. armed forces has 
continued to improve and the American people increasingly recognize the 
contributions the armed forces make to our security and to peace and 
stability in the world; 
-- the President and the national security leadership have been 
necessarily forthright with the country as to the magnitude and momentum 
of Soviet defense outlays and the resulting expansion of their military 
capabilities over more than a decade; 
the downward trend in U.S. defense spending (measured in constant 
dollars) has been reversed; and 
-- serious efforts have been undertaken to achieve equitable arms 
control agreements which are in the national interest. 
Real growth in the U.S. defense efforts in FY 1976 and FY 1977 has 
enabled us to improve defense and deterrence by: 
needed modernization of U.S. strategic forces; 
-- expansion of the Army's conventional force to 16 active divisions 
and their modernization; 
-- steps toward restoration of the Navy's capability for two-ocean 
sea control and the projection of power; 
expansion of the Air Force to 26 tactical fighter wings; 
improved combat readiness on the part of the forces; 
added research and development to strengthen U.S. technology. 
The accomplishments have been accompanied by some disappointments, 
several of which require consideration by the new Congress. 
-- Reductions in the defense budgets proposed by successive Presi-
dents have retarded the rate of modernization and expansion of U.S. 
forces; it has been less than that demanded by the continued growth in 
Soviet military capabilities; 
-- Reluctance to accept technological advance endangers U.S. 
security. We must strive to maintain the U.S. technological superiority 
which has contributed so much to our security over past decades. 
-- Support to improvements in strategic mobility is necessary to 
avoid an inefficient use of scarce resources and a shortage of capability 
to reinforce and resupply forward deployed forces.

-- Support by the Congress of a number of restraints is necessary 
to reduce waste, inefficiencies, and misplaced priorities. Realignment 
of bases to fit the numbers and needs of present day forces is essential 
to avoid serious consequences to overall efficiency and effectiveness. 
The Defense Report for FY 1978 is presented against this background. 
Last year, the FY 1977 Report stressed the growth in Soviet military 
power relative to that of the United States because of decisions made 
over the previous decade. To reverse that unacceptable course, President 
Ford proposed a real increase in last year's defense budget. Although 
$3.8 billion of the FY 1977 request was not approved, the budget, as 
passed, did provide a real increase of 5.8 percent between FY 1976 and 
FY 1977. Since the problem of security demands a long-term commitment 
of steady growth and modernization, even more effort will be required of 
us in the coming fiscal years.

Neither the high quality of U.S. technology and weapons nor the considerable 
talents and skills of the men and women of the armed forces will continue 
to make up for the quantitative advantages of such an adversary. As in 
the past, forces and weapons systems adequate to meet U.S. national 
security requirements do not come cheaply. 
It is with such considerations in mind that the President presents 
his defense budget for FY 1978 and the projected Five-Year Detense 
Program. Total obligational authority of $123.1 billion and outlays of 
$110.1 billion are requested for FY 1978. Totals for FY 1977 and those 
now projected for the Five-Year Defense Program are shown in the following 
table:

Proposed real growth in total obligational authority from FY 1977 to 
FY 1978 will be about 6.8 percent, practically all of which will go to 
the investment accounts -- primarily procurement and research and develop-
ment. Based on current assumptions about expected pay and price increases 
during the period of the Five-Year Defense Program, real growth from FY 
1978 to 1982 should continue to be substantial and, most of it, again, 
will be concentrated in investment accounts. 
The ability of the United States to afford such expenditures is not 
in question. Indeed, we cannot afford to withhold the resources required 
for strength, stability, and peace. Although security must surely rank 
first among the nation's priorities, its price is small. In FY 1977, 
even after the Congress had provided for a real increase, the Defense 
share of GNP, of federal and total public spending, and of the total 
labor force was the lowest since before the Korean war.

II. Basis of the Projected Efforts 
Our nation simply cannot allow Soviet capabilities to continue expanding 
and U.S. capabilities to retrench -- as they have over the past decade --
without inviting an imbalance and, ultimately, a major crisis. The solution 
does not lie in adopting any specific or fixed annual increases in the 
defense budget; there is no magic percentage by which Defense resources 
must expand each year. Nor should we design the U.S. defense posture as 
the mirror-image of an opponent's capabilities, simple as this might 
appear; that would miss the essence of systematic planning and could rapidly 
lead to major and expensive absurdities in force posture. 
U.S. planning must include changes brought about by military technology. 
A number of major consequences have already followed from such technological 
advances: 
-- to a degree unprecedented in its history, the United States has 
become directly vulnerable to attack; 
-- the nation must now maintain three basic types of military 
force -- strategic nuclear, theater nuclear, and conventional -- with 
defense budgets which must be higher than during the seemingly quieter 
years before World War II; and 
-- the potential destructiveness of new weapons leads reasonable 
people to recognize that nuclear forces are instruments of last resort, 
and that the more traditional conventional capabilities remain of fundamental 
importance in today's world. In essence, we are seeing a revival in the 
importance of non-nuclear military capabilities.

The U.S. defense posture does not and cannot be made to relate 
directly to the short-term objectives and tactics of U.S. foreign policy, 
although it can and does contribute in a fundamental way to the environment 
in which foreign policy is formulated and conducted. In the geopolitics 
of an increasingly interdependent world, the U.S. defense establishment 
constitutes one set of instruments -- along with diplomatic, economic and 
other means -- at the disposal of the nation, and a diverse array of capa-
bilities is needed to achieve national objectives. Since long lead times 
are required to develop modern military capabilities, decisions made today 
determine the capabilities, not of today, but of the decades ahead. 
The world of today is no longer one of many great military powers. 
There are only two major powers -- the United States, which is the primary 
champion of freedom, self-determination, and international pluralism, and 
the Soviet Union, which has an imperial domain already sprawled over two 
continents and is the primary advocate of a command economy, centralized 
control, and the subjugation of the individual to the state. 
Unfortunately, U.S. views on international issues and on the importance 
of freedom are not expanding in the world. On 26 key issues before the 
United Nations in 1974 and 1975 -- including the resolution equating 
Zionism with racism and one eliminating the UN Command for Korea -- few 
nations shared the U.S. perspective. In fact, less than one-tenth of the 
member states voted as we did on a majority of these issues; over half 
voted against our position nearly every time. Those who voted consistently 
as we did total 13 nations out of over 140. 
Nor is personal freedom flourishing. Freedom House, a private 
research organization, reports that less than one-fifth of mankind enjoys 
a degree of freedom even approximating our own, while nearly half the 
world's population lives under a dictatorial regime of one stripe or 
another. The United States and its friends believe in self-determination 
for ourselves and others; the Soviet Union and its allies do not. 
Some might say that sounds like "cold war" rhetoric. I consider it 
simply the truth, and we best serve our ideals by talking the truth. To 
do otherwise would be to grant "moral parity" to authoritarian systems. 
Despite these fundamental differences, today's world is one of growing 
interdependence. Nations and peoples increasingly rely upon each other 
for supplies, industrial and agricultural goods, markets, investments, and 
technical know-how. 
From a defense perspective, we find that modern conventional weapons 
are no longer the exclusive property of the larger industrial states. 
Nuclear technology threatens to spread to many areas. A geopolitical 
map of the world shows the United States politically, economically, or 
culturally more dependent and more involved with other states and peoples 
than ever before in its history. These conditions, combined with the

weakening of the traditional international order, the collapse of old 
empires, and the rise of the Soviet Union as an active world power, make 
bold action across the oceans both more necessary and more dangerous. 
Events in a distant corner of this increasingly interdependent world 
cannot be ignored by the United States. 
Recognizing these facts, the United States has engaged in a search 
for the peaceful and equitable settlement of international differences. In 
particular: 
-- it was the United States which first sought seriously to control 
strategic nuclear arms and achieve mutual and balanced force reductions in 
Europe; and 
-- it was the United States which struggled to end the fighting in 
the Middle East and successfully concluded three agreements among former 
belligerents. 
While extensively involved in these efforts, we have kept the main 
and continuing interests of the United States firmly before us. Our 
fundamental interest lies in preserving the independence and territorial 
integrity of the United States and its possessions. Close behind are 
political and economic interests we share with various nations and alliances. 
These interests are worldwide in nature; they impel our determination to 
preserve freedom of the seas and of space.

Iii. Conditions of Peace and Security 
To create and maintain the conditions of peace and security in the 
world is in large part to avoid actions and conditions which are provocative 
belligerence on the one hand, weakness (which can be equally provocative) 
on the other. Either can encourage others into adventurism they might 
oLherwise avoid. The obligation of government is to preserve the strength, 
determination, and flexibility needed to achieve U.S. goals and contribute 
to stability around the world. 
Helping to establish the conditions of peace means avoiding a military 
imbalance in the world. Not only is a global nuclear balance necessary; 
so are a number of balances in regions vital to our interests. Precisely 
because traditional power depends upon large quantities of military equipment 
and supplies, long lines of communication, freedom of airspace, and control 
of essential seas, the U.S. must maintain strategic positions and forward 
deployed forces. These, in conjunction with the system of alliances we 
have maintained during the past three decades, provide leverage on prospective 
enemies and help to keep potential conflict from American shores.

armed forces to threaten U.S. vital interests. 
As the Defense Report pointed out last year, there are 4.4 million 
men in the Soviet military establishment -- compared with 2.1 million 
men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces. All elements of modern power 
are heavily represented in the Soviet military establishment, including 
intercontinental strategic nuclear forces, large and growing theater 
nuclear forces, and a wide range of modern conventional capabilities.

A significant portion of Soviet theater nuclear and conventional 
forces is oriented toward Western Europe, with 27 divisions and 1,400

265 aircraft in Hungary.. The USSR has an ICBM force that numerically is 
50 percent larger than our own, and some 75 ballistic missile submarines 
capable of attacking the United States. The Backfire bomber is coming 
into service. Soviet antibomber defenses remain substantial, and it is 
increasingly evident that they provide key elements of their population,

attacks. The Soviets have also increased their capability to project 
power far from their shores and from areas of their historical involvement. 
What we are witnessing, at a minimum, is a sustained effort on the 
part of the leaders in the Kremlin to expand their capabilities sufficiently 
to became major participants in world geopolitics. In certain respects, 
they have already broken through or leapfrogged the barriers erected by 
the containment policies of earlier decades. They can be expected to 
continue this process in the future. Certainly they will have a growing 
capability to do so. 
There is continuing momentum behind Soviet defense programs. While 
the U.S. defense budget was, until recently, in a long, slow decline in 
teal terms, the Soviet defense budget increased in real terms by more 
than a third over the past decade. 
Because of the steadily growing resources allocated to defense, the 
Soviets now outproduce the United States in tanks, armored personnel 
carriers, and artillery. Their output of tactical aircraft and even

helicopters is now greater than ours. So is their production of new 
ships, in terms of numbers delivered. However, since we have built 
larger individual units, new U.S. tonnage exceeds that of the Soviets by 
30 percent. 
While the United States has developed one new ICBM since 1965, the 
Soviets have developed seven. Of their newest generation of ICBMs, three 
have greater throw-weight, more and higher-yield multiple independently 
targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), and accuracies increasingly close 
to that of our newest ICBM. In light of an ever-growing base for the 
production of military materiel and an expanding corps of scientists and 
engineers devoted to military R&D, reasonable people must conclude that 
these programs will continue to accelerate. 
We know that Soviet leaders talk of being engaged in long-term 
competition with the West and of seeking to 'tilt the international 
"correlation of forces," including the military, in their favor; that they 
continue to sponsor and support "wars of national liberation;" and that 
their writings suggest an ultimate victory of Marxism over the evils of 
"capitalist-imperialism." Indeed, to describe the Soviet Union as a 
status quo power is to ignore much of what has been taking place over 
the past twenty years. 
The Kremlin is behaving as though it is determined to increase Soviet 
military power whether we show restraint or not; Sbviet.military programs 
which we observe and measure exceed those necessary for deterrence; and the 
magnitude of the Soviet military effort, impressive by any standard, 
continues the momentum that it has displayed for more than a decade. 
In short, we must base U.S. force planning on a recognition of the 
size and scope of the Soviet military capabilities as they are, not as we 
would wish them to be. This, indeed, is the most critical assumption 
underlying the defense budget for FY 1978 and the Five-Year Defense Program. 
I do not believe there is any other assumption that fits the facts about 
the Soviet Union and our world in the late 1970s. 
The future course of the People's Republic of China remains somewhat 
uncertain, as does our relationship with Peking. While we continue to 
seek more normal relations with the PRC, Peking is gradually developing an 
intercontinental and sea-based ballistic missile capability. Accordingly, 
we must take this into account in the design and deployment of U.S. 
strategic nuclear forces, even though the United States may not be a 
primary target. In addition, we must be aware of Peking's conventional 
capabilities. Allies in Asia are necessarily sensitive to the regional 
power of the PRC, and cannot ignore the possibility of local conflicts which 
could affect their interests, and ours. 
Other and lesser powers may also choose to challenge U.S. interests 
and friends. North Korea, Libya, and Cuba are only the most obviously

bellicose of the candidates. Such challenges may become more dangerous in 
the period ahead. The incidence of terrorism, occasionally fostered by 
irresponsible foreign leaders, could also increase in number and intensity, 
and terrorists could become more heavily armed with more sophisticated 
weapons. 
V. Challenges to Security 
Certain of these many challenges call for particular attention and 
concern. 
First among the dangers remains a nuclear attack on the United 
States itself. However remote and improbable such an attack may seem, the 
consequences of its occurrence would be so catastrophic that this possibility 
must take priority in U.S. planning. 
Second is the threat of a conventional conflict. Despite thirty 
years of peace and relative stability, Western Europe -- a region of the 
most vital political, economic, cultural, and strategic interest to the 
United States -- continues to face the armed might of the Soviet Union and 
its satellites. Warsaw Pact forces, both nuclear and conventional, are 
being steadily strengthened; their doctrine and posture continue to be 
offensive in character. 
A direct attack on NATO is not the only basis for continuing concern 
about Europe. The possibility of a succession crisis in Yugoslavia 
remains. Around the Mediterranean, large communist parties of Western 
Europe are exploiting the democratic process in order to seize power or 
gain a major share of it. This is being done under the banner of "Euro-
communism," as though it were not real communism and is therefore somehow 
more acceptable. 
The dangers in the Middle East and Persian Gulf are well known. We 
seek continuing progress toward a Middle East peace settlement. We also 
have a fundamental interest in uninterrupted access to Middle East oil 
and gas resources by the United States, and especially by Western Europe 
and Japan, at acceptable prices. Both objectives remain in doubt. 
Asia is still an area of high potential for conflict. The elements 
that compose the Asian balance are multiple and fluid, reflecting the 
complex relations among the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and 
Japan. Should conflict occur, it could have a significant long-term 
cffect on the regional and global balance. 
The dangers to current stability are diverse. They range from the 
possibility of armed attack across an established frontier in Korea to 
4.'dventurism in Southeast Asia, supported in varying degrees by some of 
,the communist nations of Asia. The present situation is not unfavorable, 
but it could deteriorate.

U.S. interests in South Asia and Africa are primarily political and 
economic, with strategic interests limited to lines of communication. 
The social and economic problems of these areas may well create conditions 
of local disorder and tension, which will be both disruptive in themselves 
and may offer opportunities for exploitation by the Soviet Union or 
other countries potentially hostile to the United States. 
U.S. interests in Latin America are both political and economic, 
although there are important strategic interests with respect to lines of 
communication, particularly for oil, and access to mineral resources. 
There are few contingencies, however, that might impose a substantial 
requirement for U.S. forces. This is not to say that threats to U.S. 
security might not arise in Latin America. The future status and security 
of the Panama Canal, Cuba's potential for subversion and intervention, and 
the persistence of possibly troublesome regional rivalries are serious 
problems. 
Two other dangers are global in scope. First, the Soviets have built 
and deployed major air and naval capabilities with which they could attempt 
to deny us freedom of the seas. Dependent as the United States is on free 
use of the seas -- as avenues of commerce and as a medium for projecting 
power and influence abroad -- such a threat would be unacceptable. Similarly, 
the Soviets are working on capabilities to interfere with U.S. capabilities 
in space. Any effort to use these capabilities would require a response, 
which could only come from the United States.

in summary, we must recognize the difference between the world we 
seek and the world we live in today. Democratic institutions are not 
spreading in the world, international stability is not increasing, conflicts 
are not decreasing in number or intensity, and the rule of law is not 
flourishing. Yet in the complex world of the 1970s, we have a great 
stake in standing fast on the frontiers of freedom and deterring the 
serious threats that exist. 
VI. The Role of America and Our Allies In The World 
Because we are one of the two maior powers in the world, we must 
continue to play a large role in international affairs. Were we to 
relinquish this role, there would be no other power substantial enough to 
counterbalance the USSR. Is there anyone who seriously believes that in 
the absence of U.S. military power as a counterweight to the Soviets, they 
would long be restrained from expanding their influence by whatever means 
were available? 
The mantle of leadership for those who believe in freedom has passed 
to America. Our friends in Europe, while contributing to our collective 
security, are no longer comparable powers. Further, with technological 
advances in weaponry, the United States has lost the luxury of time in 
which to mobilize forces, adapt industry to war production, learn from the 
mistakes of others, and step into the conflict when prepared. Today, 
no one can hold an enemy at the gates long enough to permit a leisurely 
U.S. mobilization. With modern technology, that day has passed. There is 
no alternative but to be prepared and thereby to deter.

While we do not count on the contribution of our allies in the 
design of U.S. nuclear forces, we do rely on them in structuring our 
general purpose forces. For certain major contingencies, such as an 
attack by the Warsaw Pact, we assume that all NATO commitments will be met 
and that, at a minimum, the forces pledged to the Alliance will become 
available as scheduled. This assumption materially reduces the need for 
U.S. general purpose forces in such contingencies. Nevertheless, experience 
has shown that we cannot rely on our major regional allies at all times 
and in all circumstances. 
VII. Arms Control and Deterrence 
Arms control negotiations naturally play a role in the design of 
defense posture. The primary U.S. objective in these negotiations is 
security through increased stability. We would prefer a world in which neither 
major power had incentive either to attack the other or to strive for a 
long-term military advantage. We also seek to reduce uncertainty about 
the future and limit the costs of defense. 
While hopeful, we must also be realistic in this complex, sensitive 
and even risky area. So far, arms control successes have been modest. The 
ABM Treaty of 1972 has forestalled extensive deployment of ABM systems, 
and the Interim Offensive Agreement of SALT, due to expire in October 
1977, placed a ceiling on the number of U.S. and Soviet ICBMs and SLBMs. 
Such measures have clearly not dulled the Soviet appetite for new and 
more capable strategic offensive systems, nor have they assured stability. 
The Vladivostok Understanding of 1974 would come closer to realizing our 
goals, but a new treaty has not yet emerged. The reason is clear. Despite 
repeated U.S. proposals, movement thus far by the Soviet Union has not 
been sufficient to permit the signature of an agreement that would be 
in the U.S. national security interest. 
The ,complex multinational negotiations for mutual and balanced force 
reductions in Central Europe have not as yet produced anything concrete. 
While arms control measures could conceivably impose restraints and reduce 
the incentives for war, these goals remain before us. The facts of the 
present must form more of a basis for U.S. defense planning than hopes 
for the future. 
VIII. Strategic Nuclear Concepts and Forces 
In designing U.S. strategic forces, three main contingencies are 
considered: 
-- a surprise attack by the Soviet strategic forces against the 
U.S. retaliatory capabilities postured in their regular day-to-day status; 
-- a sudden Soviet attack against an alerted U.S. posture, a 
posture which has many more bombers on alert and SLBMs at sea because of

SECRET 
a deteriorating international situation; and 
-- a sequential PRC-Soviet attack against an alerted U.S. posture. 
U.S. force planning centers on the first contingency -- a Soviet surprise 
attack on our day-to-day force posture -- since the other contingencies 
prove to be less demanding. 
It should be emphasized in this context that nuclear forces make up a 
continuum of capabilities. They must therefore be assessed together 
because: 
-- Soviet nuclear forces cannot be fitted neatly into either 
strategic or theater categories. Variable-range ICBMs have been based in 
their medium-range sites, and both the SS-X-20 missile and the Backfire 
bomber are indefinite as to range capabilities and missions. 
-- The outcome of some nuclear conflicts may depend as much on an 
ability to hold or occupy territory as on the destruction of specific 
targets. For this reason, aircraft and missiles designed to perform deep 
missions and attack "strategic" targets, may not always have the decisive 
role in nuclear warfare. 
-- Important "gray area" systems -- such as the SS-X-20, Backfire, 
and cruise missiles -- do not fall into the current arms control categories 
of central and non-central systems, yet they cannot be ignored. 
The primary function of the continuum of nuclear forces is to deter 
attack and prevent nuclear blackmail. Even though they absorb no more 
than 20 percent of the total defense budget, nuclear forces provide the 
foundation of deterrence. That foundation must be solid at all times, to 
underpin the entire defense structure and our system of collective security. 
Soviet nuclear capabilities can be expected to improve in the future 
as they have done so dramatically In the past. Between 1965 and 1976, 
their ICBM force increased from 224 to more than 1,500 launchers and their 
SLBM force from 29 to 800 launchers. They began the modernization of 
their long-range bomber force and made a considerable increase in their 
deliverable nuclear weapons. 
If the Soviet strategic posture is already impressive today -- in 
numbers, throw-weight, and survivability -- it is becoming even more so in 
terms of qualitative improvements which are part of the current wave of 
modernization. 
Three rather definite statements about developments in Soviet nuclear 
programs can be made: 
-- Whatever their motives, the Soviets have greatly expanded and 
improved their strategic posture.

-- Soviet programs do not reflect an interest in deterrence by 
massive retaliation alone; their strategic nuclear posture is developing 
a war-fighting capability. 
-- While the Soviets are not likely to succeed in the admittedly 
complex, costly, and difficult task of achieving meaningful nuclear superiority, 
it is clear that their capabilities are taking them in that direction.

To preserve deterrence, U.S. forces must be designed so that, if 
necessary, they are able to absorb an attack -- rather than depend on 
warning for their survival -- and strike back after enemy weapons have 
actually detonated. The most efficient basis for such a second-strike 
capability is a mixed force of ICBMs, SLBMs and bombers -- known as the 
strategic Triad -- which interact strongly to increase the survivability 
of each part. 
The United States must also be concerned with the stability and 
flexibility of the strategic deterrent. The posture represented by the 
second-strike Triad should not be mistaken for overkill, as is so often 
the tendency. 
Continued modernization of U.S. nuclear ystems is imperative in 
light of increased Soviet capabilities. Before the mid-1980s, the Soviets 
could possibly have the capability, with a small fraction of their ICBMs, 
to destroy the bulk of the Minuteman/Titan force. While this would in no 
way give the Soviets a disarming first-strike, it could create a dangerous

isymmetry. Since much of the U.S. capability for Controlled, selective 
resnonses resides in the Minuteman force, it may be desirable to make 
the U.S. ICBM force increasingly mobile. Naturally, the United States 
would prefer to avoid this costly turn of events and prolong the life of 
fixed ICBM forces on both sides a good deal longer. 
In any event, we must make sure that the U.S. nuclear posture inspires 
the correct perception of strength. If allied and neutral nations see the 
military balance as favoring the Soviet Union rather than the United 
States, their independence and firmness may give way to adjustment, accom-
modation, and subordination. If potential enemies have a similar perception, 
they may misjudge the situation and make demands which could lead to 
confrontation, crisis, and unnecessary dangers. At present, the United 
States and the Soviet Union are seen as having roughly equivalent nuclear 
capabilities. Congress has underscored the importance of maintaining this 
posture by requiring that we not be inferior to the Soviet Union.

Even as we work toward effective deterrence, we hope for sound arms 
control agreements. As a nation, we must approach such agreements cautiously. 
So far our monitoring of existing agreements has been adequate and we have 
been able to detect and investigate a number of questionable Soviet practices 
since 1972. The necessary high confidence in our national -means of 
verification is likely to decline somewhat, however, to the extent that the 
Soviets attempt to conceal or disguise their programs. 
The overall U.S. nuclear posture and related arms control agreements 
must take Soviet efforts at damage-limitation into account. Most damage-
limiting strategies represent an effort by one belligerent to cause maximum 
damage to his enemy and minimum damage to himself. The assumption behind 
such strategies is that, if major asymmetries in damage can be achieved, 
one side will survive as a functioning nation while the other will not. 
The United States has never taken decisive action in this area. Basic 
U.S. policy has been directed at deterrence through flexibility and the 
control of nuclear escalation.

forces in a deliberate and controlled manner. 
With essential modernization of aging systems, this carefully 
tailored posture is preferable to an unrestrained arms race in the 
future. 
IX. Other Nuclear Forces 
Nuclear weapons provide a possible response to contingencies other 
than a direct strategic attack on the United States or its allies. Our 
allies have been and are today reassured by local U.S. nuclear forces 
which serve as part of the continuum between conventional forces and 
strategic capabilities. Theater-based systems constitute a key backup 
to strong conventional defenses and a major hedge against a failure of 
those defenses. Because other nations have developed local nuclear 
capabilities, a U.S. deployment of such forces is required to deter and, 
if necessary, counter them on a regional level.

As early as 1956, the Soviets began deploying MRBMs and nuclear-
,;loable light and medium bombers as part of increasingly powerful nuclear 
tJtcces. At present, they have in their peripheral attack forces a greater 
variety of long-range delivery systems and more missile launchers than 
NATO. The current Soviet capability goes from the variable-range ICBMs 
the new SS-X-20 to short-range tactical missiles. 
The Soviets continue to maintain and modernize this force and to 
J.rticulate a military doctrine which assumes an early use of nuclear 
weapons by the Warsaw Pact in a European war. While the Soviets might well 
timit such an attack to conventional means, they are not at any disadvantage 
where theater nuclear forces are concerned. 
Me People's Republic of China has now deployed a medium-bomber force 
or 77 Tu-16s which are nuclear-capable, and a small complement of MRBMs 
And IRBMs. India already may have a small nuclear arsenal and Great 
Ilritain and France have long-standing nuclear capabilities to attack 
Largets in Central Europe and in the USSR. In such circumstances, neither 
we nor the Soviets are necessarily the sole iudges of where, when, and how 
uch weapons might be used. 
structuring U.S. nuclear forces, attacks in Central Europe or in 
Korea are considered the most likely to call for backup, and nuclear 
weapons are currently maintained in each theater. A decision to use these 
weapons would depend upon (1) an enemy conventional breakthrough which 
could not be countered, or (2) his first use of nuclear weapons. U.S. 
capabilities must be sufficiently large and survivable to absorb such an 
;itrack and still perform assigned missions. This means not only a mix of 
)rices, but also an emphasis on mobility and concealment for survivability. 
Sophisticated and survivable command-control-communications networks must 
;accompany these forces. 
To minimize collateral damage, U.S. systems are presently tailored to 
estroy their targets with the minimum yields possible. As nuclear and 
guidance technologies advance, theater nuclear forces must be modernized, 
Out without blurring the important and time-honored distinction between 
nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. 
In light of the current Soviet nuclear threat, there are graver risks 
tn not maintaining theater nuclear forces than in deploying them. Friend 
;tnd foe, supporter and skeptic, all need to recognize that U.S. nuclear 
i7orces must constitute an integral part of U.S. capabilities if the deterrent 
to be effective. 
Conventional Forces 
A!though this is a nuclear age, conventional capabilities are increasingly 
important to the security of the nation and to peace and stability in the 
world. Conventional military power remains a principal instrument for

pursuing international objectives where military power is to be used at 
all. Nuclear forces credibly deter some limited -- although potentially 
devastating -- hostile acts, but the primary burden of deterrence now 
falls increasingly on conventional forces, although their effectiveness is 
enhanced by the nuclear capabilities that underlie them. 
There are other reasons for a non-nuclear emphasis in the U.S. defense 
arsenal. Conventional wars appear relatively controllable, since their 
tempo tends to be slower, allowing policy makers to act without excessive 
pressure. Limitations on a conventional conflict in terms of territory, 
weapons, or aims can more readily be defined and accepted. 
The Soviet capabilities show an appreciation of the importance of 
conventional strength, and reflect a determined, sustained, and increasing 
effort to develop two powerful conventional forces -- one facing Europe 
and the other opposite China. These modern offensive forces, combined 
with their increasing capability to project power thousands of miles from 
Soviet shores, have not appeared overnight. They are the result of a 
steady effort made with great momentum over considerable time. What is 
new is Western recognition of their magnitude and extent.

The number of active Soviet divisions, estimated last year at 168. 
now appears to be more than 170. Soviet strategic airlift has also 
continued to expand steadily in tonnage potential. Naval and amphibious 
forces, designed principally for use on the perimeters of the USSR in 
the past, are increasingly capable of extended and open-ocean operations. 
The Soviets have increased the combat effectiveness of their ground 
and tactical air forces, particularly those in Europe. Their divisions 
have been expanded in size and modernized. New fighter-attack aircraft 
have been deployed. For the first time, these capabilities may coincide 
with the long-standing Soviet doctrine of rapid offensive thrusts, 
reminiscent of German "blitzkrieg" tactics in World War II. 
Thus, the conventional posture in Europe must be based on the 
assumption that: (a) an attack with little or no warning by in-place 
Warsaw Pact forces is possible; (b) an attacking force could amount to 
500,000 or more men; (c) a forward allied defense is essential; and (d) 
the ratio of the Pact attack to the NATO defense should be kept well 
below two-to-one. We also prepare for an attack by Pact forces reinforced, 
primarily from the USSR, after perhaps 30 days of mobilization and 
deployment. 
Despite U.S. dependence on freedom of the seas, essential U.S. sea 
Lines of communication are less secure today than they were a decade 
ago. With their improved naval, airborne, and airlift forces, the Soviets 
can intervene by sea and air at considerable distances from the USSR, 
and can sustain such an intervention for a substantial and growing 
period of time.

Developments of Soviet military power are impressive, but the challenge 
remains manageable. Today, NATO, as a whole, probably spends as much on 
its defense as the Warsaw Pact. NATO armed forces total about 4.8 million 
men and women, compared to the Pact's 5.6 million. However, since the 
Soviets seem engaged in a steady, long-term effort, the feasibility of a 
NATO conventional defense of Europe cannot be assured once and for all. 
We must continue to meet these expanding capabilities if our goals are to 
remain peace and stability, freedom and independence. 
That peace and stability still exist in Europe and Korea must be 
largely credited to the deterrent effect of conventional forces, ours and 
those of our allies. Strength today, as in the past, contributes to 
peace. Weakness -- as history testifies -- can invite war as much in this 
day and age as before. In fact; the present circumstances make weakness a 
greater provocation than strength. 
Because of worldwide U.S. responsibilities, the conventional forces 
are structured to deal simultaneously with one major and one minor contingency. 
This is premised on the belief that a smaller engagement could escalate or, 
in some manner, lead to a larger conflict elsewhere. While such contingencies. 
are necessary for planning purposes, we do not predict any particular 
course of events or even reserve U.S. forces for .any definite, special 
use. At this point in history, nonetheless, we must at least have a 
posture sufficiently large, modern, ready, and well-positioned to face the 
most demanding challenge in Europe and still maintain a deterrent force in 
Northeast Asia. 
In today's world the risks are those of irresolution and weakness. 
The current non-nuclear posture and deployments help provide for the strength, 
security, and stability necessary in a world of complexity, untidiness, 
and declining freedom. 
XI. Other Capabilities Needed for Our Security 
Most of the defense program deals with the manpower and equipment 
essential to national security, but other capabilities multiply the 
utility of U.S. weapons systems. Without accurate intelligence, there 
would be even greater uncertainty about the size and composition of an 
adversary's forces and about his intentions. Either the risk to the nation 
or the costs of the U.S. defense budget would have to increase substantially. 
Today, it is possible to make relatively modest deployments to Europe 
because of our knowledge about current Warsaw Pact capabilities and deployments. 
Without such knowledge, U.S. requirements, our dependence on a nuclear 
strategy, or the risks to the United States and its allies, would have to 
increase. 
Without adequate research and development efforts, we could not 
improve the effectiveness of U.S. forces, maintain the overall military

balance, or even understand our opponent's forces. The Soviets have 
clearly made prpgress toward technological excellence in their military 
establishment. The United States must be alert for new technological 
opportunities with defense applications -- such as long-range cruise 
missiles and guidance, improved sensors, miniaturization, and computer 
technology -- and must be willing to move them along into production when 
ready. 
Finally, U.S. foreign military sales and assistance programs augment 
the non-nuclear capabilities of those nations important to us in the 
world. Support to other countries through programs of grants, loans, and 
sales enables them to assure their security at less cost to the United 
States. Without such arrangments, many of our friends could not be 
expected to share the burdens of collective defense. Nor could we count 
on their forces to complement ours with any degree of efficiency. 
Overseas base rights and other facilities frequently depend on a U.S. 
willingness to make weapons available to host countries. Regional balances 
of power, as in the Middle East, may depend on support to friendly nations, 
especially when others receive substantial support from the Soviet Union. 
While balance-of-payments considerations do not determine U.S. decisions, 
they cannot be ignored. An increasing amount of arms is becoming available 
from Soviet and European sources. When independent states believe they 
need arms to provide for their security, their requests should be taken 
seriously, realizing that they value their sovereignty and security as 
much as we value ours. 
XII. Conclusions 
The U.S. assessment of the international military situation and of 
the U.S. contribution to deterrence makes it clear that the United States 
faces a number of difficult but manageable security problems in the years 
and decades ahead. Portions of today's problem result from decisions and 
events of the past decade; still other portions have developed and will 
continue to develop from the efforts of the Soviet Union. 
We seek peaceful relations with all states, including the Soviet 
Union. However, from the evidence, it is clear that the Soviets are pur-
poseful about their military programs. Weakness on the part of the West 
is not an example the Soviets have emulated. If reasonable international 
peace and stability are to be preserved, we must learn to live with the 
fact of Soviet strength. 
In FY 1977, we set in motion a program for the security of the 
United States. It was intended to deal with the real world we face and 
arrest the decline in U.S. capabilities relative to those of the USSR. 
The task now is to stay on this path and assure an acceptable overall 
military balance by developing an adequate defense posture. To do so, we 
must raise the level of the Five-Year Defense Program, beginning in FY

Approved For Release 2002/08/21gelatrP80-00473A000600100011-7 
1978. This will entail a real increase in resources of about 6.8 percent 
from FY 1977 to FY 1978, and substantial continuing growth (in real 
terms) in the Five-Year Defense Program. To do less would be to take 
unnecessary risks with our country's future. 
More than 30 years have passed since the end of World War II, 
longer than the interval between the First and Second World Wars. 
During the past three decades, the steadfastness and strength of the 
United States have contributed to the avoidance of another large-scale 
conflict. Now is the time not to relax but to maintain a steadiness of 
purpose and resolve. We must not abandon our objectives of freedom and 
security. 
I believe the United States will do its duty. Friend and foe alike 
will understand the message of this budget. We will not be outmaneuvered; 
we will not be outlasted; we will not be intimidated. With the support 
of the American people, through their representatives in the Congress, 
and with support for the programs set forth, we can demonstrate our 
commitment to peace and stability, even in a world fraught with dangers 
and populated with many who do not subscribe to freedom -- a world we 
must preserve for freedom and for the dignity of mankind. 
When I took the oath of office as Secretary of Defense, I made four 
points: 
"First, the safety of the American people and the hopes for freedom 
throughout the world demand a defense capability for the United States 
of America second to none. I am totally dedicated to that mission. 
"Second, we are rightly proud of the armed forces, older than our 
nation itself, and I will seek to strengthen that sense of pride among 
us all. We were born as a nation out of military struggle. We owe our 
national life to men and women who had the will to fight for independence. 
The competence and dedication of their successors in today's armed 
forces will be drawn upon fully. 
"Third, that special kind of American military professionalism that 
is devoted to the constitutional principle of civilian control, so 
fundamental to political freedom in this country -- is a model for the 
world. One who has served in the Congress knows how indispensable it is 
that the defense of our country be a bi-partisan and shared responsibility. 
"Finally, let there be no doubt among us, or in the world at large, 
that the continuity of American policy can be relied upon by friend and 
foe alike. Our defense policies are geared to the interests of this 
nation." 
My watch is ending. More remains to be done. Nonetheless, I 
believe now as I did 14 months ago that "America must pursue its goal, 
as it has throughout...200 years, as a guardian of liberty and a symbol 
by example and deed in the service of freedom." In strength there is 
freedom.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
This is my second Report to the Congress of the United States as 
Secretary of Defense, and the last Defense Report of President Ford's 
administration. It affords an opportunity to summarize what has been 
done and what needs to be done for the continuing security of the United 
States. 
In the two and a half years since President Ford took office, he 
has recorded a number of accomplishments in the realm of national defense. 
Of these, several deserve particular emphasis. 
-- Throughout the country there is a renewed recognition that the 
nation's security cannot be taken for granted. I have left no doubt 
about the magnitude and persistence of the effort by the Soviets to 
expand and improve their military establishment. The American public, 
for its part, has become aware that there is no necessary incompatibility 
between the search for equitable agreements with the Soviet Union and an 
insistence on a strong defense and adequate deterrence. 
-- Security and stability have been increased in two ways: by 
some progress on arms control and by the President's determination to 
halt the erosion of U.S. military and deterrent strength caused by the 
steady real increase in Soviet military spending and capabilities, and 
the equally steady decline in our own over the ten years preceding 1975. 
-- With the reversal of the downward trend in real U.S. outlays 
for defense, it has become possible to support and accelerate investments 
in a number of programs essential to the future security of the United 
States. As a consequence: 
The modernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent 
is now under way, with decisions on production of the Trident submarine 
and the B-1 intercontinental bomber, and the acceleration in the development 
of a more survivable land-mobile ballistic missile. 
The increasing importance of U.S. conventional capabilities 
and deterrence has been recognized, and proposals set forth for major 
resources to be allocated to its expansion, so that in the years ahead: 
o the Army will field 16 rather than 13 active divisions, 
and these divisions will be given increased firepower, 
mobility, and protection from air attacks; 
o the Navy is moving to improve its capability for 
two-ocean sea control, its air and amphibious capability 
for the projection of U.S. power, and its ability to 
maintain a presence as required;

the Air Force, with 26 fully-equipped tactical air 
wings, will be able to provide an expanded and more 
modern capability for worldwide offensive and defensive 
air operations; 
worldwide mobility will be improved through expanded 
and more modern airlift, and through greater inflight 
refueling support; 
0 current research and development plans and programs 
should provide new weapons technologies for the 
fulfillment of our commitments. 
-- President Ford has strengthened our arrangements for collective 
security abroad, with particular attention to: 
- ihe improvement of U.S. combat capability and the realignment 
of U.S. support forces; 
an increase in U.S. combat units -- both ground and 
air -- stationed in the sensitive central region of Europe; 
- greater standardization of equipment with our allies, 
culminating in agreements within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) to adopt the F-16 air combat fighter, the Roland army air defense 
missile, and standard common components for the next generation of main 
battle tanks. 
-- The all-volunteer force has been brought into being and is 
solidly in place. Racial and drug problems have declined. The men and 
women of the services are dedicated to their profession. The American 
people recognize and applaud their devotion. Their competence is unequalled 
in the world today. It must be maintained. 
-- At the same time, the U.S. military presence overseas has been 
reduced wherever circumstances permitted. We have followed a consistent 
policy of bringing forces back to the United States whenever U.S. interests 
and commitments could be sustained with smaller foreign deployments. In FY 
1976, the total of U.S. military manpower outside the United States 
decreased by more than 10 percent, from 517,000 to 464,000. As the 
accompanying illustration shows, this is only the latest installment of a 
steady decline over the years.

A remarkable degree of consensus has developed over these needs, 
reflected in progress across a broad front of national security matters. 
As the war in Vietnam drew to a close, a reaction against things military 
tended to obscure even the most vital interests. During a period of detente, 
or relaxation of tensions on the heels of the war, there was a tendency to 
rationalize away or ignore national security issues. Instances of disagreement 
within the intelligence community as to what the Soviets were doing, and 
why, made a common view of the problem facing the country difficult. 
More recently, the air has cleared. There is ample evidence of 
momentum in Soviet military activity, and increasing agreement within the 
intelligence world as to what that activity means. Does anyone today 
really believe that, without U.S. strength to counterbalance them, the 
Soviets will not seek to expand their influence -- to the detriment of 
freedom? 
Arbitrary incremental reductions can always be made in the defense 
budget -- indeed in any budget. In real terms, that is exactly what has 
been happening to baseline outlays for defense during the last decade.

President's budgets were successively reduced each year. In no particular 
year did the cutback appear severe or damaging. The sky did not fall because 
of any one of these reductions. Indeed, still greater reductions could have 
been made without any immediate or apparent penalty to U.S. security. 
However, the underlying damage is there; the rot sets in. 
It must be remembered that a President works with defense capabilities 
inherited from his predecessors. Lead-times on modern defense capabilities 
are as many as 5, 10, or 15 years. Ship overhauls can be delayed, aircraft 
repairs postponed, investments in modernization stretched out or denied. 
Those who make the reductions in a given year are not likely to pay the 
penalty during their duty. It will come later, on someone else's watch, 
as it has in this instance. 
There is no free lunch. If we are to have adequate defense capabilities, 
if we are to preserve U.S. freedom and security, a price must be paid. Peace 
and stability cannot be achieved with mirrors, magic wands or good intentions, 
promises or tricks. In a dangerous world, peace and stability require 
an underpinning of strength. Strength costs money. 
Some disappointments have accompanied the accomplishments. Several 
of these disappointments -- and their implications -- require serious 
consideration by the Congress. 
-- Congressional reductions in the defense budgets requested by 
successive Presidents make it difficult to engage in the sustained and 
orderly programs of modernization and expansion that are necessitated by 
the continued growth in Soviet military capabilities over the past decade. 
On that score, the Congress should avoid mistaking transient increases in 
unobligated balances of budget authority (based on outdated estimates) for 
reductions in the costs of counterbalancing the expanding nuclear and 
conventional power of the Soviet Union. As the FY 1978 defense budget 
and the projected Five-Year Defense Program (FYDP) make clear, those 
costs have not decreased. They have increased. Congressional support 
for sustained real increases in defense budgets is, if anything, even 
more essential today than before. 
-- Technological progress and freedom go together in a modern 
society. Opposition to technological advance is bound to have a negative 
effect on a nation which must meet the Soviet challenge to freedom in an 
open society with a relatively small force and with relatively lesser quantities 
of high-quality equipment. Only technological superiority will enable 
the United States to keep its forces relatively small. Attempts to 
suppress new technology are based to some degree on views of American 
responsibility for the arms competition which have no foundation in 
fact. Technological restraint on our part would unquestionably be 
welcomed by the Soviets. There is no evidence that it would be reciprocated. 
-- Failure to support the essential strategic mobility program will 
result in a continued inefficient use of scarce resources and a loss of

defense and deterrent capabilities necessary to the worldwide responsibilities 
of the United States. The period ahead will be an era when getting 
there first, even with the least, may be what counts the most. It should 
not be necessary to deploy more forces in a particular theater than are 
absolutely essential for purposes of collective defense. However, that is 
true only if, beyond those minimum essential deployments of men and 
materiel, the United States has at its call a powerful central reserve 
and the improving strategic mobility permitted by modern technology. 
Central reserves without mobility have little value. Worldwide influence 
without worldwide mobility is a contradiction in terms. 
-- Finally, to provide incentives for efficient management, Con-
gressional support is needed to effect economies in the operations of 
the Defense Department. Management, for example, must be given flexibility 
to adjust the base structure as forces change, and obsolete methods of 
compensating and budgeting personnel must be brought up to date. 
The Department itself undertook several management initiatives during 
1976 in a concerted effort to check spiralling manpower costs and commit 
a greater share of Defense resources to essential weapons procurement 
and research requirements. All but a few of these initiatives required 
affirmative action on the part of Congress. 
Over $2.3 billion in FY 1977 savings were generated by refining 
various legal processes which had dictated excessive and often wasteful 
Defense pay costs: 
-- Presidential refinement of the Pay Comparability Process ($2.1 
Military Pay Raise Reallocation Authority ($70 million); 
Elimination of the one percent retirement "kicker" ($70 million); 
Limitations upon Payments for Unused Military Leave ($90 million); 
An opportunity to save an additional $350 million in FY 1977 and 
several billion dollars by the close of FY 1981 was lost when Congress 
failed to approve Defense initiatives calling for: 
Reform of the Federal (blue-collar) Wage System; 
Consolidation of DoD Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training; 
Elimination of Dual Compensation for General Schedule Civilian/ 
Reservists. 
These actions will be proposed again in FY 1978. Additional savings

It is against this background that the Defense Report for FY 1978 
is presented. We have made significant progress in a short time in both 
specifics and direction. We are today set on the proper path to assure 
national security in the decades ahead. The people of our country seek 
safety, stability, and efficiency. To reach these goals, as this statement 
will emphasize, we still have a considerable distance to travel. 
Last year, I emphasized and illustrated the clearly adverse trends 
in Soviet and U.S. defense spending and capabilities. I stressed the 
substantial growth in Soviet military power relative to that of the

United States because of decisions made over the previous decade. At 
that time I warned that if the comparative decline in American effort 
and strength were not reversed, the United States would find itself 
second to the Soviet Union in the essentials of military power, would be 
seen as weakening in its ability to contribute to peace and stability in 
the world, and that the effect would be to inject a fundamental instability 
into the world situation. Adequate military capabilities are the underpinning 
necessary to the peaceful resolution of international issues; however 
resourceful the diplomats, and however sophisticated the diplomacy, 
second place militarily is unacceptable. 
A. The FY 1977 Budget 
The defense budget presented to the Congress by President Ford in 
January, 1976, was designed to arrest the relative decline in American 
military power and lay the foundation for a defense posture adequate to 
U.S. security needs in the decade ahead. Although the Congress did not 
appropriate $3.8 billion of the original FY 1977 request, it did provide 
a real increase in total obligational authority of 5.8 percent from FY 
1976 to FY 1977. The decision was a sound one, and the United States 
and the world will be safer for it. However, national security cannot 
be provided on a one-shot basis. As the President has emphasized, our 
security and our ability to contribute to peace will require a sustained 
effort over a period of years.

B. The FY 1978 Budget and Five-Year Defense Program 
The effort proposed by the President is without question within our 
means. Total obligational authority of $123.1 billion and outlays of 
$110.1 billion are requested for FY 1978. The amounts already appropriated 
for FY 1977, and those now projected in the Five-Year Defense Program, 
are shown in the following table.

Proposed real growth in total obligational authority from FY 1977 to 
FY 1978 will be 6.8 percent, practically all of which will go to our 
investment accounts -- primarily procurement and RDT&E (Research, Develop-
ment, Test, and Evaluation). Based on current assumptions about pay and 
price increases during the Five-Year Defense Program, real growth from 
FY 1978 to FY 1982 will continue to be substantial, and, most of it, 
again, will be concentrated in capital investments. Since the program 
assumes military personnel of about two million men and women, the 
projected increase and its allocation represent an efficient way to add 
needed capabilities. 
C. Basis for the Proposed Increases 
The main reason sustained increases are required is the military 
policy of the Soviet Union. We now know more about the Soviet defense 
effort than we did a year ago. The pace of Soviet military programs is 
about as we estimated it in early 1976, but the resources allocated to 
the effort are larger. The facts are clear, and so is the challenge. 
It will require a sustained response.

The Soviets are continuing to expand and modernize major elements 
of their defense posture. They are continuing to add to their large war 
production base. Some of their equipment is beginning to equal ours in 
technological sophistication. The Soviet Union is a power which is 
engaged in a serious, steady, and sustained military effort. Whatever 
its purposes, its options are growing as the West's have diminished. 
The United States effort must be as serious, as steady and as 
sustained as that of the Soviet Union. Starts and stops will not do. 
We cannot continue to believe that U.S. technology, the sophistication 
of U.S. weapons, and the considerable talents and skills of the men and 
women of the Armed Forces -- substantial as they are -- will suffice by 
themselves to make up for substantial quantitative advantages of our 
rival. As the Soviets add quality to quantity, we must add quantity to 
our technology and skills. 
Given present estimates, the B-1 and Trident programs, combined 
with an FY 1984 initial operating capability for Missile X (MX) and continued 
research and development on elements of our strategic defenses, should 
prevent the Soviets from obtaining any useful advantage in strategic 
nuclear capabilities during the period ahead. 
Reconstitution and expansion of U.S. Army stocks of equipment in 
Europe will increase the rate at which the United States can reinforce

its deployed capabilities in NATO and should contribute to deterring 
attacks on Western Europe. Modernization of the Army's forces based in 
the United States will strengthen our ability to reinforce NATO and 
increase our capability to deter or respond to a variety of other 
contingencies. Our strategic mobility, worldwide, will be increased by 
an expanded procurement of Advanced Tanker/Cargo aircraft. Acquisition 
of modern sealift units will further improve our ability to transport 
heavily-equipped combat forces to distant areas. 
The shipbuilding program, as proposed, will significantly expand 
the size of the Navy, and our capability to assure the freedom of the 
seas to the end of this century. A growing number of ships will allow both 
increased worldwide presence in peacetime and greater overall effective-
ness in wartime. The funding of service life extensions for the Navy's multi-
purpose carriers and modernization of the Marine Corps and amphibious 
forces will provide necessary U.S. sea-based tactical air and seaborne 
assault power for the continued projection of deterrence where U.S. 
interests dictate. 
Modernization of the Air Force tactical air units will continue. 
investment in AWACS, the F-15, F-16, and A-10 will improve the U.S. 
ability to defend more effectively against the Warsaw Pact tactical air 
and ground forces in Europe, or respond rapidly to other contingencies, 
worldwide. 
The achievement of these improvements requires larger U.S. defense 
budgets over a period of years. Nothing is more essential than that the 
American people and their representatives understand the necessity of 
this increased effort. At stake is nothing less than the safety of the 
United States and the survival of freedom. To be safe, free, and 
independent, we must be vigilant, steady, and strong.

II. THE BASIS FOR PLANNING 
The dangers ahead dictate explicitness about the assumptions and 
logic that lead to the defense posture of the United States and shape 
the budgets now before the Congress. Only if the premises and chain of 
reasoning are provided to the Congress and the American people, and 
understood by them, can we expect to receive the necessary hearing on a 
subject so vital to the nation. Accordingly, this annual Defense Report 
is designed, in its first section, to specify the principal factors and 
assumptions which have impact on the current posture, and the principal 
objectives of proposed defense programs. 
The second section of the Report analyzes the issues faced in 
reaching the objectives set forth and describes the programs best suited 
to meet them. 
A. Approaches to Planning 
Defense decision-making is occasionally pictured as reflecting 
essentially the influence of parochial interests. However, no one who 
has actually observed the planning process in the Department of Defense 
and the interaction with the Office of Management and Budget, the National 
Security Council, the President and the Congress can be the slave of 
such half-truths. Perhaps more than in any other department of government, 
Defense has a long tradition of systematic, analytical, and cost-conscious 
approaches to its needs. Too much is at stake for the planning process 
to take any other form. 
Major historical trends in U.S. and Soviet defense spending and 
military capabilities offer one way to grasp the broad security problems 
that face the country. We cannot allow Soviet capabilities to rise and 
U.S. capabilities to decline for an extended period of time without 
inviting a major crisis for ourselves and for the world. 
But trends by themselves -- however adverse -- cannot tell us what 
forces should be acquired in order to reach our security objectives. 
Simplistic recommendations for an arbitrary but specific annual increase 
or decrease in the defense budget serve the nation no better. There is 
no fixed percentage by which our resources should expand or contract 
each year. Rather, there are capabilities that must be provided. 
The approach to planning which specifies a defense posture as the 
mirror-image of an opponent's capabilities has the virtue primarily of 
simplicity; but it misses so much else essential to serious and systematic 
planning that it can rapidly lead to major and expensive absurdities in 
force and weapons acquisition. As a result, it has no standing among 
planners. 
11 
Approved For Release 2002/08/SENKRDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
To take account of the many and diverse factors that should shape 
the defense posture of the United States, the planner must turn to 
specific contingencies -- illustrative conflicts that could occur now 
and in the future -- and analyze what would be needed to maintain U.S. 
interests under these conditions. Only an understanding of hypothetical 
but not necessarily improbable attacks permits a serious insight into 
the types and quantities of military resources that must go into a 
defense posture sufficient to achieve the nation's obiectives with high 
confidence. 
B. Types of Planning 
Defense or force planning is not the same as the more detailed 
contingency and operational planning done by military staffs. Rather, its 
main purpose is to ensure that resources, in the form of force structure, 
personnel, weapons, materiel, supplies and other factors necessary to 
military effectiveness over a wide range of contingencies, are available 
to the President and his subordinates. As such, force planning does 
not, and should not, dictate where or how these capabilities should be 
used. In the face of many uncertainties, force planning strives --
within the budgets provided -- to furnish the President with sufficient 
power and flexibility to conduct national security policy in a manner 
consistent with the nation's interests. 
C. The Importance of Analysis 
Because so many real uncertainties are involved, and so many interests 
are at risk, conservatism in the design of the U.S. defense posture is 
in order. Superiority over, or insistence on numerical equivalence with 
potential adversaries, may be justified. But underlying such considerations 
must be a bedrock of analysis based on the world as it actually exists. 
Modern force planning has the virtue of providing such a foundation. It 
demands specificity about a number of factors: 
the theaters in which contingencies could arise; 
the nature of the contingencies; 
potential enemies and allies; 
the roles U.S. forces could be expected to play; and 
the types of forces that could be used. 
To identify these factors, modern force planning requires a context 
within which the detailed analysis of hypothetical campaigns, the clash 
of forces, and selection of preferred defense postures can proceed. 
Even manpower planning and research and development must and do take 
current and expected contexts into account.

III. THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY 
Part of the planning context is provided and shaped by the revolution 
in military technology launched during World War II and continuing to 
this day. The most profound effect of this seemingly permanent revolution 
has come from the invention of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver 
them at intercontinental ranges with increasing accuracy. 
A number of major consequences have followed from the introduction 
of nuclear weapons, increased long-range accuracy, and the growth of 
related technologies. 
-- First, to a degree unprecedented in its history, the United 
States has become directly vulnerable to devastating attack. 
-- Second, a nuclear standoff -- however dynamic and precarious --
has developed in which it seems widely recognized that the strategic and 
tactical nuclear thresholds must be kept as high as possible and, as a 
result, and somewhat less widely recognized, that the more traditional 
conventional capabilities remain of fundamental importance. 
-- Third, the United States must maintain three basic types of 
military force -- strategic nuclear, theater nuclear, and conventional 
and peacetime defense budgets that must be higher than during the seeming-
ly quieter years before World War II. 
-- Finally, the technological revolution has caused the paradoxical 
effect of reviving, albeit in a modified form, the geopolitical character 
of the world of pre-nuclear years. 
The possibility of nuclear warfare is certainly still with us. 
Nonetheless, we find the world resuming a more conventional shape and 
harboring many more traditional concerns than many assumed only a 
decade ago. Geography, and the politics and strategies imposed by it, 
never actually lost their importance during those years called the 
nuclear age. But today we recognize far more than in the 1950s and 
1960s not only the basic importance but also the limited utility of 
nuclear weapons and, therefore, the vital role of conventional weapons 
in maintaining defense and deterrence. Geopolitics and an appreciation 
of its implications for national security have become essential to 
modern force planning and the design of the U.S. defense posture.

IV. FOREIGN POLICY AND FORCE PLANNING 
The Congress recognized the relationship between foreign policy and 
Eorce planning in passing Section 812 of the FY 1976 Department of 
Defense Authorization Act. This amendment requires that "the Secretary 
of Defense, after consultation with the Secretary of State, shall prepare 
and submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House 
of Representatives a written annual report on the foreign policy and 
military force structure of the United States for the next fiscal year, 
how such policy and force structure relate to each other, and the justi-
fAcation for each." 
A. Defense and Foreign Policy 
As this Report set forth last year, the U.S. defense posture does 
not and cannot be made to relate directly to the short-term objectives 
and strategies of foreign policy decision-makers, although it can and 
does contribute in a fundamental way to the environment in which such 
decisions are made. The military establishment constitutes an instrument 
at the disposal of the nation, just as diplomatic, economic, and other 
means are available and may be applied to achieve national objectives. 
And, just as we should hesitate to change the size and composition of 
firefighting forces or insurance coverage because the need for them may 
temporarily seem to lessen, so we must be cautious of suggestions that 
we can safely reduce U.S. defense capabilities simply because, during a 
period of peace, they are successfully demonstrating their value. The 
defense establishment is an institution as easy to tear down or cripple 
as it is difficult to reconstruct and indeed impossible to reassemble 
rapidly, owing to the long lead times required for modern military 
capabilities. 
To say that, however, is not to argue that the size and composition 
of U.S. Armed Forces should be insulated from what happens in the world. 
The nature of force planning is such that elements of our defense posture 
tend to be sensitive in a number of respects to considerations of geo-
politics. To the extent that our assumptions about those considerations 
evolve, the U.S. defense posture may -- but only may -- evolve as well. 
What is the current map of international politics? It no longer 
shows a world of many great powers. The United States, separated from a 
number of its friends by two oceans, has become the primary champion of 
freedom, self-determination, and international pluralism. The Soviet 
Union, its imperial domain already sprawled over two continents, continues 
to extol in action if not always in words the virtues of authoritarianism, 
a command economy, and the subjugation of the individual to the state. 
The constituents of Soviet ideology are probably more numerous than 
ours. Political and economic freedoms are expanding in a few nations --

Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
Greece, Portugal, and Spain -- but at present in many other places they 
are contracting. If the great issues of international politics were to 
be decided by vote in the General Assembly of the United Nations, the 
side of freedom would win rarely. The United States and its friends are 
in a minority. They are under pressure in a divided and dangerous world. 
Instability has been increased by the spread of technology across 
this splintered and shrinking world. As modern societies have become 
more dependent on foreign sources of supply, on interconnected systems 
of communication and transportation, on international systems of production, 
commerce, and banking, they have grown more vulnerable to a variety of 
attacks -- ranging from political intimidation, economic pressures and 
terrorist acts to full-scale military assaults. 
Modern conventional weapons no longer are the exclusive property of 
the larger industrial states. Nuclear technology now threatens to 
spread to many areas suffering from a shortage of energy, a sense of 
insecurity, or both. To these conditions, must be added the weakening of 
traditional international order, the collapse of old empires, and the 
rise of the Soviet Union as an expansive world power. The effect of these 
changes is that what happens elsewhere has an impact on us. Events in 
distant corners of our increasingly interdependent world cannot be 
ignored by the United States. Nor can they be met without some risk. 
Caution and reluctance are understandable. But events of the past 
two decades have not made the United States more independent politically, 
economically, or culturally. On the contrary, the realities of interdependence 
-- more so than ever before in our history -- oblige us to face the world 
as it is, not as we might wish it to be. 
No nation is "an Island, entire of itself;" "every nation is a 
piece of the Continent, a part of the main." The United States is no 
exception. But this much must be added. No nation has done more to 
accompany its involvement with a continuing search for the peaceful and 
equitable settlement of international differences. 
-- It was the United States, not the Soviet Union, which first 
sought constructively to control strategic nuclear arms and achieve 
mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe. 
-- It was the United States, not the Soviet Union, which has worked 
to end the fighting in the Middle East. 
Our good faith in contributing to peace cannot be in doubt. Yet 
this remains an era in which the statesman and the soldier must keep 
close company. Constructive diplomatic initiatives are necessary. They 
must be supported by strength.

B. U.S. Interests 
The force planner, faced with a dangerous world, must ask where we 
may be called upon to deploy and operate the nation's forces. Perhaps 
his best initial guide to an answer lies in identifying the main and 
continuing interests of the United States. Our most fundamental interest 
lies, of course, in preserving the independence and territorial integrity 
of the United States and its possessions. The common defense is a 
Constitutional requirement and duty. 
However onerous that charge in a world shrunken by technology, it 
by no means ends the responsibilities of the force planner. U.S. interests 
inevitably exceed these boundaries. It is understandable that the 
determination of interests beyond the territory of the United States is 
less precise, subject to evolution, and a topic of debate. Nonetheless, 
the determination must be attempted.

1. Economic Interests 
The United States is not an economic island. We depend for our 
standard of living and economic security increasingly on raw materials 
imported from abroad, and some of these imports have strategic value as well. 
We find it profitable to trade and invest abroad; imports and exports 
now total more than $200 billion a year, and U.S. international investments 
are currently valued at more than $100 billion. The United States, to 
be sure, is singularly blessed in having inherited a rich and spacious re-
source base; we would suffer less than most if we were to lose access to 
foreign trade, investment and raw materials. With belt-tightening and a 
substantial decline in standards of living, we could still manage. As 
the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 demonstrated, we would suffer dislocations, 
but our allies in Europe and Northeast Asia might be mortally wounded by 
any prolonged interruption in the established patterns of international 
trade.

Political Interests 
The vulnerability of our allies, particularly in Europe and Northeast 
Asia, underlines the complexity of contemporary U.S. interests and the 
degree to which they are interrelated. In a world where strategic 
nuclear parity has caused conventional power to rank in importance with 
nuclear power, we cannot go it alone. We seek both to deny accessions 
of power to rivals and to ensure sufficient friendly power -- political 
nnd economic as well as military -- to counterbalance that of our competi-
tors. Because of these interests, we must care about the economic 
welfare of our allies even when our own is not directly in ieopardy. 
fiecause ot these same interests, we find ourselves associated regionally 
with what, ideologically, may strike some of us as strange bedfellows. 
However, for those knowledgeable in the ways of domestic politics, in 
the United States as elsewhere, coalitions of this character should come 
as no surprise. Politics, whether domestic or international, rarely 
permit the luxury of ideological purity. Even if we make democratic 
rreedoms the test of our association with other nations, we must not 
Lorget that all authoritarian institutions are neither identical in 
their repression of freedom nor irreversible in their tyranny, as we 
have seen successively in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Nor are they 
similar in their actions with respect to self-determination for other 
nations. 
i. Ideological Interests 
To cite the fact of political balances -- balances that exist in 
any political process, however peaceful, orderly and democratic -- is 
not to minimize our dedication to democratic values at home and support 
of those beliefs abroad. Freedom of choice, whether economic, political 
or personal, is a rare privilege in this turbulent world. As a people, 
we have not sought to impose on others a system of government which 
guarantees such rights. But we have a duty both to advocate democratic 
principles and to encourage those societies where freedom grows or 
continues to flourish. So, too, it is logical that we treat differently 
nations within the large group that do not practice freedom, distinguishing 
between those which are aggressive and do not respect the rights of 
others, and those which respect the self-determination of values. 
4. The Global Nature of U.S. Interests 
Our interests -- political, and economic -- are necessarily worldwide 
In nature. The bulk of U.S. trade and overseas investment focuses on 
the highly industrialized nations of the Western Hemisphere, Europe and 
Northeast Asia. But we draw on critical raw materials from the Middle 
East and Persian Gulf, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Our dependence 
on foreign energy supplies has risen dramatically in the past 15 years, 
and it continues to grow. Already over 40 percent of our petroleum

comes from external sources, and more than 33 percent of that total is 
imported from the Persian Gulf. We draw on tin from Malaysia, Thailand 
and Bolivia; on manganese from Brazil, Gabon, South Africa and Zaire; on 
titanium from Australia and India. 
U.S. political interests are extensive: witness our commitment to 
eight formal treaties of mutual security -- with Latin America, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia and New Zealand 
(ANZUS), Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China (Taiwan), 
the Philippines, and Thailand through the Manila Pact. The United 
States is a full participant in CENTO (Central Treaty Organization), but 
not a signatory. We have longstanding commitments to the security of 
Israel, and important links to Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. While 
most of these commitments date back a quarter of a century or more and 
reflect the containment strategy adopted at that time, they still reflect 
our basic political interests.

It surely is the case that if the United States so wishes, it 
can -- with a Gross National Product of nearly $2 trillion -- tailor its 
capabilities to its needs. 
TL is by no means clear, however, that a reduction in present U.S. 
commitments abroad would result in a reduced defense posture. Much 
depends on the threat. An isolated America, without any external obligations 
but with most of the world organized against it -- with previously 
allied or friendly nations shorn of our present support and drawn into 
the Soviet orbit -- would require a much more substantial defense effort 
ami budget than is the case today. 
J. Strategic Interests 
The worldwide nature of U.S. political, economic, and ideological 
interests inevitably brings other interests in their train. Despite 
technology, we still depend on the seas for the bulk of our external 
commerce. And because we are a large trading nation -- as we have been 
throughout our history -- we must be vitally interested in the freedom 
of the seas and the narrow waters that connect them. The new domain of 
space, with its opportunities for communication, geodesy, meteorology, 
and a host of vital military activities, is rapidly growing in importance.

Our interest in freedom of access to space has already become 
great. Most important, because this is a geopolitical world in which 
conventional as well as nuclear power plays such a role, we continue to 
have worldwide strategic interests. 
Nuclear forces, for the most part, concentrate unprecedented amounts 
of firepower into relatively small units. As a consequence, very powerful 
blows can be struck with nuclear delivery systems at intercontinental 
ranges. And because these systems are so powerful at such great distances, 
there is a tendency to assume that the outcome of a nuclear conflict 
would be decided in a matter of hours or at most days. 
Conventional forces, by contrast, require large concentrations of 
men and materiel to be effective. Their radius of effectiveness is 
limited, and the outcomes of major conventional wars have usually been 
decided only after extended campaigns of attrition. Personnel, equipment 
and supplies must be transported over great distances; stockpiles of 
combat consumables must be established; multiple campaigns may be fought; 
and victory must usually come from incremental and cumulative progress 
by air, sea, and land. The length and cost of this process will depend 
to an important extent on the geographical positions of the belligerents. 
Even in an era of wide-bodied aircraft and improving strategic 
mobility, enormous advantages accrue from forward deployments of forces.

Strategically located bases are necessary to protect lines of communication 
especially when our interests overseas are great and distant. It is one 
thing to think about the defense of Western Europe with U.S. divisions 
and air wings based in Germany, with the control of such narrow waters 
as the Bosphorus and the Strait of Gibraltar in friendly hands, with a 
fleet deployed in the Mediterranean, and with bases in the United Kingdom, 
Tceland, Greenland and the Azores. It would be quite another matter to 
contemplate a defense without those assets and with the entire U.S. 
military effort having to be sent directly from the United States to the 
:ront. Despite the advances in technology, we have not freed ourselves 
either from the need to project our awn power in an efficient manner, or 
from the requirement to deny strategic areas to those who might be our 
adversaries. 
6 The Conditions of U.S. Defense 
To set forth the international interests of the United States is to 
define the objectives which guide U.S. foreign policy and force planning. 
The central objective of U.S. foreign policy is to maintain an 
international order that assures the physical security of the United 
States, its economic well being, and the preservation of its institutions 
and values. 
Vor over three decades the United States has worked toward this 
objective, primarily by policies to enlist the active collaboration of 
the industrial democracies in defense, in economics, and in other areas 
of international life where there was a sufficient commonality of interest 
and objectives to permit a collective response. These policies have 
heen remarkably successful. A collective defense has helped to deter 
general war and has provided security to the system's participants while 
reducing the financial burden on each. Behind this defensive shield, the 
economies of the industrial democracies have prospered, political stability 
has been encouraged, and social justice broadened. Although there have 
been important departures from this general pattern, the overall results 
validate a continuation of the basic policy of collective defense. 
The conditions under which this policy and force planning will be 
pursued during the next few years are likely to be characterized by: 
-- the continuing growth of Soviet military power and of a capability 
to project it into areas and to ends damaging to U.S. interests; 
-- maintenance of current alliance relationships and acceptance 
of Spain's importance to NATO; 
warfare; 
continued dangers of nuclear proliferation and of nuclear

rapid technological change; 
-- the increasing economic dependence of the United States and 
its major collaborators on each other and on the so-called Third World 
for raw materials and energy, and their vulnerability to any significant 
disruption in the flow of these goods; 
-- tension and disorder in much of the underdeveloped and parts 
of the deveEl_oped world, which -- with the increasing availability of 
sophisticated arms, the growth of major regional powers, and uneven 
economic, political, and social development -- will create opportunities 
for external manipulation and polarization of political attitudes against 
the West, and make international relations more difficult and dangerous 
for the West; and 
-- the continuing importance of the PRC as a factor in the security 
balance between the industrialized democracies and the Soviet Union.

V. FOREIGN MILITARY CAPABILITIES 
The greatest threat to the United States comes from the Soviet 
Union. While controversy continues to ebb and flow about the intentions 
of Soviet leaders, there can be no doubt about the capability of Soviet 
armed forces to threaten U.S. vital interests, including the United 
States itself. 
A. The Soviet Union 
There are 4.4 million men in the Soviet military establishment 
(compared with 2.1 million men and women in the active elements of the 
U.S. Armed Forces), and that total does not include well-armed border 
guards of the KGB and the security units of the MVD. All the elements of 
modern power are heavily represented in the Soviet military establishment,

including intercontinental strategic nuclear forces, large and growing

quality; for the most part, they have kept the one and worked to improve 
the other. Technologically, their military establishment is now approaching 
the quality of our own in many respects. 
We should not be misled, in this connection, by news stories about 
the Soviet MIG-25 (Foxbat), a high-altitude interceptor which its pilot 
landed in Japan last September. Design of this particular model of the 
Foxbat began in 1960, probably as a defense against the 3-70 and SR-71, 
which were then being developed by the United States. FOxbat first flew 
in 1964, and became operational in 1970. It is, for its time, a good 
combination of technical sophistication and cost-consciousness. Titanium 
has been used only where necessary; the same is true of aluminum honeycomb 
and solid state devices. The designers have compensated for the weight 
of the aircraft by powering it with two turbojet engines, each with 
about 25,000 pounds of thrust, and by giving it a greater internal fuel 
capacity than had been estimated. Most of the components are "off-the-
shelf." Care has been given to ensure ease of maintenance. 
The result is an aircraft with an excellent climb capability, high 
speed at altitude, a system to control its flight from the ground, and 
the ability to deny high-altitude overflights of the Soviet Union. Not 
only is Foxbat a capable aircraft for its time; it provides a significant 
technological benchmark from which the Soviets have advanced in the 
succeeding 16 years. 
A major portion of Soviet theater nuclear and conventional forces 
is oriented toward Western Europe. There are 27 divisions and 1,400 
aircraft poised in East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; another 4 
divisions and 265 aircraft continue their occupation of Hungary. Substantial 
Soviet forces are also deployed to the borders of the People's Republic 
of China (PRC). 
In the heartland of the USSR is an ICBM force -- some of it now 
deployed under the cover of the Moscow anti-ballistic-missile (ABM) 
defense system -- which numerically is 50 percent larger than the U.S. ICBM 
force. At sea and under construction are 75 ballistic missile submarines 
capable of attacking the United States. The Backfire bomber continues to 
come into service with both the Long Range Aviation and Naval Aviation 
forces of the USSR. Anti-bomber defenses remain substantial, and it is 
now evident that the Soviets seek to provide key elements of their population, 
industry, and food supplies with some degree of protection against nuclear 
attacks. 
These nuclear strike capabilities and strategic defense forces seem 
excessive for second-strike purposes. Their locations and the nature of 
Soviet military planning are bound to cause some ambiguity about the 
roles and missions assigned to them.

There is far less ambiguity about other forces available to the 
Soviets. The Soviets now have 7 ready airborne divisions which, as they 
demonstrated during the Middle East war of 1973, they would consider 
deploying overseas in special contingencies. They have also developed a 
substantial capability for long-range airlift with which they transported a 
great deal of war materiel to Angola and assisted in the transfer of a 
sizeable Cuban expeditionary force to Guinea in 1975. The Soviet navy 
continues to evolve into a force with worldwide capabilities, supported 
by a merchant marine designed to support military operations in peace 
and war. 
What we are witnessing, at the minimum, is a growing capability sut-
ftcient to enable the Soviet Union to become a major participant in 
world geopolitics. In certain respects, they have already broken 
through or leapfrogged some of the barriers erected by the containment 
policies of earlier decades. Given the momentum of their programs, it 
must be assumed that this process will continue in the future.

Of particular significance is the continuing momentum behind Soviet 
defense programs. As far as can be judged, while U.S. defense outlays, 
until recently, have been in a long, slow slide and were more than 13 
percent lower in 1976 than in 1964 (in constant dollars), the Soviet 
defense effort (estimated in U.S. prices) increased in real terms by 
more than 40 percent in the same period. Estimates show that in 1964, 
U.S. defense spending exceeded comparable Soviet efforts; by 1976, 
however, the situation had been reversed, with the Soviet level of 
effort exceeding that of the United States by over 30 percent in dollar 
terms and by nearly 40 percent when retirement costs are excluded. 
Perhaps even more important over the longer term are the economic 
resources invested in future, not current, military capability. Estimates 
indicate that Soviet programs in RDT&E, military construction, and 
procurement have exceeded those of the United States in every year since 
1966. In 1976, the Soviet military investment program was more than 90 
percent larger than that of the United States. 
The bulk of both total Soviet military spending and the increases 
in it (measured in rubles) have gone to forces which constitute a direct 
threat to the United States and its European allies. On the average, 
the costs of the Soviet forces oriented toward China took about 11 
percent of the total Russian military budget between 1964 and 1976. 
During those 12 years, roughly 15 percent of the growth in the Soviet 
level of effort, on the average, can be attributed to the buildup in the 
Far East. The remaining 85 percent has been allocated to strategic 
nuclear forces and the forces deployed opposite NATO Europe. 
Because of the resources allocated to the Soviet defense effort 
during the past decade, the Soviets have consistently outproduced the 
United States in tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, submarines, 
and minor naval combatants. Their present output of tactical aircraft 
and even helicopters is now greater than ours. While the United States 
has developed one new ICBM since 1965, the MINUTEMAN III, the Soviets 
have developed seven. Of their newest generation of ICBM's, three --
the SS-17, SS-18, and SS-19 -- have (compared with the MINUTEMAN III) 
greater throwweight, more and higher-yield multiple independently targetable 
re-entry vehicles (AIRVs), and nearly comparable accuracies. With a 
large and growing war production base, and an expanding corps of scientists 
and engineers devoted to military research and development, reasonable 
observers must conclude that, if anything, these many programs will 
continue to accelerate. 
We cannot state with certainty exactly why all of these scarce 
resources (from a Gross National Product probably no more than two-
thirds as large as ours) are being devoted to military power. But as I 
have pointed out: It would be unreasonable to assume that a nation 
would develop that kind of capability, that number of square feet under 
roof of shipyards, laboratories, test facilities, that number of scientists,

engineers, and construction workers, suddenly to turn them off. It is a 
pattern; it is clear; it is unambiguous; it is providing increasing 
military capabilities which, in turn, offer the Soviets increasing 
military options; it cannot be ignored. 
To be sure, the argument can be and has been made that this large and 
dynamic effort results simply from a traditional fear and distrust of 
the outside world. However, the Soviet people are ruled by a totalitarian 
regime with a passion for secrecy and a capacity for abrupt reversals of 
policy. Stalin demonstrated this capacity in 1939 when he suddenly 
allied himself with Nazi Germany. Times have changed, we are told, 
since the paranoid years of the old dictator. But it was not Stalin, 
who ordered the invasion of Hungary in 1956, nor was it Stalin who sent the 
Soviet armored and airborne divisions into Czechoslovakia in 1968. We know 
by their words, moreover, that Soviet leaders say that they see themselves 
engaged in a long-term competition with the West, that they seek to tilt 
the international "correlation of forces" in their favor, and that they 
continue to support and sponsor, "wars of national liberation." To 
describe the Soviet Union as a status quo power is to ignore their words 
and much of what has been taking place over the past 20 years. 
No evidence is available that the Soviet leadership intend to launch 
a direct military attack on the West in the immediate future. Recent 
experience may underline the prudence and caution of that leadership --
despite an older and more flamboyant history of threats to Berlin and the 
deployment of missiles to Cuba. U.S. self-interest may demand that we try 
to resolve conflicts of interest with the USSR by peaceful means, to seek 
understandings and mutual cooperation where the opportunity arises, and seek 
to improve the prospects for international stability through sound arms 
control agreements. But at the same time, prudence requires that we 
take into account the other and darker face presented by the Soviet 
Union. 
-- We must recognize that the Kremlin is not demonstrating restraint 
in the development of military capabilities. 
-- We must recognize that Soviet capabilities indicate a tendency 
toward warfighting and damage-limiting rather than for the more modish 
Western models of deterrence through mutual vulnerability. 
-- We must recognize the magnitude of the Soviet military effort 
and the momentum it has today as a result of their purposefulness over 
more than a decade.

nition of the size and scope of the Soviet military effort as it is, not as 
we would wish it to be, for it is those capabilities today and in the tuture 
which provide the Soviet Union with the options that we must face. 
These, indeed, are the critical assumptions underlying the detense 
budget for FY 1978 and the Five-Year Detense Program. These assumptions 
fit the facts about the Soviet Union as we now know chem. 
R. The People's Republic of China 
"e future course ot the PRG remains somewhat uncertain. The United 
States continues to seek more normal relations with that country. Despite 
hopeful prospects, we cannot wholly ignore the PRC tor purposes ot force 
planning. Sino-Soviet relations could improve. Peking is gradually 
developing an intercontinental and sea-based ballistic missile capability. 
We must take it into account in the design and deployment of our strategic 
nuclear posture, even though we may believe that its targets will not be 
n the United States. 
Because our allies in Asia are necessarily sensitive to the regional 
power of the PRC, we cannot ignore the possibility that local conflicts 
of interest might bring about the danger of armed clashes and pressures on 
the United States to support our allies. 
But the deepest concern must be reserved for the outcome ot the 
LIvalry between the PRC and the Soviet Union -- a rivalry with a continuing 
potential for violence, including even the possibility ot nuclear exchanges. 
The United States has not encouraged or taken sides in this antagonism. But 
we cannot ignore the existence of the substantial military buildup that has 
occurred on the frontiers of the PRC, or the history of border clashes 
Oetween the USSR and the PRC since 1969. The extent to which this 
Atuation should affect the defense posture of the united States, broadly 
defined, requires continuing review. 
C. Other Foreign Military Capabilities 
Other and lesser powers may choose to challenge the interests and 
allies of the United States. North Korea, Libya, and Cuba are only the most 
obviously bellicose of the candidates. Such challenges may become more 
dangerous in the period ahead. 
We are already witnessing the proliferation ot modern conventional 
weapons beyond the main industrialized nations. Regrettably, one cannot 
rule out a further diffusion of nuclear weapons. It both trends continue,

more substantial in scale, as recent conficts in the Middle East, including 
the war in Lebanon, have foreshadowed. The incidence of terrorism,

increase and terrorists could become more heavily armed with sophisticated 
weapons.

Vi. THE CHALLENGES TO SECURITY 
For purposes of force planning, it is necessary, although not 
sufficient, to know that there are threats to the security of the 
United States. Such threats must be understood and evaluated within a 
geographic context. The scope of the security problem facing us should 
not be underestimated, just as it should not be overestimated. We 
cannot expect to match all the capabilities of every conceivable adversary 
who might threaten U.S. interests in various parts of the world. In 
addition to identifying both U.S. interests and the potential threats 
to them, the force planner must indicate the kinds of challenges that 
might realistically be expected to arise. There is no shortage of such 
challenges. 
A. Nuclear Challenges 
First among these challenges -- and one that is accepted by almost 
all as requiring countermeasures for the indefinite future -- is a 
nuclear attack on the United States. Whatever the state of U.S. relations 
with the Soviet Union, and however much we may strive for progress 
toward strategic stability through arms control agreements, force 
planning must treat this challenge with the utmost seriousness. 
The threat of a direct nuclear attack on the United States must 
have the first call on our attention and resources. But we must not 
forget that our closest allies face the same possibility. Since none 
of them have nuclear capabilities on the scale of the United States and 
the Soviet Union, U.S. force planning must take their situation into 
account. Nor can we ignore two other harsh facts: 
-- the Soviet Union is modernizing and expanding its nuclear 
capability to a point where it could threaten and coerce its neighbors 
as well as the United States; 
-- the PRC continues gradually to develop a medium-range nuclear 
capability which will bring all of Asia within its range. 
Historically, these challenges have been taken into account in 
U.S. force planning. We must continue to do so. 
B. U.S. Relations with the Soviet Union 
The Soviet Union is and will remain for the foreseeable future the 
major threat to the United States and the international system on which 
we depend. While Soviet intentions and objectives are obviously not 
fully knowable outside of the Kremlin, Soviet military trends can be 
identified with some certainty: 
I. Across the spectrum of capabilities from strategic nuclear to 
general purpose, the Soviets give evidence of moving toward a fundamental 
32 
Approved For Release 2002/08StECRIX-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
shift in the "correlation of forces" that would give them peacetime and 
crisis leverage over the United States and its allies. 
2. The emphasis in Soviet nuclear programs on quantitative superiority 
indicates concern for major warfighting potential, in contrast to the 
U.S. emphasis on deterrence and stability. 
3. Increases in the overall size of Soviet forces in Eastern 
Europe -- together with increases in armor, armored fighting vehicles, 
and artillery 7- and continued stress on force modernization indicate 
the continued priority of Europe in Soviet military planning. They 
may also reflect a change in operational concept toward capabilities 
for attack without major prior reinforcement. 
4. The Soviets have built up forces capable of meeting Chinese 
threats and providing assurance of success at all levels of Chinese 
attack or provocation. 
5. Military capabilities for power projection at long distances 
from the Soviet Union are being developed with the resulting ability to 
extend influence in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, and to employ 
higher levels of aggressiveness in so doing. 
(a) Increased Soviet naval capability can provide forward 
presence and a basis for contesting U.S. influence. 
(b) Improvements in both airlift and merchant sealift now 
provide Soviet leaders with a long-range intervention capability. 
(c) Availability of a willing proxy -- Cuba today, possibly 
others (such as North Korea and Vietnam) tomorrow -- offer the opportunity 
to avoid direct Soviet military involvement, thereby lowering the 
political cost of exercising influence. Concern for adverse Chinese 
reaction may limit Soviet use of Asian proxies. 
The scope and vigor of the Soviet programs occurring at a time 
when the USSR has achieved a powerful deterrent as well as rough equivalence 
with the United States in strategic forces, raises the question of 
whether these programs can or will carry them to some form of strategic 
superiority over the United States. They trends lead to one judgment 
about the Soviet Union, and that is, in the main, their large and 
growing military capabilities with a growing offensive and warfighting 
orientation offer options to them which clearly are adverse to those 
who believe in freedom and self-determination, and particularly the 
United States. 
As to the future, the USSR can be expected to continue certain 
patterns, including:

strengthening its already formidable nuclear and conventional 
ntlitary forces; 
seeking to expand its influence by manipuLating local tensions 
and conflicts, particularly in the Third World; 
-- offering political support and various forms of military 
assistance to exploit opportunities to divide the Western alliance 
system; 
seeking to neutralize Western military advantages in areas in 
which Soviet and Western policies are in contest; 
-- pursuing arms control initiatives that will enhance their 
security, support their military and political objectives, and stabilize 
the military balance at levels favorable to the USSR. 
Soviet policies toward the West, according to their own statements, 
remain predicated on the doctrine that the forces of history will result 
in the victory of Communism worldwide and that the appropriate Soviet 
tole is to facilitate the process without endangering the Soviet state. 
Soviet leaders profess to believe that the balance is shifting in their 
Favor in the world. At the same time, structural economic weakness 
represents a vulnerability for the USSR and has compelled the Soviets to 
look more to the West for food and technology. 
rhe Soviet leadership has engaged in policies which can reasonably 
be described as relaxing tensions with the United States and Europe in 
areas which it believes provide, at present, the best opportunity for 
enhancing its own security, promoting its economic development, dealing 
with the problem of an unfriendly China on its eastern front, dividing 
the West and encouraging the spread of Soviet influence. 
Soviet leaders seem to recognize that U.S.-Soviet relations are 
particularly sensitive to developments in Europe, and Soviet policy 
toward Western Europe has seemed to be designed to enhance Soviet influence 
without arousing alarm in the United States or among our European allies. 
In Asia and elsewhere, a reality has been the Sino-Soviet dispute. 
Particularly difficult from the Soviet standpoint has been the improve-
ment in U.S.-PRC relations. The Soviets would logically view any overt 
11.S.-PRC military collaboration as increasing the threat to them. 
Conversely, the U.S. position in Asia and elsewhere could be made considerably 
more difficult by any significant Sino-Soviet rapprochement. Despite 
Lhe past intensity of the dispute, the Soviets have substantial incentives 
to seek such a rapprochement, as a method of enhancing their security in 
The Far East and easing their problems in the Communist movement. 
To the extent that the past is a guide to the future, the Soviets 
Jre likely to regard the Third World as a primary arena tor competition

both with the West and with China. The growth of their strategic and 
conventional forces will give them more room for maneuver in support 
of their clients and in attempting to intimidate neutrals and friends 
of the United States. The question is how far the Soviet leadership is 
prepared to go in exercising the options that its newly developed capa-
bilities provide. Clearly, there are dangers in challenging the United 
States directly in such critical areas as Europe, the Middle East or 
Asia. However, despite an apparent desire, thus far, to minimize the 
risk of a direct military confrontation with the United States, they 
have not been willing to exercise notable restraint in all areas of the 
Third World. Their use of Cuban forces as surrogates in Angola introduced 
a disturbing new dimension to their methods of operations. 
There seems little prospect for significant change in Soviet policies 
affecting U.S. security interests, even were there to be a change in 
Soviet leadership. Soviet military budgets seem likely to remain high 
and to increase in real terms. The options and opportunities that the 
resulting military capabilities will provide the USSR over the next few 
years will enhance its ability to counteract Western political-military 
capabilities and to exploit opportunities almost anywhere in the world. 
In such a situation, U.S. security objectives toward the USSR should 
be to have sufficient military capabilities to: 
-- deter a Soviet nuclear or conventional attack on the United 
States, its allies, and countries important to us, and to be capable 
of protecting their territorial and political integrity should deterrence 
fail; 
-- deter and to offset the expansion of Soviet power and influence 
in areas important to the United States; 
-- reduce areas of tension that risk U.S.-Soviet conflict, while 
improving mechanisms for maintaining stability and control should a 
crisis develop; 
limit, and if possible reduce, Soviet-U.S. arms competition; 
and 
-- encourage constructive Soviet collaboration on such international 
problems as arms control, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and Law of 
the Sea that affect our mutual security interests. 
American policy toward the USSR in support of these objectives has 
several distinct elements. They should include: 
-- maintaining a strong national and collective allied defense 
that can discourage Soviet adventurism or if need be respond to efforts 
at coercion, either overt or tacit, on the part of the Soviets and their 
allies;

-- encouraging negotiation to settle outstanding differences and 
to reduce tensions; 
- pursuing arms control initiatives to enhance stability in the 
military balance and improve crisis control; 
-- seeking, where appropriate, bilateral and multilateral agreements 
of mutual interest. 
The emphasis given to any one of these elements of policy will vary 
with circumstances and the degree to which it is seen to be contributing 
to overall U.S. objectives. 
C. U.S. Regional and Functional Security Interests and Objectives 
While some U.S. security interests and objectives, particularly 
those concerned with strategic nuclear arms control, will be pursued in 
a bilateral U.S.-Soviet context, most will involve close interaction 
with U.S. allies and friendly governments. In the sections that follow, 
the nature of U.S. interests, objectives and policies are examined by 
region. There are, in addition, functional elements of U.S. security 
policy such as arms and technology transfer, arms control and non-
proliferation that have foreign policy implications of global rather 
than specific regional nature. They are discussed throughout the chapter. 
1. Europe 
The fundamental U.S. security interest in Europe is to maintain 
Western European strength and deny the Soviets any ability to control or 
coerce Western Europe, either by military occupation, intimidation, or 
manipulation of domestic political or economic forces in Western European 
states. 
Major U.S. security objectives in Europe include: 
- to maintain the military capability, conventional and nuclear, 
necessary for deterrence and the defense of Western Europe; 
to promote the continued cohesion and development of NATO; 
- to encourage a major contribution to the NATO collective defense 
by the Western European states, and ensure that European and U.S. defense 
efforts are complementary and effective; 
-- to encourage the continued growth of strong, popularly supported 
national states in Western Europe which, are collectively capable of 
resisting Soviet pressures, and prevent growth of Soviet or local communist 
influence; 
36

SECRET 
-- to encourage political, economic, and security cooperation 
among Western European states and between them and the United States; 
-- to seek to reduce tension in Europe that might lead to conflict, 
and encourage various negotiations which could enhance stability in the 
East-West military relationship with undimished security. 
The overall U.S. security relationship to Europe will continue to 
be governed largely by NATO treaty obligations. In our European security 
policy, we must seek to balance the fundamental NATO relationship with 
the emergence of new areas of European cooperation in the defense field. 
A variety of proposals and efforts toward European defense cooperation 
were put forth or attempted in the 1950's and early 1960's. More recently, 
as our European allies have grown stronger, they have attempted some 
improvement in and coordination of their defense efforts. However, 
progress has been slow and the problems involved in developing effective 
regional defense arrangements remain formidable. The United States has 
adopted essentially an attitude of support toward such recent cooperative 
efforts. However, overall U.S. support for European integration has 
been predicated on the assumption that defense would and should continue 
to be handled within the NATO framework. 
A European defense entity seems not to be a near-term prospect. 
But we have encouraged Western Europeans to explore possibilities of a 
greater degree of defense cooperation among themselves. In the long 
run it would be healthier for Europe and for the U.S. relationship with 
Europe if Western Europeans developed a stronger defense capability. 
Given the importance of Central Europe to the defense of NATO, the 
Federal Republic of Germany is a principal geographic focus of NATO 
strategy. For many years the United States has had a close relationship 
with the Federal Republic in the military field, which reflects not only 
its critical geographic location but also the economic and military 
capabilities it can bring to bear on the task of defending Europe. The 
Germans, of course, see the U.S.-FRG relationship as a crucial guarantee 
of their security, bilaterally and in the alliance context. 
France withdrew from the NATO military structure in 1966. However 
sensible the subsequent low-key but useful pattern of ad hoc French 
cooperation with NATO, it is highly desirable over the longer term that 
members who benefit from the alliance so directly make a full contribution 
to its strength. 
Since the Defense Review of late 1974-early 1975, the British have 
undertaken additional budgetary reductions. By 1979-80, British forces 
will be virtually non-existent east of Suez (Hong Kong is an exception), 
British capabilities to deploy and reinforce in the Mediterranean will 
be vastly diminished, and Britain's overall quick reinforcement forces --
both manpower and transport capability -- will be dramatically cut back,

severely limiting Britain's ability to show force on either of NATO's 
Flanks, or in the Middle East or Persian Gulf. Britain's formal contribution 
to the Central Front, for the present, continues undiminished. 
Whether or not the Southern Flank continues to be politically 
unstable, the United States will want to work closely with its allies to 
ensure necessary cooperation in dealing with Middle East crises. It 
should now be clear to all NATO allies that events can and do occur 
outside of the NATO area which directly affect the nations of the Alliance. 
It is imperative that the divisions apparent in the October war of 1973 
do not recur in any future crises. 
Portugal is effectively firming up its ties to NATO. If political 
progress in Spain continues as it has over the past year, the prospects 
of its future membership in NATO would seem good. The United States must 
continue to support its eventual entry into the alliance. The question 
of possible Communist participation in some allied governments remains a 
serious problem. Only those seemingly willing to grant Communism moral 
parity with freedom can ignore the speed with which communist campaign 
promises can be and are reversed. Only those who ignore the impossible 
problem of having nations with whom we are engaged in a most intimate 
security relationship, involving the sharing of substantial national 
security information, can be unconverned with the evolving election 
pattern in some NATO nations. The fact is that in such an alliance, the 
inclusion of communists in the government of a member nation, over time, 
is incompatible with our security interests. 
3oth the aftermath of the 1974 Cyprus war and the recent "Cod War" 
between Iceland and the UK have underlined the difficulties of NATO, as 
an organization, assisting effectively in resolving conflicts among 
NATO's members. NATO's role in seeking to bring Greece and Turkey 
closer together may be limited largely to offering a forum for bilateral 
reconciliation, and the exercise of moral suasion and good offices. At 
the same time, NATO faces a number of problems and decisions that have 
their roots, directly or indirectly, in the Greek-Turkish relationship. 
The difficulties concerning Greece and Turkey, however, do not alter 
their strategic importance. It is important for the defense of Europe, 
for NATO, and for the long-term interests of the two nations that both 
remain on the Western side and continue to participate in European 
defense. 
On the northern flank, Norway's strategic position remains important 
both to the defense of Central Europe and to the balance of power in the 
Atlantic. There have been conflicting Soviet and Norwegian claims to the 
Arctic seabed, and a buildup of Soviet forces along this flank. Norway 
cannot meet the threat on its own.

2. East Asia 
The fundamental U.S. security interest in East Asia is to ensure 
that the area will not be dominated by any country or combination of 
countries hostile to the United States. The elements which compose the 
Asian balance are multiple and fluid, reflecting the complex relations 
among the United States, the Soviet Union, China and Japan. The threats 
to the current stability are diverse -- ranging from the possibility of 
armed attack across an established frontier in Korea to adventures in 
Southeast Asia, supported in varying degrees by some of the Communist 
nations of Asia. The present situation, however, is not unfavorable: 
Sino-Soviet rivalry persists; Japan remains allied to the United States 
and threatening to no country; the non-Communist nations of Southeast 
Asia are developing a degree of national resilience and regional cohesion 
to the point where they may not be readily susceptible to outside mani-
pulation. But the leadership adjustments in China, North-South tension 
in Korea, and the uncertain policies of Vietnam constitute uncertainties 
that could have a major -- yet unpredictable -- impact on East Asia. 
U.S. policy, including a strong military position in the Western Pacific 
and the maintenance of existing security commitments there, will be an 
important factor in preserving peace and stability in the area, although 
the future will also depend on a number of factors which are not directly 
under U.S. control. 
Aside from its formidable military capabilities against China, the 
Soviet Union can pose a significant nuclear and a limited naval threat 
throughout the Pacific; the USSR also possesses a limited capability 
for combined conventional operations against Japan. The Soviet capacity 
to utilize force to promote political objectives in the area is currently 
severely limited by the continuing U.S. military presence in the area, 
by the Sino-Soviet dispute, and by its lack of political resonance 
among the non-Communist nations of East and Southeast Asia. The forward 
presence of U.S. conventional forces thus plays an important role as 
the source of psychological and political reassurance necessary to 
avert intimidation. The maintenance of Pacific-based strategic nuclear 
forces serves a similar function in providing evidence of the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella. 
a. China 
The United States has a basic security interest in building 
constructive political and economic ties with China, even as we continue 
to seek to lessen tensions with the USSR. 
Basic U.S. security objectives in pursuit of these interests are: 
to counter attempts by any single nation to dominate the 
Asian-Pacific area; 
39 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 :SIRFAJP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
-- to implement the declared U.S. intent to normalize relations 
with the People's Republic of China, while protecting U.S. interests in 
a peaceful settlement of the problem of Taiwan; 
-- to encourage Chinese cooperation in promoting stability in 
the area, including Korea and Southeast Asia; and 
-- to maintain a military posture in the Pacific which will con-
tribute to stability in the area over the longer term. 
China has now entered the post-Mao era, and the present leadership 
in Peking has indicated that China's foreign policy will not change. 
The fundamental characteristics of Chinese foreign policy seem likely 
to persist, including a deep suspicion of the USSR that influences 
China's view of the U.S. role in the world. While China will probably 
continue to have a basic foreign policy objective of countering the 
threat from the USSR, some readjustments in their relationship, for 
example, a lessening of border tension, could take place. Such develop-
ments might or might not require adjustment in the U.S. posture. 
Yet in planning we must also hedge against the possibility of a future 
deterioration in U.S.-PRC relations, for differences persist between 
the U.S. and PRC outlook in policy and ideology. 
b. Japan 
The United States seeks to preserve and strengthen its partner-
ship in all fields with Japan, our most important Asian ally. The 
U.S.-Japanese alliance is not only a central pillar of Japanese 
foreign policy, it is a crucial element in the stability achieved in 
Northeast Asia, and contributes significantly to the maintenance of 
peace and security in the region and worldwide. The alliance thus 
serves fundamental U.S. interests. 
Despite the modest size of its existing defense forces, Japan's 
economic power and political influence make it a key factor in the 
East Asian political and security situation. In dealing with Japan 
in the security field, it is important that we display strength and 
steadiness, and that we act only with appropriate sensitivity to 
Japanese concerns. 
In broad terms, United States security objectives vis-a-vis 
Japan are: 
-- to ensure Japan's security against nuclear threats and to 
cooperate with Japan under the terms of the Mutual Security Treaty in 
defending against potential conventional threats. In fulfilling that 
40

SECRET 
objective, the United States should continue to encourage Japan to 
improve the capabilities of its forces for the defense of its territory; 
-- to encourage -- through close consultations -- compatibility 
and complementarity between U.S. and Japanese military forces and 
doctrines; 
-- to avoid policies and actions which would undermine Japanese 
confidence in our bilateral relationship, and in general to demonstrate 
to Japan -- through consultation, a sensitivity to its concerns, and 
steadiness in our own policies -- U.S. strength and reliability, as an 
ally and a stabilizing force in East Asia. 
C. Korea 
The U.S. interests in Korea derive from our historic commitment 
to the independence and security of the Republic of Korea (ROK), its 
geographic location, the concern of the other major Asian powers over 
events there, and the fact that developments in Korea could significantly 
affect our relations with these powers. U.S. security objectives 
include the following: 
-- to deter conflict in Korea, while seeking a political resolution 
of the Korean problem; and 
-- to help the ROK to strengthen its deterrent through assistance 
to ROK development of its economic and military strength and self-reliance. 
Our ability to pursue these objectives is constrained by a number 
of factors. North Korean intransigence and Sino-Soviet rivalry make a 
political settlement negotiated by the two Koreas unpromising. 
In pursuit of these objectives we and the ROK have made clear to 
North Korea and the PRC our readiness to dissolve the UN Command 
provided North Korea gives reliable assurances that the existing 
Armistice Agreement will remain valid, or to replace the existing 
Armistice Agreement with mutually acceptable permanent arrangements 
to keep the peace and ease tensions in the Peninsula. The United States 
has also urged resumption of the South-North dialogue, expressed a readiness 
to open relations with North Korea if the Communist powers are prepared 
to take similar, reciprocal steps toward the ROK, and supported UN membership 
for both the ROK and North Korea on a provisional basis, pending progress 
toward unification. 
The ROK, in pursuit of greater self sufficiency, has made notable 
economic and military progress, with U.S. support. It has emerged as a 
strong middle-level economic partner of the United States while assuming 
the main burden of its defense. U.S. military assistance to the ROK is 
now on a credit rather than grant basis, and the ROK has planned -- and

:s financing with its own resources -- an extensive five-year military 
Vorce Improvement Program. The continued modernization of ROK forces 
Alould allow us the eventual option of a further reduction of U.S. 
j:orces in Korea. However, the appropriate level of our forces will 
continue to be a function of the nature and magnitude of the North 
Korean threat, the ability of the ROK to meet that threat, and the 
prevailing international situation. 
Southeast Asia and Oceania 
The United States continues to have formal defense relationships 
with the Philippines under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and with Thailand 
through the 1954 Manila Pact. We have contributed to regional stability 
following the fall of South Vietnam by assisting friends and allies. 
specifically, U.S. objectives are to: 
-- encourage regional stability which will preserve the independence 
of countries friendly to the United States; 
provide material support to allies and friends; and 
-- maintain access for ourselves and our allies to vital lines of 
communication through the area. 
Mvents in Southeast Asia are less likely than in the past two 
decades to have a major impact on the major power alignments. Except for 
China, whose capability to project military force outside its own borders 
remains limited, the area is remote from the major powers. The principal 
potential threat to stability comes from Vietnam, whose military power 
has grown and whose attitude toward its neighbors remains unclear. The 
other countries of the area, to one degree or another, are seeking to 
adjust their relations with one another, as well as with the major 
powers, in an effort to preserve their independence and security. 
Those countries friendly to the United States acknowledge the value 
of a continuing presence of American forces on the periphery of Southeast 
Asia (e.g., in the Philippines) to lend substance to our contribution to 
the regional balance. The basic task is to relate U.S. political, 
economic and limited security assistance programs to the efforts of 
friendly regional states to build stable societies capable of withstanding 
Internal security threats and to maintain essential base rights and 
facilities that make possible fulfillment of a responsible regional role. 
U.S. air and naval bases in the Philippines are important in this 
respect. In addition to fulfilling a defensive mission for the Philippines,

they provide the capability to monitor and if necessary defend the lines 
of communication through the area. Moreover, facilities in the Philippines 
are the southern anchor of the U.S. forward military position in the 
western Pacific; as such they help reassure friends and remind adversaries 
of the U.S. determination to play a role in Asian security. 
We have fundamental interests in preserving the military balance in 
the South Pacific, in supporting key relationships with Australia and 
New Zealand and in ensuring that Micronesia does not come under the 
domination or excessive influence of an outside power. 
4. Middle East - North Africa 
Fundamental U.S. interests in the Middle East include: 
continuing progress toward a Middle East peace settlement; 
-- uninterrupted access to Middle East oil and gas resources by 
the United States, and especially by Western Europe and Japan, at acceptable 
prices; 
-- use of international waterways and airspace on a non-discriminatory 
basis; and 
establishment of internationally recognized borders. 
Major security objectives in the Middle East and North Africa include: 
-- preventing the spread of Soviet or Soviet-supported radical 
influence in the area; 
-- not permitting the military balance to become adverse to 
Israel, while encouraging progress toward an Arab-Israeli settlement; 
-- continuing and expanding constructive relations with all 
Middle East states, including the major oil producing countries; 
-- reducing potential causes of major power confrontation in the 
area; and 
-- encouraging regional stability and promoting cooperation among 
the states of the area. 
Several factors constrain the U.S. ability to protect these interests: 
- intra-regional tensions: the Arab-Israeli conflict and intra-
Arab rivalries jeopardize U.S. interests, and offer the USSR opportunities 
for exploitation at U.S. expense; 
43

Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
the growth or Soviet military power: its presence in the 
region increases the possibility of confrontation between the super-
powers; and 
-- different perceptions between the United States and its major 
allies: occasional differences on how to protect common Middle East 
interests constrain U.S. freedom of action. 
Security assistance and development of cooperative military relations 
between the United States and friendly states of the area, and among 
each other, will continue to make a contribution to the: 
-- maintenance of regional military balances between contending 
states create a situation of mutual deterrence; 
-- development of reliable friendly forces (for example, Iran, 
Saudi Arabia, Morocco) capable of contributing to regional order and 
deterring or combating outside intervention. 
Given the reality of the local arms competition and, given that the 
United States is certainly not the only arms supplier, the intensity and 
character of the competition is not subject to U.S. control as such. 
The Soviets, other Western countries and even Third World countries are 
sources of arms for the contending states. In addition, certain countries 
have a greater indigenous military production capability than others. 
These are obstacles to cooperation in controlling the overall flow of 
arms to the area. It will continue to be important, therefore, to 
encourage forms of regional cooperation in political, economic and 
military affairs that will reduce local tensions and contain any ex-
pansionary ambitions. 
5. Latin America 
U.S. interests in Latin America are both political and economic 
although there are important strategic interests with respect to lines 
of communication, particularly for oil, and access to critical mineral 
resources. There are few contingencies, however, that might impose a 
substantial requirement for U.S. forces. 
U.S. security objectives in these areas include: 
-- monitoring, and 
communication, such as in 
-- deterring, and if 
hostile to us in countries 
intervention would be seen 
if necessary defending, certain key lines of 
the Caribbean and the Panama Canal; 
necessary blocking, intervention by nations 
important to our security or where such 
as affecting the major power balance; and

-- supporting allies and countries friendly to the United States 
to encourage stability through regional balances. 
The United States has important interests in these areas. We 
can anticipate continuing Soviet attempts to expand its influence in 
Latin America. However, these countries, because of their complexity, 
diversity and nationalistic sentiment, have not been easily manipulated. 
This is not to say that threats to U.S. security might not arise in 
Latin America. The future status and security of the Panama Canal, Cuba's 
potential for subversion and intervention, and the persistence of 
possibly troublesome regional rivalries are serious problems. 
The roles for U.S. forces in these areas could include monitoring 
and, if necessary, defense of key lines of communication, reassurance to 
U.S. friends, and deterrence of hostile intervention in areas we deem 
important. 
6. South Asia - Africa 
As in the case of Latin America, U.S. interests in South Asia and Africa 
are primarily political and economic, with strategic interests limited 
to lines of communication (LOC). 
U.S. security objectives in South Asia and Africa include: 
monitoring and, if necessary, defending key LOC; and 
-- supporting friendly countries by diplomatic and economic means 
to encourage stability and to assist them in being less susceptible to 
Soviet or other influences hostile to Western interests. 
The immense social and economic problems of these areas will continue 
to create conditions of local disorder and tension, which will be both 
disruptive in themselves and may offer opportunities for exploitation by 
the Soviet Union or other countries hostile to the United States.

I. THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES 
The size and composition of the U.S. defense posture depends to an 
important degree on the role the United States may wish to play in 
contributing to international peace and stability. 
A. The Problem of Vulnerability 
That Americans have been forced to play an active and leading part 
in international affairs does not come from a lust for profits or world 
domination. Nor has it been an accident or an aberration. The role has 
been inescapable in part because the United States itself has become 
increasingly vulnerable to direct attack by intercontinental and sea-
based ballistic missiles. This new vulnerability has led to the con-
clusion that the United States must be concerned about the outside world, 
if for no other reason than to minimize conflicts of interest with the 
Soviet Union and discourage the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which 
could increase still further our potential vulnerability. 
B. The Problem of Power 
Another reason for the U.S. role is the power potential of the 
United States -- so much the product of the energy, imagination, and 
freedom of its citizens, the richness of its resources, its continental 
size, and the dynamism of its market economy. Such power acts as a 
magnet on those who wish us ill as well as on those who seek support and 
protection. As the years immediately preceding our involvement in the 
last two world wars demonstrated, this magnetic attraction, among other 
factors, made it impossible for us to stay aloof from what had begun as 
the quarrels of others. 
C. The Problem of Interdependence 
Since those days, U.S. involvement with the rest of the world has 
become even more intimate. By any measure, our external interests are 
larger and growing. Interdependence has become something more than a 
slogan, even though the United States continues to remain relatively 
more self-sufficient than most other nations. This interdependence is 
heightened by those who, with close ties to other countries, expect the 
United States to interest itself in the circumstances of the homelands 
they have left (as in the dispute between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus) 
and to protect them individually in their many overseas enterprises. 
D. The Problem of Superpower Status 
There is the further fact that the United States, by reason of its 
energy and accomplishments, belongs to an exclusive group. It is one of 
only two military superpowers. The Soviet Union, with a GNP much smaller 
46 
Approved For Release 2002/084ECRETRDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
than that of the United States, a weaker technological base, and an 
inefficient civil economy, has lifted itself to this status by dint of 
large allocations of resources to its military and the imposition of 
sacrifices on its citizens. As a consequence, it has become a formidable 
power. If the United States were to retire from the world stage, or 
decide to play only a minor role, there would be no counterbalance to 
the USSR. Few would suggest that given the magnitude of Soviet power --
and the absence of the United States as a counterweight -- the Soviet 
Union would long be restrained from expanding its influence. Western 
Europe and the Far East would be susceptible to domination. The world-
wide effects of a U.S. retreat would be politically, economically, 
militarily, and psychologically disastrous. 
E. The Weakening of the Old Order 
If such a forecast seems to place an undue burden on the United 
States and exaggerate its responsibility for world order, we must 
remember how much has changed since World War II. Our friends in 
Europe, while vital to the United States and contributing in essential 
ways to collective security, are no longer playing the parts on the 
world scene to which they and we had become accustomed for so long. 
Understandably, their old empires are gone, and with their breakup has 
vanished what authority and order they imposed on large parts of the 
world. The imperial policemen have left their beats and the increased 
disorder, now so evident, is one legacy of their departure. 
Only forty years ago, the idea that Great Britain, France, and 
Germany combined could not contain the Soviet Union would have seemed 
ludicrous. Now, no one believes that they can. Furthermore, in the 
absence of a strong united Europe, the United States has lost the 
luxury of time in which to mobilize its forces, adapt its industry to 
war production, learn from the mistakes of others, and support others in 
conflict as the great arsenal and reinforcement of freedom and self-
determination. 
F. Leadership 
History has now cast the United States in a role of world leader-
ship -- a role which requires military power to accompany justice -- a 
role which requires large, ready forces and places the United States in 
the frontline rather than in the rear of freedom's defense. The emblem 
of the American eagle, with an olive branch in one talon and a sheaf of 
arrows in the other, has become fully symbolic of our role. 
To have history push us center stage does not mean we are left 
without choices. For thirty years, however, we have assumed in our 
planning, and we continue to assume, that the United States will not 
shrink from world leadership. There are a number of reasons for this 
47 
Approved For Release 2002/08/2?TFRDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
assumption. Historically, we have found that a relatively passive role 
not only left the initiative in the hands of others, but also resulted 
in losses which later had to be recovered at a tragic cost in lives and 
treasure. In today's world, a passive role would imply that initiatives 
taken by others could not be harmful. Yet there is no evidence to show 
that if we fail to protect our interests, others could or would do it 
for us. 
It was argued before Pearl Harbor that if only the United States 
stood on the sidelines. Hitler and Stalin would eventually destroy one 
another, after which we could help our friends in Europe to pick up the 
pieces. However, the nation did not believe we could take the risk of 
leaving to others the settlement of a conflict so decisive to the future 
of western civilization. Ultimately, the decision was made to play an 
active role in both war and peace, to help shape events in directions 
favorable to the United States, even though the costs of doing 4o would 
prove great. 
C. The Risks of Retrenchment 
Despite this, we still hear echoes of the old plea for passivity in 
the assertion that if only we would exercise restraint, the Soviets 
would reciprocate and follow suit. Unfortunately. the evidence on 
Soviet behavior points in the opposite direction. The reality is that 
the interests of the United States stretch beyond our shores, and a 
reduction of our commitments while maintaining equal security and well-
being would lead to significantly higher, not lower, defense costs. 
In the present situation, there is no serious way to maintain U.S. 
security at diminishing cost. To be sure, we could redefine major U.S. 
security commitments, reduce the U.S. defense perimeter accordingly, and 
turn our back on some of the larger contingencies that now concern us. 
But the burden of proof for the safety of such a retrenchment must lie 
with its proponents. Certain questions in particular would require 
answers: 
-- Do they believe (and if so, on what grounds) that a major 
reduction in U.S. commitments would in any way lessen the U.S. need for 
strategic nuclear forces? 
-- Do they believe that the vacuum caused by a U.S. withdrawal 
from its obligations in Europe, the Middle East, or the Western Pacific 
would or could be filled adequately by our former allies in default of 
superpower backing and support? 
-- Do they believe that the prospects for nuclear proliferation 
would be reduced by a lessening of our relationshin with South Korea, 
the Republic of China, the Philippines, and Iran? 
48

SECRET 
-- Do they believe that the Soviet Union is so benign and modest in 
its interests that it would not be tempted at some point to fill the vacuum 
we would have created, with subsequent and adverse effects on international 
stability? 
-- Do they believe that a momentum would not be created, with the 
effect of reducing the national security of the United States, unless 
U.S. defense costs were raised considerably higher than they are now? 
-- Do they really believe that the world is so divided into 
watertight compartments, that the loss of one or two major compartments 
would have no consequences for the others? 
For those who fear that world commitments and the defense posture 
necessary to our security could tempt U.S. leaders to play the world's 
policeman, a moment with the realities of history should be somewhat re-
assuring. First, we have never aspired to that role. Second, history 
suggests that our part in the dramas of the past has been limited, 
despite the pleas of friends and the challenges of foes. Yes, in some 
instances, we have tried to provide a measure of leadership; we have 
tried to assist in replacing the old imperial order with a more democratic 
system of international politics; we have tried in a number of instances 
to create a measure of order and stability. Above all, we have tried to 
contribute to the process of collective security in a volatile and 
divided world. We have had a measure of success. I know of no choice 
but to continue that effort.

vii[. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The Role of Allies 
In the design of u.S. nuclear forces, we assume that any missions 
assigned to these forces must be accomplished without external assistance 
other than from overseas bases, communications, and intelligence facil-
ities. To say this, however, is not to suggest that we lack interest in 
the closest possible coordination with the British and French nuclear 
forces. We seek such cooperation at all times. 
Our approach is different in the design of our non-nuclear general 
purpose forces. For certain major contingencies, such as an attack on 
Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact, we assume that our NATO partners will meet 
their commitments and that, at a minimum, the forces pledged to the 
alliance will become available as scheduled. This assumption materially 
reduces the need for U.S. general purpose forces, although we have to 
recognize that other non-NATO contingencies might arise in which we 
could count only on U.S. forces for the necessary response. We need 
only recollect the obstacles the United States encountered in its effort to 
resupply Israel during the Middle East war of 1973 to realize that our 
major interests and our major regional allies' view of their interests 
sometimes diverge. 
B. Arms Control 
One of our primary objectives in arms control negotiations is 
enhanced security through increased stability, preferably at reduced 
force levels. We prefer a world in which neither superpower has any 
incentive either to attack the other or to strive for a long-term 
military advantage. At the same time, we seek to reduce uncertainty 
about the future and ease where possible the pressure for growth in the costs 
of defense. If security through stability can be achieved by means of 
agreements for equitable force reductions, we, of course, support such 
agreements. 
1. SALT 
We must, however, be realistic. So far, arms control successes 
have been modest. The ABM Treaty of 1972, with its subsequent modifi-
cation, has somewhat forestalled greater expenditure on the deployment 
of ABM systems, reduced uncertainty about the need to counter these 
defenses, and perhaps constrained the competition in this area. Con-
ceivably, it has contributed to stability as well, although that is less 
certain.

SECRET 
The Interim Offensive Agreement, which expires in October 1977, 
placed a ceiling on the number of U.S. and Soviet ICBMs and SLBMs and 
thereby reduced one element of uncertainty, during its life. But it has 
not lessened the Soviet determination to acquire new strategic offensive 
systems and has not appreciably increased stability. The Vladivostok 
Understanding of 1974 would represent an improvement over the Interim 
Offensive Agreement. But, as yet, it is not clear whether or when a new 
treaty which is in the U.S. security interest, will emerge from the 
negotiating process. 
2. Other Negotiations 
The complex multinational negotiations for Mutual and Balanced 
Force Reductions in Central Europe (MBFR), with objectives as laudable 
as those of SALT, have yet to realize specific results. In MBFR the 
United States and the participating NATO allies are negotiating with the 
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies to reduce as well as limit 
forces in Central Europe. Although these negotiations have been in 
progress for more than three years and NATO has demonstrated its serious-
ness with significant proposals, the Warsaw Pact nations continue to 
oppose parity of outcome in the form of a common collective ceiling on 
active-duty military manpower. As the MBFR negotiations continue, they 
serve as a significant example of the solidarity of the Atlantic Alliance 
and its ability to coordinate policy on far reaching and complex issues. 
Within the last year the United States has successfully negotiated 
other agreements, including the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, the 
Threshold Test Ban Treaty, and the Environmental Modification Treaty, 
which has just been opened for signature, and would prohibit "engaging 
in military or any other hostile use of environmental modification 
techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effect." Some 
ongoing negotiations, such as on the International Humanitarian Law in 
Armed Conflict, are also in progress, and there have been preliminary 
consultations or technical discussion with other states about possible 
future arms control efforts, including chemical weapons, and radio-
logical weapons. Although recent arms control measures have to some 
extent imposed restraints, and may help to slow the competitive inter-
action, it would be an exaggeration to claim that existing agreements 
have succeeded in these directions. 
The United States has conducted and will continue to conduct, its 
defense planning strictly within the limits set by existing arms control 
treaties and agreements. We continue to hope that the Soviet Union will 
do the same. But we cannot afford to pretend that current accomplishments 
in controlling arms have materially lessened the problems and costs of 
prudent force planning or the need to apply ourselves to that planning 
with the utmost dedication.

SECRET 
C. The Requirements of Deterrence 
decisive factor in shaping the defense posture is the 
concept or deterrence which underlies U.S. force planning. As has been 
frequently noted, deterrence is based on the assumption that if a 
potential aggressor is confronted with the threat of a sufficiently 
severe response, he will be likely to refrain from making his attack. 
The fundamental condition of deterrence, therefore, must be the actual 
Jltal,:ary capability to implement the threat. 
That much is obvious. But deterrence, as we have emphasized over 
he years, requires even more than an inventory of forces. The cap-
-Ability itself must be at least as ready as the threat, able to absorb 
even a surprise attack by the aggressor and still respond deliberately, 
able to penetrate defenses and reach its designated targets, and suffi-
ciently powerful to do the required amount of damage to the target 
system. 
Furthermore, the threatened penalty must be credible; if challenged, 
the United States, and, in certain cases, its allies, must have the evident 
resolve to commit the capability to the declared course of action. If 
these conditions are not met, there is a risk that an aggressor will 
choose either to ignore the threat because he considers it implausible, 
or to attack in the hope that he could eliminate our capability as a 
preliminary to proceeding with his plans. 
Clearly, the U.S. posture depends heavily on the degree to which we 
meet these requirements of deterrence. If we were to decide that a 
declaratory policy need not coincide with action policy, if we believed 
that as a nation and a government we were superb at deception, or if we 
would not be disturbed at being caught out in our bluffs, we could con-
ceivably move in one direction. We could try to create the facade of a 
defense capability, a military house of cards, accompany it with threats 
of mutual disaster, and hope against hope that the deterrent would never 
be tested. This is the direction seemingly urged by those who believe 
there is a distinction between deterrence and defense. 
The other direction -- indeed the only sound direction -- requires 
that we design and maintain a defense posture which is credible against 
a wide range of challenges. This means that the posture must have a 
serious fighting capability that we ourselves believe is responsive and 
effective, and that the threats accompanying it do not frighten us more 
than they do the potential enemy. We have chosen to go in this latter 
direction with our defense posture, although in certain areas progress 
has been less than complete. 
To arrive at a credible deterrent, whether nuclear or conventional, 
we must assume for purposes of planning that deterrence has somehow 
52 
Approved For Release 2002/08AMT-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
failed, allow a hypothetical attack to take place, and then assess the 
effectiveness of various possible defense postures as they absorb and 
respond to the attack. If we can design a posture which can credibly 
perform its missions under these conditions, we believe we will have 
confidence in it, potential enemies will be reluctant to challenge it 
even in desperate circumstances -- and deterrence will thereby be 
reasonably assured. 
D. Contingency Analyses 
The tests selected as the basis for designing and assessing the 
adequacy of U.S. forces have a major impact on the size and character of 
the defense burden we must bear. It is essential, accordingly, to be as 
explicit as possible about methodology. 
The many contingencies which could arise out of the troubled 
international environment provide an ample basis for designing the U.S. 
posture. But U.S. forces are not planned on the assumption that we 
alone, or the United States even with its allies, must be able to meet 
all possible and plausible contingencies simultaneously. Nor is it 
assumed, because selected contingencies have been used for the purposes 
of designing and testing the U.S. defense posture, that these are the 
only contingencies to which U.S. forces can or will be committed. 
Contingency analysis is useful because it permits a reasonably 
realistic if aggregate method of determining U.S. force needs. It also 
provides a way of imposing a measure of control over the total size of 
the posture. It is not useful, and is not intended to be useful, as a 
forecast of where, when, or how the United States would or should use 
the resulting capabilities. Those decisions remain with the President 
and the Congress; they are not within the exclusive province of the 
Department of Defense. The functions of this Department are limited. 
They include: 
-- providing the Commander-in-Chief and the Congress with forces 
adequate to the security of the United States; 
-- advising how to achieve the nation's objectives most effi-
ciently with the military means at our disposal; 
operating the forces at his direction. 
Discussions of contingency analysis must not be confused with these 
realities.

,, Strategic Concepts 
L;. contingency analysis is to serve as a technique for arriving at 
and controlling force size and composition, not only must particular 
contingencies be selected for analysis; strategic concepts must be 
specified as well. Several considerations shape the choice of con-
'7i..ngencies and concepts for use in force planning. The designated 
contingencies must entail serious but plausible threats in areas of 
ulaior interest to the United States. They must involve a substantial 
but realistic commitment -of capabilities by a prospective enemy. And 
'They must be genuinely demanding in that the potential attacker has the 
titiative, is malevolent (rather than cooperative), and uses the max-
imum of his available capabilities in the most efficient way open to 
him. We could, of course, assume a more cooperative enemy who would 
1Pad to our strengths. But that is not what war and its deterrence are 
about. Persumably, a serious antagonist will do his best to prevail, 
and we have to allow for that possibility. 
The Nuclear Contingencies 
We must obviously look at a number of contingencies in the course 
of designing the U.S. defense posture because of variations in geography, 
distances, climate, and possible opponents. But for the purpose of 
translating military requirements into a specific force size and com-
position, we focus on a limited number of cases. In the design of U.S. 
lrrategic nuclear forces, three main contingencies are considered: 
-- a surprise attack by the Soviet strategic offensive forces 
against U.S. retaliatory capabilities postured in their regular day-to-
day alert status; 
a surprise Soviet attack against what is called a U.S. gene-
rated alert posture -- that is, a posture which has more bombers on 
alert and SLBMs at sea because of a deteriorating international situation; 
-- and what amounts to a sequential PRC-Soviet attack against a 
U.S. generated alert posture. 
A number of other contingencies are also analyzed, not so much to 
derive the basic U.S. force structure as to determine whether the three 
base cases have demanded sufficient size and flexibility in that structure 
to deal with dangerous "off-design" possibilities. 
2. The Conventional Contingencies 
The contingencies to which the most attention is given in con-
sidering the design of the general purpose forces are also three in 
number: 
54 
Approved For Release 2002/IMMTIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
-- an attack by the Warsaw Pact, starting at the conventional 
level, on the three main fronts of NATO; 
-- an attack on South Korea by North Korean forces, which could 
be supported by the PRC or the USSR, or both; 
-- and what in the past has been described as a lesser contingency 
such as might arise in the Caribbean or the Middle East, and initially 
involve U.S. but not Soviet forces. During the 1960s, a war at sea was 
also examined as a separate contingency. Today, however, maritime 
campaigns are treated as parts of the other contingencies. 
Because the variety of non-nuclear contingencies is so great, it is 
particularly important to test our posture in a number of "off-design" 
cases. A conflict in the Persian Gulf is an example of a case, which 
could make demands on the U.S. posture not brought out by any of the 
base cases. Force planning must analyze the implications of this kind 
of sequencing, and possible Soviet reactions in the immediate area and 
elsewhere, so as to permit judgments about the insurance to maintain 
against its possible occurrence and demands. 
It has long been recognized that if the U.S. defense posture were 
designed to deal simultaneously with all the contingencies that could 
occur around the world, the defense budget would rapidly absorb a much 
larger portion of the Gross National Product. If allied forces were not 
included in the calculation of requirements for general purpose forces, 
the demand would be greater still. Even when analysis is limited to a 
small number of cases for force planning purposes, and allies are taken 
into account where appropriate, the demands become substantial. In 
order to place a ceiling on these demands, and at the same time to make 
a rough statement of the risks run with the posture, a strategic concept 
is developed. In essence, it dictates the number of base or realistic 
contingencies for which the United States should be simultaneously 
prepared. 
3. The Planning Concepts 
Strategic nuclear force planning deals only with the case of a 
Soviet surprise attack on U.S. day-to-day alert forces. The assumption 
is that a U.S. posture configured to deter this contingency should be 
able to handle other nuclear contingencies (including a PRC attack), 
provided that we had received strategic warning and gone to a generated 
alert. Where general purpose forces are concerned, the U.S. posture 
is planned on the assumption that, in conjunction with our allies, we 
must be able to respond to one major contingency (with Europe and Korea 
as the two test cases) preceded by a minor contingency (such as a con-
flict in the Middle East not involving Soviet forces).

SECRET 
There are circumstances in which a strategic nuclear posture con-
servatively designed to absorb a massive surprise attack and strike back 
could fall below the planned level of effectiveness. A successful 
Soviet damage-limiting program could produce such a relative failure. 
Even a conservatively designed general purpose force posture based on 
the current strategic concept could be stretched to the breaking point 
if two major contingencies were to arise more or less simultaneously, as 
they did in World War II. In the past, the strategic concept required 
the capability (which included the high-priority reserves) to deal 
simultaneously with two major contingencies and one minor contingency. 
Since 1969, however, planning for force sizing has assumed that the 
Sino-Soviet split would preclude the need for the United States to be 
prepared at all times to fight a conventional two-front war on the 
ground. 
Whether that assumption continues to be valid is an issue which 
deserves continuing review. Some slight modification in the concept has 
already, in practice, occurred. For the most part, active forces are 
relied upon for planning an initial defense. And it has been concluded 
that positions of deployed strength in both Europe and Northeast Asia 
should be maintained. Thus, even in the event of a war in Europe, the 
United States would attempt to hold a forward defense line in Asia 
anchored by our Pacific base system in Japan and elsewhere in the area. 
A case can be made for going still further in this direction, even 
with a continuation of the Sino-Soviet split. The alternative of 
moving toward a less ambitious strategic concept is not as persuasive at 
this time. Modifications of the strategic concept, because of the force 
planning approach, could have an impact on the U.S. defense posture, as 
was demonstrated in 1969. But hardly anyone now denies that the United 
States should have the capability to resist an attack on Europe in 
conjunction with its allies. And the volatile state of the world, 
combined with the nature of U.S. interests, still make it prudent to 
have the capability to respond simultaneously to one other contingency 
of a smaller scale. Even U.S. overseas deployments are becoming increas-
ingly difficult to modify in light of the need both for deterrent forces 
in place and for rapid-reaction capabilities in an emergency. In fact, 
one of the criticisms made of the U.S. reply to the Mayaguez seizure in 
1975 was that we had not maintained sufficient quick-response forces 
deployable in the vicinity of Cambodia. 
While strategic concepts can be changed, with implications for the 
U.S. posture and the risks we run in the world, the process should not 
be arbitrary. Those who believe that the current U.S. defense posture 
is excessively large or even counter-productive should demonstrate where 
and why they would change the assumptions underlying it. I do not see 
any basis for a reduction.

The selection of planning contingencies and the determination of 
strategic concepts permit the specific analysis of hypothetical campaigns 
and the derivation of the forces needed by the United States to maintain 
the conditions of national security. Two features of this approach 
deserve reiteration and re-emphasis. 
-- First, although the process of force planning requires a 
simulation of military engagements, whether through field exercises or 
war games of various kinds, the purpose of the approach is to ensure the 
maintenance of peace through deterrence and stability. 
-- Second, although quite specific contingencies are used as the 
basis for generating the U.S. defense posture, the resulting forces are 
not tied to these particular contingencies, except insofar as they are 
deployed to a particular theater or committed annually to an alliance. 
The fact that the European contingency dominates U.S. defense planning 
and generates the bulk of the general purpose force requirements does 
not mean that these forces can and should be used only in the defense of 
NATO. Once generated, they are available for commitment as the President 
and the Congress so direct. It is on this basis that the determination 
of detailed force requirements proceeds. 
4. Future Planning 
The current planning approach still does not come to grips adequately 
with an emerging nuclear problem. This year, as in the past, the 
Defense Report uses the terms strategic and theater to describe U.S. 
nuclear forces, and treats these forces as having separable roles in the 
arsenal of deterrence. However, there are several reasons why, in the 
future, we should be cautious of this nomenclature and consider all the 
nuclear forces as constituting a continuum of capabilities. 
The first reason is that there is no clear distinction between 
strategic and theater (or tactical) nuclear forces. For some years, the 
Soviets have based variable-range ICBMs in their medium-range sites. 
Now, with the prospective deployment of the SS-X-20 missile and the 
deployment of the Backfire bomber, they have introduced a further element 
of ambiguity as to the range capabilities and missions of their various 
nuclear forces. The United States, for its part, has forward-deployed 
various systems capable of striking targets in the Soviet Union (carrier-
based aircraft, for example). 
The second reason is that aircraft and missiles designed to perform 
deep missions, and attack what used to be called strategic targets, may 
not necessarily have the decisive role in nuclear warfare currently 
attributed to them. The outcome of a nuclear conflict, as has been the 
case in more traditional warfare, could depend on an ability as much to 
hold or occupy territory as to destroy specific targets.

SECRET 
The third reason is a function of the first two. Important systems 
such as the SS-X-20 do not fall neatly into one or the other of the two 
current arms control categories of central or non-central systems. Yet 
they could play an important role in a nuclear conflict. If arms control 
negotiations are to reduce the probability of nuclear war over time, it 
seems likely that they must at some point, in some manner, take into 
account these "gray area" systems, regardless of where they are based or 
what targets they can attack. 
Cruise missiles are particularly difficult to classify. They are 
applicable to many missions. They can be launched from aircraft, land 
launchers, ships and submarines -- with nuclear or conventional warheads 
-- in strategic, theater and antiship operations. The development 
program being pursued has focused on cruise missiles in the following 
categories: 
air launched strategic nuclear; 
land launched theater nuclear; 
ship launched theater nuclear, and non-nuclear antiship; 
submarine launched strategic and theater nuclear, and non-
nuclear antiship. 
Improved cruise missiles would be consistent with a mix of large-
deck and smaller carriers in the 1990s. A broad spectrum of shallow and 
deep interdiction targets in a theater could be attacked by cruise 
missiles with several different launch modes. In the longer term, as 
terminal guidance systems are developed, many "strategic" targets could 
be attacked with conventionally armed cruise missiles. In the nearer 
future, a long-range air-launched cruise missile will constitute the 
most efficient way to maintain the utility of the B-52 force. 
Cruise missiles may be tempting candidates for arms control, but 
because of their versatility and the verification issues they raise, 
considerable caution needs to be exercised in how they are treated 
within the framework of SALT. 
Cruise missiles raise management issues as well. Precisely because 
of their versatility and efficiency, they cut across traditional mission 
boundaries and challenge familiar weapon systems. Central supervision 
of their development may be necessary both to realize their promise and 
to ensure the caution necessary in arms control discussions of the 
future. 
The classifications of strategic, tactical, or antiship used in 
Section II of this Report will probably require change as cruise missile

technology evolves. Tomahawk is a case in point. It is being developed 
for several different roles. Current efforts are directed toward develop-
ing an antiship version of the missile with a conventional warhead and a 
land attack version with a nuclear warhead. Maritime platforms currently 
being planned for conventional Tomahawk deployment are attack submarines 
and some surface ships. The missile is also designed to be compatible 
with aircraft. Combatants would carry a mix of Harpoon and Tomahawk 
missiles, with Tomahawk providing greater lethality against major Soviet 
combatants and a longer range strike capability.

Their Functions 
The U.S. strategic nuclear posture deters such attacks. But that is 
not its only function. Although both Great Britain and France maintain 
modest nuclear forces, only the strategic capabilities of the United States 
stand as a major bulwark against nuclear blackmail of and attacks on our 
aLlies. 
is fashionable, I realize, to assert that if only the two super-
powers, and especially the United States, would set a good example and 
engage seriously in nuclear disarmament, other countries would be less 
Lempted to acquire nuclear capabilities of their own. But this assertion 
almost surely without foundation in fact. The motives of states which

aspire to nuclear status are invariably complex. It hardly seems plausible 
to believe that any significant reductions in U.S. nuclear forces, and the 
subsequent decrease in their nuclear protection for other countries, would 
discourage nuclear proliferation. Strong U.S. nuclear forces may not 
be a sufficient condition for nuclear restraint on the part of others, 
but they appear to be a necessary condition. Indeed, they may have a 
role to play in discouraging rash action by nations which acquire small 
nuclear forces. In this connection, only six nations have tested 
nuclear weapons at this tume, But there may already be as many as 20 
nuclear aspirants, and the number could well rise to 40 by 1985. 
An equally important function for the strategic nuclear forces is 
to provide the foundation on which U.S. and allied general purpose 
forces gain credibility. Consequently, even though they absorb no more 
than 20 percent of the total U.S. defense budget (when a share of indirect 
support costs is added), they require the most serious, continuing 
attention. 
If the U.S. strategic foundation is not solid at all times, the 
rest of the defense structure we build -- and our entire system of 
collective security -- may collapse. If we fail to maintain a modernized 
strategic posture, the Soviets (who seize every occasion to modernize 
and improve their own) will certainly see the opportunities presented to 
them. They are already behaving in a manner which indicates their 
interest in more than deterrence as some have defined it in the West. 
We must expect them to continue in this vein. As the Central Intelligence 
Agency has pointed out: 
The Soviets are committed to the acquisition of "war-fighting 
capabilities," a decision which reflects a consensus on the need 
to assure the survival of the Soviet Union as a national entity 
in case deterrence fails. It also accords with a long-standing 
tenet of Soviet military doctrine that a nuclear war could be 
fought and won, and that counterforce capabilities should be 
emphasized in strategic forces. Mutual assured destruction 
as a desirable and lasting basis for a stable strategic nuclear 
relationship between superpowers has never been accepted in the 
USSR. But Soviet political and military leaders probably regard 
it as a reality which will be operative at least over the next 
decade.* 
B. The Threat 
While this judgment may seem harsh, even unseemly in a period of 
negotiations, and contrary to much conventional wisdom, it is supported 
by a great many facts. To be sure, the Soviets started well behind the

United States in strategic capabilities, and with a much weaker technological 
and industrial base. For many years, therefore, it was possible to 
rationalize Soviet programs large:y as reactions to earlier U.S. initiatives 
Now, however, the situation has quite a different appearance. Between 
1965 and 1976 alone, the Soviets managed to increase their ICBM force 
from 224. to over 1,500 launchers, and their SLBM force from 29 to around 
800 launchers. They also began to modernize their long-range bomber 
force.

As their offensive capability has increased, so has their inventory of 
deliverable weapons. Their strategic loadings (weapons which can be 
loaded on board strategic missiles and bombers) rose from 450 to about 
3,300 warheads and bombs between 1965 and 1976, and there is every 
indication that the growth in deliverable weapons will continue at a 
rapid pace. 
Current Deployments 
In 1977, we already face a mature and sophisticated Soviet strategic 
nuclear capability. At the present time, the Soviets deploy fewer than 
1,500 ICBMs, over 800 SLBMs, and over 200 long-range bombers, including 
those Backfire aircraft assigned to naval aviation and other aircraft 
rapidly convertible from tankers to bombers. They appear to believe, as 
we certainly do, that a diverse offensive force mix is important insurance 
to have and that investing in only one basing mode for missiles would

SECRET 
entail an unacceptable risk. However, to date, they have placed less 
emphasis on long-range bombers than we do. 
As far as we can tell, the Soviets are building to the limits on 
missile launchers set by the Interim Offensive Agreement of 1972, with a 
deployment mix of about 1,400 ICBMs and 950 SLBMs. As their SLBM force 
has expanded well over the threshold of 740 launchers, they have been 
deactivating older SS-7 and SS-8 ICBM launchers. Of the 1,320 MIRVed 
launchers which a SALT II agreement based on Vladivostok would allow, 
the Soviets have deployed about 235 thus far. 
It has been estimated that the Soviets could deploy as many as 
3,300 launchers and bombers (excluding Backfire) by 1985 if they were 
not constrained by existing and proposed SALT agreements. There is 
evidence that they could, as an alternative, reload some silos after an 
initial launch. 
Soviet active strategic defenses remain about as they were reported 
a year ago. The Moscow ABM system consists of 64 launchers. Anti-
bomber defenses are composed of about 9,700 surface-to-air (SAM) launshers 
and 2,600 PVO interceptors. Soviet command-control-communications (C ) 
for both strategic offense and defense have been given increased sophistication 
and redundancy during the past year, and they appear to have the capacity 
to execute a flexible, war-fighting strategy. During the past year, we 
have gained a better appreciation of the extent of the ongoing Soviet 
civil defense effort. The program, which is under military direction, 
provides varying degrees of protection for leaders, the general population, 
and industry. 
2. Force Improvements 
The overall Soviet strategic posture is already impressive in terms 
of numbers, throw-weight, and equivalent megatonnage. Even more impressive 
is the generally successful effort to improve the quality of the posture 
within the limits of various SALT agreements and understandings. In short, 
we are witnessing a significant upgrading of Soviet war-fighting capability 
in the current wave of modernization. A further wave, expected to 
follow this one by the end of the decade, could increase that capability 
still further.

The most striking evidence of the qualitative improvements arising out 
ttf the current wave of modernization comes from the Soviet ICBM force. 
The new SS-17. SS-18, and SS-19 missiles continue to be deployed in modified 
and upgraded silos at a rate of about 100 a year. We estimate that there 
are now about 40 SS-17s, 54 SS-18s, and around 140 SS-19s in the force. We 
believe that some of the modified silos have been hardened to resist at least 
2,500 pounds per square inch over-pressure. Units of the SS-11, SS-17, and 
SS-19 ICBMs have been deployed underneath the umbrella of the Moscow ABM 
system. In addition to a MIRV configuration, the Soviets have developed 
high-yield, single warheads for the SS-17, the SS-18, and the SS-19. The
is currently being deployed in both single and MIRVed warhead modes. 
When configured in its MIRVed mode, the SS-17 has 4 MIRVs, each with a 
yield of about 700 kilotons. The SS-19 can carry 6 MIRVs with yields 
-stimated at one megaton per MIRV. We now believe that the SS-18 can 
deploy as many as 8-10 MIRVs with yields estimated at between a half and 
bne megaton per MIRV. The SS-18, carrying two types of MIRV, can probably 
use both types to attack a single target without causing fratricide. The

second, and blunter, type of MIRV will arrive on target about 10 seconds 
after the first and faster RV, but with a sacrifice in accuracy. It is 
becoming increasingly evident, moreover, that the SS-19 now could have an 
accuracy approaching that of the Minuteman III, and there are no intrinsic 
reasons why the SS-17 and SS-18 cannot have nearly the same CEPs (Circular 
Error, Probable). A major Soviet hard-target kill capability must therefore 
be anticipated in the near future. 
We believe that the Soviets could deploy the SS-X-16 ICBM in a land-
mobile mode as a successor or supplement to the SS-13. The payload of the 
SS-X-16 will probably consist of a single warhead with a CEP of about .25 
nautical miles. As reported, a shorter-range version of the SS-X-16 ICBM 
system, the SS-X-20, is about to be deployed in southwest Russia and in the 
vicinity of the PRC as a replacement for the older SS-4 and SS-5 MRBMs and 
IRBMs. The SS-X-20 consists of the first two stages of the SS-X-16, has a 
demonstrated range of at least 2,200 nautical miles, and carries three 
MIRVs with a CEP of about .2 nautical miles. As far as we can now judge, 
the planned deployment of MIRVed SS-X-20 missiles could give the Soviets 
almost three times as many warheads as did the older MRBMs and IRBMs. 
There is also the possibility that the missile could be given a range 
equal to the SALT definition of ICBM range (5,500 kilometers or about 3,000 
nautical miles) either by the addition of a third stage or by offloading 
MIRVs. 
Even as these deployments and developments go forward, still another 
generation of at least two new ICBMs proceeds in research and development. 
We do not yet know the specific characteristics of these new missiles. But 
we anticipate that they will show still further improvements in accuracy 
and thus in hard-target kill capability. Testing of one or more of these 
missiles will probably begin later this year. 
b. Submarine-launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) 
The Soviets have continued to modernize their SLBM force and are 
producing a significant improvement in the sea-based component of their 
Triad. Submarines are becoming only slightly quieter, but missile ranges 
are growing longer, and MIRVs are being developed for SLBMs. The Soviets 
have ended production of the Yankee class submarines in part, no doubt, 
because the boats would have to go on station within range of U.S. and 
allied ASW forces in order to cover targets in the United States. 
The Delta I submarine, of which at least 15 have been launched, carries 
12 SS-N-8 missiles, each with a range of at least 4,200 nautical miles. 
(A recent firing of the missile covered 4,900 n.m.) The Delta II submarine 
has ceased production after four units. It is nearly as large as the 
Trident submarine and carries 16 SS-N-8 missiles. Additional Delta production 
is continuing; the latest variant has been designated the Delta III. It 
will carry 16 of the new SS-NX-18 missile. The SS-N-6, Mod III, aboard the

SECRET 
Yankee submarines has three multiple re-entry vehicles (MRVs). The SS-N-8 
missile currently has one warhead, with a yield of about one megaton. The 
present generation of SLBMs does not have a significant hard-target kill 
capability. But it is sufficiently accurate for use against bomber bases 
and other soft targets of high value. The SS-N-8 has the further advantage 
that it can cover major targets in the United States from launch-points as 
distant as the Barents Sea and the North Pacific. Such deployments, 
relatively close to home ports, allow more time on station (the equivalent 
of having additional SSBNs) and provide a degree of sanctuary from anti-
submarine warfare (ASW) forces. 
Ft should be emphasized that the SS-N-8 is about comparable in range 
to the full-payload range Trident I missile we plan to deploy in 1979. By 
chat time, the Soviets may have begun deploying a submarine even larger 
than any of the Delta series. They have already tested two new SLBMs. 
One, the SS-NX-17, is a solid fuel missile with a large post-boost vehicle 
(PBV) and a single warhead. The other, designated the SS-NX-18 is a 
iiquid fuel missile which, to date, has flown with two MIRVs. It is 
estimated to have a capability of carrying three RVs. In November 1916, 
the SS-NX-18 underwent a successful launch at sea. Its range is approximately 
4,000 nautical miles. We now estimate that it will go into the new Delta 
III boats. It could also be installed in modified versions of existing 
submarines at some future time. 
Long-range Bombers 
The most significant change in the Soviet long-range bomber force has 
been the addition of the Backfire to the older Bisons and Bears. The 
Backfire has now been in service with Soviet Long-Range Aviation for about 
30 months. Around 25 are deployed with the LRA, and total production 
(including aircraft for Naval Aviation) is currently running at a rate of 
about 2.5 a month. We continue to believe the Backfire has an inter-
oontinental capability given certain flight profiles. Use of its inflight 
refueling capability would assure intercontinental ranges, and its performance 
is likely to be improved with time. Evidence exists that the Soviets are 
also working on a follow-on heavy bomber with greater range and payload to 
roplace the aging Bears and Bisons. 
d_ Active Defenses 
The Soviets have not yet remedied their vulnerability to relatively 
sLow bombers penetrating their air defenses at low altitudes. However, 
they continue efforts to plug this gap, and they are expected to develop 
an AWACS-type aircraft and a look-down, shoot-down capability greater than 
that of the Flogger B in the 1980s. 
More imminent is the renewed development of rapidly transportable, 
high-performance surface-to-air missile defense systems. One new system 
consists of a phased-array search and track radar and probably an

SECRET 
interceptor missile with a velocity almost comparable to that of our 
Sprint low-altitude ABM interceptor. This new system, which has been 
tentatively designated as the ABM-X-3, has a well-defined capability 
against both strategic and tactical aircraft and tactical missiles. The 
full system has not been tested in an ABM mode. However, it also appears 
to lend itself to the defense of both hard point and soft targets against 
ballistic missile attacks. If its components were stockpiled, the system 
could be deployed on relatively short notice. Deployment could begin as 
early as 1980. 
In theorizing about strategic nuclear stability, some analysts have 
postulated that mutual vulnerability is a condition of stability -- in 
other words, if each side offered its vulnerable population and industry 
as hostages to the other, neither side would dare to attack. These same 
analysts saw acceptance by the Soviets of this premise in their signature 
of the ABM Treaty of 1972. It has become equally plausible to believe 
that the Soviets have never really agreed to this assumption, and that 
they entered the ABM Treaty either because of severe resource constraints 
or because they feared that, without an agreement, U.S. technology over 
the near term would give us a continuing and even growing advantage in 
this form of defense. 
e. Passive Defenses 
This hypothesis gains in plausibility when the spectrum of Soviet 
active and passive defense programs is considered. While U.S. R&D on ABM 
systems has slowed down, theirs has not. In the realm of civil defense, 
there were significant shifts in program emphasis in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. The current Soviet civil defense program is broad in scope 
with preparations suggesting the following order of priority; 
political 
hardening 
and other 
Assuring continuity of government and control by protecting the 
and military leadership; 
Providing for the continuity of important economic operations by 
facilities, protecting personnel, protecting some food supplies, 
measures; and 
Protecting nonessential personnel through sheltering or evacuation. 
Available evidence suggests that all of these preparations are continuing 
and that the Soviets are following the above priorities. While the evidence 
is still coming in, and we cannot make firm judgments on either the magnitude 
or potential effectiveness of Soviet civil defense, the available in-
formation suggests a strong Soviet interest in damage limiting.

3. Conclusions 
Two points should be made about these developments in Soviet offensive 
and defensive programs. 
-- First, whatever the motives for past Soviet strategic expenditures, 
it should now be evident that the Soviets have taken the initiative in 
a wide range of programs, that restraint on our part (whatever its reason) 
has not been reciprocated -- and is not likely to be -- and that the 
behavior of the Soviets indicates an interest -- not in the more abstract 
and simplistic theories of deterrence -- but in developing their strategic 
nuclear posture into a serious war-fighting capability. 
-- Second, while the Soviets may not persevere or succeed in this 
admittedly complex and difficult task, their growing capabilities must play 
a major role in U.S. force planning. 
To underline this last point may seem trivial. But some believe that 
U.S. strategic nuclear forces are already insensitive to whatever the 
Soviets do with their offense and defense. In my judgment, few ideas could 
be more dangerous to the security of the United States or further from the 
actuality of the strategic situation. As Albert Wohlstetter wrote nearly 
twenty years ago, the balance is delicate, and the task of strategic nuclear 
deterrence is continuing and demanding. Not only should the design of the 
U.S. strategic posture be highly responsive to the threat; it must also 
reflect a number of other factors including the specific and changing 
conditions of modern deterrence. 
C. Second-Strike Forces 
It has been a longstanding policy of the United States to recognize, 
first, the peculiar ability of strategic nuclear offensive forces to deliver 
devastating and even decisive attacks with little or no warning, and 
second, the advantage that an attacker would gain if he could destroy the 
U.S. strategic forces. Accordingly, a major condition of nuclear deterrence 
is the maintenance of second-strike retaliatory capabilities -- that is, 
forces which can reliably wait until an enemy has attacked before striking 
back. 
The reasons for this caution are worth remembering. Nuclear strikes 
have such unprecedented implications that they must never result from an 
accident, an unauthorized act, a misunderstanding, or a hasty conclusion 
that if they are not used, they will be lost. Under law, it is the 
responsibility of the President to decide when and how to use the nuclear 
forces of the United States. It is the responsibility of the Department of 
Defense, not to force his hand, but to ensure as far as possible that he 
can make this decision with deliberation and with the confidence that he 
knows the circumstance of the nuclear attack. 
68

Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
We take a number of measures to keep the probability of accidents and 
unauthorized acts extremely low. We also strive wherever possible to 
design U.S. forces so that, if necessary, they can actually absorb an 
enemy attack, rather than depend on warning for their survival, and strike 
back only after nuclear weapons have actually detonated. Until recently, 
ICBMs and SLBMs have been ideally suited to meet this design requirement: 
through a combination of mobility and concealment in the case of the SLBMs; 
through hardening in the case of the ICBMs. Since bombers are extremely 
soft and concentrated when on the ground, they cannot ride out an attack in 
the same way as ICBMs and SLBMs. We must keep some percentage of them in a 
high degree of alert, and depend on tactical warning to get the alert 
aircraft off their bases before incoming weapons arrive. Positive control 
measures then permit their recall after launch in the unlikely event that 
warning systems have given a false alarm, as is at least within the realm 
of possibility even with the advanced and complementary surveillance systems 
now available. In addition, we maintain the capability to keep a portion 
of the bomber force on continuous airborne alert if the need should arise. 
The President can obviously commit any or all of these three forces to 
their missions with or without warning of an attack. But his option to 
avoid pre-emption or a "launch on warning" of ballistic missiles (which 
cannot be recalled) should be preserved by ensuring that he does not have 
to commit the forces until he is confident a nuclear attack is in fact 
under way. To design otherwise would be to undermine deterrence by 
creating unnecessary fears of a first-strike which, in turn, could lead to 
instability in a crisis and increased risks of a nuclear war. 
D. The Triad 
The most efficient way to preserve a responsive, controllable, retaliatory 
capability is by means of a mixed force of ICBMs, SLBMs and bombers --
namely the Triad. Maintenance of a second-strike Triad continues to be 
justifiable on a number of grounds. First, history shows that no system, 
however ingeniously designed, is ever entirely invulnerable for an indefinite 
period of time. For most measures, there tend to be countermeasures. And 
the countermeasures may show up with little advance warning, especially 
when one of the contestants operates in a closed society. Considering the 
fundamental importance of the tasks assigned to the U.S. strategic retaliatory 
forces, it is not unduly conservative to maintain three capabilities with 
differing characteristics, differing challenges to an opponent bent on 
countering them, and differing rates at which their vulnerability is likely 
to become critical. To take a less conservative approach is to risk 
precisely the instabilities which arise from claims of "bomber gaps" 
and "missile gaps." The Triad minimizes those risks because when vulnerabilities 
do begin to appear, they can be dealt with in an orderly fashion rather 
than with costly crash programs.

SECRET 
Another advantage ot the Triad is that the three torces interact to 
promote the survivability ot them all. While the survivability ot the 
SLBMs does not depend directly on the ICBMs and bombers, the Soviets could 
concentrate much larger resources on countering ballistic missile submarines 
if they did not have to worry about the other two components. The ICBMs 
and bombers, on the other hand, interact strongly for their mutual benefit. 
A simultaneous attack against ICBMs and bombers through U.S. warning screens 
would enable the alert bombers to launch even if the ICBMs were withheld. 
An effort to slip under the warning screens and attack the bombers would 
give the ICBMs unambiguous evidence of the attack through the prior detonation 
of weapons on airfields. And any attempt to pin down the ICBMs while 
attacking the bombers would run into such delicate problems of communication 
and timing that it would risk triggering both forces. 
The Triad also provides major insurance against systems failures. The 
bombers are a thoroughly tested part of the Triad because they have 
experienced actual combat and fly daily. However. ICBMs and SLBMs are only 
fired on non-operational trajectories. Although we seek operational realism 
in test launches of our ICBMs, we have never launched them from operational 
silos. On two occasions, the Department has been denied the funds and the 
permission to tire the Minuteman ICBMs in this mode -- a practice the 
Soviets follow with some regularity. As a consequence, confidence in the 
three components of the Triad is uneven, and the possibility that some 
portions of the force might not perform as expected cannot be overlooked. 
As far as can be judged, however, there is virtually no probability that 
all three components would fail catastrophically. 
As long as the ABM Treaty is observed, the ICBMs and SLBMs surviving 
a Soviet first-strike should be reliable enough to reach and attack their 
targets. Bomber penetration is less certain, although the great majority 
of the bombers should reach their targets, and planned modernization of the 
force will preserve that confidence in the future. 
A second-strike by such a mixed force, approaching enemy targets at 
differing speeds, trajectories, and azimuths of attack, not only would 
complicate the problem ot the defense; it would also permit a particular 
target to be attacked with delivery systems and weapons of differing 
characteristics. Cross-targeting increases the probability that even after 
a highly effective enemy first-strike, and even atter some system failures, 
targets of importance to the enemy would come under attack from at least 
one element of the Triad. 
For all these reasons. I believe we must continue with a Triad of 
bombers, land-based missiles, and sea-based missiles. 
The overall size and composition of the Triad must necessarily depend 
on a variety of factors. l should point out in this connection that the 
peacetime inventory of delivery systems, weapons, and megatonnage is only 
one datum, and by itself not the most important, in indicating whether and

SECRET

Approved For Release 2002/08fitial-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
in what ways U.S. forces need to be strengthened. What counts from the 
standpoint of force planning is how much of a given peacetime inventory 
would survive a first-strike, penetrate the enemy's defenses, and destroy 
a designated set of targets. It matters very little if we have an 
arsenal of 3,000 delivery systems, 8,500 warheads, and thousands of 
megatons if only a few of those systems could survive a surprise attack 
and reach their targets. In the perspective of the force planner, if 200 
bombers need to reach their targets, attrition from defenses is estimated 
at 20 percent, and we maintain a peacetime alert-rate no higher than 50 
percent, the inventory would have to consist of at least 500 bombers. 
Depending on the system, peacetime inventories must always exceed the 
number of attacking systems, especially in the design of a second-strike 
posture. In short, a premium must be paid for the safety and stability 
of an assured retaliatory force. Such a premium should not be mistaken 
for overkill. 
E. Assured Retaliation 
Force size and composition will also be sensitive to the types of 
missions this retaliatory capability must perform. It is on this score, 
in fact, that the most significant issues arise concerning U.S. strategic 
nuclear forces. Widespread agreement exists that, at a minimum, the 
U.S. second-strike capability should be able to execute the mission of 
assured retaliation as the prime condition of deterrence. But even 
here, arguments persist as to specific targets and the damage to be 
assured. According to one approach, planners could simply target major 
cities, assume that population and industry are strongly correlated with 
them, and measure effectiveness as a function of the number of people 
killed and cities destroyed. Thus, as one example, prompt Soviet fatalities 
of about 30 percent and 200 cities destroyed would constitute a level of 
retaliation sufficient to assure deterrence. 
A different approach views assured retaliation as the effort to 
prevent or retard an enemy's military, political, and economic recovery 
from a nuclear exchange. Specific military forces and industries would 
be targeted. The effectiveness of the retaliation would be measured in 
two ways: 
-- by the size and composition of the enemy's military capability 
surviving for postwar use; 
-- by his ability to recover politically and economically from 
the exchange. 
If the Soviet Union could emerge from such an exchange with superior 
military power, and could recuperate from the effects more rapidly than 
the United States, the U.S. capability for assured retaliation would be 
considered inadequate.

3oth approaches can obviously be carried to absurd lengths. The 
point, however, is that whichever approach is taken, the number, yield, and 
Accuracy of the weapons needed in the U.S. inventory will depend to an 
-important degree on the level of damage required of the assured retaliation 
mission. The ability to destroy only 10 cities on a second-strike makes 
one kind of demand on the posture; the requirement to destroy 200 makes 
quite another. 
The present planning objective of the Defense Department is clear. We 
believe that a substantial number of military forces and critical industries 
fn the Soviet Union should be directly targeted and that an important 
objective of the assured retaliation mission should be to retard significantly 
the ability of the USSR to recover from a nuclear exchange and regain the 
status of a 20th-century military and industrial power more rapidly than 
the United States. 
This objective has been set for a number of reasons. With the growth 
And diversification of the Soviet economy, and with continued Soviet efforts 
to disperse and protect vital industries, the practice of simply targeting 
the largest cities might no longer produce the effects previously assumed. 
More specific and precisely designated aiming points are needed, especially 
ficir the lower-yield weapons now in the U.S. strategic inventory. The 
number of targets must be substantial because low levels of damage would 
not necessarily deter a desperate leadership, whereas high levels of damage 
and a low probability of recuperation might do so. Where the assured 
retaliation mission is concerned, any prospective enemy must understand at 
all times that the United States has a second-strike capability which can 
do him, not significant or serious, but virtually irreparable damage as a 
modern nation and great power. 
F. Options 
For some, a second-strike capability for counter-city retaliation is 
the essential and sole condition of strategic nuclear deterrence. To go 
beyond this minimal capability, as they see it, is to invite trouble: 
further competition, arms race and crisis instability, an increased risk of 
nuclear war, and a decreased probability of progress toward arms control 
and disarmament. For the United States, however, the deterrence of nuclear 
war requires a different approach than is embodied in the concept of counter-
city retaliation. 
Soviet Capabilities 
As previous Defense Reports have emphasized, the Soviet Union has now 
developed a strategic nuclear offensive capability of such size and diversity 
that a number of options must be taken into account. One could begin with 
an attack on the theater-based forces of the United States and its allies, 
atter which the Soviets might seek to defer retaliation with their large 
strategic nuclear reserve capability. Second, a creeping attack on SSBNs

at sea, selected military facilities in a theater, or even silos in the 
continental United States itself, could be launched to demonstrate their 
resolve and to force the United States into major concessions. A third 
example would be an attempt to destroy U.S. bombers and ICBMs, disrupt our 
command-control-communications, and avoid major damage to U.S. cities and 
people, while at the same time holding in reserve a large follow-on capability 
targeted against other U.S. assets and available for successive waves of 
attack. Such a campaign would not necessarily disarm the United States, 
but it could leave us with only the forces and the plans for partial 
coverage of the enemy target system. With them, the United States might 
be able to cause heavy damage to the industrial base of the Soviet Union 
and even to its people. But the withheld Soviet force would be able to do 
equal or greater damage to an equivalent target system in the United States. 
2. The Problem of Deterrence 
The credibility of a deterrent based solely on the capability and 
doctrine of counter-city retaliation, however large or small the programmed 
response, is likely to be low in the face of such contingencies. The 
Soviets might be skeptical about the threat contained in such a posture, 
and inclined to test U.S. resolve to defend allies by these means. Even 
though we might delude ourselves about the credibility of the threat under 
normal peacetime conditions, we might find that we were more deterred by it 
than the Russians in a crisis. 
These examples admittedly raise contingencies which, as far as can 
be judged, have a low probability of occurrence. However, we should not 
forget the risks that accompanied the Soviet deployment of missiles to Cuba 
in the autumn of 1962. And, even the surprise attack everyone agrees should 
be deterred tends to fall into this same category oE low probability and 
high risk. Why then should the United States be any less concerned about 
equally rational and more limited attacks? 
3. Options and Escalation 
Less than full attack contingencies raise enormous uncertainties. We 
are totally lacking in any relevant experience of them. Yet we know that 
once nuclear weapons are used, calamity of an unprecedented nature will 
lurk in the wings. In these circumstances, even if the probability of 
nuclear escalation is high, it seems appropriate to have available for the 
President some options rather than only the full response of assured retaliation. 
Accordingly, the U.S. posture should include the ability both to implement 
some preplanned options and to improvise responses to events not anticipated 
in contingency planning. 
4. Options and Hard Targets 
It should be evident that once the possibility of some options is 
admitted, the range of targets becomes wide. Many targets important to a

SECRET 
tlociety's economy and political system are separated to some degree from 
heavy concentrations of people. That tends also to be the case with a 
number of military targets, including general purpose as well as strategic 
nuclear facilities. To attack relatively soft targets, and to minimize 
collateral damage, relatively low-yield weapons with high accuracies are 
required. In previous years, because of these considerations, it has been 
U.S. policy to seek improved command and control, higher accuracy, and an 
increased variety of warhead yieldsin order to implement an effective 
range of options. 
Uast year I stated we would be making system improvements such as 
increased accuracy so as to ensure that any attack could be met by a 
deliberate and credible response. Certainly the need for more than 
a limited hard-target-kill capability was not foreseen. The costs of such 
a capability are substantial, in part because the phenomenon of fratricide 
timits the number of weapons that can be usefully applied to a hard target 
and therefore imposes heavy demands for accuracy, reliability, and command-
control. A major effort to acquire a comprehensive hard-target-kill capability 
is likely to raise apprehensions about crisis and arms race stability. 
The United States has continued to hope that the Soviets would have a 
similar outlook and comparable concerns. Today, however, it is much 
less certain that they see the wisdom of abstaining from comprehensive 
hard-target-kill capability. Not only have they failed to give serious 
consideration to U.S. proposals for reductions in throw-weight; they are 
actually in the process of increasing their own throw-weight by a substantial 
amount. In addition, they are taking rapid improvements in the accuracy of 
their ICBMs, and they could have a reload capability for some of those 
tCBMs which can be cold-launched (that is, popped out of their silos prior 
to ignition), permitting reuse of the silos. 
It is uncertain how rapidly these programs will come to fruition. But 
there is now an increasing probability that before the mid-1980s, the 
Soviets could have the capability, with a small fraction of their ICBMs, to 
destroy a substantial portion of the Minuteman/Titan force as well as 
non-alert bombers and submarines in port. This potential would in no way 
give the Soviets a disarming first-strike. But it could enable them to 
create a dangerous asymmetry. As previous Defense Reports have emphasized, 
much of the U.S. capability for deliberate, controlled, selective responses 
resides in the Minuteman force. If much of that force were eliminated, 
the Soviets would preserve their flexibility while that of the United 
States would be substantially reduced. The Kremlin would still have 
options; the choices open to a President would be limited. 
This is not an acceptable prospect. It would be preferable to see the 
life of the fixed ICBM forces on both sides prolonged a good deal longer. 
Nventually, however, even with foreseeable arms control measures, improvements 
in accuracy combined with large throw-weights could make such systems 
unreliable as second-strike forces. But additional time in which to

negotiate and make deliberate decisions about reasonable substitutes would 
be valuable. That is the course the United States would still like to see 
both sides follow. But, we cannot permit the major degradation in the 
Triad that the growing Soviet capabilities threaten. And the United States 
must not permit the development of a major asymmetry in potential outcomes, 
with all the political and military hazards accompanying such a prospect.

If the life of the fixed, hard ICBMs cannot be extended, then 
stability requires both sides to improve their land-based forces enough 
so they they are more difficult to target by the other side. The United 
States should not accept a strategic relationship in which we must bear 
the heavier costs of alternative basing while the Soviets are allowed 
the luxury of retaining their fixed ICBMs. Since high accuracies can be 
built into mobile as well as fixed systems, the Soviet leadership should 
be aware that if the United States moves toward mobility, the Soviets will 
have strong incentives to go mobile as well. 
5. Options and First-Strike

acting provocatively, or threatening stability. The Congress will surely

SECRET 
tecognize that it is the Soviet Union and not the United States which has 
taken the initiative in creating this prospect. Members will also notice 
that the same critics who oppose the necessary U.S. countermeasures argue 
that the strategic nuclear balance is stable, not delicate, and that major 
asymmetries do not matter. Perhaps critics can live with these inconsistencies. 
The United States cannot. 
The U.S. position is straightforward and consistent. We do not believe 
either side can achieve a serious, high-confidence, disarming first-strike 
capability, and we do not seek to attain one. To that extent, the strategic 
auclear balance can be said to he stable. But significant asymmetries in 
the outcome of a strategic nuclear exchange can be created, and these 
asymmetries could give -- and would be seen to have given -- a meaningful 
advantage to one side over the other. As long as so much of the U.S. 
capability for flexibility is invested in the ICBM force, and as long as 
some options continue to he desirable, such an asymmetry could arise if one 
side eliminated most of the other's ICBMs. The United States should not 
permit that eventuality to develop. 
Options and Stability 
This line of reasoning, tends to be opposed only by those who, despite 
Lhe evidence, cling to the view that there is only one condition of stability, 
namely mutual assured destruction; that the Soviets faithfully subscribe to 
that doctrine; and that the Kremlin will respond cooperatively to U.S, 
restraint. The same opponents contend that any options are provocative 
and increase the probability of nuclear war. More or less simultaneously, 
they assert that having options (and the limits on destruction implied by 
them) is infeasible because any nuclear exchange is bound to escalate to 
an all-out attack on cities, and because the collateral damage from nuclear 
detonations on military targets, especially hard targets, would make even a 
limited exchange indistinguishable from an all-out conflict. The conclusion 
C.TOM this reasoning is inexorable: the maintenance of options is both 
destabilizing and infeasible. Presumably, the prospective loss of the U.S. 
capability need be of no concern, while any threat to a comparable Soviet 
capability is provocative. 
This is not a persuasive position. It depends upon assumptions about 
soviet beliefs and behavior that are not borne out by the facts. It applies 
different standards of conduct to the United States than to the Soviet 
Union. And it is inconsistent. None of the allegations -- about the 
provocative and damaging consequences of options -- have any basis in 
experience. U.S. strategic plans have contained options for many years, 
yet no one has been provoked or tempted in a crisis. Indeed, to attach 
such importance to options, which are little different from other contingency 
plans, is to ignore how decisions about peace and war are made. Far more 
Important than options in the choice of capabilities is the degree of U.S. 
conventional strength. If the nuclear threshold has been kept high, con-
ventional responses will be given first priority in a crisis (at least

by the United States) regardless of whether nuclear options are available. 
Experience should make that evident. 
7. Options and Collateral Damage 
As for the argument that anything less than a full-scale response 
would be indistinguishable from direct attacks on population, data and 
analyses indicate the contrary. In every case considered, both the short-
term and the longer-run collateral damage from attacks on a comprehensive 
list of military targets (including ICBM silos) has been dramatically lower 
than the fatalities from direct attacks on population targets. It must be 
emphasized, however, that the results, even in limited and controlled 
exchanges, could be appalling. They could involve the potential for millions 
of fatalities, even though the distinction between 10 million and 100 
million fatalities is great and worth preserving. No U.S. decision-maker 
is likely to be tempted by this prospect, especially in view of the dangers 
of nuclear escalation. 
It is no inconsistency to recognize those dangers and still see the 
desirability of having some options short of full retaliation. The other 
side is fully capable of inventing and considering options. And precisely 
because we are uncertain about the course and ultimate consequence of a 
nuclear exchange beginning with less than a full response, surely all 
would want to avoid bringing about a holocaust by U.S. actions and would 
want any President to have at least the option to respond in a deliberate 
and controlled fashion. Just as surely, if such were actually to be 
the U.S. response in the terrible event of an attack, it is a response that 
must be available for the purposes of deterrence. To depend on irrational 
behavior by the Soviets, and to depend equally on an irrational response by 
us, is to put nuclear deterrence in double jeopardy. The Soviets, by 
their activities, indicate that they are not interested in mutual assured 
destruction. Accordingly, they must be accepted for what they are, not for 
what we want them to be. Their actions indicate that they take nuclear war 
seriously; the United States must do no less. Part of taking it seriously 
is responses short of full-scale retaliation in our strategic nuclear 
capabilities. It is a condition of stable deterrence. 
G. Equivalence 
Satisfaction of the fundamental requirements of second-strike 
survivability, Triad insurance, assured retaliation, and options should 
ensure stable deterrence under most circumstances. These requirements, in 
fact, underlie the current U.S. strategic nuclear posture. There is, 
however, one other factor we must consider in our planning. 
It is generally recognized that world stability depends to a remarkable 
extent on the strength of the U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately, 
not everyone assesses the effectiveness of that deterrent in the same way. 
It is the subject of many and differing perceptions which, in turn, can

affect the behavior of prospective enemies, allies, neutrals, and attentive 
publics in the United States itself. If friends see the balance as favoring 
the Soviet Union rather than the United States, their independence and 
firmness may give way to adjustment, accommodation, and subordination. If 
potential enemies have a similar perception, they could misjudge the situation 
and make demands leading to confrontation, crisis, and unnecessary dangers. 
if domestic audiences see real or imaginary imbalances, they could insist 
on excessive and costly crash programs to restore the equilibrium. One has 
only to recall the reaction of Mao Tse-tung to the appearances of Soviet 
missile superiority after the Sputnik demonstrations, and the response in 
the United States to charges of a "missile gap," to recognize the impact of 
such perceptions on international affairs. 
however much one might wish otherwise, popular and even some governmental 
perceptions of the strategic nuclear balance tend to be influenced less by 
detailed analyses than by such static indicators of relative nuclear 
strengths as launchers, warheads, megatonnage, accuracy, throw-weight and 
the like. If all or most of these indicators were to favor the Soviet 
Union, a number of observers might conclude that the United States was not 
equivalent to the USSR in strategic power and that the balance was now 
weighted in favor of the Soviet Union. 
It is to be hoped that, in designing the U.S. strategic posture to 
meet the requirements of adequate and stable deterrence, the perception as 
well as the reality of a strong deterrent will be created. U.S. programs 
of research and development should be expected to be, and be seen to be, 
sufficient to offset the dynamism of the Soviet Union in this realm. But 
to the extent that rough equivalence is not credited to the United States 
im these two respects, actions to create the necessary perception of equivalence 
could be required. 
At the present time, it is widely agreed that the United States is 
seen as having "rough equivalence" with the Soviet Union, even though, up 
to now, we have not added to our strategic posture for that purpose. The 
United States should also continue to stress the effectiveness of its 
strategic forces in the performance of their missions as the basis for 
:udging their adequacy. But the Congress and common sense require that 
the United States not be inferior to the Soviet Union, and the Vladivostok 
Understanding postulates equality between the two sides in central offensive 
systems. Accordingly, U.S. plans and programs for future U.S. offensive 
capabilities must be geared to those of the USSR.

Whatever the influence of rough equivalence on U.S. force planning, it 
is occasionally asserted these days that a powerful factor affecting the 
U.S. strategic posture is a distorted view of arms control held by the 
Defense Department. The allegation imputes to DoD an exploitation of every 
loophole in existing agreements to develop exotic and unnecessary weapons 
and drive the strategic force structure up rather than down. Arms control 
negotiations and agreements, at least in their present form, are alleged to be 
counterproductive in that they create demands for bargaining chips subsequently 
converted into legitimized weapons programs. Just as bad, by this theory, 
are the safeguards demanded by the Defense Department as the "price" for 
endorsement of pending arms control agreements, since they, too, allegedly 
can turn into entering wedges for further weapons developments. 
Such charges might better be. directed at the Soviet Union. Certainly 
they are wide of the mark when aimed at the United States. The idea of 
bargaining chips is not new; it was not invented in our lifetimes. For

example, in 1966, President Johnson began to use the ABM defense system as 
a negotiating counter. In fact, despite its cost, the ABM "chip" did not 
serve the United States badly. An ABM treaty would hardly have been signed 
without it. It should be remembered, moreover, that weapons can only be 
effective as bargaining chips if there is a serious need for the weapon 
system in the U.S. strategic inventory. To develop systems simply to throw 
them on the negotiating table would be folly. The Soviets would not pay 
anything to stop them. U.S. policy is to develop only those weapon systems 
for which there is a justifiable military need. Serious programs thus may 
become bargaining chips and be affected in their development and deployment 
by arms control considerations. What are seen merely as bargaining chips 
will, not become serious programs, nor will they be effective bargaining 
chips. 
Tt is worth recalling that the United States has been able to detect 
and investigate a number of questionable practices on the part of the 
Soviets since 1972. U.S. monitoring of agreements has been adequate so 
far. This reasonable level of confidence in national means of verification 
is likely to decline, however, to the extent that the Soviets attempt to 
conceal or disguise their programs, and if SALT negotiations attempt to 
control the more qualitative, as opposed to quanitative features of strategic 
arms. In these circumstances, it makes sense to take account of the 
possibilities for cheating, the possible failure of complex negotiations. 
or even the sudden abrogation of agreements, followed by a rapid Soviet 
deployment of systems previously banned or controlled. 
Arms control considerations do have an impact on strategic force 
planning. The United States is committed to abide by existing and pending 
SALT agreements. Strategic stability is considered next to deterrence in 
force planning, and the United States has sought to preserve stability in 
the presence of highly dynamic technology. But it must be recognized 
that precisely because technology is dynamic, the contributions of arms 
control to stability may well be modest, and may be overtaken on occasion 
by events. 
Even under more hospitable conditions than now exist, arms control 
aegotiations and agreements could not be expected to substitute completely 
for unilateral force planning or remove all the uncertainties with which 
that planning is so centrally concerned. Given the attitudes of the 
USSR toward war-fighting and stability -- which differ from ours -- the 
results of arms control negotiations are bound to be limited. Accordingly, 
the United States must continue its efforts in SALT while supporting them 
with prudent unilateral planning to ensure the continuing credibility of 
the deterrent and the maintenance of stability. 
Damage-Limiting 
One of the main uncertainties at the present time is the extent to 
which the Soviets are developing a major damage-limiting capability. Since

Approved For Release 2002/08/21SECRINDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
the concept of damage-limiting has not received much attention for some 
time, it is useful to set out the range of damage-limiting strategies. 
The most modest strategy attempts to limit the damage from attacks 
directed against military and other targets not directly associated with 
population. It does so primarily through fallout shelters and the 
evacuation of people from exposed target-areas. The most ambitious 
strategy dictates a first-strike capability against an enemy's strategic 
offensive forces which seeks to destroy as much of his megatonnage as 
possible before it can be brought into play. An enemy's residual retaliation, 
assumed to be-directed against urban-industrial targets, would be blunted 
still further by a combination of active and passive defenses, including 
ASW, ABMs, anti-bomber defenses, civil defense, stockpiles of food and 
other essentials, and even the dispersal and hardening of essential 
industry. 
Most damage-limiting strategies represent an effort by one belligerent 
to maximize damage to his enemy and minimize it to himself. The assumption 
behind such strategies is that, if major asymmetries in damage can be 
achieved, one side (the "winner") will survive as a functioning nation 
while the other will not. Thus, the outcome of damage-limiting campaigns 
can in some sense be measured in terms of the ability of the two belligerents 
to recuperate from such barbaric attacks. However, the techniques 
currently used to assess the post-attack powers of recuperation of the two 
sides are analytically weak and plagued with uncertainties. Key 
decision-makers, in any event, are not likely to be very interested in the 
possibility that the Soviet Union could restore its prewar Gross National 
Product in 10 years, while it would take the United States twice as long 
to achieve the same result. 
The most modest approach to damage-limiting would not attempt to 
protect urban-industrial targets from direct attacks. Consequently, 
it would not seriously jeopardize an opponent's capability for assured 
retaliation. The most ambitious approach, with its emphasis on active 
and passive defenses for both population and industry, would obviously 
try to minimize the effects of assured retaliation. In the United 
States, such a strategy has been seen, therefore, as a major stimulus 
to the strategic arms competition and a guarantee of instability. 
The United States has never gone very far down the road of damage-
limiting. Opposition to that strategy has been sharp, and there have 
been other reasons for stopping short in such an endeavor. The problems 
of eliminating any enemy's entire strategic nuclear force by offensive 
means have grown increasingly difficult with the years, and further 
investments toward that end have always shown rapidly diminishing returns 
to scale. Moreover, once SALT limited ABM deployments to one site, 
little seemed feasible against the large, early-warning Soviet missile 
force, and little worth doing against the small, late-arriving Soviet 
bomber force. Emphasis therefore shifted from the elaborate dedicated

continental air defenses popular in the 1950s to early warning, surveillance 
and peacetime control of American airspace, and development of a mobile, 
itghter-defense force based on AWACS. The advantage of the mobile force 
is that, while it is intended primarily for defense of a theater overseas, 
;.t. would be based in the United States and could be committed to continental 
air defense in an emergency. With the emergence of the Soviet Backfire 
le continued development of this dual-purpose force seems particularly 
appropriate. 
With the emphasis on active defenses substantially reduced, it was 
considered almost pointless to advocate a major program of passive 
defenses centered on blast shelters. Only a modest fallout shelter 
program has been provided as what amounts to a hedge against limited 
attacks on military and non-collocated economic targets -- attacks which 
would not be directed at major urban-industrial centers but which could 
produce serious short-term fallout effects on nearby concentrations of 
people. 
in sum, U.S. policy for some years has been to avoid the development 
of large first-strike forces and major damage-limiting capabilities 
through active and passive defenses. Restraint in both areas, it was 
hoped, would demonstrate to the Soviets that the United States did not 
tntend to threaten their capability for assured destruction, and that, 
accordingly, their basic security was not endangered by the U.S. deterrent 
posture. But such restraint cannot long be unilateral; it must be 
reciprocated. Any effort by the Soviets to erode the U.S. capability 
for assured retaliation by means of major damage-limiting measures must 
Jead to adjustments on our part to maintain a credible deterrent. 
Requirements 
It is with all these factors, assumptions, and objectives in mind 
that, over the years, the United States has adopted a strategy of flexible 
nuclear response and arrived at a strategic nuclear posture consisting 
of: 
-- A high-confidence Triad of second-strike retaliatory forces 
within the Vladivostok Understanding of 2,400 strategic nuclear delivery 
vehicles; 
-- Around 8,500 warheads on delivery vehicles for adequate coverage 
of all relevant mission targets, even after the attrition suffered from 
an enemy first-strike and from the penetration of his defenses; 
-- A single ABM site on inactive status except for its Perimeter 
Acquisition Radar (PAR) and a light dedicated air defense to provide 
surveillance and peacetime control of U.S. airspace and prevent a "free 
ride" over the North American continent;

THEATER NUCLEAR FORCES 
ft has been convenient for analytic purposes to separate nuclear 
systems that fit into the strategic Triad from those directly supporting 
Lactical operations -- commonly referred to as theater nuclear forces --
and those with more narrow defensive applications, such as antisubmarine 
warfare (ASW) and antiair warfare (AAW) weapons. In reality, nuclear 
systems provide a continuum of capabilities. As part of that continuum, 
Lheater nuclear forces constitute a major capability in the defense 
posture of the United States. Despite some controversy about them, the 
arguments justifying their existence continue to be persuasive. 
A_ Functions 
since the detonation of the first Soviet atomic device, there has 
aeen a growing recognition that U.S. strategic nuclear forces would not 
be able to bear the entire burden of credible deterrence by themselves. 
Some may have questioned that judgment in the past; no serious person 
doubts it today. The need for other forces to provide a credible response 
to contingencies less than a direct strategic attack on the United 
States or its allies is no longer an issue. Clearly, theater nuclear 
:orces must constitute a part of that spectrum of deterrence and response. 
Further, as strategic nuclear forces have become less dependent on 
overseas basing, adequate U.S. theater nuclear forces must be available 
as part of the deterrent. It has been generally accepted that the 
theater nuclear forces are not interchangeable with U.S. and allied con-
ventional forces, and that nuclear firepower is no convenient substitute 
for manpower on the ground. But there should be no question about their 
finportance as a backup to strong conventional defenses and as a major 
hedge against a failure of those defenses. 
The United States has never ruled out a first use of nuclear weapons. 
If an enemy, whether by stealth and deception or by large-scale mobiliza-
tion, should attempt to defeat U.S. and allied conventional forces, it 
is NATO and U.S. policy to take whatever action is necessary to restore 
the situation. Thus, the theater nuclear forces provide a source of 
options and flexibility that would be difficult and perhaps inadvisable 
to incorporate exclusively into strategic nuclear forces. Accordingly, 
to the extent that a nuclear response may be required locally, theater 
nuclear forces have an indispensable function to perform in defense and 
deterrence. 
1erhaps most important of all, because other nations -- and most 
particularly the Soviet Union -- have developed theater nuclear capa-
bilities, a U.S. deployment of such forces is required to deter and if 
necessary counter them. The United States no longer has the choice of 
whether or not to deploy strategic or theater nuclear capabilities.

B. Foreign Capabilities 
It is true that the United States set the example in the deployment 
of theater nuclear forces. Postwar planners clearly misjudged the 
length of the U.S. nuclear monopoly and the amount of time it would take 
the Soviets to acquire theater nuclear forces of their own. Neither the 
value of stolen secrets nor the level of Soviet investment was fully 
anticipated. The size of the Soviet conventional forces oriented toward 
Europe was overestimated. At the same time, it was assumed that the less 
costly theater nuclear firepower could make up for shortfalls in NATO 
manpower, and that there would be an enduring U.S. advantage in tactical 
nuclear forces. But as early as 1956, the Soviets began deploying MRBMs 
and nuclear-capable light and medium bombers. Nuclear-capable missiles 
organic to the ground forces were deployed to Soviet forces by the early 
1960s. Today it is estimated that the Soviets have, or soon will have, a 
nuclear artillery capability, and their theater nuclear forces contain a 
greater variety of missile delivery systems and more launchers (including 
those based in the USSR) than those of the United States. The current 
Soviet capability ranges from the variable-range ICBMs (SS-11, SS-13, SS-
17, SS-19) and the new SS-X-20 (described in the strategic section) to 
short-range tactical rockets deployed with Soviet forces in the Far East 
as well as in Eastern Europe and with other Warsaw Pact units. All in 
all, so large and diversified is this capability that it has become 
difficult to deduce the target system used by the Soviets to justify it. 
Much of this force is based outside the NATO Guidelines Area; accord-
ingly, it does not come within the purview of the negotiations on Mutual 
and Balanced Force Reductions. This is disturbing because the Soviets 
continue not only to maintain and modernize their force, but also to 
articulate a military doctrine which permits an early use of nuclear 
weapons in a European war -- initiated either by NATO to avert a conventional 
defeat, or by the Warsaw Pact to pre-empt NATO first use. On balance, 
however, the Soviets would seemingly prefer to wage a purely conventional 
campaign in Western Europe; they appear to see their growing theater 
nuclear capabilities both as a deterrent and as a counter-capability to 
the nuclear forces of NATO. 
The USSR is not the only other nation besides the United States with 
theater nuclear forces. The PRC officially entered the nuclear lists 
only in 1964. But it has now deployed a medium-bomber force of 77 Tu-
16s which is nuclear-capable, and a small complement of MRBMs and IRBMs. 
We also believe that the Chinese are now conducting a research and development 
effort to acquire nuclear weapons of various yields along with differing 
types of delivery means for direct support of their ground forces. This 
effort underlines the possibility that any major clash between the Soviet 
Union and the PRC could involve nuclear weapons at an early stage. For 
the foreseeable future, however, Soviet tactical nuclear forces will 
greatly outnumber those of the PRC.

SECRET 
This is not the only possibility for nuclear conflict. Other 
nations continue to show a strong interest in acquiring theater nuclear 
forces; India already may have a small nuclear capability. Both Great 
Britain and France have long-standing nuclear capabilities against 
targets in Central Europe as well as in the USSR. Not only is the 
United States obliged to maintain major theater nuclear forces in these 
lifficult circumstances; we must also recognize that neither we nor the 
Soviets are any longer necessarily the sole judges of where, when, and 
how nuclear weapons will be used. To pretend that by unilateral restraint 
alone, the United States can control this situation or decide whether 
other nations will deploy nuclear weapons in a sensitive and important 
region of the world is to ignore the realities, however unpleasant they 
may he. 
Foreign nuclear capabilities are bound to have an impact on the 
size and composition of U.S. theater forces. But here as elsewhere, the 
goal is not to make U.S. forces a mirror-image of what others deploy. 
Tnstead, planners must consider what is needed as a function of specific 
itheaters, threats, contingencies, and missions. And because accidents, 
unauthorized acts and terrorist activities must be of concern where 
nuclear weapons are involved, we must ensure that security and control 
over the necessary nuclear warheads are maintained with high confidence 
at all times. 
Contingencies 
The main planning contingencies to consider in determining a preferred 
dheater nuclear posture are an attack by the Warsaw Pact in Central 
Europe and an offensive launched against South Korea by North Korean 
forces logistically reinforced from the outside. Enough nuclear warheads 
should be maintained for both theaters, since the weapons required for 
the one would not be available for the other. For planning purposes, an 
Assumption is made that a U.S. decision to use theater nuclear forces 
would be determined either by an overwhelming enemy conventional break-
ihrough or by his first use of nuclear weapons. 
Within the framework of these planning contingencies, a number of 
actors determine the conditions of deterrence and hence an appropriate 
U.S. theater nuclear posture. Since planning allows for the possibility 
::hat an enemy might strike first with theater nuclear forces, U.S. 
1.apahilities must be sufficiently survivable to absorb such an attack 
ond still have enough sufficient surviving launchers and weapons of the 
appropriate yields to perform their assigned missions. This means not 
only a proper mix of forces, but also -- because of the relatively short 
distances between opposing battlefield systems -- an emphasis for surviva-
bility on mobility and concealment. Sophisticated and survivable command-
control-communications networks are an integral part of these forces 
as well.

D. Missions and Forces 
The types of missions assigned to the theater nuclear forces will 
have a major impact on their size and composition. It is noteworthy in 
this connection that all of the U.S. theater nuclear forces are programmed 
against military targets. In fact, although there is no less interest in 
deterrence and stability here than in the strategic realm, the United 
States plans its theater nuclear forces on the basis of warfighting 
missions. Both the posture and the contingency plans place proper emphasis 
on restraint rather than on indiscriminate damage, and on the achievement 
of traditional military and political objectives, rather than on the 
destruction of an enemy's society. 
The principal missions needed to achieve these traditional ends are: 
-- limited nuclear strikes designed to destroy selectively important, 
fixed military targets and at the same time demonstrate a determination 
to resist the enemy's attack by whatever means necessary; 
-- regional nuclear strikes intended, as one example, to destroy 
an attacking enemy force before it achieves a major breakthrough; 
-- and theaterwide strikes directed at counter-air and counter-
missile targets, lines of communication, and troop concentrations both at 
the front and in reserve. 
Various methods exist for computing the number of theater nuclear 
weapons needed to perform these missions with an acceptable level of 
confidence. Owing to the transient nature of many tactical targets, the 
most reasonable approach is to develop options keyed to likely military 
targets -- such as ground force units, airfields, bridges, or ships --
and determine the number of weapons required to achieve a high probability 
of significant damage to them on a second-strike. It is on this basis 
that consideration should be given to whether the number of nuclear 
weapons deployed to key theaters and at sea is sufficient for the performance 
of the three vital main missions of the theater nuclear forces. 
E. Modernization 
Numbers alone, however, do not provide a satisfactory basis for 
judging the adequacy of the theater nuclear forces. Since it is policy 
to minimize collateral damage in any theater nuclear employment, an effort 
is made to tailor warheads and delivery systems to their targets, and 
to plan the use of yields no greater than necessary for the destruction 
of designated targets. As nuclear and guidance technologies advance, 
lower yields can be incorporated into the theater nuclear forces. Where 
it is done, there is neither a plan nor an intention to blur or erase 
the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. The objective 
has been and remains to increase kill probabilities, reduce collateral

damage, and economize in the use of scarce nuclear materials. 
Some opposition, even now, remains both to the current theater 
nuclear posture and to its modernization. Some critics question the 
feasibility of conducting a theater nuclear campaign resembling a con-
ventional conflict in any way, and doubt that the damage from such a 
campaign could be kept below catastrophic levels. They express skepticism 
about the stability of less than theaterwide nuclear options; they 
suggest that any use of nuclear weapons would escalate rapidly to a 
strategic nuclear exchange. With these reservations in mind, proposals 
are made to reduce the U.S. overseas deployments of nuclear weapons and 
to halt any procurement of the newer generation of nuclear weapons. 
The difficulty with these proposals is that they seem to treat as 
known what is intrinsically uncertain. That theater nuclear warfare 
would resemble a traditional conflict can be described as a contradiction 
in terms: damage might be unprecedented; chaos could ensue; rapid escala-
tion might follow. But the fact is, we do not know what the outcome 
would be. Therefore, as long as theater nuclear capabilities exist --
and hardly anyone in a position of responsibility favors unilaterally 
doing away with them -- the United States must surely insist on exercising 
control over them and having the option to use them in as selective and 
deliberate a manner as possible. Uncertainty is no excuse for irresponsibility 
and the possibility of disaster is no reason to make certain that it 
occurs. 
Just as there are risks in most things, there are some risks associated 
with the maintenance of non-central systems. But most of those systems 
are dual-purpose, and there would be a need to deploy them with or 
without nuclear weapons. in any event, the current Soviet nuclear 
threat makes clear that there are serious risks in rejecting deployed 
theater nuclear forces. Opponents could be tempted by their absence; 
allies would question their own and U.S. capabilities. Greater flexibility 
may be desirable in designing the characteristics of the U.S. theater 
nuclear posture; but the basis for the posture itself should not be in 
serious question. 
To say this, and to recognize the importance of retaining our own 
and allied confidence in U.S. theater nuclear capabilities, is not to 
argue that the current posture should remain forever immutable. It 
cannot. If U.S. defense capabilities and the deterrent are to remain 
strong, periodic modernization is essential. A case in point is the 
stockpile of atomic demolition munitions (ADMs), which can be emplaced as 
nuclear barriers. It is characteristic of the current generation of ADMs 
that if they are subject to acceptable peacetime security and wartime 
control, they are unlikely, without prepositioning, to be emplaced 
in a timely enough fashion to be militarily useful. To take other 
instances, nuclear air defense and ASW weapons have warheads which may 
increase the probability of destroying aircraft and submarines once

these targets are identified, tracked, and pinpointed. But their overall 
probability of kill is not necessarily greater than that of their non-
nuclear counterparts. Since these weapons are expensive in terms of 
nuclear material which could be effectively used for other purposes, we 
should periodically modernize the force. Where newer weapons are more 
efficient than their predecessors, they should be substituted in the 
stockpiles -- overseas as elsewhere -- for older weapons. The test of 
deterrence must not be the overall number, but the utility and capability 
of the overall force. 
Allies deserve to see the U.S. determination to collaborate in 
their defense by available means. Critics are entitled to know that the 
currently deployed nuclear forces are not simply dangerous relics from a 
previous decade. Friend and foe, supporter and skeptic, need to recognize 
that U.S. theater nuclear forces, even though they may evolve in size and 
composition as technology advances, constitute an integral part of the 
overall U.S. deterrent.

Kl. CONVENTIONAL FORCES 
HOW we see the relative strength and dynamism of the two superpowers 
depends on judgments or intuitions about the nuclear balance. This nuclear 
preoccupation is heightened by official and academic fascination with the 
technology and strategy of central systems. At the same time, nuclear 
equivalence, combined with the uncertainties which surround the consequences 
of nuclear conflict, has led to a revived awareness of the importance of 
conventional military power. 
Increasingly in the West, and probably in the East as well, nuclear 
Corces are seen as credibly deterring only a limited -- although potentially 
devastating -- number of hostile acts. The main burden of deterrence has 
once again fallen on the conventional forces. Assessments of where nations 
stand in the international hierarchy of power may be made according to 
auclear criteria (and frequently inadequate criteria at that). But with 
the reality of rough equivalence in nuclear forces, gains and losses in the 
international arena are largely determined by conventional military power, 
will, and resolve. To complete the paradox, conventional military power 
obtains authority from the nuclear capabilities underlying it. The two 
basic forces are in this sense inseparable, although the history of the 
past 30 years indicates that, so long as alliances hold firm, it is not 
necessary for each member alone to maintain the full spectrum of nuclear 
and conventional capabilities adequate to the total task. A division of 
tabor has developed. Only the two superpowers have been obliged to carry 
the burden and responsibility of covering the entire range of modern military 
power. 
A. The Utility of Conventional Forces 
Acceptance of this paradox, and of the revived importance of conventional 
Alilitary power, has not gone unchallenged. Questions continue to arise 
about the need to maintain major conventional capabilities. Since the 
burden is heavy -- conventional forces take nearly 70 percent of the 
current U.S. defense budget -- these questions deserve consideration. 
rhree in particular are fundamental to decisions about the size and composition 
of U.S. conventional capabilities: 
Pirst, are the risks and uncertainties any fewer in a conventional 
than in a nuclear engagement, or is escalation just as probable and non-
nuclear capabilities simply a small but costly way-station on the road to 
the nuclear war? 
Second, whatever the controllability of conventional conflict, 
what is the feasibility of balancing the large, manpower-intensive, con-
ventional forces of prospective opponents? 
Third, is it even desirable for the United States to maintain a 
large conventional capability? Will it deter, or will it weaken deterrence

by its very presence, tempt decision-makers, and draw us into wars at the 
wrong place or the wrong time? 
Absolute answers to these questions are not available. No empirical 
basis exists for comparing the nuclear with the conventional forces 
simply because nuclear weapons have not been used since World War II. 
There are a number of reasons, nonetheless, why a conflict begun at the 
non-nuclear level seems less likely to end in a strategic nuclear exchange 
than one which starts with nuclear weapons. The conventional campaign --
even if one thinks of it as a fuse -- has much further to burn than its 
nuclear counterpart before the greatest risks and uncertainties are reached. 
And the spark must cross the nuclear barrier. That barrier, or threshold, 
has now stood for more than 30 years. The precedent is an important one. 
It seems reasonable to assume that it can continue as a major obstacle to 
escalation in the foreseeable future. For this reason alone, conventional 
warfare should be less escalatory -- at least as long as the United States 
and its allies keep adequate conventional capabilities on hand. 
Equally important, we understand conventional warfare, and have been 
engaged in two conventional wars since World War II, both without violent 
escalation. The Soviet Union was not directly involved in either. But by 
and large, it seems plausible to believe that non-nuclear wars will remain 
more controllable than any nuclear counterpart. Their tempo is likely to 
be somewhat slower, so that policymakers are under less pressure to make 
momentous decisions. Sanctuaries can be tolerated more easily, and other 
limitations on the conflict can be more readily defined and accepted. 
Damage to the societies of the belligerents can be better controlled and, 
as a consequence, war aims kept more manageable. Guarantees cannot be 
given that conventional warfare will be controllable in the future, but 
its salient features are such that there is certainly a higher probability 
of limiting it than a nuclear campaign. 
The feasibility of countering the main conventional challenges of the 
future appears to be less open to doubt, despite much conventional wisdom 
to the contrary. Admittedly the number, variety, and sophistication of 
conventional probes may increase as the traditional international order 
evolves, as modern conventional weapon technology proliferates, and as 
certain nations become more venturesome because of nuclear equivalence. 
But it is reasonable to suppose that if the United States and its allies 
can meet the conventional challenge of the Soviet Union and its satellites, 
they can deal with any of the lesser threats that might arise. The problem, 
from the standpoint of feasibility, can thus be defined as the Warsaw Pact 
with particular emphasis on the Soviet Union.

However, the zeal to underscore the serious military challenge we face 
from Moscow should not cause the opposite mistake of describing the 
Soviet Union as our military superior. It is not -- at this time. 
What we are witnessing in the conventional as well as in the nuclear 
realm, is a determined, energetic, sustained, and increasing effort by 
the Soviets to develop two large and powerful theater capabilities --
one facing Europe, the other China -- with substantial and increasingly 
modern offensive power. These forces, and a capability to project power 
thousands of miles from their shores, are not new developments. They 
are the product of an effort undertaken over more than a decade and 
continued regardless of whether U.S. and allied forces have increased 
or decreased. What is new is the growing recognition of its magnitude 
and continuity.

Out of the 4.4 million people in their armed forces, the Soviets

Aviation remains at roughly the same size as last year, with about 4,600 
tactical fighter and bomber aircraft. Most of the approximately 500 
Badger/Blinder medium-range bombers could also be used for conventional 
operations. The size of the Soviet general purpose forces navy also 
remains essentially unchanged. The major surface combatant force consists 
of approximately 210 ships, and attack submarines total about 150 diesel-
powered and and 84 nuclear-powered boats. 
Soviet strategic airlift has continued to expand steadily, especially 
in lift capability. With an air fleet consisting of approximately the 
same number of aircraft as they had in 1966, the Soviets can currently 
Lift better than 50 percent more cargo to a range of 2,000 nautical miles 
(14,800 tons versus 9,600 tons). Soviet amphibious forces, which in the 
past were designed principally for use in seas near the USSR, are now 
being upgraded with the construction of new units apparently designed for 
extended operations and open-ocean transit. The Soviet merchant marine is 
receiving considerable attention as well. It is already integrated with 
the Soviet navy, and is being given additional military support capabilities, 
especially with roll-on/roll-off ships. Prior to 1973, the Soviets had 
none of these types; they are expected to have as many as 40 by 1978. 
As pointed out in previous years, about a third of the Soviet divisions' 
are fully combat-ready, or what are considered Category I divisions. 
Roughly another third are manned at 50-75 percent of combat strength and 
may lack some equipment, while the remainder tends to be in cadre status. 
These Category II and III division? would be filled out by reservists who 
receive no further training once they leave active duty. Of more than 170 
divisions, about 45 are deployed on the Sino-Soviet border, and about 30 
percent of the total force remains east of the Urals. 
The Soviets have done a great deal to increase the combat effectiveness 
of their ground forces generally, and have notably favored those divisions 
oriented toward Europe. The divisions have been expanded in size, and 
their firepower and mobility have been increased and modernized. Of 
particular note, a new tank (the T-72) is now being introduced; a capable 
armored fighting vehicle (the BMP) has been deployed in increasing numbers 
since 1967; self-propelled artillery is appearing; and army-level air 
defenses will provide dense, all-altitude coverage. The ground forces 
today have much greater combined-arms power, speed, and antiair protection 
than they did a decade ago. They are equipped with chemical munitions, 
emphasize protection against chemical warfare (CW), and conduct live 
firings and training exercises to test their CW plans, doctrine, weapons, 
and equipment. Their capabilities may be commensurate with long-standing 
Soviet doctrine, which continues to favor rapid offensive thrusts reminiscent 
of German blitzkrieg tactics in World War II.

In the past, this doctrine was seen as an indication that the 
Soviets were preparing to fight a short war of rapid maneuver. This 
meant that if they could be held for a few days, their forces were expected 
to exhaust the supplies available to sustain the campaign. Now, however, 
there is evidence that both in Eastern Europe and in the Far East, the 
Soviets have added to their war reserve stocks and non-divisional support 
personnel. As a consequence, they may be acquiring a significant capability 
to sustain an attack, even though in Europe they continue to emphasize 
the goal of reaching the English Channel in about two weeks. 
A similar effort to match capability with doctrine is evident in 
the evolution of Soviet Frontal Aviation. Whereas about 2,100 of the 
tactical aircraft are assigned to units with a primary mission of air 
defense, most of these, as well as 1,800 ground-attack fighters and 
tactical bombers are suited and train for offensive operations. Increasingly, 
the force can deliver bomb tonnages as far west as the United Kingdom. 
The late-model Fishbeds., and new Fitters, Floggers, and Fencers -- with 
.substantially improved range, payload, avionics, and ECM capabilities --
are adding to the flexibility, reach, and power ot the force. The 
capabilities of these new aircraft are in many ways competitive with 
current U.S. aircraft such as the late-model F-4s. Although they are

not comparable to the newest U.S. fighters (the F-15 and F-16), they are 
already deployed in large numbers in operational units, while U.S.

offensive capability in the air which can complement the growing agility 
of their ground forces.

Soviet general purpose naval forces will probably continue to grow in 
combat power during the coming decade as older surface combatants and 
submarines are replaced by more capable ships, even though the number 
of ships may decrease slightly. Combat effectiveness will improve con-
siderably in units designed for both the high seas and peripheral 
waters. One indication of the probable trend is the introduction to 
the fleet of the aircraft carrier Kiev, which will probably be used 
primarily for ASW, although its aircraft could support combat troops 
ashore, and the ship itself has considerable antiship capability. 
Another indication is the continued replacement of diesel with nuclear 
attack submarines, including units that can launch antiship cruise 
missiles while submerged. The Soviets also continue to improve their 
shipboard antiaircraft defenses, and the worldwide command-control-
communications for their naval forces.

Two other developments are noteworthy. The Soviets have deployed 
an excellent system for surface ocean surveillance, and they have introduced 
the Backfire to their naval aviation. The first enables them to keep 
continued track of selected U.S. surface forces; the second gives them 
an extended-range, rapid-response, antiship missile capability of considerable 
power against U.S. surface ships.

A portion of the growth in Soviet general purpose forces can be 
related to the buildup in the Far East. However, the Soviets have made 
no military sacrifices elsewhere to facilitate that buildup. On the 
contrary, they have simultaneously improved precisely those forces which 
must be of the greatest and most immediate concern to the United States. 
The threat to NATO has not diminished; it has grown. Further, essential 
sea lines of communication are less safe today than they were a decade 
ago. And it must now be recognized that with their improved naval, 
airborne, and airlift forces, the Soviets can intervene by sea and air 
at considerable distances from the USSR, and can sustain such an intervention 
for a substantial period of time. 
Despite these facts, the challenge is a manageable one. Although 
trustworthy comparative costs do not exist, NATO as a whole probably 
spends about as much on its defense establishment as the Warsaw Pact. 
NATO armed forces total about 4.8 million men and women, compared with 
the Warsaw Pact's 5.6 million men. 
Since there is every indication that the Soviets are engaged in a 
steady, long-term effort which shows no signs of leveling off in the 
near future, the feasibility of a NATO conventional defense of Europe 
rests on continued improvements; it cannot be assured once and for all. 
Unless the United States and its allies are prepared to make up the in-
creasingly obvious shortfalls in their collective security posture, 
unless we are willing to sustain our efforts and increase them, the 
response to the challenge could fail. 
But failure, if it should occur, would not be for lack of the 
necessary resources. Compared with the Warsaw Pact, NATO has them in 
abundance. Despite the continued momentum of Soviet conventional programs, 
a satisfactory conventional defense capability is feaSible for the 
United States and its allies, and at less of a burden on our economies, 
as a percent of GNP, than the Warsaw Pact countries have been bearing 
for many years. 
C. Conventional Deterrence 
Despite the changes in the international military environment, the 
argument can still be heard that the maintenance of a major non-nuclear 
capability will undermine the credibility of nuclear deterrence. Yet a 
deterrent which depends solely on nuclear capabilities is credible over 
too narrow a range of contingencies. In most circumstances, choices are 
needed between passivity and the risks of nuclear warfare. No one 
suggests that the Soviets have weakened their deterrent by maintaining 
large conventional forces. What is good for them cannot always be bad 
for others. 
A second argument is that the availability of major conventional 
forces will tempt Presidents into irresponsible acts. This is an 
97

SECRET 
argument without evidence to support it. We became involved in Korea 
before we had sufficient forces to support the decision. We did not 
become committed in Southeast Asia because we had the forces necessary 
to intervention. Rather, the forces were raised to support the inter-
vention. 
Surely we do not want to restrain a President by attempting to 
deprive the United States of the defense capabilities necessary to 
aational security. Weakness has not become a virtue simply because, in 
the view of some -- and then, after the fact -- strength may have been 
used unwisely at some point in the past. We must face the fact that in 
the current era, as in the past, there can be no risk-free posture for 
Lhe United States. 
One hears the argument, finally, that however desirable it may be 
in principle to keep the nuclear threshold high, we are not getting 
value received for the money spent on b.S. conventional forces. The 
assumption seems to be that conventional forces do not buy additional 
security; they simply add to the costs of defense. The strong implication 
is that the world is no safer with the existence of U.S. conventional 
forces than it would be without them. 
Whatever the merits of this argument, it does serve to remind us 
that the prevention of war cannot be taken for granted. It is almost 
axiomatic that we can never be certain of achieving deterrence, nuclear 
or conventional; in a given situation, there is always some probability 
that deterrence could fail. The burden of conventional deterrence is 
particularly complex and demanding. Conventional forces are more familiar; 
if a military response seems justified, their use represents less of a 
leap into the unknown. The prospects for controlling the most destructive 
i'orms of escalation seem better; catastrophe appears to be less probable. 
Where nuclear forces are concerned, an adequate posture -- including 
Clexibility and a sound declaratory policy -- may suffice to deter all 
but the most critical nuclear contingencies. Where conventional forces 
are concerned, a nation's will and demonstration of resolve loom large. 
Since the risks of using conventional capabilities may be seen as 
c!ommensurate with the objectives sought -- which is rarely the case 
where nuclear weapons are concerned -- the prospective attacker, to be 
deterred, must have powerful evidence that his intended adventure will 
be unduly expensive or cannot be counted on to achieve his objective. 
it is for others to judge, and avoid error, with respect to the 
will, resolve, and staying power of the United States. Nonetheless, 
several points should be made here in response to any who still question 
the necessity of major U.S. conventional forces. What has not happened 
is as important as what has happened in our troubled world. International 
order has broken down in many places, frequently at the instigation or 
with the encouragement of the Soviet Union. But it has not broken down

SECRET 
in Western Europe since 1945, and it has not broken down in Korea since 
1953, despite recklessness and irresponsibility on the part of North Korea. 
That peace and stability exist in those two key regions after so many years 
must be credited in no small measure to the deterrent effect produced by the 
presence and steadiness of U.S. and allied conventional forces. They have  
worked as a deterrent. They have more than paid for themselves by their 
silent effectiveness in Western Europe and Northeast Asia. 
Just as we are not the world's policeman, so we cannot be expected 
to deter events in every instance that are off our beat. To say that, 
however, is not reason to dismantle U.S. conventional forces. That those 
forces may be 80 rather than 100 percent effective is no argument against 
their continuation. On the contrary, strength -- conventional as well as 
nuclear -- contributes to peace; weakness, clearly in this day and age, 
but also throughout history, can invite war. It is not even too much to 
say that present circumstances make weakness a greater provocation than 
strength. 
For these reasons, the United States has a clear requirement to 
naintain an unquestionably strong conventional posture -- land, sea, and 
air. However, such a declaration of general policy is not enough. It is 
necessary to be more specific in any statement of needs. To do so, a 
number of factors must be considered: 
-- the contingencies to be used for planning purposes (including 
the details of the threat and the circumstances of a hypothetical attack); 
the contributions made by allies; 
-- basic strategic objectives; 
the missions to be performed; 
the measures of effectiveness to be employed; 
the levels of confidence sought; and 
the expected duration of a conflict. 
It must be stressed in this context that the definition of a mission 
in a particular theater -- sea control, for example -- does not automatically 
result in the specification of a unique force package. The size and 
composition of the package will depend on a number of factors which can 
vary, including the magnitude of the threat. As a consequence, caution 
should be exercised in trying to reach major defense decisions on the basis 
of missions alone.

O. Contingencies, Missions, and Forces 
U.S. force planning approach calls for the United States, in conjunction 
with its allies, to deal with a major contingency in Europe. Since the 
threat from the Warsaw Pact to the Central Region of NATO is the worst 
case, it is given primary attention for planning purposes. However, the 
aorthern and southern flanks of NATO also influence the design of the U.S. 
posture. An attack on the Republic of Korea would have its impact on 
planning largely in the realm of logistics and overseas deployments.

In Central Europe, two contingencies have concerned the United States 
for many years. The first is a short-warning attack initiated by the 
deployed and combat-ready forces of the Warsaw Pact stationed in East 
Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The second is an attack by these 
forces reinforced, primarily from the USSR, after perhaps 30 days of 
mobilization and deployment. In both cases, attacks on NATO naval forces 
and sea lines of communication are assumed. 
a. Short-Warning Attack in Central Europe 
These two cases continue to be the most appropriate for the purpose 
3f generating the U.S. conventional posture. But there is reason to give 
careful attention and emphasis to the possibility of an unreinforced 
attack which minimizes warning time. Soviet doctrine has highlighted this 
possibility for some time; the divisions in the Group of Soviet Forces, 
Germany (GSFG), have been expanded and given increased firepower and 
mobility; war reserve stocks have been built up; and more sophisticated 
aircraft with a greater offensive capability have been deployed to Eastern 
Europe. The conditions for tactical surprise have become more favorable 
in the last few years. 
Surprise, it should be emphasized, can be much more than the rapidity 
of the transition from peace to war. Soviet doctrine emphasizes a variety 
of ways to confuse opposing commanders, disrupt critical defense decisions, 
and delay their implementation. For the potential attacker, such measures 
could be preferable to the deployment of massive ground and air forces and 
all the other preparations for a long, costly, and less winnable war. 
The Warsaw Pact already deploys 58 divisions in varying degrees of 
readiness opposite NATO's Central Region. Of these, 27 are the Soviet 
divisions in East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The remainder 
consists of 6 East German, 15 Polish, and 10 Czechoslovakian divisions, 
It is conceivable that the entire force could be ready to attack within 
96 hours of a decision for war. Almost certainly the 20 divisions of the 
GSFG and the 6 East German divisions could meet or exceed this schedule. 
The other divisions could be used as a first element of reserves.

Because of these possibilities, the size of the attack force could 
vary from a low of about 500,000 men to a high of as many as a million. 
They could bring to bear anywhere from 9,000 to 15,000 tanks. The Pact 
could also commit on the order of 2,900 tactical aircraft to a surprise 
attack. Of that total, around 1,400 would consist of modern fighter 
aircraft at the present time. 
To defend against such a very short-warning attack, NATO would have, 
at best, about 25 maldeployed non-U.S. divisions at low states of readiness 
and alert. To implement a forward defense strategy along a front of about 
900 kilometers, this force -- without any U.S. contribution -- would have 
to be stretched thin. Even against the GSFG only, its chances would be 
poor since the attacker would have the initiative. Against the higher 
threats and a fast-breaking attack, its position could well prove untenable 
without an early use of nuclear weapons. Quite apart from any advantages 
of deception and tactical surprise, division frontages and force and 
firepower ratios would so favor the Pact that an early breakthrough of 
major proportions would have to be expected. Without a major U.S. presence, 
defense against such an attack would be precarious and problematic at 
best. 
To increase military and political stability in Central Europe in the 
face of a possible short-warning attack, the United States has for many 
years supplemented the allied contingent with a deployed force of five 
division equivalents and eight fighter-attack wings. These capabilities 
help to improve coverage of the front and make force and firepower ratios 
much less favorable to the Pact. Because an attack could come with little 
warning, the divisions and air wings have to be stationed in Europe, or be 
rapidly deployable, if they are to have any effect on the battle and its 
deterrence. They must also have prepositioned stocks of combat consumables 
and materiel. The size of these stocks is affected by estimates of the 
length and intensity of the war and the ability to deliver additional 
stocks from the United States with hardpressed airlift and sealift assets. 
A reasonable goal for prepositioned war reserve stocks in Europe, all 
possibilities considered, is at least 60 days of supply, assuming intense 
rates of combat consumption. 
As can be seen, a first slice -- but only a first slice -- of the 
U.S. conventional posture is based on four assumptions: 
-- the possibility of a short-warning attack by in-place Warsaw 
Pact forces; 
an attacking force which could amount to 500,000 or more men; 
a forward allied defense; 
- the need to keep the ratio of attack to defense well below two-
to-one.

SECRET 
Although these assumptions are tenable, others are possible. In 
principle, a larger allied and a smaller U.S. contribution to the common 
defense could be postulated. In practice, the difficulties of such a 
substitution are obvious. The bulk of any replacement for deployed U.S. 
forces would have to come from the Federal Republic of Germany; the 
aecurity of U.S. nuclear weapons would become an increasing issue; and 
the political stability induced by a major U.S. presence would be shaken. 
It should be noted that the force numbers used in arriving at ludgments 
about U.S. requirements may not always coincide with those used in the 
negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (14BER). Several 
reasons exist for the difference. First, force planning dictates that 
we took beyond the NATO guidelines area and, as appropriate, consider 
other capabilities, including those of Denmark and France and forces 
atationed in the United Kingdom. Second, we are interested, for planning 
purposes, in the field forces which might become engaged rather than in 
the manpower totals for armed forces with which MBFR must be concerned. 
b. Mobilization and Deployment in Central Europe 
The size and composition of U.S. general purpose forces are sensitive 
to the short-warning attack contingency in Europe. But their need 
derives primarily from a more demanding contingency. This is a case 
where, during a period of rising tension in Central Europe, the Warsaw 
Pact mobilizes and adds to the forces already deployed in Eastern Europe, 
after which it attacks. Since so much of the U.S. conventional posture 
is dictated by this contingency, the key assumptions about it need to be 
made explicit. 
or planning purposes, it is postulated that, within 30 days, the 
Soviets could mobilize, flesh out, and deploy to East Germany the 29 
divisions and 900 aircraft that they station in the three western military 
districts of the USSR. With the rounding out of other units, the total 
Warsaw Pact capability facing the Central Region of NATO would amount to 
about 87 divisions, 1.3 million men, 27,000 tanks, and about 3,700 
iactical aircraft. 
Although the Soviets have not conducted a mobilization and deployment 
on this scale since World War II, it is conceivable that they could do 
;t in fewer than 30 days with a substantial use of air and road transportation 
Lo supplement movement by rail. It is also quite possible that the 
deployment would take longer. 
With additional time, the attack force could be built up still 
further by divisions drawn from other regions, including the Far East. 
To do this, however, would create vulnerabilities on other Soviet borders 
and would afford NATO additional days in which to improve its posture. 
The United States in particular would have more time to move its forces. 
The Soviets, recognizing this, might choose to begin the attack earlier, 
with somewhat smaller forces.

? DAYS AFTER PACT M-DAY 
For these reasons, force planning, as contrasted with contingency 
planning, continues to use a force of 87 Warsaw Pact divisions attacking 
at M+30 as the basis for designing the U.S. response. I should stress, 
however, that an attack of this magnitude could occur after substantially 
fewer days of mobilization and deployment by the Pact, although it would 
have to include low-readiness divisions. There is also a possibility 
that NATO could fail to use effectively the available warning time and 
therefore could lag in its response to the Pact buildup sufficiently so 
that little more than the currently deployed forces would be available 
for defense along the Central Front. That is one reason why contingendy 
plans exist for the possible use of nuclear weapons at a relatively 
early stage in the Pact attack. 
The standard planning assumption is that NATO would have fairly 
clear warning of Pact intentions to attack, would begin its mobilization 
and deployment by seven days after the Pact's, and would, accordingly, 
have 23 days in which to build up its defenses. For force planning 
purposes, it is hypothesized that the main allied effort would take the 
form of rounding out and adding support forces to the divisions already 
deployed. This would leave to the United States the main burden of 
bringing NATO back into balance with the Pact. It has been judged that 
the early addition of about ten more divisions and 15 more tactical air 
103

SECRET 
wings from the United States (for a total U.S. contribution of 15 divisions 
and 23 tactical air wings by approximately M+30), along with the strengthened 
Ailed forces, would provide an adequate basis for an initial forward 
defense against the 87-division attack force of the Pact. According to 
this planning concept, a total NATO capability in the Central Region of 40 
divisions and 3,900 tactical aircraft should give reasonable coverage of 
the front, provide a reserve, and prevent force and firepower ratios 
from favoring the Pact to an excessive degree. 
Once such basic planning assumptions are made, and the initial force 
are postulated, other requirements follow. Because U.S. forces should 
be on line in Germany within 23 days, most of them have to be ready and 
come from the active inventory. Major reserve units, however valuable 
for subsequent reinforcement and other less time-urgent situations, 
cannot be expected to meet even this, let alone the more exacting mobilization 
and deployment schedules generated by attacks with little or no warning. 
Because the deployment schedule would allow so little time for the 
arrival of the crucial U.S. reinforcements, the means of bringing them 
on line are limited. One obvious way to solve the problem is by keeping 
as many as 15 divisions and 23 air wings in Europe at all times. That 
is not desirable for a number of reasons, including the fact that, while 
the Central Region of Europe is of vital interest to us, there are 
other contingencies we seek to deter as well. To tie down most of our 
ground and air forces in Central Europe, with all the problems of extracting 
them for use in the event of a crisis elsewhere, would be unacceptable. 
As Soviet power in Eastern Europe has grown, the United States has 
added two brigades to the deployed forces in Germany, just as we have 
added to the total number of Army divisions. We have also added fighter-
attack aircraft in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
For purposes of rapid reinforcement, we can preposition stocks of 
materiel and supplies in a threatened theater, and fly in the men to 
"marry up" with that equipment. Another choice is to use airlift to 
move both men and materiel in the early stages of a buildup and rely on 
sealift for the satisfaction of longer-term needs. 
Koch of these methods has its own vulnerabilities. In order to 
spread the risks, we preposition several division sets of equipment in 
Europe and expect to improve the U.S. capability for sealift. But 
because of the demanding NATO deployment schedule (and the U.S. need 
for worldwide mobility), we rely most heavily on strategic airlift for 
quick response, and place particular value on wide-bodied aircraft with 
their ability to move outsize cargos. As long as large tonnages must 
he delivered rapidly over long distances, there is no other choice. 
Specifically, for the NATO contingency, the United States would need to 
Aove on the order of 370,000 tons within about 30 days. With a capability 
of that magnitude in hand, it should be possible to deal with most other 
contingencies that could arise.

The alternative to such a large capability would be a willingness 
to engage in the classic practice of trading space for time. As a 
result of such a trade, mobilization could proceed more slowly, and 
deployment capabilities would not have to be as massive and costly. But 
planning to give up territory to buy time is an unattractive proposition 
on several counts. Those whose territory would be traded -- our NATO 
allies -- are unlikely to see merit in the idea, and we would find that 
in saving peacetime investment and operating costs, we had simply deferred 
larger costs and greater risks to wartime. 
Forward flexible defenses are often an advantage because smaller 
forces are required to hold a well-chosen line than to retreat and 
subsequently take the offensive to recover territory previously lost. 
Casualties also tend to be lower in the first than in the second case. 
In the circumstances,it is clearly why strategic airlift is regarded as 
such a bargain. The continued inability to fund the proposed modifications 
in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (to make it adaptable to military cargos) 
is therefore particularly disappointing. 
If there were complete confidence that the deterrence of conflict 
in NATO and elsewhere (including at sea) would require only short-war 
capabilities, the bulk of U.S. conventional needs could probably be met 
by active ground forces, tactical air wings, strategic mobility, and 
naval power projection forces. There is little confidence, however, 
that future NATO wars necessarily would be short or that other contingencies 
would not require longer-war capabilities. 
As far as can be determined, the Soviets plan for a short, violent, 
fast-moving attack on NATO which, if not successful, would burn itself 
out in a relatively short time. But doctrine and practice do not always 
coincide; rationing of supplies and less violent offensives could lengthen 
Pact endurance. In any event, the evidence mounts that the Soviets are 
investing more in non-divisional support units and other elements of 
staying power. 
It would make little sense to strengthen U.S. short-war capabilities 
at the expense of staying power only to discover that the enemy could 
outlast us. Accordingly, for the sake of deterrence alone, NATO must 
hedge substantially against longer-war eventualities. One part of the 
solution is to have the main Guard and Reserve forces serve as a first 
echelon of reinforcements and replacements for the active units which 
will have borne the brunt of the initial defense. Another part would 
be, in critical areas, to provide sufficient war reserve stocks so that 
we could fight from D-day to P-day (the time when production lines can 
satisfy our combat needs). 
Uninterrupted access to the main sea Lines of communication would 
be essential to any major overseas combat operation by the United States. 
Otherwise, even if an enemy could not defeat us directly in the land battle,

he could force us into a desperate situation by using his naval forces 
lo cut us off from our home base of supply. 
Lu the event of a major mobilization in Europe, the United States 
would begin to move and protect cargos at sea, partly because the period 
of crisis might last more than 30 days, and partly because it cannot be 
assumed that a major war in Europe, once started, would stop at U.S. 
convenience. Nor can it he assumed that the conflict would not actually 
have begun elsewhere (in the Middle East, for example), or that it would 
not spread elsewhere. In these circumstances, it seems essential for 
us, in conjunction with our allies, to have the capability to protect 
the sea lines of communication in the Atlantic, through the Mediterranean, 
sad in the Pacific as far west as Japan and South Korea. 
The main naval threats, for planning purposes, come primarily from 
the Soviet fleets based in the Barents Sea, the Black Sea, and the 
western Pacific, and from long-range Soviet naval aviation. These 
h,rces might begin operations only after D-day. But since the Soviets 
would have the initiative, they might be able to deploy some of their 
ships and submarines into the North Atlantic, Eastern Mediterranean, and 
Western Pacific before a conflict began. In either event, U.S. strategy 
would be to create a series of barriers that Soviet aircraft, submarines, 
and surface combatants would have to cross to attack our merchant 
shipping and surface combatants, and cross again to return to their home 
bases. 
U.S. carrier and land-based air would provide the main defense 
against Soviet naval aviation and surface combatants, but they would 
also participate along with U.S. barrier forces in a campaign of attrition 
against Soviet submarines. Three types of barriers could be formed. The 
first could deploy in relatively narrow waters and consist primarily of 
aines, submarines, and patrol aircraft. The second and much looser 
harrier could be formed in the open ocean and depend for its effectiveness 
primarily on ocean surveillance systems, attack submarines, and patrol 
aircraft. The third barrier could consist of the close-in defense of 
.luch high-value units as carriers, amphibious groups, convoys, and 
underway replenishment groups and be based primarily on escort ships, 
.ielicopters, direct-support submarines, and where available, carrier-
-ased air. The requirement for surface and submarine combatants is 
Largely determined by this task. For force planning purposes it is 
ossumed that around 240 frigates, destroyers, and cruisers, and enough 
direct-support submarines would be necessary to protect 12 carrier task 
Forces, two amphibious groups, the necessary underway replenishment 
groups, and at least 6 convoys. Manning the other two types of barriers 
Largely accounts for the remaining U.S. patrol aircraft, submarine, and 
modest surface mine-laying capabilities. 
Naval forces also fulfill other important roles. In particular, the 
capability of the aircraft carrier to project tactical air power from the 
106

Approved For Release 2002/08HCM-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
sea represents an effective means of supporting national policy. 
Aircraft carriers constitute a mechanism for showing a presence, 
managing crises, and projecting power. Since World War II, U.S. 
policymakers have used naval forces and carrier strike groups to support 
major interests on at least 43 occasions. The circumstances have ranged 
from reminding potential nations of the U.S. presence to engaging in combat 
operations. For the foreseeable future, there is little reason to expect 
that the need for carriers to perform such roles will decline. 
Accordingly, planning of future naval forces should sustain the present 
capability for crisis management and power projection. The main elements 
of that capability will consist of task groups built around a mix of large-
deck aircraft carriers and smaller, less expdnsive, conventionally-powered 
V/STOL carriers. 
c. The Flanks 
An attack on the Central Region of NATO is, of course, not the only 
basis for the U.S. non-nuclear posture. The flanks of NATO could come 
under attack simultaneously with a Pact offensive in the Central Region. 
Either in North Norway, Jutland, or possibly in Greek or Turkish Thrace, 
the weight of a Pact offensive could require reinforcement of the 
allies. For force planning purposes, it is assumed that at least part 
of this requirement would be satisfied by a U.S. Marine Amphibious Force 
and its associated lift. If used in other than a reinforcing role, this 
expeditionary force would have to depend, in turn, on fire support from 
accompanying surface combatants and, if available, from the aircraft of 
at least two carriers until Marine airpower could be established ashore. 
2. The Minor Contingency 
The strategic concept calls for the United States to plan on the 
occurrence of a minor contingency prior to or simultaneously with a 
major contingency. The reason for this relationship is twofold: not 
only could a small engagement result in a larger conflict elsewhere; it 
could require the commitment of U.S. forces which could not then be 
extricated in time for use against the major threat. 
An example of this possible sequence of events arose with the 
covert introduction of Soviet MRBMs and IRBMs into Cuba. The problem 
for U.S. policymakers at that time was how to force the missiles out of 
Cuba and simultaneously deter the Soviets from taking action in some 
other region, particularly Europe, where their military leverage was 
greater. The solution was to place U.S. strategic nuclear forces on a 
high alert and mobilize land, naval, and air forces against Cuba while 
maintaining an ability to respond to a contingency in Europe with general 
purpose forces. Even though in the autumn of 1962 the general purpose 
forces were already being developed for two simultaneous contingencies

MI: is now possible, based on standard plannirw assumptions, to 
iiiiimarize the main elements of the active non-nuclear force structure 
Mlle United States would require to deal with a major contingency in. 
Europe and a more or less simultaneous minor contingency comparable in 
magnitude to the Cuban emergency of 1962. Land forces would consist of 
V) active divisions, of which three (by law) would consist of Marines 
with accompanying air wings. Other land-based fighter-attack needs 
would be met by 26 active Air Force tactical fighter wings. Strategic

farflung responsibilities for sea control and specialized power projection, 
would comprise a two-ocean ASW capability, 12 carrier task forces, and 
the amphibiOus lift for the assault elements of a Marine amphibious force 
and one Marine amphibious brigade. These are, in fact, the general 
purpose forces that have been programmed for the past two years. 
Northeast Asia 
There is a view, I realize, that the United States is actually 
preparing to deal simultaneously with more than one major contingency. 
According to this theory, not only are substantial forces oriented 
toward a high-technology war in Europe; the two-front strategy has been 
kept as well. Critics of this persuasion cite U.S. Navy deployments in 
the Pacific, the 2 divisions and 3 tactical air wines there, and the 
fact that some of the Continental U.S. (CONUS) based divisions still 
remain light and suitable primarily for the so-called third-world contingencies. 
Several points are relevant to such suspicions, and should allay 
item. 
first, it makes sense in peacetime to maintain a limited 
presence in the vital area of Northeast Asia to guard U.S. interests and 
keep watch over the sea lanes. Current deployments are there for defensive

purposes and are not excessive to their missions. Indeed, the U.S. 
military presence in the Western Pacific is smaller than at any time 
since 1950. 
Second, a war in Europe could spread to the Pacific. Some 
forces would be needed in that area to hold positions, tie down Soviet 
forces in the area, and protect essential sea lines of communication. 
-- Third, the great majority of the U.S. forces, including those 
based on the west coast and some elements in the Pacific, would be 
needed for a NATO contingency. The peacetime location of these forces 
does not necessarily indicate or restrict their use in wartime. 
Fourth, funds to accelerate the "heavying up" of two more Army 
divisions are being requested, and consideration is being given to the 
problem of retaining the amphibious capability and, at the same time, 
making the Marine Corps more adaptable to the high-intensity wars of 
modern technology. 
E. Conclusions 
In correcting misapprehensions, the opposite error should not be 
made of mistaking the force planning process for a prediction of 'how the 
resulting posture will be used. The European contingency is a iajor 
factor in shaping the U.S. conventional force structure. And i a full-
blown crisis should develop in Europe, it would absorb the bulk. of U.S. 
conventional forces. But it is a planning contingency, not a flat 
statement of where an emergency will arise or the only theater where 
U.S. forces will necessarily be required. Without such a planning 
contingency, we could be left with unlimited demands on U.S. national 
resource's, or even less satisfactory methods of designing the posture. 
Nonetheless, we must avoid becoming literal in equating contingencies 
with reality, rigid in committing forces to specific theaters and contingencies 
regardless of the circumstances, unimaginative in remaining wedded to a 
particular strategic concept independently of U.S. interests and the 
dangers to them. 
The main U.S. security objectives continue to be peace and stability 
through suitable defense and deterrent forces. Aside from the Western 
Hemisphere itself, Western Europe and Northeast Asia are the two regions 
most essential to U.S.. security. Whatever the strategic concept used for 
force planning purposes, it is necessary to avoid a demonstration of capa-
bility and will to resist pressure and aggression in one of these great 
regions at the cost of denuding the other and inviting pressure there as 
well. We may be willing to arrive at the necessary size and composition 
of U.S. forces on the basis of a major and minor contingency. But we 
must be equally sure to have a posture that is sufficiently large, 
modern, ready, and well-positioned to face the most demanding threat in 
Europe and still maintain the deterrence produced by a forward deployment

XII. OTHER CAPABILITIES 
The size and composition of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces 
will be highly sensitive to the assumptions made about the factors 
reviewed here. It is possible to be more or less conservative in the 
way the structure is designed; more or fewer risks could be taken. 
The present course continues to be a moderate one. The world has 
not changed significantly for the better in the past decade. In many 
ways, it holds more dangers and surprises for the American people than 
It did in the mid-1960s. The military threat has not declined; it has 
expanded, and become more diversified. Yet the United States has tried 
over a number of years to maintain security with defense budgets which, 
in real terms, have been lower than they were before the war in Vietnam, 
and with a defense posture which is smaller in many respects (if more 
capable in some) than it was in 1964. 
Whether the adverse trends of recent years can be arrested, and the 
necessary conditions of security maintained with these forces, remains 
problematic. Certainly it cannot be done by reducing the other capabilities 
which add so much to the overall deterrent. The United States must have 
adequate funding for programs in intelligence, research and development, 
military cooperation with other nations, command-control-communications, 
and logistics. 
A. Intelligence 
Without the collection and analysis of the various intelligence 
capabilities, uncertainty about the size and composition of adversary 
forces would be much more substantial, and we would know even less than 
we now do about opponents' plans and capabilities. Risks would increase. 
It would be necessary to introduce greater conservatism into the planning 
and programming of the U.S. posture and take out heavier insurance 
against surprises in action and technology. As one example, we have 
made relatively modest deployments to Europe based on our knowledge 
about current Warsaw Pact capabilities and deployments. Without that 
knowledge, either U.S. requirements would grow or our dependence on a 
nuclear strategy would have to increase. 
B. Research and Development 
Without a major program of research and development, the United 
States could not keep pace with the Soviet Union, improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of our posture, or even understand adequately what our 
opponents are doing. The Soviets have had a long-standing and deep 
commitment to technological excellence in the military sphere; they have 
made great strides toward their goal. That is one reason why we must be 
cautious about the transfer of advanced technologies to them. In many

Areas of their military establishment, they have actually increased the 
,Aze of their forces as they have heightened their sophistication. For 
;The most part, quantity has not been traded for quality. 
This development has several implications for the United States: 
- We must recognize that the principle of diminishing marginal 
productivity is as applicable in mature technologies as elsewhere; additional 
tnvestments in those technologies will not produce returns to scale, and 
Lhe Soviets will catch up -- as they are doing in inertial guidance. 
- This means that we must be more alert than ever for new techno-
logical opportunities with defense applications and invest more to bring 
them along. At present, for example, we must pursue the technologies of 
ong-range cruise missiles and guidance which, in combination, can permit 
mprovement in our conventional capabilities against many targets. There 
is also the possibility of improved sensors to detect, locate, and identify 
rhe presence and activity of foreign military forces. Space-based sensors 
are especially interesting, as are mini-micro computers.

Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
-- Finally, since geography remains important, we must recognize 
that the substitution of quality for quantity has only so much potential. 
Numbers remain essential in most military operations, whether\ of men to 
provide a certain density along a front, of aircraft to saturate a 
defense system, or of carriers to maintain a presence in separate oceans 
around the world. Accordingly, the U.S. investment in procurement as 
well as research and development must be increased. 
C. Military Cooperation with Other Nations 
Cooperation with other nations through programs of loans, sales, 
and some grants is desirable in certain cases to support U.S. foreign 
policy and national security. Some look at such programs and fail to 
see that it is in our interest for the NATO allies to purchase arms from 
the United States, that it makes sense to approve certain military sales 
to Israel, that it is better that we, rather than the Soviets, sell an 
air defense system to Jordan. The overall security assistance program 
has been a useful foreign policy tool since the Marshall Plan. Every 
administration and Congress in the past 29 years has supported the 
program. 
Without military sales and assistance, it would be difficult for 
many of our friends and allies to share the burdens of collective security 
with us. Nor could we count on their forces to complement ours with any 
degree of efficiency. Overseas base rights and other facilities sometimes 
depend on a willingness to make U.S. defense equipment available. 
Regional balances of power that could affect world stability and peace, 
as in the Middle East, may depend on the U.S. ability to support well-
disposed nations, especially when others are being supported by assistance 
and sales from the many sources of arms in the USSR and Europe. Balance-
of-payments considerations, while not central, cannot be ignored. Where 
proud and independent states with large dollar earnings see it in their 
self-interest -- as well as their sovereign right -- to acquire defensive 
capabilities, their requests must be taken seriously, just as we have an 
obligation to decide which sales are in the U.S. interest. 
D. C3, Readiness, and Production 
Other capabilities are central to the U.S. posture as well. Without 
the command-control-communications permitted by modern technology, military 
resources could not be used in the most efficient possible fashion, and 
we could hardly hope to depend as we now do on deliberate, second-strike 
responses for strategic deterrence. Without a high level of readiness --
materiel as well as personnel readiness -- it would be impossible to 
substitute quick, forward, and economical defenses for the much larger 
forces required when space is traded for time and lost territory must be 
regained. In an era of uncertainty, without a war production base which 
can satisfy current equipment and supply needs, and expand rapidly to 
meet sudden emergencies and demands, the United States would encounter 
even greater difficulties than in the past in responding to a Soviet

SECRET 
surge in the production and deployment of guns, tanks, aircraft and 
missiles. It is necessary only to recall the demands made on U.S. materiel 
inventories as a result of the Middle East war of 1973, and the difficulties 
since encountered in replacing those drawdowns, to realize how limited 
Lhe U.S. war production base has become. As that WAT demonstrated, the 
2ntire annual U.S. production of tanks could be consumed in a war lasting 
only a month or two. To be sure, war reserve stocks can substitute in 
;ome measure for a "hot" production base, but they are not a proof against 
ancertainty. The expanding Soviet production base, and the possibility 
of its being surged, mean that a diversified and "warm" production base 
Ls an essential condition of U.S. security in these uncertain times. 
Assumptions and Planning 
As indicated, changes in assumptions about key factors relevant to 
force planning can lead to modifications in the U.S. defense posture. 
An example of such a modification occurred in 1970 when it was decided to 
go from a "two-plus" to a "one-plus" strategic concept on the ground that 
,be Sino-Soviet split removed the previous need to deter a two-front war. 
Greater or fewer risks can also be taken with the force structure, 
The Army would prefer the higher confidence of narrower division 
ontages than are now being assumed for the European contingency. This 
would drive up the number of divisions necessary to keen in the active 
land force structure. 
The Navy would like more ASW and AAW barriers in the Atlantic, 
Mediterranean, and Pacific, which would increase the probability of kill 
against Soviet submarines and other forces attacking our SPA lines of 
communication. 
]n. these and other instances, however, it must be decided whether 
increments of effectiveness would be worth the additional costs, partly 
because of diminishing returns to scale, but also because of opportunities 
to invest resources elsewhere with larger returns in the overall effectiveness 
of U.S. forces. 
in an era of significant uncertainty, U.S. forces must have much 
better than even odds of achieving their essentially defensive objectives. 
They need not be overdesigned in the search for a no-risk posture, but we 
must clearly avoid creating a capability which inspires low confidence 
among friends and over-confidence among foes. 
A posture which depends for its effectiveness on the restraint and 
Looperation of our enemies is not a satisfactory deterrent. Opponents 
who are assumed to ignore U.S. vulnerabilities and attack U.S. strengths 
may be a convenient fiction for wishful thinkers. They are not the stuff 
of real life. Now is not the time for major vulnerabilities or the 
facade of deterrence. To deter, the United States must have a credible 
capability to fight back if attacked -- that, above all. is clear.

XIII. NET ASSESSMENTS 
A. Methods 
To what extent does the current defense posture of the United States, 
and the one projected through FY 1981 -- essentially the posture described 
and recommended to the Congress a year ago -- achieve U.S. objectives? 
To answer that question requires use of the same analytical methods 
employed in the design of the posture. If future trends in the factors 
that shape our posture have been accurately foreseen -- and particularly 
trends in the threat -- the previously programmed posture should prove 
adequate to fill current and future needs. Nonetheless, periodic and 
separate assessments of that posture need to be made. 
Just as weapon systems should not be evaluated by the same group 
that designed them, the effectiveness of the U.S. defense posture is best 
assessed by groups not intimately engaged in its construction. It is 
also the case that, because of long lead-times for the development and 
production of weapon systems, and for the training of military personnel, 
the posture today is bound to reflect decisions made some years previously. 
Since many of those decisions had to be taken under conditions of uncertainty 
about a number of planning factors, what was judged adequate only a short 
time ago may no longer fit the situation. 
The United States is involved in 'a highly dynamic political-military 
process. Accordingly, our posture and programs must be continually 
assessed in light of more precise data so as to ensure the continued 
appropriateness of the capabilities to our needs. 
In making such assessments, a number of off-design contingencies 
are considered, as well as the basic cases from which the U.S. defense 
posture is derived. However, the main tests the posture must pass before 
we can be satisfied as to its adequacy are: 
-- the ability of the strategic nuclear forces to survive a surprise 
Soviet attack and execute its missions with the desired level of effectiveness; 
-- the ability of the general purpose forces, in conjunction with 
allied capabilities, to conduct a successful, forward, non-nuclear defense 
of Central Europe or South Korea; 
-- the ability of U.S. naval forces to maintain selective control 
of the seas to permit essential support of forward defenses and allies. 
In addition, because of nuclear equivalence and the revived role of con-
ventional forces in maintaining U.S. security, it is necessary to begin 
examining the ability of the U.S. war production base to respond to a 
sudden surge in Soviet military outputs.

SECRET 
Not only should these assessments deal with the current military 
balance; they must also consider where the United States and the Soviet 
Union expect to be militarily in the future. Only if such an assessment 
;s made, allowing for uncertainties, is it possible to judge whether the 
ive-Year Defense Program is adequate to estimated U.S. needs. 
The Strategic Nuclear Balance 
The Present Situation 
At the present time. U.S. strategic nuclear forces are capable of 
completing the missions prescribed for them under second-strike conditions. 
Even after a full-scale Soviet surprise attack concentrated on U.S. forces, 
4: is estimated that the on-station SLBMs, the bulk of the ICBMs, and most of 
the alert bombers would survive, along with the minimum essential command-
control-communications system. The surviving force should be able, if 
uecessary, to cause major destruction to the military and industrial capacity, 
and to the leadership and population of the Soviet Union. In addition, 
elements ot the surviving force would be available to engage in other responses. 
The Soviets appear to be in a comparable position. 
These conclusions suggest that despite differences between the U.S. and 
Soviet strategic capabilities, the two sides are roughly equivalent at the 
present time.. As now constituted, the U.S. posture contributes to both 
crisis and long-term stability. It lacks capability for a disarming first-
sLrike; its ability to destroy fixed hard ICBMs on a time-urgent basis is 
severely limited. In no way does the posture threaten to degrade significantly 
by offensive or defensive means the Soviet capability for second-strike 
assured retaliation. 
The Future 
Evidence of restraint on the part of the Soviet Union would be welcome. 
Unfortunately, it has not been forthcoming. Along with the increasingly 
large throw-weight they are deploying in their ICBMs, the Soviets have 
dramatically improved the accuracy of this force. At exactly what point the 
combination of throw-weight, MIRVs, high yields, and low CEPs will give them 
1 high kill potential against U.S. Minuteman/ Titan ICBMs still remains a 
matter of some uncertainty. There can be little doubt, however, that within 
a decade or less, confidence in the present U.S. fixed hard forces as high-
confidence, second-strike weapons will be seriously eroded. 
At the same time that the Soviets are developing their hard-target 
kill capability, they are making a massive research effort in strategic 
ASW, improving their anti-bomber defenses and continuing an active 
program of SAM, ABM, anti-satellite, and possibly anti-tactical ballistic 
missile research and development. They have already developed a mobile 
defense system with an impressive probability of kill against bombers and

SECRET 
cruise missiles, and the system could have an anti-ballistic missile 
capability because of its phased array radar and high-acceleration 
missile. Moreover, it could be produced in large numbers, stockpiled, 
and deployed rapidly on short notice. 
Finally, it is necessary to consider the potential impact of the 
Soviet passive defense program. This long-standing program provides 
protection for key government and military leaders in hardened shelters, 
protection of key economic facilities and essential workers through 
dispersal and hardening programs, and lastly, protection for the majority 
of the population (through fallout shelters and evacuation). 
During the last six months we have become more aware of the magnitude 
of Soviet civil defense efforts, although major gaps in the intelligence 
data preclude us from making any confident judgments about effectiveness. 
What we see, however, suggests to us a continuing Soviet interest in 
enhancing the Soviet capability to survive a nuclear war, coupled with a 
steadfastness of purpose which is of concern. 
This civil defense capability -- if it continues to grow as we 
expect -- coupled with high accuracy and more reliable missiles, could 
adversely affect our ability to implement the U.S. deterrent strategy. 
Thus, it could provide the Soviets with both a political and a military 
advantage in the event of a nuclear crisis. 
With the initiative, if they develop better military capabilities, 
the Soviets in a first-strike could conceivably eliminate 95 percent of 
the fixed U.S. ICBM force, all of the non-alert bombers (and perhaps 
even some of the alerts), and all of the SLBMs in port. Furthermore, 
their civil defense capabilities could enable them to protect key leaders, key 
facilities, and some of their population from a U.S. counterstrike. 
They would also retain a large residual offensive capability which they 
could either withhold or use to attack U.S. population and industry. It is 
at least conceivable, under these conditions, that U.S. second-strike 
retaliatory forces would have a damage expectancy, not of 40 percent 
prompt fatalities and 70 percent of Soviet industry destroyed, but 5 percent 
prompt fatalities and perhaps 30 percent of industry destroyed. Soviet 
damage expectancy against the United States, by contrast, would remain at 
more than 50 percent prompt fatalities and as much as 80 percent of in-
dustry destroyed. The Soviet society and system could probably survive 
such an exchange; the United States probably could not. It is clearly 
not in our interest to allow such an imbalance to evolve. 
It is premature to say that such a damage-limiting asymmetry is 
developing. But the vigor of Soviet efforts in this direction raises a 
number of issues for the U.S. strategic nuclear posture and programs. 
The Five-Year Defense Program, as it was presented to the Congress last 
year, concentrated on two broad efforts.

-- The first entailed an orderly modernization of the Triad by 
means of the Trident, B-1, and improvements to Minuteman ITT. 
The second involved the development, again at a measured pace. 
of several hedges against the possibility of Soviet efforts to upset the 
strategic balance. These hedges included work on Missile X (M() -- an 
tCBM designed to have more survivable basing options, improved guidance, 
and better yield-to-weight warheads for ballistic missiles, continued 
development of ABM systems technology, and a very modest base of civil 
defense activities which. if necessary, could be built on in the future. 
In none of these eftorts, as projected in the Five-Year Defense 
Program, was the effect to reduce the Soviet capability for assured 
fetaliation. After programming the funding profile below, it was possible 
to see if the Soviets would reciprocate by leaving their population and 
industry hostage to our capability for assured retaliation.

Xvidence of reciprocity has not been forthcoming. Accordingly, in 
the FY 1978 budget cycle, it has been necessary to assure ourselves that 
the Five-Year Defense Program maintains the U.S. strategic nuclear 
deterrent. We have tried to identify steps that must be taken now so 
that the United States will be capable of countering potentially destabilizing 
actions of the USSR. A number of potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
strategic posture are developing. So far, these problems have been 
anticipated in ongoing research and development programs.

C. The Conventional Balance in Europe 
Any assessment of the current balance of conventional power in 
Central Europe must evaluate NATO's ability to contain an attack with little 
or no warning as well as a major mobilization and deployment by the 
Warsaw Pact. 
1. The Current Situation 
At present, the United States and its allies in NATO have sufficient 
active forces to maintain an acceptable ratio of defense-to-offense 
against either type of attack. However, it would be a mistake to conclude 
that, because of an acceptable ratio, we have high confidence of conducting 
a successful forward defense in all instances. NATO forces are badly 
positioned to cope with a short-warning attack by deployed Pact units 
(one U.S. division is on the wrong side of the Rhine); they would probably 
be slow in their response to such an attack because of readiness problems; 
and NATO does not have the streamlined and ready command structure necessary 
to deal with a short-warning, fast-moving battle, a sufficiently responsive 
logistics system, or the central reserves necessary to pinch off a major 
enemy salient.

A full-scale, reinforced attack would require the Warsaw Pact to take 
as much as a month to deploy the additional 29 divisions and 900 aircraft 
from the western military districts of the USSR, make ready a full 87-
division force, and launch a well-coordinated offensive. Even assuming 
that NATO would have no more than 23 days in which to respond, the alliance 
should be able to mobilize a capability sufficient to contain an attack of 
this magnitude. But whether warning time would be fully utilized, whether 
reinforcements from the United States would arrive early enough to stem 
the Pact offensive, and whether the alliance would have sufficient staying 
power to outlast the Pact, continue to be the most disturbing uncertainties 
facing NATO. 
The U.S. strategic airlift capability remains seriously deficient both in 
total capacity and in the capacity to move the necessary outsize cargos. 
Allied and U.S. war reserve stocks remain below what are considered prudent 
levels for a conflict lasting more than a few weeks. Firepower ratios 
favor the Pact. The main line of communciations to the front is excessively 
exposed. NATO could not be sure of winning the initial battle on the frontier. 
2. Future Prospects 
As to the future, the outcome of a Pact attack on NATO becomes even 
less certain. The Soviets may well continue to add manpower to their 
forces in Eastern Europe, and they seem likely to continue increasing and 
modernizing their firepower, mobility, non-divisional support, and frontal

aviation; they will probably improve still further their nuclear and 
chemical warfare capabilities, which are already formidable. As they do 
so, NATO deficiencies in artillery, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers 
will become more serious. If uncorrected, force and firepower ratios 
could become dangerously unfavorable. 
Adjustments in the current Five-Year Defense Program to repair these 
prospective weaknesses in U.S. forces are required. Our allies must also 
do more. Contrary to conventional wisdom, NATO may have enough manpower 
to stem both the short-warning and the full-scale attack, but without 
prompt remedial action, the alliance may lack the necessary firepower and 
mobility to enable that manpower to do its job, especially if the current 
qualitative advantage in fighter-attack aircraft weakens. 
D. The Conventional Balance in Northeast Asia 
Despite recent events in Korea, the military situation in Northeast 
Asia is relatively stable. It should remain stable for the foreseeable 
future, provided the United States maintains an adequate presence in that 
vital region. The main test of the posture there would come from an 
attack on South Korea. The North Koreans might launch such an attack 
without major external assistance. If they did, the South Koreans could 
have some difficulty containing an attack north of Seoul without the 
support of some U.S. ground, air, and logistical units. In the unlikely 
event that the North Koreans received major external assistance, substantial 
U.S. support would be required to help maintain a forward defense north of 
Seoul. 
The U.S. division in Korea, in addition to its deterrent function, 
provides both an initial response capability and the base on which deploy-
ments could be made in the event of a major attack. The Marine amphibious 
force in Japan (Okinawa) and theater air forces could provide additional 
reinforcements in the short-run. Additional air and ground forces, if 
needed, could be deployed in a timely fashion to contain a large-scale 
attack, provided, of course, that the needed U.S. forces had not been 
committed previously to another theater. The forces programmed for a 
minor contingency help reduce the risk that the United States could not 
respond in Northeast Asia in the event of a need to withhold substantial 
forces for Europe. 
E. The Maritime Balance 
The main test of U.S. naval forces comes precisely from the possibility 
of having to deal with a major contingency in Europe and the threat of one 
in Northeast Asia, with the accompanying requirement to ensure the sea 
lines of communication to these two theaters, the Mediterranean, and 
Persian Gulf. Soviet cruise-missile and torpedo attack submarines represent

These forces might be able to deny us access to waters adjacent 
to the USSR and full initial use of the eastern Mediterranean. However, 
present U.S. naval capabilities, in conjunction with those of our allies, 
should be able to ensure the delivery of essential tonnage to Europe and 
Japan during the first three months of a war, and gain virtually unimpeded 
control of the seas thereafter. Despite this expected outcome, losses 
of both combatant and merchant tonnage could be heavy, and could jeopardize 
seriously the U.S. ability to sustain land and tactical air operations 
in Europe and Asia. Because of this risk, and projected improvements in 
the Soviet fleet, the time has come to move systematically toward a 
posture capable of earlier and more decisive sea control.

Seven major conclusions of our recent study of the maritime problem

-- The Soviet maritime threat constitutes a substantial and growing 
challenge to the United States and its free access to the seas. The 
main components of that threat are: 
Lhe Soviet submarine fleet;

- the Soviet naval aircraft, including the Backfire, equipped 
with sophisticated air-to-surface, antiship missiles. 
- the Soviet surface fleet equipped with antiship missiles 
when at firing range; 
Our allies have a substantial maritime capability which can, 
and should be considered to augment U.S. capabilities. 
-- The rate at which the U.S. Navy is rebuilt should nonetheless  
be accelerated to meet the Soviet challenge. 
-- In the expansion of the Navy, continued emphasis should go to  
improving the U.S. ASW capability. The Soviet Union has the world's 
largest submarine fleet; numerically, it is three times larger than 
ours. U.S. attack submarines are quieter and have a better sonar suite 
than their Soviet counterparts. The U.S. Mark-48 torpedo is effective 
against deep, fast-running targets. U.S. air ASW platforms -- the P-3 
and S-3 -- have improved sonobuoys and acoustic processors. The Underwater 
Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) is being upgraded and expanded. The 
tactical towed array sonar and the LAMPS helicopter now under development 
promise to add a new dimension to the ASW capability of the surface 
fleet. When operational, these systems will provide a major improvement 
in the local ASW defenses of convoys, underway replenishment groups, and 
amphibious forces. However, the number of surface combatants presently 
authorized is not sufficient to provide an adequate capability against 
the Soviet submarine threat. Equally important, should some cruise 
missile launching submarines go undetected and launch their missiles, 
the ability of U.S. naval forces to defend against these missiles is 
inadequate. 
-- This is one dimension of the problem. There is also a major  
deficiency in the U.S. capability to meet the more general antiship cruise  
missile threat, especially the high-density threat posed by air-launched  
missiles. Land-based Soviet naval aircraft operating from fields in the 
Black Sea area can attack shipping throughout the Mediterranean. From 
northern fleet bases, the Backfire can range deep into the Atlantic to 
strike resupply and reinforcement convoys to Europe. In the Pacific, 
the Backfire can reach areas south of Hawaii, making U.S. resupply of 
Hawaii, Japan, and Korea increasingly difficult. The introduction of 
the F-14/Phoenix system has brought a major improvement in the ability 
of the carriers to defend against this type of attack. There will, 
nonetheless, be situations where significant numbers of hostile bombers 
could penetrate the interceptor screen to launch air-to-surface missiles 
that must be met by the surface-to-air missile systems of the surface 
forces. Needed capabilities can be acquired with a mix of AEGIS-equipped 
DDG-47 destroyers, CSGN strike cruisers, and FFG-7 frigates. 
-- The major platform for sea control will continue to be the large-
deck carrier through the 1990s. However, in view of advancing technology and

i-he high cost ot new carriers, we must find new ways to put aircratt over 
The world's seas. Through a vigorous Service Life Extension Program 
SLEP) for the carriers, the United States can keep a total of 12 large-
deck carriers in the force into the 1990s. The extension program will 
hegin in the early 1980s and continue into the 1990s. 
The President, in addition, has decided to move toward smaller air-
apable ships and V/STOL aircraft because of the large unit investment 
-e.presented by the NIMITZ class carrier and the prospective technological 
advances in the threat (particularly Soviet satellite surveillance 
!;ystems coupled with advanced offensive strike capabilities). In these 
circumstances, development of less costly, flexible replacements for 
iarge-deck carriers must be pursued. That is why the President, last 
May, proposed budget amendments to accelerate research and development 
oa several new technologies related to V/STOL aircraft. antiship missiles, 
=ocuise missiles, and long-range, land-based aircraft. 
Once combatant ship force levels are established, the in-
creased needs for specialized support and auxiliary ships must be addressed. 
Vhere is little doubt that the requirement for sustained overseas deploy-
ments and operations oi the U.S. Fleet will continue, as will the need 
,or modern support ships. 
The Production Balance 
A determined adversary who sees that the United States is intent on 
eaiing off one avenue of potential attack could well look for others. 
In the past, we have seen precisely this process in the growing Soviet 
:Ilipport for "wars of national liberation" as the opportunities for more 
conventional political and military gain diminished. Now, as Soviet 
military technologies grow more mature, there may well be yet another 
-;earch for Western vulnerabilities. 
To take the critical case of the military balance in Europe as an 
,-xample, its stability depends on the U.S. ability to defeat either an 
attack with little or no warning or a full-scale attack launched by the 
T'act after a period of intense mobilization and deployment. But there 
still another possibility. As the Soviets have expanded their military 
orces, they have increased their considerable war production base. 
They are moving into a position to surge their output of war materiel 
and marry it 1.11) with trained manpower (in the form of reservists) to 
produce, over a period of about 18 months, a substantially expanded 
.2.ombat capability. To the extent the Soviets believed the United States 
could not compete with such a surge, it could be persuasively argued 
dithin their councils that it would pay them to engage in a war production 
race before embarking on any large-scale adventure.

Given this possibility, two questions should be asked: 
--- how many equipped and combat-ready units could the Soviets 
raise after 18 months of intense mobilization? 
-- what response could the United States make during the same 
time with its current war production base? 
As far as can be estimated, the Soviets have enough recently trained 
reservists so that, within 18 months, they could add an increment to 
their general purpose forces of about 1.3 million men. At the same 
time, they could produce around 1,600 additional front-line aircraft, 
together with, enough equipment sets, spares, and other materiel to 
support the additional forces. 
In an equivalent period of time, the United States would be able to 
call up and ready its Guard and Reserve forces, amounting to one million 
men. Of this total, 8 Army divisions and about 12 tactical wing equivalents 
(with over 800 aircraft) would have their equipment, as would a Marine 
Amphibious Force. The current war production base surged to maximum 
capacity, could (by diverting deliveries from intended FMS recipients) 
provide the materiel for another 10 divisions and the aircraft for 4 additional

wings. The total U.S. force, including both high-priority Guard and 
Reserve and essentially new units, would comprise about 3.1 million men 
and 5,500 aircraft. By the standard tests of force and firepower ratios, 
this new force could probably neutralize the increment to the threat 
added by the Soviets over a comparable period of time. 
Too much should not be made of this comparison at the present time. 
It is worth noting, however, that if such an assessment is even reasonably 
accurate, the main constraint on the United States, ironically enough, 
is not trained manpower but military equipment and supplies. The greatest 
industrial nation in the world ought to be in a better position to deal 
with such a contingency. 
G. The Basic Choice 
A little more than forty years ago, Winston Churchill had these 
somber words to say about his country: 
"I have watched this famous island descending incontinently, fecklessly, 
the stairway which leads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at 
the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on 
there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break 
beneath your feet." 
The United States must not follow that path. We have been born to 
freedom; we must be wise enough, purposeful enough, and strong enough to 
preserve that freedom.

XIV. CONCLUSIONS 
Assessments of the international military situation and of the U.S. 
contribution to deterrence, make it clear that the United States faces a 
number of difficult but manageable security problems in the years ahead. 
We have not entered a static phase of history; ours is a dynamic 
age. In part, the momentum comes from the revolution in technology, the 
breakup of old empires, and the frictions of growing economic inter-
dependence. Global tensions understandably exist. 
We must not mistake such frictions for the main problem. The 
principal cause of international instability lies elsewhere. It lies in 
the Soviet Union -- with its combination of beliefs and military power --
and there is no pretending to the contrary. 
A. The Problem 
The United States seeks peaceful relations with the Soviet Union. 
The United States has continued, cautiously, to believe that the current 
Soviet leaders will probably see it in their interest to seek hegemony 
by peaceful means, and avoid a direct conflict with the United States. 
But the Soviets understand violence well, and have the connoisseur's 
taste for the psychological and political uses of military power. It 
should come as no surprise, therefore, that they are in deadly earnest 
about their military programs, that stability -- as we have defined 
it -- apparently concerns them less than it does us, that they have 
designed their forces -- nuclear as well as non-nuclear -- for warfighting 
purposes, and that they proceed toward their force planning objectives 
with persistence. Self-restraint in the expectation that we will follow 
their example has not been a part of their doctrine or their pattern; 
neither has reciprocity on their part for restraint on ours. Western 
weakness and irresolution are not examples the Soviets are likely to 
emulate, but an opportunity to seize. If international peace and stability 
are to be preserved, the United States must cope with these predispositions 
rather than expect the Soviets suddenly and uncharacteristically to 
adopt ours. 
3. Arresting Adverse Trends 
In FY 1977, the United States has set in motion programs intended 
to arrest the decline in U.S. capabilities relative to those of the 
USSR. The task now is to stay on that path, preserve the stability of 
the main balances of power, and ensure the future adequacy of the U.S. 
defense posture, despite the magnitude and velocity of Soviet military 
programs. To do so, the level of the Five-Year Defense Program must be 
raised. To do less would be able to take unnecessary risks with our 
nation's future.

C. The Conditions of Security 
Deterrence and stability remain the prerequisites of security and 
peace in this last quarter of the 20th century. Our country's ability 
to contribute to deterrence and stability must be foremost in considering 
the design of the U.S. defense posture. Our three major capabilities --
strategic nuclear, theater nuclear, and conventional -- must be maintained. 
Each must have the responsiveness, flexibility, and effectiveness necessary 
to permit the appropriate action in support of U.S. security objectives. 
Only under those conditions can it be said that we have a credible 
deterrent. 
1. The Strategic Nuclear Posture 
The strategic nuclear posture must satisfy six requirements: 
It must be able to survive a large-scale surprise attack. 
-- It must be able, if necessary, and be seen as able, to cause a 
high level of destruction in the mission of assured retaliation. 
129 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21S.F&MDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
Approved For Release 2002/08/21 : CIA-RDP80-00473A000600100011-7 
SECRET 
it must be designed to implement options short of full-scale 
retaliation so as to be able to avoid unnecessary escalation. 
-- It must contain programmatic and R&D hedges against an effort 
by the Soviets to create a strategic asymmetry unfavorable to the United 
States. 
ft must be, and be seen as, equivalent to the Soviet strategic 
posture in force effectiveness. 
-- And it must be tailored so as to comply with existing arms 
control agreements and encourage equitable agreements in the future. 
2. The Theater Nuclear Posture 
We can be no less stringent in the demands on the theater nuclear 
forces. They too must be capable of riding out a surprise attack in 
sufficient numbers to execute a variety of theater-related plans. They. 
too must be designed to minimize unnecessary collateral damage. They 
too must permit appropriate responses. 
3. The Conventional Posture 
The United States must not be in the position of having to cross 
the nuclear threshold for lack of other choices. Nuclear forces are an 
Inadequate deterrent to many contingencies. Accordingly, the U.S. conven-
tional posture continues to be essential to deterrence, stability, and 
security. We must have the conventional capability, in conjunction with 
our allies, to maintain a forward defense in Europe against a Warsaw 
Pact attack, whether atter little or no warning or after a period of 
mobilization and deployment. This capability must also be sufficient to 
allow for a prior U.S. response to a minor contingency. We can and must 
continue to contribute to peace and stability in the Western Pacific as 
well as Europe and to the deterrence of sudden attacks in these two 
vital regions. 
4. Other Capabilities 
The U.S. command-control-communications network is indispensable to 
our entire defense posture; it must have the survivability, reliability, 
capacity, and security to implement the decisions of the National Command 
Authorities. 
To complement U.S. active forces and their reserve components, security 
assistance programs are necessary to help strategically located friends, 
maintain access to necessary facilities overseas, substitute where 
possible for U.S. forces, and stabilize regional balances.

Both U.S. and allied forces need to be combat-ready and capable of 
sustained operations. Without modern equipment, adequate supplies, 
adequate maintenance, and realistic training, their size and composition 
will not avail. They must be able, and be seen as able, to fight. 
Strategic mobility is essential to their flexibility and combat effectiveness. 
To support this posture, the United States requires a solid program 
of research and development, and a production base sufficient to supply 
current needs and permit a surge capability as necessary. 
D. Major Objectives 
The programmed force structure, with the exception of the Navy's 
general purpose forces, should meet U.S. security needs insofar as they 
can now be anticipated. U.S. requirements can be met in the years 
ahead, given the present situation, at a military personnel level of 
about 2 million men and women. However, if we are to have reasonable 
confidence of meeting the growing Soviet military challenge as we now 
assess it, there are seven major requirements to meet during the course 
of the new Five-Year Defense Program. It will be necessary to: 
1. Strengthen U.S. strategic nuclear capabilities and accelerate 
those development programs necessary to balance any efforts by the 
Soviets to develop major offensive and defensive damage-limiting capa-
bilities. 
2. Increase the firepower, armor, air defenses, and tactical 
mobility of U.S. land forces to meet the growing Soviet emphasis on 
surprise, maneuver, and concentrated fire. 
3. Accelerate the equipment and modernization of the 26-wing 
tactical air force, to improve deterrence of a Warsaw Pact attack through 
the ability to defeat a Soviet air offensive, disrupt enemy lines of 
communication into the battlefield, and disperse armor-heavy forces. 
4. Expand U.S. strategic airlift capacity to meet long-range 
mobility requirements, and preposition additional division sets of 
equipment in Europe to compensate, in part, for the refusal by Congress 
to support the more cost-effective Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAP) 
modifications. 
5. Accelerate progress toward a modern Navy based on 12 carrier 
task forces and a two-ocean ASW capability to provide the necessary sea 
control, power projection, and peacetime presence, in the face of the 
growing worldwide reach of the Soviet maritime capability. 
6. Flesh out U.S. division sets and war reserve stocks in Europe 
and reduce major maintenance and overhaul backlogs so that scarce active 
capabilities are ready and in a position to sustain combat.

SECRET 
7. Increase investment in research, development, test, and evaluation, 
(RDICE), procurement, and the production base in recognition that, as 
Soviet technology matures, numbers of systems will be as crucial as 
their sophistication. 
E. The Costs 
These are the requirements. Meeting them will necessitate a higher 
Five-Year Defense Program than was presented last year. Total costs of 
the additional effort over the five-year planning period will amount to 
approximately $15 billion (in FY 1978 dollars). The benefits of continued 
confidence in the U.S. security position will be worth the cost. 
F. The Task 
More than 30 years have passed since the end of World War II. This 
modest record of relative peace nonetheless surpasses the 20-year interval 
between the first and second of this century's great wars. That we have 
come so far cannot be attributed to restraint and cooperation by others. 
Technology, and some luck, have undoubtedly played their part. Above 
all, however, the steadfastness and strength of the United States have 
brought us this still uneasy but priceless peace. 
Friend and foe will judge our determination by our actions. With 
support for the programs outlined here, and described in detail in 
Section II of this Report, it will be clear to all that we value our 
freedom and our independence -- and intend to preserve them for those 
who follow.

I. THE NUCLEAR FORCES 
A. Strategic Forces 
L. Strategic Offensive Forces and Programs 
a. The Basis for the Program 
U.S. force planning continues to emphasize programs to ensure a 
fully credible second-strike strategic deterrent. As indicated in 
Section I, assessments reveal a need for systems with increased military 
effectiveness and survivability in order to: 
-- counter projected improvements in Soviet offensive systems and 
damage-limiting capabilities; 
improve survivability under a potentially heavier Soviet attack; 
-- accommodate reasonable growth projections in the number of Soviet 
targets; and 
meet the needs of our targeting doctrine. 
Force planning under current policy is constrained by the numerical 
Limitations of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), and in particular, 
those limitations anticipated in light of the Vladivostok Accord. Current 
U.S. force planning through FY 1986 is depicted in Chart I-1 on the next 
page, and is consistent with these limitations. Similarly, projections of 
Soviet force capabilities assume that they, too, will be constrained by the 
proposed SALT limits, although the USSR has the capacity to exceed these 
Limits. U.S. forces programmed through FY 1982 are shown in Table 2 of 
the appendix. 
Given the objective of deterrence, which relies most heavily on the 
military effectiveness of our retaliatory forces under a variety of possible 
circumstances, there are a number of factors which must be considered in 
shaping our forces. We must: 
-- have strong confidence in the ability of U.S. strategic forces, 
individually and collectively, to absorb and survive a large scale, enemy 
first strike and still mount a second strike in retaliation. 
-- be alert to the age of U.S. strategic forces, taking timely steps 
to enhance the effectiveness of aging systems as Soviet modernization de-
grades their capabilities, and to replace obsolete systems when cost and 
effectiveness considerations dictate. Further, U.S. planning must be 
sensitive to the pace of future deployments to prevent, to the extent 
possible, future block obsolescence of strategic force elements.
