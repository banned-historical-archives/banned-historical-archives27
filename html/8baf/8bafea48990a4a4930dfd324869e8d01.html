BIOGRAPHIC BRIEF 
Chou En-lai is a member of the triumvirate 
ruling in Peking today. Although 73 years old, he 
is the only one of the top three with sufficient 
vigor to conduct the day-to-day affairs of the 
nation. For protocol purposes Chou acts as Chief 
of State. As Premier, he has run the government 
since the People's Republic was established in 1949. 
Foreign affairs, which he conducts with consummate 
skill, has long been his particular specialty. He 
is more than just an able administrator and diplo-
mat, however. His status has been enhanced since 
the Cultural Revolution (1966-68), and he now 
exercises a strong influence on a wide range of 
domestic as well as foreign policy matters. In 
1970 he was put in charge of the task of rebuilding 
the Communist Party apparatus, thus making him de 
facto secretary general. In short, Chou serves as 
Mao Tse-tung's chief executive of the country and 
of the party. 
Chou has reached his present position of 
eminence after decades of struggle and subtle com-
promise. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 
1924, but it was not until 1935 that he gave his 
support to Mao Tse-tung, to whom he has been stead-
fastly loyal ever since. Chou has remained in the 
inner circle of leaders continuously since that time. 
Chou En-lai is well-known abroad, where he has 
long been the best salesman of Peking's accomplish-
ments and policies. He is known to be a tough, 
patient negotiator, while his evident talent, charm 
and flexibility enhance his effectiveness as a 
diplomat.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
Member, Standing Committee, 
Politburo, Chinese Communist 
Party Central Committee; 
Premier, State Council, 
People's Republic of China; 
Chairman, Chinese People's 
Political Consultative 
Congress 
Chou En-lai, now in 
his early 70's, is the 
third-ranking Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) 
leader and the most 
active member of the 
inner circle of leader-
ship. He is known 
abroad as China's lead-
ing diplomat, but he is 
her leading statesman as 
well, having been Premier since 1949 and the 
senior nonmilitary CCP figure since 1966. Minis-
ter of Foreign Affairs for the first decade of the 
regime, he resigned the post in 1958 but has re-
tained a leading role in foreign policy formation 
and a flim grip on its administration. 
CHOU En-lai 
(0719/1869/0171) 
Chou communicates reasonableness to his 
hearers, and this, with his charm, has made him 
the most popular Chinese Communist leader abroad. 
Chou's popularity at home is also considerable. 
What he lacks in charisma is partly offset by 
affability and other more homespun political 
qualities. He is a proponent of social order, 
stability and a productive economy. He worked 
to curb extremism during the Cultural Revolution 
between 1966 and 1968. Chou also adroitly managed 
to ride out the more extreme leftist swings of 
the political pendulum, however, and never openly 
appeared to lose the confidence of Mao Tse-tung 
and Lin Piao. Militant Maoists who tried to 
attack Chou in the spirit of revolutionary 
criticism found him beyond reach.

Principal Positions  
Chou is a member of the Politburo of the Ninth 
Central Committee (CCP-CC) and of its elite Stand-
ing Committee. This committee consisted originally 
of Mao, Lin Piao, Chou, and two lesser lights, 
ideologist Ch'en Po-ta and security figure K'ang 
Sheng, but may now consist only of Mao, Lin and 
Chou. Chou does not sit on the Military Commission 
of the CCP-CC, headed by Mao and Lin, but his 
personal influence with its members is undeniable. 
China's first and only Premier, Chou since 1949 
has presided over the civil administration of the 
country--foreign affairs, civil government at lower 
levels, economy, security, and, to a degree, military 
affairs. (In 1967, for example, he gave direct 
orders to regional military authorities.) 
Since 1954 Chou has also been chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress 
(CPPCC), a national assembly of persons nominally 
representative of all occupational sectors, classes 
and preexisting parties in China. Now a rubber-
stamp organization, the CPPCC is historically senior 
to the National People's Congress (NPC), whose 
chairman is Chu Te. 
Relations with Lin and Mao  
Chou has been outraAked by Lin Piao, Mao's 
designated successor, since 1966. There is little 
reason to consider Chou's status as markedly inferior 
to that of Lin; Mao would scarcely have established 
Lin in second position without the agreement of 
Chou, the man whose support Lin needs most. Second 
rank--that of the heir apparent--is a delicate 
position, and there is reason to suspect that Chou 
has for many years deliberately spurned it, 
believing that he can operate more effectively in 
the number-three slot.

IN STEP WITH MAO. MAO, LIN AND CHOU AT FEBRUARY 
1968 CULTURAL REVOLUTION MEETING 
Chou and Mao are the sole surviving members 
of the pre-1928 CCP-CC. Between 1928 and January 
1934, a period when Mao was excluded from the CCP 
inner circle, Chou was at times much more influen-
tial than Mao. In their post-1928 activities Mao 
and Chou appeared as two strong leaders who worked 
often in separate and conflicting spheres, during 
a particularly trying period. It was between 
early 1931 and early 1933 that party headquarters 
moved from Shanghai to Kiangsi. Chou was on the 
Politburo at most times, working with leaders who 
were more or less at odds with Mao. 
Chou's own relationship with Mao was obscure 
until the historic January 1935 conference of the 
party at Tsuni, at the start of the retreat to 
the northwest called the Long March. At this 
conference Chou gave his full loyalty and public 
deference to Mao, who emerged for the first time as 
undisputed leader of the CCP. Since then the two 
men seem to have had a uniquely personal private 
relationship in which they have apparently meshed 
their respective talents.

Chou has remained firmly established in Mao's small 
entourage of fully trusted helpers. In foreign 
affairs, especially, he has spoken with particularly 
great authority. 
Personal Stature 
In the 1949-66 period, Chou was chiefly an 
administrator, but he emerged from the 1966-69 
Cultural Revolution as Mao's chief executive in 
party as well as governmental affairs. He has 
entirely reclaimed the reins of governmental con-
trol from the encroachments of party administrators 
after 1956. Within the party he is now more influ-
ential than at any time since the early 1930's, and 
he is currently engaged in the delicate task of 
putting together a new party apparatus. 
Chou has proved his administrative competence 
and political toughness in over 40 years of service, 
beginning in 1924, when he first joined the CCP 
as an already experienced activist. He tends to 
come forward in such times of stress as the present. 
Early Life  
Chou En-lai was born around 1898 in Shaohsing, 
Chekiang Province, of an upper-class family. In 
1913 he entered the American-sponsored Nankai Middle 
School in Tientsin. Graduating in 1917, he, like 
Mao and others, became involved in the students' 
political study movements that matured during the 
May Fourth Movement of 1919 and became the seedbed 
of the CCP. 
Chou "studied" in Japan and again in China in 
1917-18. From 1917 on he was increasingly pre-
occupied with political agitation and apparently 
ceased serious study. He went to France in late 
1920 for a stay that lasted until 1924 and included 
a visit to Germany.

Political Commissar, 1924-35  
Chou joined the CCP in Canton in 1924. His 
first party assignment was as secretary of the 
Kwangtung provincial party headquarters. In the 
Kuomintang (KMT)-CCP united front of 1924-27, he 
held several important KMT positions and earned 
Chiang Kai-shek's regard. He was instrumental in 
placing Communists far and wide within the KMT mili-
tary forces as political workers. 
In 1925-26 Chou served as 
acting director of the Politi-
cal Department of the Whampoa 
Military Academy, of which the 
youthful and dynamic Chiang 
was director. Chou was also 
secretary there to the Russian 
adviser, Gen. V. K. Bleucher. 
In March 1926 Chou was arrested 
for clandestine Communist 
activity; although he was re-
leased by Chiang's order, his 
removal from the Whampoa Acad-
emy followed. Chiang allowed 
Chou to continue as an instruc-
tor at the KMT's Peasant 
Movement Training Institute in 
Canton. Mao Tse-tung, also an 
effective participant in the 
united front, served as the 
institute's last director 
during May-October 1926. This 
was their first known working 
association. 
AS A YOUNG SOLDIER 
Chiang also retained 
Chou in a military cadre train-
ing role. At the same time, in 
the winter of 1926-27 Chou was 
in charge of all CCP operations 
within Chiang's National Revolutionary Army, as the 
campaign against local warlords called the Northern 
Expedition began. When the united front began break-
ing apart and the CCP restructured itself, Chou became

head of the newly established Military Department 
of the CCP around the end of 1926. 
After leaving Canton, Chou went to Shanghai to 
aid in the forthcoming seizure of the city by 
Chiang Kai-shek's forces. After Chiang made his 
historic break with the Communists in April 1927, 
Chou was arrested and sentenced to death but either 
escaped or was released. 
Chou then made his way to Wuhan, where he joined 
the Central Committee and Politburo during the Fifth 
National Congress of the embattled CCP, held in 
April 1927. As reverses mounted, Chou helped Chu 
Te plan and execute the unsuccessful Nanchang 
uprising of 1 August 1927, at which the Red Army 
was born. Again fleeing, Chou went to the East 
River area of Kwangtung and subsequently into under-
ground activity in Hong Kong and Shanghai. 
By that time, Chou was a veteran indoctrinator 
and organizer and had recruited many future leaders. 
Present associates whom he knew in the years from 
1918 to 1924 include party elder Chu Te, economic 
planner Li Fu-ch'un, and the brilliant general 
Nieh Jung-chen. Among those who have since suffered 
purge was Teng Hsiao-p'ing. All five of the aging 
marshals who in 1971 are Mao's vice chairmen of the 
CCP Military Commission were in 1926 students or 
political instructors at Whampoa under Chou's 
direction. Two of them, Nieh and CCP Military Com-
mission Vice Chairman Yeh Chien-ying, are still 
among China's active leaders. 
In 1928 Chou went to the USSR, where he was a 
Chinese delegate to the sixth congresses of both the 
CCP and the Comintern. He was reelected to the 
CCP-CC and to the Politburo and was retained as head 
of the CCP Military Department. He returned to 
China in 1929, following brief attendance at the 
cadre school in Moscow then known as Sun Yat-sen 
University.

Between 1929 and the spring of 1931 Chou worked 
with the Soviet-influenced Li Li-san group in Shang-
hai, which called for "urban uprisings," and with 
the fragile Ch' en Shao-yii (Wang Ming) apparatus of 
young Russian-trained cadres. He was not associated 
with Mao then. 
In early 1931, however, KMT pressures drove Chou 
out of Shanghai and into the peasant-oriented Kiangsi 
environment dominated by Mao Tse-tung. The associa-
tion of Chu Te and Mao Tse-tung, dating from 1928, 
received a form of party sanction at the November 
1931 Juichin Conference. Mao became chairman of the 
Kiangsi Soviet established by the small, beleaguered 
Communist force rusticating at Juichin, and Chou 
was elected to the new government's central executive 
committee. 
In the years from 1931 to 1935 the Mao-Chou 
relationship was strained by the impatience of the 
Moscow-trained student leaders, supported by Chou. 
Until forced to yield at the Tsuni Conference 
(January 1935), this faction resisted the guerrilla-
minded, defensive views of Mao. 
Prior to 1935 Chou had held several senior 
military posts. He had been a member of the Central 
Revolutionary Military Council since November 1931; 
political commissar of the First Front Army, 
succeeding Mao, since August 1932; political com-
missar of the entire Red Army--mostly the troops 
of the First Front Army--since May 1933; and vice 
chairman of the Central Revolutionary Military 
Council since January 1934. At Tsuni, however, 
Chou yielded to Mao the position of Red Army 
political commissar. Mao became head of the Mili-
tary Affairs Committee, with Chou a vice chairman. 
(The committee and the council were soon merged, and 
Chou remained a vice chairman into the late 1940's.) 
United Front Work, 1936-49  
Chou's wartime career revolved around the 
second united front, a Comintern-stimulated frame-
work of KMT-CCP cooperation against the Japanese. 
Chou became the senior CCP negotiator with the 
Nationalists.

The 1936 Sian Incident became the cornerstone of 
Chou's wartime career. In December 1936 Chiang 
Kai-shek was kidnaped at Sian, in Shensi Province, 
by Nationalist-connected military rebels, whom 
Chou had previously induced to stop fighting on 
Chiang's behalf against the Communists. Chou and 
several associates negotiated with the rebels for 
Chiang's release. This episode led to suspension 
of KMT operations against the Communists and 
initiated the negotiation of CCP-KMT collaboration 
against the Japanese. After early 1938 Chou assumed 
a permanent role as the chief CCP liaison official 
with the Nationalist regime in Wuhan and then in 
Chungking. As a token of their sincerity, the 
Nationalists readmitted Chou to the KMT and made him 
a member of the ruling military body of free China. 
In September 1939, as the Russians and Japanese 
were terminating their miniwar, Chou went to Moscow 
where he remained for several months. He returned 
to Chungking in June 1940 for a 3-year stay. Lin 
Piao joined Chou in 1942-43 for serious military 
talks with the Nationalists. 
Chou returned to Yenan in mid-1943, and in 
1944 he began preparatory work aimed at creating 
a coalition government with the KMT to avert a 
civil war. US Ambassador Patrick Hurley added his 
influence to help keep the coalition negotiations 
going into early 1945. Through him Chou secured 
Chinese Communist representation by party elder 
Tung Pi-wu at the April 1945 San Francisco Conference 
on International Organization, which established the 
United Nations. 
These efforts proved impossible, and fighting 
between Colludunists and Nationalists, never entirely 
nonexistent, expanded in August 1945, even as Chou 
and Mao were in Chungking negotiating with Chiang 
Kai-shek over the shape of postwar China. The 
negotiations failed and civil war broke out in 
earnest, leading ultimately to a Communist military 
victory. Chou returned to Yenan in November 1946 
and was occupied with party and military questions.

MAO, A JAPANESE FRIEND, AMBASSADOR HURLEY, CHU TE 
AND CHOU IN YENAN, NOVEMBER 1944 
He was with Mao after the Communists evacuated Yenan 
in March 1947 until Mao went to Peking in 1949. In 
late March 1949 Chou offered surrender terms to a 
Nationalist delegation that had sought negotiations. 
Their rejection ended for him a 25-year career of 
united front work with the KMT. 
Despite having originally borne the Soviet 
trademark, the united front as a political device 
for cooperation with non-Communists is one of Chou's 
preferred methods. He learned to use it in the 
1920's and worked effectively through it in the 
1930's and 1940's to cooperate with, then .use, and 
finally undermine the Chinese Nationalists. The 
new regime was founded in 1949 on the basis of a 
united front of all domestic political groupings 
and interests, embodied in the CPPCC. This wide-
spectrum body legitimized the People's Republic of 
China, and under a "Common Program," which had been 
drafted under Chou's direction, served for 5 years 
as China's only "legislature."

Chou used the united front concept again in 
the mid-1950's in his initially promising contacts 
with "Third World" countries, and again in 1970-71, 
with the winding down of the Vietnam war, in dealings 
involving the front groups of Cambodia, Laos and 
South Vietnam. 
Premier and Diplomat 1949 On  
In 1949 Chou oversaw the staffing and establish-
ment of the government and the creation of a Foreign 
Service. On 1 October the new government was 
inaugurated, and Chou assumed an array of positions 
suited to his wide-ranging responsibilities--member 
of the Central People's Government Council (CPGC), 
Premier of the Government Administration Council 
(GAC), Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Chairman of 
the Chinese Revolutionary Military Council (RMC), 
executive board member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship 
Association, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee 
of the Foreign Ministry, and honorary chairman of 
the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. 
The Premier then began wide-ranging diplomacy 
pertaining to the forging of trade and economic 
agreements, to the Korean war, to Indochina, to 
the status of Taiwan, and to UN relationships. His 
most important diplomatic service was to support 
Mao in negotiations with 
Stalin In early 1950 
he concluded a set of 
Sino-Soviet agreements 
capped by the 14 Febru-
ary Sino-Soviet Treaty 
of Friendship, Alliance 
and Mutual Assistance, 
providing for joint 
military action to re-
pel aggression by Japan 
or "any state allied 
with Japan-" From 
June 1950 to July 1953 
he was preoccupied 
with the Korean war, 
but he went twice to

Moscow in that period, once in August 1952 with a 
military and industrial delegation, and again in 
March 1953 for Stalin's funeral. 
Supreme legislative, executive and judicial 
power was at this time--1949-54--exercised by the 
CPGC, chaired by Mao personally as Head of State. 
Chou attended most of its 34 meetings in those years, 
beside chairing 224 sessions of his own GAC, and 
thus was an important decisionmaker. 
In January 1953 Chou was appointed to chair 
the committee to draft the new 1954 state consti-
tution establishing the NPC, a rubber-stamp legisla-
ture, alongside the CPPCC, which remained the 
representative but powerless organ of the entire 
Chinese people. The new NPC reorganized and 
civilianized the central government and placed the 
State Council over the governmental organs. Chou 
retained both the Premiership and the Foreign 
Ministry. The CPPCC was enlarged and continued 
with Chou as its Chairman. (The CPPCC was enlarged 
again in 1958 and in 1964; it has not met since 
1964.) 
Chou's 1954-55 diplomacy established him on 
the world scene as a would-be spokesman of the Third 
World countries in what came to be known as the 
"Spirit of Bandung." 
Prior to the April-July 1954 discussions on 
Korea and Indochina at the Geneva Foreign Ministers 
Conference, China concluded economic and cultural 
agreements with Mongolia and North Korea. At the 
Geneva Conference, Chou made China a signatory to 
the agreement that ended hostilities in Indochina. 
Returning via India and Burma, he signed trade 
agreements and began to publicize the Five Prin-
ciples of Coexistence. Because they appeared first 
in the preamble to the Sino-Indian treaty on trade 
with Tibet, Chou shares credit of authorship with 
the late Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. 
The principles are mutual respect for territorial 
integrity and sovereignty; nonaggression; noninter-
ference in internal affairs; equality and mutual 
benefit; and peaceful coexistence in international 
relations.

The principles are still useful to him in 
arguing China's strength, independence, elevated 
revolutionary purpose, and self-restraint. His 
participation in devising this formula required 
neither inventiveness nor courage. "Peaceful 
coexistence" was a vogue phrase of the day, already 
much used by the Soviets. The "principles" were 
in part an expansion of terms of foreign inter-
course previously voiced by Mao before the takeover 
at a preparatory meeting of the new Political Con-
sultative Conference on 15 June 1949: 
We are willing to discuss with any 
foreign government the establishment 
of diplomatic relations on the basis 
of the principles of equality, mutual 
benefit, and mutual respect for ter-
ritorial integrity and sovereignty, 
provided it is willing to sever rela-
tions with Chinese reactionaries... 
and adopts an attitude of genuine, 
and not hypocritical, friendship to-
wards People's China. 
Chou therefore was loyally expressing Mao's policies 
in this formula and was not taking a personal 
initiative. 
In the fall Chou completed the negotiation 
with Soviet Premier Khrushchev of an end to the 
last symbols of Russian imperialism, a set of 
special privileges in Manchuria and Sinkiang, and 
secured the expansion of Soviet assistance to China. 
Reacting to US leadership in the formation of 
the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in late 1954, 
five countries called a 29-nation Afro-Asian Con-
ference at Bandung in Indonesia for April 1955. 
Chou turned the conference into a personal triumph, 
making himself and China the champions of anti-
imperialism, independence and neutralism. 
The Hungarian revolution of 1956 interrupted 
for Chou an auspicious goodwill tour of South and 
Southeast Asia. Chou was at first publicly critical 
of the Soviets ("great-nation chauvinism") before he

expanded his trip to include visits to Moscow, 
Warsaw and Budapest. The tone of his statements 
then changed swiftly to remarks supporting bloc 
solidarity, papering over any public offence to the 
Soviets by his earlier words. This unanticipated 
event nevertheless gave China its first chance to 
question the political dominance of the USSR in 
world Communism and to act in the role of a media-
tor between the USSR and its satellites. 
Pressure from Teng Hsiao-p'ing  
The 1956 CCP constitution, presented by Teng 
Hsiao-p'ing, was non-Maoist in tone and altered 
the decisionmaking machinery. Replacing Chou in 
intraparty influence was the energetic and incisive 
Teng, then in his fifties but a rising star who 
became CCP First Secretary and Politburo member in 
1954 and General Secretary of the CCP-CC in 1956. 
A new policymaking organ, the Politburo Standing 
Committee, replaced the old Secretariat that had 
previously acted for the Politburo. Its members 
were those of the Secretariat--Mao, Liu Shao-ch'i, 
Chou, Chu Te and Ch'en Teng (Lin Piao was 
added in 1958). 
In the CCP structure a new, elected administra-
tive Secretariat was constituted to interpret policy 
and to manage the expanding CCP and its evolving 
relationships with the government. Chou was not 
a part of the new Secretariat; the new instruments 
of CCP control were not of his devising and did 
nothing to conserve his previous influence. One 
of the quirks of the Eighth Central Committee, 
elected in 1956, was that Chou could remain the 
third-ranking member of the Politburo while slipping 
to fifth place on the new CCP-CC, after Mao, Liu, 
Teng and Chu Te, because the rankings were based on 
votes. Liu Shao-ch'i, the CCP chieftain, gained 
preeminence over Chou and by 1957 was recognized as 
Mao's probable successor.

Teng began to get into foreign affairs in the 
late 1950's. By 1961 he was displacing Chou in 
various dealings with the North Koreans and espe-
cially, though probably not completely, with the 
Soviets. In December 1963 Teng became Acting 
Premier while Chou was on a 3-month tour abroad. 
By then it was beginning to be rumored that Teng 
was engaging in anti-Chou activity. A seasoned 
Hong Kong observer noted in May 1964 that Teng, as 
"one of the hardest of the hardliners" in both 
domestic and foreign policy, seemed to be moving 
into new responsibilities and authority in govern-
mental affairs. To him, Chou, speaking for flexi-
bility and against conceit in foreign affairs, 
seemed out of contact with Mao's "doctrinarian 
aides." 
Resignation from the Foreign Ministry  
In early February 1958 Chou unexpectedly re-
signed from the Foreign Ministry. He retained his 
leading role in foreign affairs, however, relin-
quishing only the formal responsibilities of the 
post to his old associate Ch'en I. 
Troubleshooting, 1958-65  
The Great Leap Forward of 1958 disrupted 
economic administration and planning--areas of con-
cern to the Premier--but he was guardedly in favor 
of its goal of speeding up iron and steel produc-
tion, and he is now known to favor mass geographic 
dispersion of industry as well. In the ensuing 
3-year slump, Chou picked up much of the burden of 
repairing the damaged economy and became a spokesman 
for revisions of priorities and quotas. 
With the onset of Sino-Soviet difficulties 
and with the misfiring of domestic campaigns, 
policy planning became complex, and the momentum 
of China's essentially anti-Western diplomacy 
slowed while foreign policy toughened. After 1959 
Chou was trying to paper over adverse situations 
originating in the bitter Sib-Soviet competition 
for international support. In January and February 
1959, in the last glow of Sino-Soviet amity, Chou

attended the 21st CPSU Congress in Moscow and 
secured from Khrushchev what was to be the last 
installment of Soviet aid to China. 
By 1961 China was clearly competing with the 
USSR in aid offers to other countries. Chou walked 
out of the 22nd CPSU Congress in October 1961, 
breaking with Khrushchev, over criticism of Albania, 
China's client in Europe. 
In dealings with China's neighbors Chou had in 
the preceding 2 years forged a number of boundary, 
friendship and aid treaties and had traveled ex-
tensively on goodwill missions. Only with India 
did accomodation elude him until in October 1962 
a brief Chinese punitive campaign ensured borders 
located in accordance with China's views. 
Normally prescient, Chou miscalculated in 
starting out to construct a second diplomatic 
triumph like that of 1955 during a grand tour of 
Africa and the Middle East in 1963-64. With Foreign 
Minister Ch'en I he visited Albania, the United 
Arab Republic and nine other African countries 
between December 1963 and February 1964 to promote 
a second Afro-Asian conference that would exclude 
the Soviets and strengthen Chinese influence in the 
Middle East. Unaccountably, Chou defeated his own 
purpose upon his return from Africa in February 
when he upset the leaders of the countries he had 
just visited by announcing that "revolutionary pros-
pects throughout Africa are excellent." 
By fall, after China had exploded her first 
atomic bomb on 16 October, Chou issued a call for a 
summit conference of all countries to ban the use of 
nuclear weapons. In November he went to Moscow, 
in the aftermath of Khrushchev's ouster, but he 
accomplished little. 
Both internal and external affairs turned 
difficult for China in 1965. The downfall of the 
Sukarno regime in Indonesia and the possible 
escalation of the Vietnam war were incontrovertible 
signs that Chinese foreign policy was at the point 
of failure. Serious dispute over military plans

aggravated intraparty political disagreement, which 
sharpened in November when an impatient Mao allowed 
the first blow of the Cultural Revolution to fall 
on the Peking CCP Municipal Committee. It must be 
assumed that Chou was close to these developments 
from his place on the Politburo Standing Committee. 
Cl-IOU AND SUKARNO, APRIL 1965 
Chou made four trips in 1965, all between 22 
March and 7 July, keeping his hand in Middle 
Eastern and South Asian developments. He went to 
Romania, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Burma and 
Indonesia in March and April. Later in April he 
was in Djakarta for the 10th anniversary of the 
Bandung Conference. In June he went back to Egypt; 
he was also there during the first 10 days of the 
Boumediene regime in Algiers. He and his entourage 
were particularly disappointed that the Afro-Asian 
conference so long in the planning was slighted by 
Chou's erstwhile African friends, undercut by the 
USSR, and finally canceled because of the downfall 
of the planned host government, Ben Bella's Algerian 
regime. 
Chaos and Reconstruction, 1966-69  
The last efforts of the CCP machine of Liu 
Shao-ch'i and Teng Hsiao-p'ing to take the inita-
tive in Cultural Revolution campaigning were 
unsuccessful in the spring of 1966. Liu, Teng 
and the CCP Secretariat were effectively eliminated 
by August, leaving the People's Liberation Army

(PLA) and the Maoists in control. The State Council 
was also dismantled as though it were a CCP organ, 
but Chou was not blamed for its deficiencies. 
Chou stood with Mao from the start of the 
Cultural Revolution, resisting Liu and Teng and 
collaborating with Lin Piao. He maintained his 
options with the ultraleftists who thought they 
were obeying Mao, and his reported conflicts with 
Chiang Ch'ing (Mao's 
wife) never came to 
the point of a break. 
Chiang, for example, 
broke with the 
ultraleftist May 16 
Group in September 
1967 to defend Chou 
against the group's 
attempt to seize the 
reins of foreign 
policy. Chou's rela-
tions with leftists 
were nonetheless 
periodically precarious. 
In July 1966, well 
before the Red Guards 
burst forth, Chou helped 
guide and modulate 
revolutionary student activity. The August Central 
Committee plenum confi/med him, again, in third 
place behind Mao and Lin Piao. Chou attended all 
eight of the mass rallies held in Peking between 
18 August and 25 November and spoke at three. 
Speeches in which he urged "production first" aroused 
the anger of certain Red Guards, and numerous central 
organs under his authority were attacked in late 
1966. 
WITH CHIANG CHtING (MAO'S WIFE) 
AT A PEKING RALLY IN APRIL 1967 
As an unofficial adviser to the Central Cultural 
Revolution Group headed by Ch'en Po-ta and Chiang 
Ch'ing, and as Premier, Chou began in January 1967 
to mediate between the myriad factions that emerged 
everywhere to participate in setting up "revolu-
tionary" gOvernment. With varying degrees of 
success he defended many leaders, including Vice

Premiers Li Hsien-nien, Li Fu-ch'un, Ch'en I and 
Hsieh Fu-chih, but he was not able to prevent many 
demotions and forced retirements. 
Chou himself was publicly attacked; one wall 
poster accused him of protecting Vice Premier Li 
Hsien-nien and demanded (metaphorically) that Chou 
be "burned alive." Chou could offer placatory 
self-criticism but he could also turn admonitory; in 
April he bluntly said that criticism of himself 
was injudicious. 
By the end of April Chou had assumed direct 
management of the State Council staff offices for 
foreign affairs, finance and trade, and agriculture 
and forestry, as their leadership came under political 
attack. 
Serious trouble developed in Canton, and Chou 
went there in April, ostensibly to oversee prepara-
tions for the opening of the Canton Trade Fair. He 
also lent support to the hard-pressed Huang Yung-
sheng, commander of the Canton Military Region, 
who was beset by youths arriving from Peking to 
help the local Red Guard factions. 
On 14 July Chou was in Wuhan, since February a 
scene of bloody factional struggles, which were 
strangling that key industrial center. Having 
attempted to secure agreement on a solution autho-
rized by Peking, he left on the same day and was 
followed in Wuhan by two Peking emissaries. They 
continued the attempt to convey what a Japanese 
reporter called Chou En-lai's four-part instructions 
One of those instructions censured a powerful force 
that on 20 July provocatively arrested the emissaries, 
with the support of the Wuhan military Region com-
mander. Chou flew back to Wuhan on the same day, 
dramatically replaying his 1936 role in Chiang 
Kai-shek's kidnaping, to issue the orders that 
secured the release of the detainees. The event 
shocked the Peking leadership and became a Cultural 
Revolution turning point, leading first to more 
turbulence and then to suppression of disorder.

Chou never went to Shanghai, Mao's preserve, 
but he kept his hand in the Canton situation. He 
directed negotiations in Peking with provincial 
groups until in November a "preparatory group" for 
the Kwangtung Provincial Revolutionary Committee 
could finally be formed. Many other provincial 
revolutionary factions also utilized Chou's media-
tion in 1967-68. The burden on him eased only when 
policy became less permissive in the fall of 1967 
and the provincial factions began to get into line. 
A natural community of concern existed between Chou 
and the regional military commanders to see order 
reestablished, even if there were no visible bonds 
of personal commitment as a group. 
Through his ceaseless activity Chou seemed at 
times to have become the chief executive officer 
of the Cultural Revolution to the extent of even 
ordering military actions. The year 1968 became 
one of intense governmental reconstruction. Many 
decisions on economic matters, foreign policy and 
administrative rebuilding fell to Chou, the indis-
pensable man. His third-ranking position was under-
scored by the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969, 
which ended the anti-CCP phase of the Cultural 
Revolution. After the congress, K'ang Sheng was 
charged with the job of rebuilding the shattered 
party apparatus. He failed to do so, and in 1970 
the task was given to Chou. 
During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guard 
"diplomacy" seriously injured Peking's foreign 
relations. Diplomacy was in abeyance following 
the recall to China of all but one Ambassador early 
in 1967. Foreign delegations continued to arrive, 
however, and Chou made time to meet them and ex-
plain events to them. In August 1967 Red Guards 
disrupted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and went 
to such extremes as burning the British Mission. 
The latter event shocked even some radicals, and 
thereafter Chou managed to protect the integrity 
of the foreign affairs establishment fairly well 
from further attack.

Recent Activity in Domestic Affairs  
Since early 1970 there has been continuing 
pressure on the May 16 Group, a radical group of 
ultraleftists that flourished in 1967 and made 
Chou their main target. Official pressure on this 
group matured into an unpublicized but intense 
campaign, and a principal figure of the group, 
Yao Teng-shan was supposedly sentenced to death 
in June 1971. 
Chou's position seemed firm in January 1971, 
when he was reported to be closely involved in can-
didate selection for the long anticipated National 
People's Congress. Serious controversy over 
policy issues continues, but the informal community 
of interest, whether or not it can or should be 
called an alliance, continues between Chou and the 
regional military commanders and is the present 
basis of internal stability. 
Recent Activity in Foreign Affairs  
Chou returned the first group of Ambassadors 
to overseas assignments in May 1969. He left China 
for the first time in 3 years when he went to Hanoi 
in early September for the funeral of Ho Chi Minh.

Next, conferring in Peking, Chou and Premier Kosygin 
set up Sino-Soviet border talks that began in Octo-
ber. In January 1970 Chou resumed contacts with the 
United States in Warsaw after a 2-year interruption, 
and in March he made a 3-day visit to North Korea 
to terminate a long period of coolness in Sino-North 
Korean relations. 
Chou's 1971 diplomacy began with a focus on 
Indochina and has gone forward to direct dealings 
with the United States on a broad range of outstanding 
issues, including UN representation. Characteris-
tically, Chou played the leading role in the first 
"people's diplomacy" initiative toward the United 
States in April 1971 by allowing an American table 
tennis team and accompanying journalists into China. 
Contacts with the US Government culminated in the 
visit of presidential adviser Dr. Henry Kissinger to 
Peking in July 1971 for talks with Chou. One direct 
result of Kissinger's visit was an invitation ex-
tended by Chou to President Nixon to visit China 
before May 1972. 
In June Chou achieved some harmonization of 
party and state relationships between China and 
Romania when Premier Ceausescu visited China for 
8 days. Chou made lavish efforts to erase the 
memory of impatient behavior that, untypically, 
had marked a visit he made to Bucharest in 1966. 
Position in Mid-1971 
In May 1971 Chou began his third year of party-
state administration under the Ninth Party Congress 
mandate. At hcae he has begun to defuse some of 
the political and economic issues that beset the 
regime. His leadership in foreign affairs appears 
to have launched a new phase of conciliatory, 
highly visible diplomacy around the world. He 
seems to be resuming personal relations with the 
United States of the type he had in the Chungking 
period (World War II). 
The pattern of the Premier's present activity 
shows that he is approaching policy formation and 
planning by degrees and systematically. As he

works issues into potentially soluble forms, the 
probability is that he is preparing to present 
highly persuasive and moderately impressive foreign 
and domestic policy packages to the NPC, whenever 
the hard-fought delegate selection process is 
finished and the time is propitious. 
Style  
Chou's purposes, to foreigners, seem to combine 
respect for the CCP with loyalty to Mao and with  
ordinary patriotism.  
Chou gets along well with almost everyone and 
is an effective mouthpiece for Chinese Communist 
policies at home and abroad by being pleasant,  
realistic and undoqmatic.  
The people who have learned to take Chou at 
his word include those who discounted his warnings 
that China night enter the Korean war under certain 
circumstances and those in India who discounted 
China's readiness to attack the Indian Army in 1962.
