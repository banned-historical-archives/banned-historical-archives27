 mainlanders and is expected to go smoothly. Differences within this group
 over internal or foreign policy issues are unlikely to trigger a major power
 struggle.
 By the same token, Chiang's immediate successors are unlikely to under-
 take any major new policy initiatives. Thus, we expect they would initially
 seek symbolic gestures of continued US support to demonstrate that they
 can manage relations with Washington. We believe they would also
 continue to hold China at arm's length to avoid Taiwanese charges of
 negotiating with Beijing in order to perpetuate mainlander dominance on
 the island.
 We believe that no individual will dominate the immediate successor
 regime. Rather, decisions will increasingly be made by consensus among
 several powerful figures representing such key constituencies as the
 military, the party's old guard, and the security services. This collegium, in
 turn, will seek the formal ratification of the other members of the party's
 powerful Standing Committee for all major policy decisions.
 Over the longer term, a coalition of Taiwanese and younger mainlanders
 will move up, a transition that Chiang has been preparing since the mid-
 1970s. As these politicians develop more influence toward the end of this
 decade, we believe they may press for more innovative approaches to old
 domestic and foreign policy problems, including relations with the
 mainland.
 Any change they advocated in policy toward China, however, would be
 tactical and designed mainly to reduce the appearance of Taiwan intransi-
 gence. There is no indication that anyone within this group favors
 reunification on Beijing's current terms, or on anything other than perhaps
 the most nominal basis.
 Still, such proposals could create serious dissension within the leadership
 on this key political issue. Disagreements between the Taiwanese and the
 senior mainlanders could also spill over into other areas, such as economic
 planning and defense allocations.

 Thus, despite Chiang's preparations, the present trend toward a peaceful
 transfer of power to a more Taiwanese leadership over the next decade is
 by no means assured:
 ? Those mainlanders who believe their interests are threatened by Taiwani-
 zation could try to slow the process, thus provoking even sharper disputes
 with Taiwanese in the Kuomintang. Conversely, Taiwanese in the party
 or opposition could press too soon for a greater sharing of power, as
 Taiwanese radicals did during 1979, provoking a strong conservative
 mainlander backlash.
 ? Economic problems could also undermine stability. Chiang has used the
 phenomenal improvement in the island's standard of living to mute
 Taiwanese discontent over mainlander political dominance. But if the
 government's present effort to retool the economy-a move intended to
 ensure that the island's exports remain competitive-falters, the Taiwan-
 ese could challenge mainlander management, especially if the prospect of
 a greater sharing of political power proves illusory.
 China's immediate response to Chiang's death will probably be a renewed
 call for reunification negotiations. Beijing might even try to use intermedi-
 aries to coax individual members of the collegium to support negotiations
 with promises of support for their political position. Because the Chinese
 believe that US arms sales to the island encourage Taiwan to resist Chinese
 overtures, they might also increase pressure on the United States to halt
 the sales.
 Over the longer term, if the Taiwanese continue to move up within the
 leadership, Beijing probably would fear that such a leadership might
 declare Taiwan independent, a step China has said might cause it to drop
 its pursuit of peaceful unification. We believe the Taiwanese would not
 take that risk, but Beijing probably would apply political pressure on
 Taipei to deter such a move unless the Taiwanese took steps to reassure
 Beijing. Indeed, if the Taiwanese were able to persuade the senior
 mainlanders to take a more flexible approach toward China, we believe
 that Beijing would feel less compelled to press for further curbs on US
 arms sales to the island. This, of course, would ease tension between the
 United States and China.

 The Political Succession
 on Taiwan F
 Chiang Ching-kuo, 74, has been the dominant figure
 in Taiwan politics for the past decade. Those around
 him who hold key positions of power and influence in
 the government and the Kuomintang (KMT) are
 nearly all mainlanders of the same generation-men
 such as Premier Yu Kuo-hua, 70, and Chiang Yen-
 shih, 69, the Secretary General of the KMT. Below
 them, however, is a younger group of Taiwanese and
 mainlanders whom Chiang has been grooming as a
 successor generation. F-1
 To strengthen the legitimacy of the KMT and the
 prospects for a smooth generational transition, Chiang
 has broadened the popular base of the party and
 incorporated key new constituencies-predominantly
 Taiwanese-produced by Taiwan's rapid economic
 development. This "Taiwanization" is gradually be-
 ginning to change the makeup of both the party and
 the government leadership. To underscore his com-
 mitment to a gradual transfer of power, Chiang
 selected Li Teng-hui, a 61-year-old Taiwanese, as his
 running mate and vice president last spring. 71
 We believe Chiang's decision to seek another six-year
 term as president-he was reelected last May-
 despite his poor health stems from his desire to
 increase the chances for an orderly transfer of power
 after his death. In the short run, he wants to strength-
 en the position of his most likely successors-the still
 dominant mainlander clique surrounding him-while
 putting more firmly in place his plans for a transition
 to a youn er, more Taiwanese leadership by the early
 1990S .
 25X1                   Mechanics of Succession
 If Chiang dies during his present term, Vice President
 Li Teng-hui would accede to the presidency under
 Taiwan's constitutional process. But because Li con-
 trols no faction of his own, his power would not be
 commensurate with his position. Premier Yu Kuo-hua
 would probably be more powerful. But Yu, who was
 named premier in June, also lacks a strong political
 Taiwan President Chiang
 Ching-kuo. Chiang, 74 and di-
 abetic, is unlikely to survive his
 current term, which expires in
 will determine whether Taiwan
 remains politically stable.n
 and  is immediate successors
 handle this transition period
 There is no established method to replace Chiang as
 party Chairman, a position to which a successor must
 be elected by the KMT Central Committee. Likely
 candidates include current party Secretary General
 Chiang Yen-shih, but his power base is also limited.
 25X1
 No single leader, in fact, is likely to possess the
 extensive network of contacts and support necessary
 to dominate the government the way Chiang has.
 Thus, we believe that Li and Yu would have to share
 power with the other senior members of the 31-man
 KMT Central Standing Committee (see appendix A).
 The Committee is the ruling party's highest decision-
 making forum and will probably assume additional
 power after Chiang's death.
 Taiwan's political leaders are comfortable with such
 ad hoc political arrangements and have worked well
 together during similar periods in the past. For exam-
 ple, Chiang Ching-kuo ran the government from the
 base and is primarily a technocrat.             25X1

 The Kuomintang in 1922 was consciously modeled
 after the Soviet Communist Party and remains so
 today. Chiang Ching-kuo is party chairman, in addi-
 tion to being president of the state. There are no vice-
 chairmen, nor is there any automatic process for
 naming a successor as chairman. F-1
 Policymaking nominally resides in the Central
 Standing Committee (see appendix A), which is equiv-
 alent to a politburo, and in six subcommittees of the
 party's Central Committee. The Secretary General,
 Chiang Yen-shih, is responsible for day-to-day man-
 agement of party affairs. F-]
 Premier's office under a caretaker president following
 the death of his father in 1975. More recently, when
 Chiang was incapacitated after eye surgery in 1982,
 an informal group of top leaders took over his respon-
 sibilities for several months. A similar group was
 formed and worked successfully when former Premier
 Sun suffered a stroke earlier this year.
 Chiang has carefully tailored the Standing Commit-
 tee so that it now contains representatives not only of
 the three traditional bases of power-the military,
 security services, and the KMT old guard-but also
 of important new groups from the bureaucracy, busi-
 ness community, and the media, many of whom are
 Taiwanese. We believe that Chiang envisions the
 members of this body assuming a greater policymak-
 ing role and making decisions representing a consen-
 sus of the island's major political constituencies.
 Chiang also probably hopes this arrangement will
 forestall any serious challenge to the succession proc-
 ess he has worked out. F1
 If Chiang's plan succeeds, as seems likely, his death
 will set in motion an evolution toward a more pluralis-
 tic leadership less dominated by the military and
 security services. Indeed, once Chiang dies, those at
 the top will have to assess-for the first time-the
 relative strength of their own power bases. Until now,
 their power and influence have depended much more
 on their relationship with Chiang Ching-kuo than on
 the group they represent. As political jockeying be-
 comes more pronounced, some of these men will
 probably reach out beyond the traditional bases of
 power in search of allies. This, in turn, should create
 opportunities for businessmen, technocrats, and media
 experts to play a larger role in policy formulation than
 is now the case. We believe the probable formation of
 such competing power blocs will lead to a more
 pluralistic system that takes the interests of all the
 major groupings more into account before decisions
 are made.n
 Although we believe that no single individual will ever
 be able to exercise the broad powers of either Chiang
 or his father, senior Taiwan politicians may-like
 many of their Asian counterparts-find collegial deci-
 sionmaking difficult and eventually turn to one indi-
 vidual to broker decisions. Alternatively, one man
 could, over time, try to create a power base similar to
 Chiang's. Because Chiang has prevented any of his
 subordinates from building power bases that would
 allow them to challenge his power, predictions about
 which of the current politicians will emerge are
 difficult. F-1
 The most likely candidate would seem to be Li Huan,
 a mainlander who enjoys support from the Taiwanese
 and also has good relations with the security services.
 But Li is only the Minister of Education, does not
 currently sit on the Standing Committee, and until
 recently was absent from Taipei for four years. None-
 theless, Li is, at 67, the youngest of the senior leaders,
 and he built a strong following during his tenure as
 director of the party's organization department during
 the 1970s. In addition, despite his exile to Kaohsiung
 following election rioting in 1977, Li was able to
 maintain his substantial faction on the KMT's Cen-
 tral Committee.n
 Policy Continuity
 We expect any new leadership-whatever its precise
 composition-to hew closely, at least at first, to the
 guidelines that Chiang has laid down, especially in
 foreign policy, defense, and economic modernization.
 The key exception could be on the question of the
 "Taiwanization" of the ruling party and government.

 Yu Kuo-hua, Premier, 70. Yu is
 one of the key officials respon-
 sible for Taiwan's "economic
 miracle. " His appointment as
 Premier, which was made de-
 spite his limited background,
 was probably designed to em-
 phasize continuity and stabil-
 ity, es ecially in economic poli-
 cy.
 25X1
 Shen Chang-huan, Secretary
 General of the President's Of-
 fice, 71. Shen reports to the
 President on foreign policy and
 security affairs. His influence
 will probably decline after
 Chiang Yen-shih, Secretary
 General of the KMT, 69.
 Chiang, a technocrat with a
 background in agriculture, is
 responsible for the very suc-
 cessful reform of the party dur-
 ing his tenure since 1979. He
 probably would have been
 named Premier but was
 deemed too valuable in his cur-
 rent position. Chiang is a lead-
 ing candidate to succeed
 Chiang Ching-kuo as party
 Li Huan, Minister of Educa-
 tion, 67. Li was "exiled" to
 southern Taiwan after election
 rioting in 1977 but was allowed
 to maintain his large faction in
 the Central Committee. His re-
 turn to Taipei last May may
 portend a larger role than his
 title as Minister of Education
 indicates. His links to native
 Taiwanese moving up within
 the party-Li recruited many
 of them when he was head of
 the KMT's Department of Or-
 ganizational Afairs-mark
 him as one of the very few
 senior mainlanders with such
 credentials. He is the only im-
 portant figure not currently on
 the KMT Standing Committee
 but also would be the only seri-
 ous candidate in a restoration
 of one-man rule. n

 Li Teng-hui, Vice President,
 61. Independent-minded but
 trusted by the mainlander elite
 (in large part because he con-
 trols no faction of his own), Li
 is one of the very few Western-
 educated Taiwanese. He
 worked in agricultural planning
 many years before serving as
 Taipei mayor and Taiwan Gov-
 ernor. In his current post he is
 responsible for links with native
 Taiwanese. Li also may be giv-
 en expanded responsibilities in
 military and foreign affairs. If
 so, it will be a sign that Chiang
 is grooming him for real rather
 than nominal, power.
 Lin Yang-kang, Vice Premier,
 58. Lin started his career as an
 elected politician and frequent-
 ly is an outspoken critic of the
 mainlander political monopoly.
 His current position is a check
 on his political aspirations. F-1
 Chiu Chuang-huan, Governor
 of Province, 59. A leading
 member of Taiwan's strongest
 local political faction, Chiu is a
 loyal and cautious KMT mem-
 ber and is unlikely to clash
 with senior mainlanders.
 25X1
 Foreign and Defense Policies. Taiwan's historical
 need to maintain close economic, political, security,
 and technological ties to the United States will contin-
 ue to shape the foreign policy of Chiang's successors.
 We expect no leader or group to question the need for
 this linkage during the 1980s, although there will be
 disagreements over how best to manage it. Because
 nearly everyone within the leadership distrusts the
 United States to some degree, Taiwan has sought
 repeated US assurances about its intentions. We
 believe Chiang's successors will follow suit, both to
 bolster their own confidence and to demonstrate-for
 domestic consumption-their ability to manage the
 US relationship.                           25X1
 Any new leadership will maintain a strong military
 deterrent and remain unpersuaded that close United
 States-China relations reduce the island's military
 needs. Hence, the new leadership will continue to seek
 from the United States the weapons and weapons-
 related technology it believes are necessary to deter
 China from trying to seize the island. F-1
 Chiang's successors also will probably be loath to
 change Chiang's policy of "no contact and no negotia-
 tion" with the mainland lest they fuel domestic
 tensions on the island. In particular, any new leader-
 ship would have to fear that the Taiwanese majority
 would interpret such moves as preliminary to a "sell-
 out." Taiwanese politicians have stressed repeatedly
 to US and other foreign officials that they will not
 accept any form of settlement negotiated by the
 mainlanders.F-l
 The Economy. Chiang's death probably will trigger
 some capital flight and nervousness among foreign
 and domestic investors, but we believe that will be
 manageable. His decision to name Yu Kuo-hua Pre-
 mier last May probably was intended in part to
 reassure such investors that there will be continuity in
 government economic policy. Yu is widely regarded as
 one of the principal architects of Taiwan's remarkable
 economic performance. He is also viewed-correct-
 ly-as a very conservative economist, who can be
 counted on to pursue sound, if cautious, economic
 policies.=                25X1

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/01/20: CIA-RDP86TOO59OR000100010001-3
 Yu's selection probably also reflects Chiang's judg-
 ment that his successors' ability to maintain internal
 stability after his death will depend in no small
 measure on how well they manage the economy. The
 government has been highly successful thus far in
 muting Taiwanese discontent over mainlander politi-
 cal dominance by sustaining high rates of growth and
 by ensuring an equitable distribution of the resulting
 25X1             prosperity. As one consequence, most of the large and
 growing Taiwanese middle class remains more inter-
 ested in the pursuit of wealth than in political power.
 This situation could change, however, if the island's
 senior economic managers-who are mainlanders-
 falter in their efforts to maintain Taiwan's strong
 competitive position in the international marketplace.
 Low population growth and increased prosperity have
 sharply pushed up labor costs on the island. As a
 result, Taiwan's traditional labor-intensive export in-
 dustries face increasingly stiff competition from such
 countries as China, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka.
 25X1         To overcome this problem, the government is promot-
 ing the development of more technology-intensive
 industries. Government economists are optimistic that
 ultimately they will succeed, but even they expect that
 the transition period may be difficult and are forecast-
 ing slower economic growth over the next decade.
 25X1          Party Reform and the Second Succession
 Probably the single greatest potential problem for a
 successor regime will be managing the pace of
 Taiwanization. Over the past several years Chiang
 Ching-kuo has appointed increasing numbers of Tai-
 wanese to high positions in the party and government.
 Although these moves have thus far been largely
 cosmetic, half of the Cabinet (see appendix B) and
 over a third of the Standing Committee are now
 Taiwanese. Thus, an important precedent has been
 established that Chiang's successors will find difficult
 to reverse.
 Perhaps more significant over the longer term is the
 fact that Chiang has worked since 1977 to expand the
 party's popular base to incorporate new social groups
 that have emerged as a result of Taiwan's economic
 development. As a result, the composition of party
 membership has changed dramatically. The KMT is
 now three-fourths Taiwanese, young-60 percent of
 the members are under 35-and primarily middle
 class, closely resembling the island's demographics.
 These reforms markedly strengthen the party's popu-
 lar appeal and sharply increase the prospects for the
 maintenance of one-party rule on the island. At the
 same time, they guarantee that the party's present
 mainlander leadership will face increasing pressure
 from below from competing new interest groups. For
 example, many of the new Legislative Yuan members
 elected in the relatively honest elections since 1977
 represent grassroots interests and a powerful force for
 change to which senior party mandarins will have to
 pay increasing attention.0                      25X1
 Another group that is moving up inside the party and
 will be a strong voice for change is the younger
 mainlanders (see table). These individuals recognize
 that they are unlikely to inherit the power of their
 fathers or other powerful relatives to whom they trace
 their political lineage, and thus have made a strong
 effort to cultivate close ties with influential Taiwanese
 politicians. Their connections and knowledge of for-
 eign affairs and foreign languages will, at the least,
 guarantee them some influence in future govern-
 ments.
 Managing the Pressure
 As long as the successor leadership does nothing to
 slow or block Taiwanization, it should be able to
 control the pace of this process. Thus far, the Taiwan-
 ese inside the KMT have been patient, and we believe
 they will remain so because they believe time is on
 their side. In fact, two of the most powerful Taiwan-
 ese KMT politicians told US representatives in Taipei
 last year that they hoped Chiang would outlive his
 appointed mainlander successors so that he could
 hand over power directly to them.

 The political opposition to the_KMT-almost exclu-
 sively Taiwanese-is too weak and divided to apply
 significant pressure on the government to accelerate
 Taiwanization and will probably remain so. If the
 opposition pushed too hard, it would run the risk of
 being repressed. In 1979, after the US recognition of
 Beijing, the more radical opposition politicians con-
 cluded that the government had been so weakened
 that they could challenge it directly. That confronta-
 tion resulted in a tough government crackdown and
 the arrests of many radical Taiwanese leaders.)
 The radicals could see a new opportunity to confront
 the government after Chiang's death, but in our view
 that would be a serious miscalculation. We believe the
 security services would stifle such a challenge. An
 initially weak or uncertain government might even
 allow the security apparatus greater latitude than it
 now has and, as a consequence, countenance a harder
 crackdown.
 Indeed, we believe that the security services represent
 the greatest obstacle to eventual Taiwanization of the
 government and party. The garrison command and
 the police have monitored and checked Taiwanese
 political activity since the 1940s, and there is a strong
 residue of suspicion on both sides. F-]
 With one exception-Chen Shou-shan, commander of
 the Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters-main-
 landers still man all key security posts. We believe
 that there probably is an increasing number of Tai-
 wanese at lower levels, but they are unlikely to reach
 senior positions soon.)
 Most of the security services' efforts have been aimed
 at anti-KMT dissidents, but we believe that the
 security services look askance at all Taiwanese politi-
 cal activity, even that within the KMT. We believe
 the security services fear that a future Taiwanese
 leadership might be less willing to crack down on
 what they see as the activities of anti-KMT Taiwan-
 ese, something they define more broadly than the
 Taiwanese themselves.    1
 The security services, therefore, could put pressure on
 the government to slow the pace of Taiwanization,
 posing problems for Chiang's successors. Still, Presi-
 dent Chiang has been careful to stress military subor-
 dination to civilians in his selection of top officers and
 has already moved to limit the future power of this
 group. Most notably, in 1983 Chiang demoted and
 transferred Gen. Wang Sheng, then head of the
 General Political Warfare Department and a symbol
 of opposition to Taiwanese political aspirations. F__]
 Opposition to Taiwanization could also come from the
 military, but during discussions with US representa-
 tives on Taiwan most high-ranking officers seem
 resigned to the eventual transfer of power to a
 Taiwanese civilian leadership. The changes that took
 place within the party and the government during the
 late 1970s are beginning to occur in the military.
 Although there are only about a dozen Taiwanese
 general officers, a review of those just below flag rank
 indicates that their numbers will increase significantly
 by the end of the decade. Enlisted men are over-
 whelmingly Taiwanese, as are most junior officers.F_

 Secret
 Military opposition would be constrained by fears that
 Beijing could exploit any serious civilian-military
 tensions. Like the senior mainlander political elite, the
 military and security services believe that China
 might undertake military action at any time and are
 reluctant to participate in activities that might in-
 crease Taiwan's vulnerability to such a move. n
 Future Policy Disputes
 Foreign Policy. As the Taiwanese and younger main-
 lander politicians become increasingly involved in
 decisions affecting defense and foreign policy-dis-
 cussions from which they are currently barred-they
 might begin to question openly current policies, creat-
 ing dissension within the leadership.F--]
 25X1       Although the rising young Taiwanese officials, along
 with younger mainlanders, agree with the present
 ruling elite that US arms and security guarantees are
 important, they are also concerned about what they
 see as excessive reliance on the United States. They
 believe the government should put much more stress
 on domestic political and economic developments,
 claiming that Taiwan's security and stability are
 enhanced more by its international economic position
 and peaceful political evolution than by close ties with
 the United States. Success in these areas, they argue,
 attracts investors and trade and generates concern in
 Europe and Japan-as well as in the United States-
 over any Chinese attempt to bring about reunification
 by other than peaceful means. We believe Taiwanese
 businessmen, who dominate the private sector, would
 support them. Such businessmen have repeatedly
 criticized Taipei's ban on trade with the Chinese
 mainland.)
 By the same token, some Taiwanese politicians have
 also been critical of the current leadership's strict
 limits on athletic, intellectual, and cultural exchanges
 with China. In private conversations with US offi-
 cials, Taiwanese politicians have argued in favor of
 increased exchanges, not because they agree with
 Beijing's view that this would eventually lead to
 reunification, but because it might reduce Chinese
 pressure on both Taiwan and the United States to
 begin the process. These officials are critical of what
 they term the current leadership's "paranoia" about
 such activities and of the resulting policy of "no
 contacts." These politicians believe that this approach
 denies the island a valuable ploy to use against the
 mainland and leaves the island's security overly de-
 pendent on decisions made in Washington.F__1
 Many younger mainlanders are just as critical of
 current policies and are already exploring ways of
 dealing with the mainland that are quite different
 from those of the current leadership and sometimes
 even offensive to it. For example, Sung 'Chu-yu, until
 recently director of the Government Information Of-
 fice and son of the late Lt. Gen. Sung Ta, a close
 associate of President Chiang, has ended the ban on
 factual reporting on life in China, in the apparent
 belief that Taiwan can only profit by the comparison.
 Another example is Wei Yung, currently the head of
 a research organization under the premier. Wei has
 put forward the highly controversial "multisystems
 nation" theory-which would allow Taiwan to merge
 nominally with China but remain independent in
 fact-as a possible solution to the problem of reunifi-
 cation. Several other, younger mainlanders have told
 US officials privately that they subscribe to a similar
 notion, the "German formula," for reunification,
 whereby China is viewed as one nation divided into
 two political states. F__1
 It is not clear whether these younger politicians have
 considered all of the ramifications of such schemes. In
 particular, they appear unaware of concerns voiced
 frequently by current Foreign Ministry officials that
 Taipei's requests for continued US arms sales might
 be received less sympathetically in Washington if
 Taiwan were more responsive to Chinese overtures.
 As these politicians move from their predominantly
 domestic interests to address foreign policy issues, we
 expect that their awareness of the complexities of
 such issues will sharpen.)

 Other Potential Conflicts. Conflicts between the Tai-
 wanese and the senior mainlanders could also arise
 over the nature and pace of economic modernization.
 Senior economic planners have traditionally yielded to
 the military's desire to attain self-sufficiency in
 defense-related industries such as steel and alumi-
 num.. Taiwanese officials closely tied to the island's
 private economic sector could in the future oppose
 such expenditures as wasteful and unnecessary. If so,
 they would find allies among mainlanders such as
 Chao Yao-tung, director of Taiwan's economic plan-
 ning agency, who also oppose such projects.n
 In a similar vein, reform of Taiwan's financial institu-
 tions, which is long overdue, has been blocked by
 opposition from the security services. Taiwanese busi-
 nessmen remain frustrated over the unwillingness of
 the security services, for example, to allow expanded
 international telex services or freer travel to and from
 the island-two important prerequisites for reform.
 Despite the potential for serious disputes, we believe
 the Taiwanese will continue to exercise the caution
 and patience that are their hallmarks. Even the most
 impetuous of the Taiwanese, Vice Premier Lin Yang-
 kang, recognizes the limits of tolerance for debate at
 the top. Thus, none of the changes currently advocat-
 ed by the Taiwanese will occur soon. Over the next
 five years, we believe the senior mainlanders may, at
 most,. moderate their views slightly toward the posi-
 tion of the Taiwanese. This moderation would acceler-
 ate only if the Taiwanese and younger mainlanders
 succeeded in gaining the support of one or more of the
 senior mainlanders. Changes during 1981-83 in Tai-
 pei's policy toward China, for example, including a
 sharp reduction in rhetoric, were promoted by former
 Premier Sun, who was strongly influenced by a coterie
 of younger advisers. Conversely, Sun's incapacitation
 following a stroke earlier this year put an end to these
 policies because the young advisers lost their patron.
 25X1
 When Chiang Ching-kuo dies, it will mark the end
 of his family's control of the Kuomintang, as well as
 of the state and military organizations-control that
 has existed since the 1920s. Chiang Wei-kuo, report-
 edly the half brother of Chiang Ching-kuo, has a poor
 reputation on the island and has held few substantive
 positions during his career. His performance as an
 officer in charge of Taiwan's military logistics has
 been unremarkable, and he was moved last June to a
 largely ceremonial post. Given his poor reputation, we
 believe political groups would be unlikely to turn to
 him, even as afigurehead.F-]
 Chiang Ching-kuo's children also are poorly posi-
 tioned to succeed him. His oldest son is physically
 unable to assume any responsibilities. Chiang has
 failed to groom the others and has kept their hands
 far from the levers of power. They are also not well
 regarded, in part because they are half Russian-an
 important consideration in racially conscious Chinese
 society.
 25X1
 earlier this        25X1
 year Chiang ordered his top lieutenants to begin
 improving the political position of his second son,
 Chiang Hsiao-wu, 39. The younger Chiang has had
 only limited political experience and currently serves
 as president of a state-owned broadcasting station.
 We believe it is unlikely that the son is being groomed
 to take over from the father. It appears more likely
 that Chiang wants to enhance his son's position in
 part to reassure younger mainlanders that they will
 still have a role in an increasingly Taiwanese-domi-
 nated Taiwan and also to designate an heir to
 manage the Chiang family estate, which, although
 not particularly large, does support a number of
 family members.

 Secret
 The View From Beijing and Implications for the
 United States
 Beijing will probably treat the death of Chiang as the
 beginning of the end of mainlander rule on Taiwan
 and conclude that his successors-being politically
 weaker-would be even less inclined to hold reunifica-
 tion talks. Even so, Beijing probably would make new
 overtures to Taipei to encourage discussion of reunifi-
 cation. If Beijing does believe that the successors are
 weak, it might send private messages to one or more
 members of the collegium-via intermediaries-pro-
 posing Chinese support for their political power in
 exchange for the opening of reunification negotia-
 tions. We believe such probes would be rejected. At
 the same time, China might renew pressure on the
 United States over arms sales to Taiwan, which
 Beijing views as encouraging Taipei's refusal to begin
 negotiations. F_~
 Over the longer term, Beijing probably would be
 uneasy about the emergence of a predominantly Tai-
 wanese leadership, fearing it would be more likely to
 declare Taiwan independent. Time is not on Beijing's
 side. China has long pinned its hopes on reaching an
 accommodation with the present leadership in Taipei
 and has tailored its reunification initiatives to appeal
 more to the mainlander elite than to the Taiwanese
 majority. In addition, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly has
 warned that any declaration of independence could
 lead Beijing to abandon its peaceful reunification
 policy and possibly to invade the island.n
 If the rising Taiwanese and younger mainlanders are
 successful in promoting increased contacts with Bei-
 jing, China's fears might be mitigated. In this case,
 Beijing would see little need to increase the pressure
 and might be content, at least for a while, to explore
 such initiatives with Taiwan.n
 If Beijing does believe that the chances for reunifica-
 tion are slipping away, and especially if Taiwan
 continues its policy of no contact with the mainland,
 Beijing probably will increase the pressure, both
 public and private, on the United States to end arms
 sales to Taiwan.
