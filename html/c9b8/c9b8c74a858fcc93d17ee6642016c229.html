 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 III.  THE PURGE OF THE P.L.A.  AND THE STARDOM OF MADAME MAO
 This staff study is one of a series growing out
 of continuing SRS surveillance of the China scene.  The
 first of this particular series, "Mao's 'Cultural Revo-
 lution':   Its Leadership, Its Strategy,  Its Instruments,
 and Its Casualties" (February 1967), concluded that the
 Cultural Revolution was primarily a purge, carried out
 with special instruments.   The second, "The P.L.A. and
 the 'Cultural Revolution"' (October 1967), concentrated
 on Mao's use of the P.L.A. as an instrument of the "revo-
 lution" and on his reorganization of the P.L.A.  itself
 to make it "reliable" in that role.
 The present study traces the story to June 1968.
 It finds Mao to be still the central and dominant figure,
 but it devotes special attention to the way in which
 Mao's treatment of the P.L.A.  has seemed to work against
 his ends by provoking resentment among those upon whom
 his position directly depends, by narrowing his base of
 support to fanatics and opportunists, and by putting his
 own position in danger.   These trends are highlighted by
 the activities and status of Madame Mao, who has become
 one of the principal leaders and has played the starring
 role in purging the P.L.A.
 This study, like its predecessors in the series,
 is not a coordinated paper; it is a result of the research
 and analysis of a single staff analyst.   Comments are
 invited.

 MAO'S "?CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 Ill.,   THE PURGE OF THE P.L.A.  AND THE STARDOM OF MADAME MAO
 Summary and Conclusions
 The People's Liberation Army (P.L.A., meaning the
 armed forces as a whole) has been both an instrument and
 an object of the "cultural revolution" in China.   As an
 instrument, it has been used to protect Mao against his
 enemies, to protect and support the militant mass forces
 of the revolution and to keep them within limits, and to
 govern China until a new party apparatus can be built.
 Thus the PLA has been--and remains--the apparatus on which
 Mao's team primarily depends.   But to make it "reliable"
 in that role, it has also been an object of the revolu-
 tion--suffering a prolonged purge (in installments) which
 has radically reorganized the high command, claiming as
 victims half of its central leaders and many of its region-
 al and provincial leaders, and threatening to strike down
 more.
 Mao's wife, Chiang Ching,  a former bit player in
 the movies and now about 55,  has been the scourge of the
 PLA.  While Mao and Lin have had the main roles in guid-
 ing the PLA as an instrument, the Madame too has had an
 important role.  Moreover, she has been the main source
 of militant exhortation to the revolutionary mass organi-
 zations and has thus greatly complicated the tasks of the
 PLA in controlling and governing.   Of greatest importance,
 the Madame has played her first starring role in carrying
 out the purge of the PLA on the lines drawn by Mao and
 Lin--lines which have apparently permitted the Madame to
 exercise a good deal of initiative, perhaps subject only
 to review by Mao and Lin.  The Madame has dominated the
 special instruments of the purge and has taken the public
 lead in almost every stage, and in the course of this
 she has risen spectacularly in the Peking hierarchy.

 She has been quick to break those who opposed her.   Even
 Mao's top two lieutenants, Lin Piao and Chou En-lai,
 recognize her as dangerous.  And Mao's use of the Madame
 has actually increased the danger to his own position.
 Madame Mao began her rise in November 1965, when
 Mao used her to plant a denunciatory article which opened
 the "cultural revolution."  The PLA's chief-of-staff was
 soon purged as an immediate threat, but, before under-
 taking any large-scale purge of the PLA, Mao assigned the
 Madame to look into its political condition.  Following
 this exercise, Mao made clear that a purge of the PLA as
 well as of the party lay ahead, and set up at that time
 a special instrument--the central Cultural Revolution
 Group--to conduct the purge of the party; Madame Mao was
 named its first deputy chairman, and brought several
 proteges with her.
 In August 1966, Lin Piao announced the criteria
 for judging PLA leaders--demonstrated support of Mao,
 and fidelity to his thought.  At first he gave the re-
 sponsibility for conducting the purge to conventional
 organs (the Military Affairs Commission and the General
 Political Department) and to PLA officers (Yang Cheng-wu
 and Hsiao Hua).   In October, however, the "cultural revo-
 lution" in the PLA moved into a higher gear, and another
 Cultural Revolution Group was formed for the PLA alone;
 the Madame became advisor and de facto chief of this PLA/
 CRG, and thus the only person to have a leading role in
 both the central CRG and the PLA/CRG.
 The Madame began at once to subvert the work of
 the nominal chief of the PLA/CRG, and to go after bigger
 game.  In December she got it, denouncing             he
 second-ranking officer of the MAC and the reputed ~cen-
 tral figure of the first large group of PLA leaders to
 be purged.  The Madame's denunciation of a key figure for
 "rightist" errors and factional activity, followed by
 the purge of that leader and his associates, was to be
 the pattern throughout the purge of the PLA.

 In January 1967 Madame Mao took the lead in directly
 attacking the chief of the PLA/CRG and announced (on Mao's
 authority) the reorganization of that group, placing it
 under an elderly marshal, naming the two original super-
 visors of the purge--Yang and Hsiao--as his deputies,
 and adding Lin Piao's wife.   The Madame and other lead-
 ers soon began criticizing Hsiao, but gave him another
 chance.
 In late January, the great disorder resulting from
 the call for "revolutionary rebels" to "seize power" made
 it necessary for the PLA to intervene, under the slogan
 of "Support the Left."-'  Because Mao urgently required the
 PLA's cooperation at that time, he reassured the PLA that
 he did not mean to purge it on the same scale as the party.
 However, the PLA tended to suppress trouble-makers
 of all sorts--including "rebel" groups favored by Peking--
 and the PLA itself thus became part of what was judged
 by the Maoists to be an "adverse [rightist] current" in
 the revolution as a whole,   In late March the PLA was
 put back on the leash, restricted in its use of coercion,
 and directed not to act at all without orders from above.
 The Madame again dismissed the head of the PLA/CRG
 During the spring of 1967, PLA leaders in the re-
 gions and provinces came under increasing attack by the
 "rebels," and by May the leaders in Peking apparently
 felt it was necessary to issue directives curbing the
 "rebels,"  However, the PLA was not given authority to
 use the necessary force, and great disorder continued.
 Mao's team in Peking chose to deal with this dis-
 order--and with political resistance in the PLA--by send-
 ing a small delegation under Hsieh Fu-chih to the worst
 trouble-spots during July.   This delegation found the

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 Wuhan headquarters to be insubordinate both in its past
 handling of mass organizations and in its present treat-
 ment of the delegation.   This latter action enraged and
 alarmed the leaders in Peking, notably the Madame.  The
 Wuhan commander was quickly replaced, and the Madame called
 on the "rebels" to arm themselves against other mass or-
 ganizations which--with the possible support of PLA of-
 ficers--might wish to harm them.   PLA regional commanders
 were summoned to Peking in late July for a lecture on
 discipline, and the CRG-controlled party journal called
 for a further purge of the PLA.   Lin Piao in early August
 again told the PLA that in dealing with mass revolution-
 ary organizations it was not to act without orders from
 Peking, and the MAC at that time pet up a special "Sup-
 port the Left" Group (under Hsieh Fu-chih) to guide the
 efforts of PLA commanders in handling these organizations.
 At the same time, Lin Piao and Madame Mao, needing
 a scapegoat for the failure of the PLA commanders in the
 spring and early summer to respond as Mao wished to the
 confusing and disabling orders from Peking, now moved
 against Hsiao Hua.  Hsiao was purged, and his General
 Political Department was set aside.   Shortly thereafter,
 the PLA/CRG--of which Hsiao had been one of the directors--
 was again reorganized.   It was now placed under Wu Fa-
 hsien, commander of the politically reliable Air Force,
 with Madame Mao remaining as "advisor" and Lin Piao's wife
 moving toward the top.
 However, the leadership was not yet willing to call
 off the "rebels," and its own criticism of the PLA led
 swiftly to intensified "rebel" action against local mili-
 tary commanders and to increased disorder.  Taking account
 of this and of PLA resentment, Mao's team soon felt im-
 pelled to repudiate the line taken since late July.  The
 Madame in particular did so--presumably on orders from
 Mao--in a speech of 5 September in which she reversed her-
 self, defended the PLA, criticized the "rebels," wi-chdrew
 her incitement of them to seize arms, and encouraged the
 PLA to restore order.  On the same date, the MAC and the
 central CRG authorized the PLA to use force to repel at-
 tempts by mass organizations to seize weapons from the
 PLA.

 Later in September, Mao's team went further to
 placate the PLA.  Three second-level figures of the cen-
 tral CRG--just below the Madame--were purged as "ultra-
 leftists."  Madame Mao, although one of those responsi-
 ble for the harsh and threatening line of July and August
 for which these three were made the scapegoats, was given
 credit by other leaders for discovering the "errors" of
 the three; again she took the lead in attacking those dis-
 credited.
 By October, the worst of the disorders had appar-
 ently abated, and speeches by the leaders (e.g., Lin Piao)
 indicated an intention to give the PLA a respite from the
 purge while it restored and maintained order throughout
 China.  The situation remained volatile, however.   Some
 versions of Mao's own "instructions" condoned violence
 and disruption in undefined circumstances, and "rebel"
 organizations hostile to one another remained in exist-
 ence and in official favor.
 The uneasy calm was short-lived.   On 12 November,
 Madame Mao made several statements which could be and were
 read by militant rebels as a justification for resuming
 violence and attacking "people in authority."  Those "rebel"
 groups which did this found that they could get away with
 it--that the PLA, rightly afraid of Mao's reaction, would
 not use the necessary force against them; and the word
 quickly spread.   After mid-November, violence substanti-
 ally increased.
 This disorder continued through tiie winter of
 1967-68.   In at least some cases, contrary to the Septem-
 ber directive, local PLA commanders v'ere ordered not to
 use force even to prevent seizures of arms.  And they
 were not permitted to suppress the increasingly serious
 fighting among "rebel" organizations which the seized
 arms made possible.   Although the militant leaders of the
 "cultural revolution"--principally Mai, Lin, and the
 Madame--made a conciliatory gesture to the PLA by purg-
 ing another of the "ultra-left" second-level figures of
 the central CRG who had offended the PLA, these party
 leaders did not alter the policies--the real source of
 the trouble--which restricted the PLA's actions.

 At about this time, perhaps by design of Lin Piao
 in order to dilute Madame Mao's power, three new Fork
 groups were established in the PLA to carry on the tasks
 of political surveillance once performed by the discredited
 General Political Department.  The most important of these
 --the political work group--was apparently either to sup-
 plement or to replace Madame Mao's PLA/CRG.   There is some
 evidence that Yang Cheng-wu wa?:; given the job of supervis-
 ing this new group.   If so, the Madame may have seen Yang
 as a threat to her position as the principal person re-
 porting to Mao and Lin on the political reliability of
 senior PLA officers.
 The next wave of the purge was to hit Yang Cheng-
 wu himself, along with two other high-ranking officers
 (the first political officer of the Air Force and the
 Peking Garrison Commander). All that is clear about this
 case is that the three ran directly afoul of Madame Mao.
 Official materials on the case give the impression--per-
 haps falsely--that Yang and the Aar Force leader were
 purged primarily for having questioned the judgment of
 Mao, Lin Piao, and Madame Mao, and for having tried to
 do something about it.   (If so, this could have happened
 in connection with the work of the new political work
 group.)  The two had also come into conflict--for this
 reason or some other--with two other strong leaders,
 Hsieh Fu-chih and Wu Fa-hsien, with whom the Madame worked
 closely in purging the PLA, and possibly with some of
 the regional commanders.   Yang and the garrison commander
 brought matters to a head on the night of 7-8 March, when
 they allegedly tried to "arrest" some people on the pre-
 mises of the central CRG.                           Madame Mao was credited with
 "bravely" preventing the arrests.  The three, along with
 many other military leaders, immediately disappeared from
 the news.
 Mao's team--including Madame Mao--immediately
 launched a rew offensive against the "rightists."  The
 Madame defined the "main danger" throughout China as the
 rightist effort to "reverse verdicts," and in a series
 of meetings she and others warned audiences in Peking
 and delegations from other  arts of China of the danger
 of a new "adverse [rightist] current."  On at least one

 occasion, the Madame and others rebuked some regional
 military leaders for rightist attitudes.
 At a 25 March meeting, the PLA was informed of
 the purge of Yang Cheng-wu and the others and of the ap-
 pointment of Huang Yung-sheng (like Yang, a long-time
 lieutenant of Lin Piao's) as the new chief-of-staff and
 of Huang's former deputy as the new garrison commander.
 A striking feature of this meeting was the deference
 shown Madame Mao by both Lin Piao and Chou En-lai; Lin's
 speech included a long and laudatory defense of the
 Madame, and both he and Chou pledged allegiance to her.
 The Madame and others called for "exposure" of Yang's
 "black backers" (Lin expressly denied being one of them),
 but Mao apparently decided not to press this delicate
 matter publicly.   At a 27 March rally, the recent chal-
 lenge to Madame Mao personally was again emphasized, and
 extreme deference to the Madame was again shown by other
 leaders.
 While Peking's campagn against factionalism in
 mass organizations had led to a reduction in violence by
 early March, now in early April Peking redefined "faction-
 alism" in such a way as to make "proletarian" factional-
 ism a good thing.   This, together with the campaign against
 the "rightists," encouraged "rebel" groups to become mili-
 tant r.nd troublesome again.   Frort several points there
 were reports of reneweu heavy fighting and of fresh poster
 attacks on military leaders.
 On May Day, Mao's team made a show of both the
 militant and the moderate features of its policies, with
 the militant dominant.   This was true both of the offi-
 cial pronouncements and of the line-up of leaders, which
 displayed strikingly the militants--including Madame Mao--
 who had risen in and on the "revolution."  The militant
 leaders were displayed even more strikingly in the small
 group--of 13 or 14--presented on two other occasions in
 May as Mao's first team.
 As of late May 1968, the casualties of the purge
 of the PLA had already been heavy.  Of the 65 top posi-
 tions in the central military leadership, the occupants
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 of at least 35 posts (28 individuals) had apparently been
 purged; half of these were military commanders, half poli-
 tical specialists.   The purge had claimed many victims
 as well in the regional and provincial commands; compara-
 tively few of these,  however, were military commanders,
 and many had survived the kind of "rebel" attacks which
 had preceded the downfall of political figures.
 The "cultural revolution" has continued to display
 Mao's conviction of the absolute correctness of his
 "thought", central to which is his belief in the power
 of the fanatical revolutionary will, and his obsessive
 concern with developing "revolutionary successors" who
 will be faithful to that "thought."  The revolution has
 also continued to highlight such features of Mao's char-
 acter as his boundless vanity, his increasingly paranoid
 suspicion, and his vindictiveness.  The mark of his style
 is on virtually every concept and tactic of the "revolu-
 tion"; contradictory aspects of his "thought" are established
 as policy; fantasies are held up as realities; losses are
 defined as gains; equivocal directives confuse those who
 must implement them and leave Mao "correct" no matter what
 happens.   The "cultural revolution" has repeated features
 of past Maoist campaigns, such as setting traps and tests
 for his colleagues and punishing severely those who have
 "failed",  finding scapegoats for his own errors, creat-
 ing new opponents by his arbitrary behavior, and relying
 increasingly on revolutionary fanatics.   Such irrationality
 has been increasingly apparent in Mao's behavior since the
 "hundred flowers" period in 1957, and has reached a new
 high in the "cultural revolution."
 This Maoist stamp on developments,  together with
 the attribution of all basic policies and changes of
 policy to Mao himself (in directives and "instructions"
 that appear genuine), argue strongly that Mao is still
 the central figure in the "cultural revolution."   Th.:?  in-
 creasingly important role and status ass'gned to Madame
 Mao also argues for the continued central position of Mao;
 it is most improbable that any one else would entrust
 such important work to a person so little qualified, and
 so much disliked.

 Mao's "thought," Mao's ch..acter,  and Mao's prac-
 tice give the situation an inherent instability.   More-
 over, Mao is committed to carry this revolution "to the
 end"--meaning not only the "destruction" of the old order
 but a continuing purge of the new structures he is build-
 ing.  And as he further disrupts his already severely dis-
 ordered society, he further reduces his already narrow
 base of support among those capable of contributing to
 the constructive features.
 The vacillation in Chinese policies reflects pri-
 marily Mao's own unsteadiness as a "helmsman."  There
 have been, however, important and growing differences of
 disposition and inclination among Mao's lieutenants.
 There are those who, like Mao himself, are inclined 'left'
 (Lin Piao, Madame Mao, the other principal figures of the
 central CRG), and those who are inclined 'right' and ex-
 ert a moderating influence when possible (Chou En-lai and
 others, including most military leaders).  There has been
 growing tension and conflict between these groups, but
 the militants, being closer to Mao, have probably been
 in the stronger position even in periods of relative mod-
 eration.
 Developments from September 1967 to the present
 illustrate the latter point.  From September to late March,
 Peking's policies were mixed but on balance relatively
 moderate, and Mao's militant lieutenants seemed somewhat
 on the defensive.   But in early March, when a group of
 military leaders offended Madame Mao and other militants,
 the offenders were quickly purged and a nation-wide cam-
 paign against "rightists" instituted.   Since then Mao has
 gone out of his way to display his militant colleagues
 as the dominant figures on his team.
 The PLA as an instrument of the revolution has
 suffered from Mao's style of work.   It has repeatedly been
 given responsibility without being given either clear
 directives or necessary authority, and has then been
 chastized for "errors."  It has also had to defend it-
 self against militant "rebels" incited by Peking.   Al-
 though the PLA has gained in political power, its sur-
 viving leadership has probably been left with a sense
 of resentment and insecurity.

 Despite the heavy casualties sufferers by the PLA
 and the inability of any individual to protect himself,
 there has apparently been no broad and organized resist-
 ance movement within the PLA.   That is,  there has been
 no known effort to coordinate resistance outside Peking
 or to stage a coup in Peking. One reason may be that
 military leaders have been too conscious of Mao's mass
 following and historical role. Another may be that he
 has not taken on a large enough group of PLA leaders at
 any one time.   Nevertheless, resentment of Mao's treat-
 ment of the PLA, combined with fear of further purges,
 makes the PLA an instrument of uncertain reliability.
 It may in fact become the instrument of Mao's overthrow.
 Mao's base of support in the central leadership
 in Peking has narrowed sharply.  The 'first team'  he
 has recently been presenting consists of himself and Lin
 Piao,  two actresses (Madame Mao and Madame Lin),  three
 propagandists,  three policemen, and only three or four
 military and government leaders. Mao's base of true sup-
 porters among military leaders seems particularly narrow,
 as the result of his own policies and the operations of
 Madame Mao.
 In addition to the narrowness of Mao's base among
 central leaders, it seems very doubtful that the military
 figures who dominate the revolutionary committees through-
 out China are reliable "revolutionary successors."  They
 have been put through too much.  They may be too awed by
 or frightened of Mao to disobey him, but they have not
 become Maoist revolutionaries.
 Mao seems to believe that his "revolution" has
 been a success--in purging those whom he has wished to
 purge, in separating the true believers from the revi-
 sionists, in creating a new governing apparatus, and in
 making fresh contributions to doctrine and practice.
 But these accomplishments are illusory.   An outside ob-
 server cannot escape the conclusion that the "revolution"
 has been a disaster for China of at least the magnitude
 of the "leap forward" and the split with the Soviet camp.
 In previous disasters Mao has been able to protect his
 own position;  in this case,  he may be unable to.

 Whatever the prospect for Mao personally,  the
 prospect for China is continued instability.   So long as
 Mao dominates the leadership, he will continue to work
 toward fantastic goals through irrational and often con-
 flicting policies, and he will continue to purge those
 who cannot work this way.   The new revolutionary commit-
 tees reflect Mao himself:                       they are inherently unstable,
 and conflict among their elements will continue.   More-
 over, in building the new party apparatus there may be
 a destructive conflict within the camp of the militants:
 the leaders of the central CRG, including Madame Mao.
 will probably seek to put their own followers in key
 party posts, while Lin Piao may want to install military
 leaders in these party posts concurrently.
 Mao's intention to conduct further purges poses
 the principal danger to his own position.   He may finally
 provoke such resentment and anxiety--particularly through
 Madame Mao's operations in the PLA--that an effective
 coalition will form against him.   Apart from the possi-
 bility of his ,lssassination by an individual with a griev-
 ance, PLA leaders might be precipitated into attempting
 a coup against him (and against Lin Piao too), either in
 Peking or on one of his tours.   Mao's true supporters
 among PLA leaders may be so few that--like Khrushchev--
 he would not receive warning of such a coup.
 If Mao dies or becomes disabled, and Lin succeeds,
 Lin will probably have to change Mao's policies or face
 a struggle,  perhaps prolonged. A struggle would probably
 be waged principally between elements of the PLA and the
 police and mass organizations--some elements responsive
 to Lin and other Maoist militants, other elements respon-
 sive to Chou En-lai and certain military leaders.   Lin
 would probably choose instead to make the necessary changes,
 and his successors will probably weaken Mao's doctrines
 still further.

 The Madame in the First Stage of the Purge
 Madame Mao became an important political figure
 only in late 1965, when Mao used her to plant an article
 in the Shanghai press attacking a playwright who was to
 serve as a symbol of all opposition to Mao's thought and
 will.    The Madame, a onetime bit player in Shanghai movies,
 had been occupied for more than 15 years with an effort
 to reduce all of the Chinese arts to propaganda.  Until
 1965 party leaders seem to have regarded her as a simple-
 minded nuisance not to be taken seriously.
 The planted article of November 1965 was followed
 quickly, however, by the seizure of the People's Libera-
 tion Army (PLA) chief-of-staff Lo Jui-ching, thought to
 be a dangerous rival to Lin Piao.   This was the beginning
 of the "cultural revolution," and the Madame was to rise
 on the wreckage of party and military leaders--including
 all of those who once had scorned her--until the Red Guard
 press could describe her as the "most outstanding command-
 er of the great proletarian cultural revolution."
 In February 1966, having decided that a purge of
 the PLA as well as of the party was necessary, Mao assign-
 ed the Madame to conduct a symposium on "cultural" work
 in the PLA.  The Madame's report concluded--probably the
 conclusion was foregone--that there was indeed "class
 struggle" in the PLA and that "revolution" was essential
 to purify its ranks.  Her report was approved in March
 by Lin Piao and by Chen Po-ta, a long time writer and
 spokesman for Mao who was to head the Cultural Revolution
 Group which was formed later to conduct the purge of the
 party.  Since that time, Madame Mao has had the starring
 role in carrying out the purge of the PLA.

 Cultural Revolution Group to take the place of the central
 party apparatus and to purge that apparatus.. Madame Mao,
 who had never had a party post, was named first deputy
 chairman of the CRG under Chen Po-ta.*  Mao did not yet
 see as necessary an analogous group for the purge of the
 PLA.
 In June and July of 1966, while Madame Mao was
 warming to her new role, the "cultural revolution" was
 being conducted by "work-teams"--small teams named by the
 upper levels of the party apparatus and assigned to inves-
 tigate and purge lower-level bodies.   The PLA contributed
 officers and men to these teams, and its own academies
 and schools were objects of the activity of these teams.
 The work of these teams was directed not by the newly-
 elevated militants such as Chen Po-ta and the Madame but
 rather by the conventional party apparatus under Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.   Liu and Teng understandably at-
 tempted to conduct the "revolution" in the party without
 destroying the party apparatus, but the latter was what
 Mao wanted to do, so the "failure" of the work-teams (as
 defined by Mao in late July) was the proximate cause of
 the downfall of Liu and Teng in early August.   Several
 months later, Liu Chih-chien, a deputy director of the
 PLA's General Political Department, was made the scapegoat
 for the concurrent and derivative failure in the conduct
 of the "revolution" in the PLA in June and July.
 *The Madame was the link between several leaders of
 the central CRG.  Kang Sheng had brought Madame Mao into
 the party (in 1931), and the Madame had worked closely
 with him for many years.   She had worked closely also
 with three important younger members of the new CRG--Chang
 Chun-chiao (second deputy chairman) and Yao Wen-yuan of
 Shanghai, two "cultural" careerists who had cooperated
 in writing and planting the November article which set
 off, the "revolution," and phi Pen-yu, a journalist whose
 article of April 1967 was to commence the attacks on the
 arch-enemy, Liu Shao-chi.

 In late August 1966, when the newly-organized Red
 Guards were turned loose against the party apparatus,  the
 PLA was told to stay out of it; in other words, the PLA
 was not yet an instrument of the "revolution"  (although
 standing by as a threat     It was already an object of
 the "revolution," and Mao's team--now clearly including
 the Madame--w:.s preparing for a stage of much greater
 militancy.
 The Madame and the Purging Instruments
 In October 1966, a MAC directive moved the "cultural
 revolution" in the PLA--still concentrated in the mili-
 tary academies and schools--into a higher gear.   Mao and
 Lin set up at about this time a Cultural Revolution Group
 for the conduct of the revolution in the PLA,  analogous
 to the central committee's Cultural Revolution Group set
 up five months earlier for the conduct of the "revolution"
 as a whole.   The first nominal chief of the PLA/CRG was
 probably Liu Chih-chien of the General Political Depart-
 ment, not yet disgraced, but the de facto chief from the
 start was Madame Mao, its reported "advisor."  The Madame
 thus became the only party leader to be a leader of both
 the central CRG and the PLA/CRG.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 It was soon clear that Liu Chih-c hien was not
 militant enough for the Madame.   The Madame was making
 remarks subversive of Liu's work as early as November
 (she was to be the first party leader to make a public
 attack on Liu,  in early January 1967), and she apparently
 began to go after the high-ranking and prestigious Ho
 Lung too at about this time.
 In the same period--between October and early
 January--Mao and Lin were defining a second "test" that
 lay ahead of party leaders outside Peking.   In the party's
 work-conference in October, and in editorials and speeches
 (one by Madame Mao) later, these party leaders were told
 that they could keep from getting purged only by denounc-
 ing Liu and Teng and their works in extreme terms, making
 a public self-criticism for following the "Liu/Teng line,"
 denouncing local officials who followed that line, and
 meeting the demands of revolutionary mass organizations.
 This definition of right conduct was to prove importalit
 for an understanding of the process by which a few former
 regional and provincial party leaders were rehabilitated
 during 1967 and early 1968 and found qualified to join
 the "revolutionary committees."
 The Madame Leading Attacks
 In mid-December Madame Mao,  in her role as first
 deputy chairman of the central CRG,  exhorted the Red
 Guards to rise up and "take over" some government organs.*
 *The Madame launched at this time what was to be a
 prolonged attack on the public security apparatus, regard-
 ed as still under the influence of the disgraced Peng
 Chen and Lo Jui-ching, and on the related apparatuses
 of the judiciary and the procuratorate.   Mao himself,
 some time in 1967, was to call for the entire three-part
 apparatus to be "smashed," i.e. reorganized completely.

 At the same time,  in her role as "advisor" to the PLA/CRG,
 she made the first public denunciation of Ho Lung, who
 ranked second only to Lin Piao among officers of the MAC.
 (Such denunciatiores of leading figures by Madame Mao
 were to be repeated in almost every stage throughout the
 purge of the PLA,)   Brought down with Ho in the next few
 weeks were several high-ranking officers of the central
 military leadership--including the commander of the armored
 forces and the political officer of the navy--and of thq
 regional military commands,  including Peking's.   All seem
 to have been guilty--,just possibly,  in collusion--of re-
 sisting the militant conduct of the "revolution" in  the
 PLA.   Some were charged with conspiring against military
 leaders then in favor--e.g. Yang Cheng-wu and Yu Li-chin--
 who were themselves to be purged later; but this later
 reversal of fortune was not to entail any reversal of
 verdicts on those purged earlier,
 In early January 1967 there was apparently intense
 questioning of the status of other military leaders by
 Red Guards seeking targets.   Madame Mao,  acting together
 with Chen Po-ta and Chou En-lai,  told the Guards that
 other officers of the MAC--including Yeh Chien-ying, Nieh
 Jung-then,  and Hsu Hsiang-chien--were not eligible to be
 targets.  But the Madame again took the lead in denounc-
 ing a military leader out of favor--the luckless Liu Chih-
 chien, who was made the principal scapegoat for all of
 the "mistakes" of the PLA's Political Department in 1966.
 The Madame also said that Liu's PLA/CRG was to be re-
 organized and put under Hsu Hsiang-chien,  one of the MAC
 officers she had defended, with Hsiao Hua and Yang Cheng-
 wu as his principal deputies,  and with Lin Piao's wife
 (Yeh Chun) as a new member.  The reorganized PLA/CRG
 was to work under the "direct leadership" of the MAC and
 the central CRG.  (This reorganization was announced as
 a decision of the MAC alone,with no mention of the central
 CRG, implying some rivalry from the start.)  The Madame
 at the same time adopted officially the title of "advisor"
 to the PLA/CRG.
 Concurrently with the reorganization of the PLA/
 CRG, the PLA press called for a militant pursuit of the
 "cultural revolution" in leading organs of the PLA but
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 for low-key "education" in line organizations.   (This was
 to be under the control of party committees--not little
 PLA/CR groups equivalent to the miniature CRG bodies--re-
 sponsive to the PLA/CRG.)  This remained Mao's policy:
 to accept much disruption at the upper levels of the PLA
 from time to time, but not of the military units which
 might be called into action.
 Curiously, within a few days of the appointment
 of the new PLA/CRG, several of its members (not Hsu,
 Hsiao or Yan   were bean  attacked in Red Guard posters
 other things for not being responsive to Madame Mamong
 ao.
 Perhaps the real. target was Hsiao Hua.   Within a week
 of the naming of Hsiao to the post of deputy chief of
 the reorganized PLA/CRG, Madame Mao and Chen Po-ta made
 clear that Hsiao was not in high favor. The Madame now
 charged Hsiao with some part of the responsibility for
 the rightist errors of the recently-purged Liu Chih-chien
 (Hsiao had in fact been Liu's supervisor), and accused
 him of making decisions without clearing them with Lin
 Piao and of being unresponsive to the central CRG.   Hsiao
 was called on to make a sincere self-criticism.   Yang
 Yung, the commander of the sensitive Peking military
 region, was immediately purged for making public an ac-
 count of this meeting, but Hsiao Hua himself was given
 another chance.
 The PLA Unleashed and Leashed Again
 At this time (January 1967), the "cultural revolu-
 tion" entered the stage of violent overthrow of all those
 in positions of authority in the party and government who
 were thought to be resisting Mao's new revolutionary order.
 The call to "seize power" soon resulted in great disorder,
 and it was apparent that intervention by the PLA was need-
 ed.                    On 23 January, the MAC, the central CRG and the State
 Council jointly ordered the PLA into action.

 By the end of February,  the rightist trend in the
 conduct of the revolution was so pronounced that--as
 first defined by Chou En-lai in March 1967--it had be-
 come an "adverse current" or "reactionary counter-current."
 In Peking, the party-machine leader Tan Chen-lin allegedly
 tried to reopen the cases of his purged principals, Liu
 Sliao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, and of other purged leaders,
 and to discredit and destroy the central CRG.   In t',? pro-
 vinces, military leaders engaged in restoring order .vere
 necessarily acting aggressively against some of the most
 militant "revolutionary rebels."  What was happening, ap-
 parently, was that, after a "revolutionary" group had
 "seized power"  (meaning the seals of power,  the authority
 of inoperative party and government organizations) and
 had been recognized by the local. military authorities,
 a competing "revolutionary" group would then attempt a
 counter-seizure and would be suppressed by the PLA as
 counter-revolutionary.   Some PLA leaders were later pun-
 ished for their effort to prevent anarchy, and still
 later, other PLA leaders were brought down in part for
 trying to reopen the cases of these leaders, most of whom,
 presumably, were acting on what they took to be the in-
 tent of the directives of the time.*

 During March,  Mao decided that the swing had been
 too far in the direction of an imposed order, and the
 "revoluti.onary rebels" were unleashed again, to attack
 first the "restoration" of d:1scredited officials to pouts
 in government organs.   Chou En-lai,  head of the govern-
 ment apparatus, defended some of the government leaders
 att;acked for this practice but himself warned against in-
 discriminate rehabilitation, an issue which was to arise
 again in the spring of 1968.
 Later in March, following an inspect. ion tour by
 Lin Piao,  the PLA was put back on the leash.  On 30 Ma;-ch,
 Lin told the PLA that PLA units would be restricted in
 their use of coercion and that they were not to take action
 on their own initiative but were to wait for orders from
 above.   This order--.which was highly important in holding
 the PLA to a strict, legalistic interpretation of its
 mission in the months to come--was embodied in a 10-point
 directive of 6 April.   Whereas the 23 January directive
 had given the PLA the upper hand over disorderly elements,
 the 6 April directive seemed to put the PLA at the mercy
 of these elements, unless local PLA leaders chose to defy
 Peking.
 New Leadership of the PLA/CRG and the MAC
 On the same day (6 April), there were intensive
 and apparently inspired poster attacks on Hsu Hsiang-
 chien and Yeh Chien-ying, two officers of the MAC who had
 probably had important roles in directing the conduct of
 the PLA during the February-March period of its repres-
 sion of militant "rebels" and who now--with the change
 of line--were evidently to be made the scapegoats for that
 period.  Both were charged with a number of rightist of-
 fenses, including opposition to Madame Mao.   In mid-April
 posters reported (perhaps prematurely) that the Madame,
 supposedly only the "advisor" to the PLA/CRG  had "dis-
 missed" Hsu as the chairman of that body--in~part, for
 not being sufficiently responsive to her personally--and
 that the leadership had been given to two of Hsu's deputies,

 criticism) and Yang Cheng-wu, and to Hsieh Fu-chih; ? Lin  25X1
 Piao's wife remained.*
 During the spring of 1967, while the PLA's military
 control commissions were in effect occupying China until
 "revolutionary committees" could be set up to replace the
 smashed party apparatus and the paralyzed government
 structure, regional, provincial and municipal PLA lead-
 ers came under increasing attack by elements of the "revo-
 lutionary rebels."  The initiative for 'these attacks was
 apparently most often taken by "rebel" organizations which
 had been ruled against by the PLA in the early months .if
 1967 and which now sought a reversal of verdicts; these
 attacks were launched against both the PLA and the "rebel"
 organizations which had found favor with the PLA.  Local

 The PLA Under Attack
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 PLA leaders, forbidden since late March to take harsh
 action against "rebel" groups without specific orders
 from Peking, had perforce to protect themselves by sup-
 porting those "rebel" groups which were friendly to them.
 There were probably some cases too in which PLA leaders
 knew very well which groups were in favor with the mili-
 tants (of Madame Mao's type) in Peking, but found those
 groups so obnoxious that they refused to support them un-
 til directly ordered to do so by Peking.*  Mao himself
 wanted it both ways--that is, wanted both the PLA and the
 "rebels" to correct their errors through "rectification"
 programs, meeting then on a middle ground.
 By mid--May the emphasis had shifted from the faults
 of the PLA to the faults of the "rebels," and a new dir-
 ective of 6 June called for an end to a number of "rebel"
 offenses (e.g. assaults, destruction, looting, arrests)
 and gave the PLA the responsibility for enforcing the
 order.   It did not, however, order the "rebels" to turn
 in the weapons they had seized, and it did not give the
 PLA the authority to use force against "rebel" organiza-
 tions.                           There was simply no way for the PLA to act ef-
 fectively against "anarchy" if it was forbidden to use
 force.
 Disorder continued.   Hsieh Fu-chih revealed in mid-
 June that there was disagreement among the leaders in
 Peking--probably betyieen Madame Mao and the others of
 the central CRG on one hand and Chou En-lai and the cen-
 tral military leaders on the other--as to how to proceed.
 Hsieh himself was chosen to carry out the decision to

 send a small delegation to various troubled areas of China
 to try to put an end to the armed struggles between "rebel"
 groups and between those groups and  the lc al military
 forces.   Hsieh's lieutenants in this mission were Wang
 Li, a militant journalist who had been taken into the
 central CRG, and Yu Li-chin,  the political officer of the
 CCAF.   Both Wang and Yu were to become casualties in later
 stages of the "revolution."
 The Wuhan Incident, Peking's Anger, New Militance
 Hsieh's delegation began its work in southwest      25X1
 China, where it induced competing "rebel" groups to agree
 to stop fighting among themselves and to form "alliances,"
 and then in mid-July went to Wuhan in central China.
 The groups ruled against then staged a demonstration,  in
 which they roughed up and detained members of Hsieh's
 delegation,  apparently unimpeded by the local military
 command (although elements of the CCAF later came to their
 rescue).
 This insubordination enraged and alarmed the lead-
 ers in Peking, notably Madame Mao.   Chen Tsai-tao was
 quickly summoned to Peking and purged for it, and on 22
 July the Madame called upon the "rebels  to arm them-
 selves against their enemies.   There was at once a great
 increase in seizures of weapons by the "rebels."
 At the same time, in late July, the military com-
 manders and political officers of most of the other region-
 al commands were called to Peking.   While they may have
 been given an opportunity there to state the genuine dif-
 ficulties facing them in trying to comply with Peking's
 will, they were almost certainly warned in strong terms
 about disobedience or evasion.   The point was underlined
 at July's end by Red Flag (controlled by officers of the
 central CRG), which called for the "overthrow' of the "bad

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 handful" in the PLA.   This withdrew the reassurances given
 in February that there would be no fresh wave of purges
 of the PLA.*  Moreover, at about the same time orders went
 out to local PLA commanders to give arms to certain "rebel"
 organizations,  thus compounding the problems of the com-
 manders.   Further, in an early August speech Lin Piao,
 who had repeatedly shown that his allegiance was primarily
 to Mao rather than to the PLA, again criticized the mis-
 takes of the PLA, and again (as in late March) told PLA
 leaders that in dealing with mass organizations they were
 not to take action of any kind without orders from Peking,
 no matter how long they had to wait.   Lin also told the
 PLA to seek guidance in handling the "rebels" from the
 central CRG.  Wall posters and the Red Guard press soon
 reported that the MAC had established a 'Support the Left'
 Group in the PLA under Hsieh Fu-chih, second-ranking of
 the active officers of the MAC.**  The mission of this
 new group--probably guided by the central CRG--was almost
 certainly to be that of guiding the efforts of PLA com-
 manders outside Peking in handling the revolutionary mass
 organizations.   Subordinate  'support the left'  offices,
 composed of PLA personnel and administratively under the
 jurisdiction of local military districts, were soon iden-
 tified in many parts of China.
 By mid-August, Hsiao Hua, the director of the PLA's
 General Political Department and one of the directors of
 the more important PLA/CRG, was finally brought down.  He
 *The term "handful" was not reassuring.   Mao's team
 had used the same euphemism about the state of the party
 before purging about three-fourths of the leading func-
 tionaries of the party apparatus.
 **Posters and the Red Guard press agree that other mem-
 bers of the new Group were:  Hsiao Hua, as the deputy
 chief; Li Tien-yu, a deputy C/S and concurrently a deputy
 director of Hsiao's Political Department; and Cheng Wei-
 shan, then deputy commander, later commander, of the Pek-
 ing MR.  Hsiao Hua, the new deputy, was to be purged with-
 in about two weeks.

 had managed to survive the fall of several of his deputies
 and criticism of him by several party leaders,  +.ncluding
 Madame Mao, but this time he was through.   Again Madame
 Mao led the attack on a discredited figure,  although Lin
 Piao had prepared the way.   Hsiao was held responsible
 for the deficient political consciousness of PLA leaders,
 as expressed in the "mistakes"--and crystallized in the
 Wuhan Incident--which had Just been criticized by Lin.
 Thus Hsiao was made the scapegoat for the failure of some
 PLA leaders to respond as Mao wished to the confusing and
 often disabling orders from Peking.
 At about the same time, the PLA's Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group--of which Hsiao Hua had been one of the direct-
 ors--was reportedly reorganized again.   It came now under
 the control of Wu Fa-hsien, commander of the politically
 sound CCAF, and  replaced  some of its members of political
 officer backgrounds (and closely associated with the newly-
 purged Hsiao Hua) with military professionals.*  So far
 as is known, both Yang Cheng-wu and Yu Li-chin, who were
 later to collide with both Madame Mao and Wu, remained
 members of the PLA/CRG.
 Quick Repudiation of the Hard Line
 The harsh and threatening line taken toward the
 PLA from late July soon led to a great increase in dis-
 order, as the "rebels" were emboldened by this line.   In
 late August, taking account of this disorder and of PLA
 *The PLA/CRG continued, however, to give the same ap-
 pearance as did Mao's team as a whole--that is, of an un-
 stable association of very different types.   While the
 reorganized PLA/CRG gave greater representation to mili-
 tary professionals, the extremist Madame Mao was still
 its real leader, and Yeh Chun--Lin Piao's wife, and a
 person who seemed of the same type as Madame Mao--seemed
 to be increasingly important,  in the same roles as (though
 smaller parts than) Madame Mao.

 resentment, Peking began to shift the line.   At first,
 the new line did not withdraw the criticism of the PLA,
 but it sharply increased criticism of the mistakes of
 the "rebels," and it did withdraw
 the late July call for a further purge of the PLA.
 It did this by condemning those who wished to "drag out"
 PLA leaders.   In other words, Mao's team in Peking, alarmed
 in late July by the attitude of PLA leaders, was now con-
 cerned about the effects on the PLA of the line since late
 July and about the "rebel" violence which Peking's actions
 had been provoking in that period.
 Mao's team apparently continued to desire a high
 level of "rebel" activity, but a decline in the violence.
 The PLA was not told to restore order at all costs.   On
 the contrary, Liberation Army Daily informed the PLA on
 30 August that it was to continue to support the Left,
 to support all genuine revolutionary organizations, and
 to bring them together rather than to suppress those which
 had made mistakes.
 In a speech on 5 September, Madame Mao reversed
 and repudiated the line of late July.*  She withdrew her
 *Mao was on tour of the provinces, accompanied by Yang
 Cheng-wu (acting C/S), Yu Li-chin (political officer of

 hind Madame Mao--of the central CRG, and the top man in
 Shanghai), and Wang Tung-hsing (once and perhaps still

 stages of the "cultural revolution" (e.g., Tao Chu, Ho

 1967. For example, in a speech of late September he com-
 mented on the overall condition of the PLA, criticized
 some provincial military leaders for disobeying or distort-
 ing orders, identified some regional military leaders

 call for "rebel" groups to arm themselves, warned of the
 danger from the "extreme 'left"' as well as from the
 right, defended the PLA warmly and at length, and criti-
 cized the "rebels" for attackin  the PLA.
 Better Order, the Purge of the "Ultra-Leftists"
 Beginning almost immediately after the issuance
 of the 5 September directive and Madame Mao's speech,
 there was a dramatic improvement in several of the areas
 in which there had been serious fighting as late as the
 first week of September.  On 18 September, the day after
 Liberation Army Daily reaffirmed that it was the PLA's
 as      aassist revo utionary groups to "unite," Mao be-
 came personally associated with this course in the form
 of a "latest instruction."  In this Mao declared that
 "there is no fundamental clash of interests among the
 working class" (i.e., revolutionary mass organizations
 should form alliances,  not fight).

 (e.g. Hsu Shih-yu in Nanking) in Mao's favor, spoke of
 Mao's plans for shifting regional leaders whom he thought
 to have been too long in one place and for shortening
 terms of service and simplifying study and equipment,
 and confirmed Mao's mismated plans for taking guns back
 from "rebel" groups while at the same time arming other
 such groups.

 Later in September, as forecast by Madame Mao in
 her 5 September speech, Mao's team went further to placate
 the PLA.   Three second-level members of the central Cul-
 tural Revolution Group (Wang Li, Kuan Feng, and Mu Hsin),
 and a lesser figure who was an editor of Red Flag (which
 had called publicly for a further purge of the PLA) were
 removed from their posts, charged in posters with "ultra-
 left" mistakes.   The basic policy had of course been for-
 mulated, imposed and reaffirmed by the sacrosanct leaders,
 Mao and Lin Piao, but it is possible that the three second-
 level figures had exceeded their instructions in carrying
 it out.   Inter alia,  these figures were accused of having
 bonds with a "rebel" group which sought to overthrow not
 only Chou En-lai but such militants as Mao, Lin and Kang
 Sheng.  While Chou En-lai and other relatively moderate
 leaders may have advocated the purge of these particular
 militants and were presumably pleased by it, party lead-
 ers credited Madame Mao with discovering the errors of
 the "ultra-leftists" and with taking the lead in attack-
 ing them.
 The situation throughout China continued to improve
 through September.  By National Day, 1 October, large-
 scale disorders were no longer being reported, although
 violent incidents had not ended.  Both the PLA and the
 "rebels" had apparently been generally responsive to the
 new line developed since late August.
 The New Team and Mao's Narrowing Base
 At the same time, however, press accounts of Nation-
 al Day showed how Mao's base in the leadership was narrow-
 ing down to the fanatics and opportunists.   The "leading,
 comrades"--Mao's inner circle--were now reduced to the
 old-timers Mao, Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Chen Po-ta, Kang
 Sheng, Li Fu-chun, and Nieh Jung-chen (not all of them
 fully reliable), the military and security figures who
 were newcomers as party leaders, Hsieh Fu-chih, Yang Cheng-
 wu, Su Yu, and Wang Tung-hsing, and the complete newcom-
 ers of the central CRG (in addition to Chen) and of the
 PLA/CRG--Madame Mao, Madame Lin, Chang Chun-chiao, Yao

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 Wen-yuan, and Chi Pen-yu.   (Part of this already narrow
 base was soon to be cut away.)  A few leaders who had been
 removed from posts and were thought to be in some degree
 of disfavor--at least at the time of their removal--appeared
 on this occasion, but not a single one of those thought
 to be in strong disfavor was rehabilitated and displayed.*
 In other words, there had been no "reversal of verdicts."
 Lin Piao, giving the main speech at the National
 Day rally, defined the "most important" current tasks as
 those of (a) criticizing and repudiating party leaders
 already brought down (i.e., focussing on enemies rather
 than fighting with one another), (b) concluding and de-
 veloping "alliances" among "rebel" groups  (i.e., keeping
 order), and (c) developing the "three-way alliances" (i.
 e.  the cooperation of the PLA, rehabilitated party cadres,
 and young revolutionaries in forming and operating revo-
 lutionary committees to govern China).   The latter two
 tasks were principally the tasks of the PLA. On the same
 occasion, the regime's three most important journals--Peo-
 ple's Daily,. Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily--joined
 in prophesying that in carrying out its tasks in the year
 to come the new team would encounter challenges from both
 the "right" and the "extreme 'left'."  This was of course
 a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 *Among those who had lost posts and favor during the
 "revolution," but who now appeared in qualified favor,
 were the military leaders Hsu Hsiang-chien and Yeh Chien-
 ying.                     Some observers regarded the reappearance of the
 party and government leaders Li Hsueh-feng and Yu Chiu-
 li--out of sight for some months--as even better evidence
 of the increasing strength of a "moderate faction" which
 (they thought) was coming to dominate or already dominated
 the central leadership.   However, both Li and Yu had been
 represented in early 1967 as the very models of erring
 officials who could be rehabilitated by repentance, con-
 fession, work and study; a few others who had run this
 course successfully were to be produced in the early months
 of 1968.

 The PLA had already been hit hard by the "cultural
 revolution," far harder than was generally realized.   More-
 over, Mao at this time reaffirmed his intention to carry
 the revolution through "to the end."  This meant that,
 while the PLA was to be given a respite while it restored
 and maintained order, it was sure to suffer a further
 purge.  The interesting question was whether Mao, if he
 chose to make it another large-scale purge, would be able
 to get away with it--that is, whether he would not provoke
 resistance leading to his own overthrow.

 Further Measures to Reduce Disorder
 Another "instruction" issuing from Mao's September
 tour was that the process of setting up a new governing
 structure be speeded up.   His stated intention was to
 establish "revolutionary committees" throughout China by
 early 1968, with a balance among the three elements.   Local
 military leaders (both military commanders and political
 officers) and rehabilitated party and government cadres
 were to divide the work, and representatives from the
 spectrum of revolutionary mass organizations were to "super-
 vise" them (i.e., keep the "revolutionary" pressure on
 both).*  Military figures were evidently to be dominant
 in most of these committees in the early stages.
 The formation of these "revolutionary committees"
 from below--that is, through agreements among local mili-
 tary leaders, party cadres, and "rebels"--had apparently
 not worked very well.  Thus the decisions had to be made
 in Peking, after consultations with representatives of
 all three components of the "alliance."  This shortcut
 itself took a long time, however, because the composition
 of the committees then had to be approved by all three
 components.
 Throughout October,  the effort to restore order
 was increasingly successful, although some "rebel" groups
 continued to be refractory.   That Mao himself favored
 some limits on disorder wras made clear by the various
 "instructions" and directives attributed to him; for
 *It appeared and still does appear that the revolution-
 ary committees, replacing both the party and the govern-
 mental apparatus, must be responsive to all three of the
 key central organs--the CRC, the MAC, and the State Coun-
 cil, perhaps in that order of importance.

 example, he advocated "alliances" on the part of mass
 organizations rather than disputes for position, he said
 the "chief danger" was that "some people want to beat
 down the PLA," he insisted that there must be "no chaos"
 in the PLA, he described the recent "countrywide disturb-
 ance" as the "last of its kind."  On the other hand, some
 versions of his "instructions" appearing in the "rebel"
 press condoned violence and disruption in certain unde-
 fined circumstances.  The most militant of his lieuten-
 ants--that is, Lin Piao, Madame Mao, Chen Po-ta, and
 Kang Sheng--spoke more clearly than he dim in favor of
 restoration of order.   So, of course, did Chou En-lai,
 who among other things warned the "rebels" not to allow
 themselves to be pushed by the condemnation of "ultra-
 left" errors into rightist errors:   he expressly warned
 against efforts to "reverse verdicts" on disgraced right-
 ists, a theme which was to get greater emphasis in the
 spring of 1968.*  Hsieh Fu-chih also spoke for the restora-
 tion of order, and also, in a
 speech of late October, gave a good account of the com-
 position of the dominant group of leaders, among whom
 he did not place himself.   As stated by Hsieh, the big
 three were Mao, Lin, and Chou En-lai, with Chou a step
 below the other two as their staff man, while Chen, Kang
 and the Madame (the three leaders of the central CRG)
 composed a group formed to assist the big three; these
 six, Hsieh said, were the holders of ultimate power, re-
 placing the former standing committee of the politburo
 as the body above the politburo and the central committee,
 (At the same time Chou En-lai described the central CRG,
 considered separately, as the equivalent of the old secre-
 tariat but with greater responsibilities.)  In other
 *It was true,  however, that there was a difference in
 tone between such spokesmen as Kang Sheng and Chou En-lai.
 Kang, like Mao, suggests a predisposition to radical and
 militant policies; Chou executes such policies, and well
 enough to protect himself, but suggests a different pre-
 disposition, and an inclination to modify such policies
 when he safely can.

 words, while relatively moderate policies were to be pur-
 sued for a time and relatively moderate leaders (Chou En-
 lai and his friends) were to have large roles in carrying
 them out (as often before), Mao and Lin continued to
 dominate the party and could change course at any time,
 and the group closest to them were the militants of the
 central CRG.   Although it could be argued that Madame
 Mao had replaced Chou En-lai in the big three in terms
 of power to make or break individuals, Hsieh's assess-
 ment otherwise seemed exactly right.*
 The Madame's Contribution to Fresh Disorder
 In early November Madame Mao made two speeches--per-
 haps reinforced by unpublished speeches on the same occa-
 sion by the other militant leaders of the central CRG,
 Chen and Kang--which clearly contributed to the increase
 in disorder which followed.   The Madame's speeches, as
 amalgamated and perhaps toned down in a subsequent arti-
 cle, were given to PLA representatives concerned with
 literature and art and to representatives of "revolutic-ti-
 ary" groups.   They were explicitly addressed to the situa-
 tion in literature and art, and were concerned largely
 *Shortly thereafter, acting C/S Yang Cheng-wu published
 an article in praise of Mao's thought and works which was
 denounced in March 1968 when Yang was purged.   Even in
 retrospect it is impossible to discover how this orthodox,
 fulsome treatment of the subject offended against either
 Mao's thought or Mao's works; Yang's line ("establish
 absolutely" Mao's thought) was in fact the line emphasized
 at the time.  However, Yang was later charged with having
 sought personal publicity by trying to get his article
 printed on the first page of People's Daily (reserved for
 one of Mao's "instructions") and by ordering the PLA to
 study the article,   Moreover,  the article, while praising
 Lin Piao strongly for his active defense of Mao's thought,
 did not mention Madame Mao's contribution to this defense;
 the Madame may have construed the omission as a deliber-
 ate slight.

 with the procedures for forming "three-way alliances" in
 accordance with the policies of the time.  They were not,
 in general, militant.   However, they included a certain
 amount of incendiary material which could be used by mili-
 tant "revolutionary rebels" as a justification for resum-
 ing the violence and attacks on "people in authority."
 This had happened before.  The Madame had made a
 speech in late November of 1966 which was also addressed
 only to literature and art but which had stated clearly
 Mao's intention to put all party leaders who had failed
 him through a long process of criticism and self-criticism,
 and that speech was underlined as authoritative in sub-
 sequent pronouncements in party journals.   Again now in
 1967 the Red Guard press made much of the Madame's speech,
 and after some delay official media again called attention
 to "stagnant pools."  The Madame seemed really to be ex-
 pressing both aspects of Mao's "thought"--that some or-
 ganizations were too disorderly, while others were too
 quiescent.   The insistence on having it both ways was
 evident in Mao's own "instructions" of the time; both
 militant and moderate "revolutionary rebels" were soon
 found to be quoting selectively from these ill-composed
 directives to support their very different predilections.
 There were probably other factors in the increas-
 ing violence after mid-November.  One was the increased
 pressure on "revolutionary rebel" groups to compete for
 position in the "revolutionary 'ommittees."  Another was
 resentment over the composition of those committees and
 preparatory groups already formed; those excluded, or
 dissatisfied with their shares, attacked those in "power"
 and those who had put them there, and attacks led to counter-
 attacks and to small wars which perpetuated themselves.*
 *As a glaring instance of arrangements imposed by Pek-
 ing and resented by "rebels," in early December Huang
 Yung-sheng, commander of the Canton MR, was named to head
 the preparatory group for a revolutionary committee in
 Kwangtung.   Huang had been under attack by "rebel" groups
 in Canton for more than a year, had taken strong action         25X1

 Another was the increasing evidence that rehabilitated
 party cadres were to play more important roles in the
 new committees than were the "rebels."  Moreover, there
 were continuing indications--certainly noted by the "reb-
 els"--of Mao's dissatisfaction with the general condition
 of the PLA and in particular with the PLA's handling of
 mass organizations.   Of greatest importance, those rebel
 groups which did resume violence and did attack those in   25X1
 "authority" found that they could get away with it.   They
 could disobey the PLA's orders with impunity because the
 PLA was not interpreting liberally
 using force to recover stolen weapons and was not tak- 25X1
 ing                   as a mandate to use all necessary force
 to restore order.     It was not that the PLA was afraid of 25X1
 the "rebels," but rather than the PLA, burned twice be-
 fore, was afraid of Mao, was afraid that he would once
 again rebuke and purge the army for harshness toward the
 young militants.   This estimate of the situation--by both
 the "rebels" and the PLA--was presumably strengthened by
 a new "instruction" attributed to Mao in early December,
 which was in fact a reaffirmation of Mao's position that
 "rebels" who had committed "mistakes" should be helped
 to achieve "unity," rather than suppressed.   In sum, the
 disinherited "rebels" thought that they had something to
 gain from violence, and they had good reason to believe
 that they would not be severely punished for engaging in
 violence,  so it was not surprising that violence was to
 increase.
 footnote continued from page 22)
 There was no reason
 for the "rebels" to conclude that Huang was himself im-
 posed on Mao, that Mao was as sorry about it as they were;
 on the contrary, Huang, who had had commands under Lin
 Piao ever since the early 1930s, had made a satisfactory
 self-criticism and had been praised by both Mao and Lin
 prior to this appointment, and the appointment itself was
 almost certainly another mark of confidence.   The continu-
 ing attacks on Huang by "rebel" groups were presumably
 intended to "reverse the verdict."

 Plans To Rebuild the Party Apparatus
 Also in early December, following reported asser-
 tions by party spokesmen (e.g.  Hsieh Fu-chih)  that the
 party intended to convene its Ninth Congress sometime in
 1968, a joint directive--of the central committee, the
 MAC, the central CRG, and the State Council--made clear
 that Mao and his team did indeed intend to rebuild the
 party apparatus, as in fact Mao and his spokesmen had
 promised from the start that they would do.   This rebuilt
 apparatus was presumably to function either as the core
 of the "revolutionary committees" or as a parallel (and
 more powerful) structure.
 Presumably, the new party apparatus would be staffed
 in large part by the officers of the revolutionary com-
 mittees.  And presumably the new apparatus would become
 what the old apparatus had been--the principal instrument
 for formulating, transmitting and carrying out the poi--
 ies imposed by the small group of top leaders.*

 Disorder and Permissiveness
 By the end of December, civil disorder and viol-
 ence were again widespread in China, with serious dis-
 turbances reported from almost every province.   The dis-
 order was apparently not as serious as it had been a
 year earlier, but it seemed again to be approaching the
 point at which Mao and Lin--as in January ?:967--would
 have to take serious measures against it.  The Maoist
 methods of investigation, persuasion and education could
 not do the job.
 At the same time (early January), the authorita-
 tive Shanghai newspapers introduced a theme which was to
 become of great importance during the spring.  Reviewing
 the cases of a number of local party leaders who had been
 purged, the Shanghai papers said that attempts had been
 made to "reverse the verdict" on some of them. Those who
 had taken part in this effort had turned out to be "count-
 er-revolutionaries."  (The Red Guard press soon picked
 up this theme.)
 The party and military press continued in January
 to tell the PLA to support "all" revolutionary mass or-
 ganizations under the abiding slogan of "Support the
 Left," and to exhort the mass organizations to rid them-
 selves of the various expressions of "factionalism."   it
 was made clear that this factionalism existed also with-
 in the revolutionary committees, not simply among groups
 competing for posts on the committees.  There was evidence
 too that at some points--as Yang Cheng-wu had implied
 in his September speech--different components of the PLA's
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 regional and provincial commands were backing different
 groups of "rebels."  it was unclear, however, whether
 this particular development was widespread or serious.
 At the same time, there was evidence that Mao's
 team in Peking was failing--in at least some cases--to
 back the PLA leaders in the regions and provinces in
 using force under the terms of the 5 September directive,
 and, moreover, was discouraging a liberal interpretation
 of that directive.  Whereas the directive had authorized
 the PLA to use force to repel attempts to seize weapons
 and could be used also to justify the forcible recovery
 of weapons, in the early weeks of 1968 there were con-
 firmed instances in several areas--Yunnan, Szechuan,
 Tibet, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, and Fukien---in which disorderly
 "rebel" groups seized arms and got away with it.   In some
 of these cases, the local PLA commands were expressly
 ordered not to use force against "rebel" groups, either
 to recover the arms or to suppress the increasingly
 serious fighting which the seized arms made possible.
 The Fall of One of the Madame's Proteges
 This development--the failure to crack down--was
 itself a good indicator that Mao and Lin and the milit-
 ants of the central CRG continued to dominate the lead-
 ership.  The group around Chou En-lai and the central
 military leaders--if they had been the dominant figures--
 would almost certainly have authorized PLA commanders
 in the field to take all necessary measures to restore
 order.
 However, at about the same time (February 1968)
 certain changes in the second-level leadership--three
 appointments and one dismissal--suggested to some ob-
 servers that the relative moderates in the top leader-
 ship were now dominating it, and were imposing these
 changes.  The appointments were of three figures of the
 old party apparatus who turned up in leading positions
 in the new "revolutionary committees" in the provinces.
 One of these (Li Hsueh-feng in Hopei) had been publicly

 working his way back into favor for a year,  and was no
 surprise; but two others had been out of sight for more
 than a year and had been presumed purged.   The probabilit'>
 was that these two were instances of what Mao had promised
 as far back as October 1966--the restoration of those
 party officials who could successfully pass through the
 101and  ainful   rocess of reform and rehabilitation;
 25X1
 (There have thus far been
 very few at the upper levels, despite the assurances of
 Mao and Lin that "most" of the party's cadres were re-
 garded as "good" or pretty good.)   Whether such officials
 were genuinely reformed, had really become perfect in-
 struments of Mao s thought and will, was of course another
 question.
 The dismissal was of Chi Pen.-yu, a militant member
 of the central CRG, one of the "literary adventurers"
 who had been pulled into the leadership in the early stages
 of the "cultural revolution" when Mao needed new voices
 to denounce the old propaganda apparatus.   Several others
 of this lot (Wang Li, Kuan? Feng, et al.)   had been brought
 down in September 1967 for "ultra-left" mistakes--i.e.
 over-zealous implementation of the line imposed by the
 militants at the top.   Chi's record had been much the
 same,  and he might have fallen at that time if he had
 not had a powerful protector (to permit him to make "self-
 criticisms") in the person of Madame Mao.   As previously
 noted, the Madame had worked closely with Chi for several
 years and had probably been his sponsor when he was
 brought into the central CRG in the summer of l9F.6.   Where-
 as the Madame had led the attack on those purged in Septem-
 ber,                 now in February,  in Chi's case, she refrained from
 doing so.  But she evidently d-d withdraw her support from
 him, and he was charged inter alia with collecting "black
 material" on the Madame as well as on Lin Piao, Chou En-
 lai, Hsieh Fu-chih, and others.  The central charge
 against Chi appears to have been that of responsibility
 --along with those purged in September--for the "ultra-
 left" policy of late summer 1967 which had mistreated and
 threatened the PLA.   He was also charged with "ultra-left"
 initiatives against some of those (both moderate and
 militant) above him in the hierarchy.   And he may have

 come into conflict with Chou En-lai on the specific ques-
 tion of Sinkiang.*  The fall of all four of the "ultra-
 left" second-level leaders was subsequently said to have
 provided a pretext for a resurgence of "rightist" activity
 in the early months of 1968.**
 The conclusion--from the three appointments and
 Chi's dismissal--that the moderates were now dominating
 the leadership was pretty clearly too strong.   However,
 there may have been a temporary dilution of the power of

 Sinkiang continued to be baffling.  Wang En-mao, the party

 leaders in addition to Chi Pen-yu.

 out China was in general reported to be dropping., This
 was presumably a payoff from the campaign against faction-
 alism and may also have been due to increasing indications
 from Peking that regional and provincial military leaders
 who had long been objects of "rebel" criticism and attack
 were in fact in favor with the militant leaders in Peking,
 including Mao and Lin.  One of them was soon to be named
 as the new chief-of-staff and as secretary-general of the
 MAC.

 one of the worst of the militants--Madame Mao herself.
 This conjecture derives from the establishment of new
 political work groups in the PLA,
 The New Political Work Groups
 At about this time--February 1968--Mao's team set
 up in the PLA three separate but related groups to carry
 on the work of political control and surveillance once
 performed by the General Political Department (sent to
 purgatory after the fall of its director--Hsiao Hua--in
 August 1967).   The new groups were designed either to
 supplement or to replace the PLA/CRG as the body concerned
 with the po.itical reliability of high-ranking military
 officers.
 The three groups were called the political work
 group, the literary and art group, and the military press
 (chun pao) group.   At a reception for members of these
 groups (reported in the Red Guard press in early March),
 L'n Piao and Yang Cheng-wu defined the work of the groups.
 Their work was to be "political"--saturating the PLA with
 Mao's thought--and "organizational," that is,  learning
 more about the PLA's leaders from the army level up, to
 support a judgment as to their political reliability.
 Lin complained that,.owing to Hsiao Hua's poor perform-
 ance, the top leaders did not know whom they could rely
 on.   Lin told these groups that they would get instruc-
 tions from, and would report to, Chairman Mao, the central
 committee, Premier Chou, the central CRG, and the "ad-
 ministrative unit" of the MAC; as reported, Lin did not
 mention the PLA/CRG, the organ which, one would think,
 would be the logical choice to supervise these new groups
 directly if the PLA/CRG were to continue to function.  In
 fact, Lin told them, they were to be supervised by offic-
 ers of the MAC and the central CRG.
 The political work group--clearly the most import-
 ant, in that it would normally be dealing with officers
 of higher rank and in command of combat forces--was to
 be supervised by the "administrative unit" of the MAC.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 The chief of this office was not identified,  but it may
 have been Yang Cheng-wu, as it was Yang who was secretary-
 general of the MAC and who provided the discussion of the
 wo?   of this group.   (The head of the group itself may
 have been Wu Fa-hsien, particularly if the PLA/CRG was
 disbanded at that time.)  The literary and art group was
 to be supervised primarily by Madame Mao, and the military
 press group by Chen Po-ta and Yao Wen-yuan.
 Although the new political work group may have been
 designed simply to feed information to tie PLA/CRG, sub-
 sequent developments were to give some support to the con-
 jecture that the new  rou  was intended to re lace the
 PLA/CRG.
 although the evidence is thin, it may be that Madame
 Mao's power was diluted by the establishment of this new
 group, and it may further be that Yang Cheng-wu was
 named the supervisor of the group (analogous to the
 Madame's role as "advisor" to the PLA/CRG) and that the
 Madame saw Yang Cheng-wu as a threat to her position as
 the princi.pal person. reporting to Mao and Lin Piao on the
 political character of their PLA leaders.*   (It will be
 recalled that Yang had played this role once before--in
 autumn 1966--just prior to the time that Madame Mao took
 over leadership of the PLA/CRG.)   If so, the purge of
 Yang Cheng-wu a few weeks later is easier to understand.
 *The speeches at this reception in fact show a minor
 clash between Yang and the Madame at the time.   Yang im-
 plied that the political work group was too small for
 its many tasks, and the Madame immediately countered
 --snidely--that a few men were enough, if their leaders
 were good. The Madame may have had an interest in re-
 stricting the size (and authority) of the group.

 The Purge of Yang Cheng-wu and Others
 By early March there was evidence that the PLA was
 acting aggressively in running the "revolutionary commit-
 tees" throughout China.   While the local PLA leaders re-
 mained responsible to the MAC, the CRG and the State Coun-
 cil for their actions, military men dominated most of
 these committees, and, in the absence of explicit orders
 from Peking, could act high-handedly--contrary to Mao's
 longstanding proposition that the party must command the
 gun, and to his recently-reaffirmed intention to rebuild
 the party apparatus and make it his principal instrument
 again.   Both the PLA press and the party press for some
 weeks had been reminding the PLA of its duty to treat
 cadres--as well as representatives of the revolutionary
 left--"correctly," and had been calling for "emancipating
 the great majority" of cadres, encouraging them to "step
 forward," "boldly using" them, allowing them to play their
 "-ore and key" role, and so on.   (The press had also added
 tliis element to its running attacks on "anarchism" and
 "factionalism" on the part of revolutionary mass organiza-
 tions.)
 On 7 March Mao, Lin, and seven other top leaders
 (including Madame Mao) received delegates to various
 conferences of activists in the study of Mao's works.
 More than 40 second-level leaders concerne,'. with military
 affairs appeared on this occasion, and it was to be t::a
 last appearance for some of them, because on that same
 night three of the central military leaders were so care-
 less or unlucky as to give Madame Mao cause to purge them.
 This group was broken at once, and other military leaders
 remained out of the news while--presumably--their cases
 were being examined.
 The first three victims of this latest wave of the
 purge were all high-ranking military officers who had risen
 in the course of the "revolution" as their predecessors
 had been purged or transferred, and who were now to be

 brought down themselves as "rightists."*  They were Yang
 Cheng-wu, acting chief-of-staff since late 1965 and rank-
 ing below only Lin Piao and Hsieh Fu-chih among active
 military leaders; Yu Li-chin, first political officer of
 the CCAF; and Fu Chung-pi, commander of the Peking Garri-
 son.  Two of the three, Yang and Yu, had been members
 of the PLA/CRG under Madame Mao and Wu Fa-hsien; Yang
 may have been named a few weeks earlier to supervise the
 political work group of the MAC which was to supplement
 or replace the PLA/CRG and which Wu Fa-hsien may have
 *It does not seem very useful to try, as some observ-
 ers have tried, to separate the Chinese military leaders
 into "radical" and "moderate" figures.   Except for Lin
 Piao (who seems to have identified completely with Mao
 Tse-tung) and a handful of young opportunists, almost all
 of the Chinese military leaders should probably be regard-
 ed as relative moderates, when compared with the doctrin-
 aire militants like the officers of the central CRG.
 The nature of their work predisposes theiu to dislike and
 resent disruptive political adventures like the "cultural
 revolution," while at the same time predisposing them
 to try to carry out orders.   The great majority of Chi-
 nese military leaders, like the government leaders around
 Chou En-lai, are seen as having a common interest in op-
 posing the excesses of the "revolution" (and in fact in
 every known case in the course of the "revolution" the
 purged military officers have been charged primarily with
 "rightist" offenses) but as cautious in expressing that
 opposition (as witness the fate of those who had been
 incautious).   A small number of PLA leaders are seen as
 psychologically divided--identified with the PLA on one
 hand, with long-standing ties to other military leaders,
 and thus unsympathetic to "revolution" as conceived by
 its most militant leaders, but placed in a very difficult
 position by being given posts which have forced them to
 conduct the purge of the PLA or to carry out exercises
 which harass the PLA and impede its work (those in the
 Political Department, the PLA/CRG, the political work
 groups, and  he 'Support the Left' group).

 headed,and Yu may also have been named to that new group;
 Yang had also been closely associated with Hsieh Fu-chih
 in the MAC; Yu had of course worked closely with Wu Fa-
 hsien in the CCAF and had been a memler of Hsieh Fu-chih's
 touring group in summer 1967; and Fu had been an officer
 of the Peking revolutionary committee which Hsieh headed.

 newspapers--~j centering on a long speech by          25X1
 Lin Piao at a 25 Marc hmeetin;--give the impression that
 Yang and Yu were purged primarily for having questioned
 the judgment of Mao, Lin Piao and Madame Mao and for hav-
 ing tried to do something about it, and that Fu was purged
 mainly as a catspaw of the other two.   The treatment of
 the case at the 25 March meeting--by such leaders as Lin
 Piao, Chou En-lai, and Kang Sheng, a., well as by the
 Madame herself--emphasizes the outrage to Madame Mao per-
 sonally.
 %J1 Yu with the Madame, Hsieh and Wu--especially with the
 Madame--had been deteriorating for some time.                                                                                                          The two had
 not been openly opponents of the three, in the way that
 Peng Te-huai had openly opposed Mao; indeed, they -,!'ere
 said to be "double-dealers," who pretended to support the
 decisions of the leaders but really did not, and said
 disrespectful things and then denied it.   Both Yang and
 Yu had apparently drawn attention to themselves by advo-
 cating, or being taken as advocating, a review of the
 cases of some of the party and military leaders purged
 earlier.  Thus they are charged with having "dared to
 witness for the adverse current" which Tan Chen-lin had
 allegedly initiated a year earlier--which sought a "re-
 versal of verdicts"--and thus with having "slandered"
 Mao, Lin, the central CRG, and Madame Mao.
 If this is indeed what happened, it could have
 come about through the operations of the MAC's new poli-
 tical work group--as the new group began to compile
 materials to support a judgment as to the political

 reliability of PLA leaders.  The judgment might easily
 have been reached by intelligent and honest men (and Yu
 at least had seemed to be an unusually intelligent and
 able man) that poor decisions had been made, and this
 judgment is clearly attributed to them in the charges.
 Moreover, if the same criteria were to be used, then a
 number of other military leaders still in favor were
 equally qualified to be-,objects of the purge; and this
 judgment is implicitly attributed to them in the addi-
 tional charges that they "conspired to oppose" Hsieh and
 Wu and that they planned to "overthrow" those two lead-
 ers and several regional military commanders.   Beyond this,
 the very operations of the new group--particularly if it
 was designed to replace or had already replaced the PLA/
 CRG--could be seen by Madame Mao as a threat to her per-
 sonal position, and Ypag and Yu are in fact charged with
 seeking to build "pcrsonal political power."  Any group
 of leaders attempting to direct any organization would
 of course be vulnerable to charges of empire-building,
 and most of those purged during the "revolution" have had
 this charge included in the list; but the leaders of the
 political work group may have been particularly vulner-
 able, as Lin Piao and Chou En-lai in their remarks to the
 group had warned expressly against repeating this parti-
 cular mistake of the General Political Department.*.  (There
 *It should be recognized that the evidence is not
 strong for the proposition that Yang Cheng-wu was the de
 facto supervisor of the political work group.  It consists
 largely of his role as secretary-general of the MAC and
 of his role in the reception for the new groups.

 of mass organizations,)
 Any expression of the feeling attributed to them
 --that some. poor or questionable decisions had been made
 in the course of the "revolution''--could indeed be taken
 as reflecting unfavorably on Mao and Lin, and would cer-
 tainly be taken by the Madame (who has displayed a vanity
 of the same pathological order as Mao's own) as reflect-
 ing unfavorably on herself.   She would have then both a
 means and a motive for "settling accounts," in addition
 to the possible motive of wishing to strangle the new poli-
 tical work group or to get her own men into the leader-
 ship of it.   On the night of 7-8 March she got her chance.

 The probability is that Yang, Yu, and Fu were all
 placed under house arrest  at once, although they seem
 to have been given an opportunity to defend themselves
 before sentence was passed on 22 March.  Their case was
 publicized to the PLA on 25 March.
 A New Offensive Against the  'Rightists"
 Party leaders--including Madame Mao--began at once
 to prepare a new offensive against the "rightists."  On
 11 March, Madame Mao, Madame Lin, and Chou En-lai, speak-
 ing to students and teachers in Peking, denounced the
 "adverse current" of early 1967 and warned of the danger
 of a new "adverse current."  On 15 March, Madame Mao and
 some others (again including Chou) met in Peking with a
 delegation from Szechuan, and the Madame defined the
 "rightist" effort to "reverse verdicts" as the current
 "main danger" all over China.  On this occasion, the
 Madame and others rebuked Chang Kuo-hua and Liang Hsing-
 chu--the leaders of the Chengtu MR and of the preparatory
 group, who had been installed after a series of military
 leaders of that regional headquarters had fallen--for
 having failed to give proper support to militant leaders
 and militant revolutionary mass organizations there, in-
 cluding a deputy political officer of the MR who had a
 better understanding of the true leftists.*
 *The Madame showed an interest in the rehabilitation
 of a member of the former party apparatus in the South-
 west, Li Ta-chang, an old friend, who had gone through
 the process of self-criticism and denunciation of his
 former associates which entitled one to be considered
 repentant and purified--the very process which the Madame
 in a November 1966 speech had publicly stated to be neces-
 sary.                    Li duly appeared as an officer of the new revolu-
 tionary committee in Szechuan in late May.

 On the next day (16 March), Liberation Daily in
 Shanghai--long a favorite vehicle o  the militant lead-
 ers of the "cultural revolution" and controlled directly
 by two members of the central CRG--opened the public at-
 tack on those who wished to "reverse the verdicts on the
 rightists."  On 18 March, Madame Mao and Chen Po-ta spoke
 of the current danger to a delegation from Chekiang.   On
 20 March, in Shanghai, the disgraced Chen Pei-hsien was
 dragged out again as an example.  On 21 March, the Madame,
 Chou En-lai and Kang Sheng spoke on the same lines--the
 current threat from the right--to a group from Kiangsu.
 On this occasion, the Madame followed the practice of
 Mao himself by explaining that the "bad elements" of the
 central CRG (notably the "ultra-leftists") had been placed
 there by Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.   At the same
 gathering, Kang Sheng increased the gravity of the charges
 against Liu and others by declaring them to be agents
 of the Kuomintang (and thus eligible for execution).  On
 22 March, there was a large-scale demonstration in Peking
 against Tan Chen-lin, the alleged central figure of the
 first "adverse current."  On 24'March, Madame Mao and Kang
 Sheng spoke to PLA representatives about the past and
 present threat posted by people like Tan Chen-lin.  At
 about the same time, public denunciation of the three dis-
 graced in the 7-8 March incident--Yang, Yu, and Fu--began
 with poster attacks on these "big ambitious rightists"
 and conspirators.
 The Madame, Lin Piao, and Chou En-lai
 Lin Piao, in the presence of Mao and Madame Mao
 and a few other party and military leaders, informed the
 lower levels of the PLA on 25 March of the disposition

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 of the cases of Yang, Yu, and Fu.*  He also announced
 the appointment (by Mao) of Huang Yung-sheng--then com-
 mander of the Canton MR--to replace Yang as chief-of-
 staff or acting C/S, and of Wen Yu-cheng, Huang's former
 deputy in Canton and more recently a deputy C/S, to re-
 place Fu as commander of the Peking Garrison.   (The re-
 vised team of military leaders--Lan, Hsieh Fu-chih, Huang,
 and Wu Fa-hsien, in that order-appeared publicly the
 same evening.**  This 25 March meeting--for the light it
 throws on the status of Madame Mao--is worth some atten-
 tion.
 *Yang and Fu were dismissed from their posts, while
 Yu was arrested and held for trial.  Perhaps Yu, the only
 one of the three described air. a "renegade," really did
 try to "seize power" in the CCAF, by countermanding Wu's
 orders and/or purging Wu's men, whereas Yang is charged
 with "instructing" Yu to do this rather than doing it
 himself.  The basis of the distinction, however, is far
 from clear.
 **Some observers--not most--have treated Huang as a
 military leader more "closely aligned" with moderate
 forces than was Yang Cheng-wu, and thus as a new C/S
 whom the militants in the Chinese leadership were "fo:?c-
 ed to accept."  But Huang seemed a "moderate," or an
 ally of the moderates, in exactly the same sense that
 Yang and other military professionals had seemed to be:
 one predisposed against a militant and disruptive con-
 duct of the "revolution," but cautious about resisting
 it.   Moreover, Huang, like Yang before him, had served
 since the 1930s in Lin Piao's commands, had been.praised
 by Mao and Lin, and, like Yang, had almost certainly been
 chosen for the post not by any group of "moderates" but
 by Mao and Lin.   This is not to say.that Huang will not
 disappoint their expectations, as Yang did; as the "revo-
 lution" proceeds, Huang too may find a point at which he
 feels he must take certain risks to resist it, if the
 PLA is not to be ruined.

 Lin Piao's long speech--which may have followed
 an unpublished speech attributed to Mao--builds up to
 the charge that Yang Cheng-wu was "unfaithful" to Mao
 and to the central CRG.  He spied on Mao and Madame Mao
 (Lin says), defended those who were indirectly critical
 of Mao, and pretended to support Madame Mao but "really
 hated" her;  indeed, he had surreptitiously set up a
 special team to collect "black materials" (derogatory
 information) on the Madame.   This introduces a truly re-
 markable passage in defense of Madame Mao, in terms not
 employed for any of Mao's lieutenants except Lin himself:
 that she had been too long overlooked, had played a "very
 outstanding" role and a "great role," had managed both
 to be faithful to Mao's thought and to show "great creative
 power," had "great merits," and so on.
 Another interesting feature of the 25 March meet-
 ing was the call by Madame Mao, Kang Sheng, and Chou En-
 lai for "exposure" of Yang's "black backers."  This con-
 cept raised the real and critical question of whether
 second-level leaders like Yang Cheng-wu--that is, below
 the level of the militants who dominate the party--would
 have had the courage to challenge (even in private con-
 versations) the decisions made by those leaders and the
 temerity to affront them in the 7-8 March incident if they
 had not been incited and given assurances of support by
 other powerful figures in the leadership.  The thread could
 lead--in fact or fancy--to either Lin Piao or Chou En-lai.
 That this thought occurred to Lin and Chou too seems
 evident in their treatment of the Madame in the 25 March
 meeting
 Mao himself, pre-
 sumably recognizing the implications and being the only
 leader in a position to make such a decision, seems to
 -39-

 have decided not to press publicly any search for "black
 backers"; this particular aspect of the case against the
 "rightists" has not been included in the public campaign
 against them.   But it seems certain that Madame Mao and
 her friends (with Mao's blessing) will privately press
 the search.*
 More Defense, More Offense
 The recent challenge to Madame Mao (and the cen-
 tral CRG as a whole) was again emphasized, and extreme
 deference to the Madame was again shown by other leaders,
 at a rally on 27 March and a reception on 30 March.   As
 the principal speaker at the rally of 100,000, Madame
 Mao defended the course of the "revolution" and all of
 the adverse decisions on indivId ual leaders that had been
 made, described the efforts of the recently-purged mili-
 tary leaders to discredit the central CRG, and took note
 that some people wanted to "fry me in oil"; her pauses
 were filled by "shouts" by Hsieh Fu-chih, Yeh Chun (Madame
 in early April
 wall-posters denouncing Chou En-lai could be seen every-
 where in Canton, some of them accusing him of playing a
 "two-faced" role in the revolution, a charge not too far
 from the apparent truth.   Such posters were also report-
 ed in Peking, some denouncing Chou as the "man behind XXX."
 There were others, however, between the top level and the
 level of Yang's group, who could be charged rightly 'r
 wrongly as "black backers."  These included three poli---
 buro members long close to both Chou and Lin Piao, Li Fu-
 chun, Yeh Chien-yang, and Nieh Jung-chen.  Both Li and
 Yeh were reportedly being denounced in posters in late
 March as "rightists," Yeh was denounced expressly as a
 "black backer" of Yang, and Nieh Jung-chen again came
 under poster attack some weeks later.

 Lin Piao) and Chen Po-ta,  endorsing her analysis,  praising
 her conduct, denouncing her opponents, and calling upon
 everyone to "learn" from her, "support" her, carry out
 her "directives," and defend her (and the central CRG)
 "until death."  The same deference to the Madame was
 shown in the speeches of other top-level leaders--Kang
 Sheng, Chen Po-ta, and Chou En-lai--on this occasion.
 Chou's speech in particular was remarkable, as Lin Piao's
 25 March speech had been, for a prolonged tribute to
 Madame Mao,  in which he stated expressly that the principal
 party and military leaders who had been purged in the
 "revolution" had (among other offenses) persecuted and
 opposed the Madame personally, and went on to imply (as
 had seemed to be the case)  that the Madame had had the       25X1
 principal role in the central CRG in judging whether in-
 dividual leaders met or did not meet Mao's standards (and
 thus in marking those to be purged).*
 J All of this suggested
 that it was the Madame's intention to use the central CRG
 to restore whatever power she had lost with the establish-
 ment of the political work group--pending, perhaps, an
 effort to take over the group.
 Immediately after the 25 March meeting, the public
 campaign against the new rightists--against the "rightist
 resurgence" and the efforts to "reverse verdicts"--began
 to spread across the nation.  The Honan Daily began it
 on 26 March with an editorial forthrightly entitled
 "Resolutely Repulse the Counter-Revolutionary black Wind
 *In her own interjections, Madame Mao called for the
 defense of Mao and Lin, and praised Chou.

 of Reversing Verdicts on the February Adverse Current."
 The authoritative Shanghai press soon followed, and in
 the next few weeks authoritative newspapers in most of
 the provinces and major municipalities were to carry edi-
 torials denouncing "right deviation" and "right splittism"
 in general and the effort to "reverse the previous cor-
 rect decisions" on rightists in particular, and to report
 rallies to the same end at which previously-disgraced
 officials were again produced.
 The press followed the lead of party leaders in
 working a defense of Madame Mao into the campaign against
 the "rightists."  For example, an editorial of 7 April
 in Peking Daily--recognized as authoritative and reprinted
 --described Lin Piao and the Madame as both being Mao's
 "close comrades-in-arms", and went on to praise her for
 being "most resolute and -:ourageous" and for having made
 "outstanding contributions."  The Wen Hui Pao (Shanghai)
 reprinted this under a banner of "pledging our lives" to
 defend Mao, Lin, the central committee,  the central CRG,
 and Madame Mao.
 "Proletarian Factionalism" and Other Bad Omens
 Beginning on 10 April, there was an important
 change ir the definition of "factionalism."  Whereas
 "factionalism" for the first three months of 1968 had
 meant factionalism--that is, Self-seeking and disorderly
 behavior by mass organizations which were supposed to
 form alliances--and was a bad thing, it now turned out
 that there was a good factionalism and a bad factionalism.
 Writing jointly on the inauguration of the revolution-
 ary committee in Hunan (Mao's place of origin), People's
 Daily and Liberation Army Daily reminded the national
 au  ence that the cultural revolution was a class strug-
 gle, and went on to argue that bourgeois factionalism
 must be opposed.   Subsequent editorials were to make the
 point explicit that proletarian factionalism was a good
 thing and indeed necessary to combat bourgeois faction-
 alism.

 On 12 April,  the Tsinan Radio,  which had been car-
 rying on for several days about "counter-revolutionary
 double-dealers" (like the Yang Cheng-wu group)  in the
 Shantung provincial committee, announced the purge of
 three members of its standing committee (the second-level
 of leadership)---apparently for a mixture of "rightist"
 and "ultra--leftist" offenses.   It was alleged that in
 collusion with "counter-revolutionary double-dealers at
 a higher level" (presumably Yang's group), the three had
 conspired against the top leaders of the committee (one
 a party figure, one military).   The one known military
 officer of the three (a deputy C/S of the provincial MD)
 was described as having taken the initiative in the con-
 spiracy.   There was no independent evidence of a special
 relationship between Yang Cheng-wu's group and any of
 the three, but the event had unpleasant implications for
 other national, regional and provincial military leaders.
 Within a few days, there was evidence that mili-
 tant "rebel" groups in several areas had been freshly
 stimulated by the attacks on "rightist" military leaders
 since late March.   Posters appearing in Peking and per-
 haps elsewhere attacked Chen Hsi-lies, commander of the
 Shenyang (Northeast) MR, and Sung Jen-chiung, former
 political officer of that MR (and longtime protege of
 the disgraced Teng Hsiao-ping),  for having ordered or
 at least permitted armed attacks (using tanks and machine-
 guns) on "rebels" in Shenyang in early April.   These lead-
 ers had reportedly been given a vote of confidence by
 Chou En-lai himself in late March,  and both the fresh
 activity of the militant "rebels" in early April (appar-
 ently provoking military counter-action) and the fresh
 poster attacks on the military leaders suggested a
 belief--or hope--that the situation had changed.   Further,
 posters reported large-scale violence in Shansi as a
 result of clashes between the civilian head of the revo-
 lutionary committee there and the political officer of
 the provincial MD.   There were concurrent reports of heavy
 casualties in renewed fighting in Shensi, Szechuan, Kwangsi
 Kwangtung, and Hunan.

 At the same time, there was striking additional
 evidence of the status of Madame Mao.
 Chinese bookstores were taking orders
 for the "Selected Speeches of Comrade Chiang Ching" (Madame
 Mao). The Madame was now to be the only active Chinese
 leader--except Mao himself--whose pronouncements were col-
 lected for dissemination to the flock.*   (The book is not
 known to have appeared, however:   perhaps Mao had second
 thoughts about it.)
 For the rest of April, the tone and content of both
 the central and the provincial press--on the matters of
 both the threat from the rightists and the virtue of pro-
 letarian factionalism--continued to be harsh and militant.
 Some of the commentaries--both central and provincial--
 joined the two themes, arguing that the rightists could
 be countered by the good factionalists.
 On 20 April, developing the theme they had intro-
 duced on 10 April, People's Daily and Liberation Army
 Daily wrote jointly on the "nee  to apply class analysis
 to factionalism."  This editorial strongly encouraged the
 expression of "proletarian revolutionary factionalism,"
 and concluded that one must "never discard a revolution-
 ary principle merely for the sake of achieving an outward
 appearance of peace and harmony," and that one must
 "struggle" for unity and not "compromise" for it--thus
 in effect reversing the line taken in February and March.
 The Shanghai press followed at once, going so far as to
 warn against "forgetting class struggle and occupying
 ourselves with inane discussion of a struggle to oppose
 factionalism"--a pejorative description of the previous
 line.   The provincial press soon followed, while continu-
 ing its campaign against the rightist threat, and, as
 noted above, sometimes related the two themes.

 publishing his Selected Works.

 In commenting on the rightist (or "ultra-leftist"
 objectively rightist) threat,  in particular the effort
 to "reverse correct verdicts" on the rightists, several
 of the provincial journals not only denounced previously-
 disgraced officials for this and reported the "dragging-
 out" of some of them,  but stated or implied that this
 threat was a current concern to the local authorities.
 Further, they implied that some of the local authorities
 themselves would be purged;  it was said,  for example, that
 persons still in office were protecting dangerous right-
 ists removed from office but still dangerous.   And in
 commenting on factionalism, several of the provincial
 journals indicated not only that the local authorities
 would take harsh action against "rebel" groups judged
 to be conservative, but that there was fresh fighting
 among "rebel" groups and new attacks on the local auth-
 orities themselves by "rebel" groups.*
 The First Team:  Domination by the Militants
 On May Day, Mao's team offered a show of both
 aspects of its position--that is, a collage of moderate
 and militant features, with the militant In the brighter
 colors.   The joint editorial of the three principal
 journals--People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army
 Daily--on one hand reaffirms   that the team was making _
 its way between the perils of the right and of the ultra-
 left, that it favored alliances, that there were "extremely
 few bad elements," and that the PLA had done a great job
 and must be cherished; and on the other hand that the
 class struggle was intensifying as the "revolution" pro-
 ceeded (a Stalinist line), that all "hidden renegades"

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 must be discovered, that all expressions of rightism (in
 particular, the effort to "reverse correct decisions")
 must be opposed and smashed, and that proletarian fac-
 tionalism was a good thing.   In other words, the team
 was reaffirming both the relatively moderate policies
 in effect from September to late March, and the militant
 initiatives taken since late March--both genuine features
 of Mao's tangled and contradictory "thought," but with
 the militant showing as closer to Mao's heart.
 The same impression was given by the display of
 leaders on May Day.  The team put on display all of the
 central leaders not known to be in outright disgrace.
 That is, it included a number of party and military lead-
 ers known or believed to be in some degree of disfavor,
 including some who had been out of the news since early
 March, the time of Yang Cheng-wu's collision with the cen-
 tral CRG.   (Some of these were even on the rostrum with
 Mao and Lin.)  Thus Peking was indicating that it had not
 yet found, or was not yet choosing to point out, any
 "black backer" of Yang's group, as all of the leaders
 of his level or above were present.  But at the same time
 the line-up of leaders on the rostrum showed strikingly
 the importance of the militants who had risen in and on
 the "cultural revolution" and of the special instruments
 of the "revolution" which they dominated
 On the rostrum with Mao, Lin and Chou (and a few
 survivors from the old politburo) were the top five of-
 ficers of the central CRG (including the Madame, ranked
 ninth among all leaders present but seventh among active
 leaders) and the five or six principal officers of the
 old PLA/CRG (including Yeh Chun, Lin Piao'3 wife, ranked
 twentieth among active leaders and now second among of-
 ficers of the PLA/CRG), now possibly reassigned to the
 central CRG and the MAC's political work groups. The
 military was well represented:  most of the active of-
 ficers of the MAC were on the rostrum, and all were pre-
 sent; almost all of the surviving. leaders of the Ministry
 of National Defense and of the central departments and
 service headquarters were present; more than half of the
 commanders of military regions wer-.: present; and there
 were many other regional and pro.incial military leaders.

 (Representation was disproportionately heavy from areas
 without revolutionary committees and with an abnormally
 high degree of disorder, such as Szechuan, Tibet, Sinkiang
 and Fukien, suggesting that theE-e officers were in Peking
 in part for consultations on the formation of such com-
 mittees and related problems.)
 The same balance--that is, imbalance, favoring the
 militants--appeared in the poster accounts of the fortunes
 of individual leaders which were observed at that time
 or appeared immediately after May Day.   On one hand, a
 "huge" poster was seen which carried a self-criticism by
 Chen Po-ta, head of the central CRG, reportedly emphasiz-
 ing his responsibility for favoring Chi Pen-yu before the
 latter's fall in February (this was doubly interesting,
 because it had apparently been Madame Mao, not Chen, who
 was principally responsible for Chi's rise); however,
 Chen's self-criticism was in the same self-serving form
 as Mao's own "self-criticism" in October 1966 f'r having
 trusted Liu and Teng, it included a claim that he had cor-
 rected his errors, and this claim was endorsed in the
 poster by Hsieh Fu-chih, who described Chen as one of
 Mao's faithful soldiers (also doubly interesting, in that
 Chen was thus cleared by someDne well below him ir the
 hierarchy).   On the other hand, there were fresh poster
 attacks--unaccompanied by any defense--on Chen Yi (once
 an officer of the MAC) and strong poster attacks--with
 notice of a coming mass meeting--on Nieh Jung-then
 (who has been more important as the coordinator of China's
 civilian scientific/technological programs than as an
 officer of the MAC).   With the late March poster attacks
 on Yeh Chien--ying,  this brought under attack three of
 those four marshals of the MAC as of early 1967 who had
 apparently been held responsible for the PLA's unsatis-
 factory performance during the "adverse current" (the
 rightist resurgence) of early 1967,  but who had seemed
 to make a partial c::meback since that time; presumably
 the new wave of concern about a rightist resurgence was
 responsible for the fresh attacks.   The attacks were also
 interesting in bringing to five--those three, plus Li
 Fu-chun, and Yu Chiu-li--the number of close associates
 of Chou En-lai publicly attacked since late March.   Chou
 was, of course, the principal administrator of the policies

 of the relatively moderate period from September to late
 March, and was generally regarded as the leader (in some
 sense) of those with a common interest in modifying or
 deflecting policies associated with the militants.   It
 thus continued to appear, in early May, that a further
 purge of military leaders and moderate figures lay ahead,
 although there was not sufficient reason to conclude that
 the next wave of the purge would be a large one.
 There was an even more striking display of the
 militants, and of the degree to which Mao's team had be-
 come a family affair, at an 8 May reception for compon-
 ents of the revolutionary committees.   In the official
 account, the officers of the central CRG, the old PLA/CRG
 (now perhaps reassigned), and the 'Support the Left'
 Group were grouped with Mao and Lin, although most of
 them are not politburo members, and most of the polit-
 buro members were dropped out of the elite group and
 listed separately below.   The account seemed clearly to
 be making the point that the 14 figures in the Mao-Lin
 grouping were to be taken as Mao's first team, his "pro-
 letarian headquarters."  After Mao, Lin, and Chou En-lai
 came Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng of the central CRG, then
 Li Fu-chun* (the same order for the first six as on 1
 October), then Madame Mao, Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-
 yuan of the central CRG (with the Madame concurrently
 on the old PLA/CRG), then Hsieh Fu-chih and Huang Yung-
 sheng of the MAC and 'Support the Left' and perhaps the
 political work group, then Wu Fa-hsien and Yeh Chun of
 the old PLA/CRG (Yeh Chun now officially second) and
 perhaps the political work group, and finally Wang Tung-
 hsing of the central CRG and the security services. In
 other words, Mao's first team consisted of himself and
 Lin, their wives, the party police chief (Kang), two
 military leaders in addition to Lin (Huang and Wu), three
 *Li seemed the only incongruous figure--that is, the
 only one believed not to be highly active in promoting
 the "revolution" and not regarded by Mao as fully reli-
 able.

 propagandists,  two government leaders (Chou and Li) and
 two more policemen (Hsieh and Wang).   There is no way to
 make this list come out as predominately moderate.*
 The same group (less Chang Chun-chiao, absent in
 Shanghai) was again displayed on 20 May as the first team.
 Essentially the same group was displayed again in early
 June, but this time with the odd man--Li Fu-chun--excluded
 and listed below.
 The Scale of the Purge
 It remains true that the scale of the purges of
 the PLA leadership--from the very top level to the level
 of provincial commanders--is not generally recognized.
 The purge of the PLA has not been on the same scale as
 the purge of the party, has normally struck only a few
 officers at a time, f).nd has been less publicized, but
 cumulatively it has been formidable.   A brief review
 follows.
 As for the principal guiding body, the Military
 Affairs Committee (MAC), Chairman Mao and de facto Chair-
 man Lin Piao have remained in place, but, of the other
 seven known officers when the "revolution" began, one
 was purged at once (Lo Jui-ching), another by the end of
 *Shortly thereafter, on 16 May, the three central
 ,journals--People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army
 Daily--published a joint editorial on the second anniver-
 sary of the central committee circular which "formally"
 .launched the cultural revolution.   It was appropriately
 militant, denouncing several discredited party leaders
 by name as "renegade" and enemy agents, reaffirming Mao's
 policy of "putting destruction first," pointing again to
 the dangers of the "iight-deviationist trend of trying
 to reverse correct decisions," and calling for a continua-
 tion of "attacks on the class enemy."

 1966 (Ho Lung), another was soon dropped (Chen Yi), and
 the remaining four (Nieh Jung-chen, Liu Po-cheng, Hsu
 Hsiang-chien, and Yeh Chien-ying) were displaced as active
 leaders by the four rising figures added in early 1967,
 although so far as is known the four marshals are still
 members of the MAC standing committee.   Moreover, two
 of the four added in 1967 (Hsiao Hua and Yang Cheng-wu)
 have since been purged.   The effective leadership seems
 to amount to Lin Piao, Hsieh Fu-chih, Su Yu, and the
 recently-added Huang Yung-shs-ng; Wu Fa-hsien is an un-
 reported but possible fifth.
 The PLA's Cultural Revolution Group, the special
 organ formed to conduct the purge, has suffered the normal
 fate of purging instruments--to be purged itself with
 every shift in the line.   Of its four chairmen in its
 short life, in 1967 two were purged (Liu Chih-chien and
 Hsiao Hua) and a third (Hsu Hsiang-chien) was removed
 and demoted, and of its other eight known officers five
 have been purged (Yang Cheng-wu, Hsu Li-thing, Kuan Feng,
 Hsieh Tang-chung, Li Man-tsun).  The only surviving of-
 ficers--if the group itself has survived--have been Madame
 Mao, "advisor" and de facto chief, Wu Fa-hsien (chairman
 since August 1967), Wang Hsin-ting and Chiu Hui-tso; Yeh
 Chun (Madame Lin Piao) has obviously moved from lowly
 member to rank behind Wu Fa-hsien in this group or its
 successor, and others (e.g., Li Tso-peng, Chang Hsiu-
 chuan, Liu Hsien-chuan) may have been added to the of-
 ficers.  However, as noted, the PLA/CRG may have been
 disbanded in February and its officers reassigned to the
 central CRG and the MAC's political work groups.
 As for the foremost conventional military organ,
 the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Lin Piao has
 prospered, but, of the other eight ranking officers when
 the "revolution" began, three deputy ministers and the
 head of the general office were purged by early 1967 (Lo
 Jui-ching, Hsu Kuang-ta, Liao Han-sheng, and Hsiao Hsiang-
 Jung).   Since that time, the Ministry's leadership has
 apparently been stable--Lin, Hsiao Ching-kuang, Su Yu,
 Wang Shu-sheng, and Hsu Shih-yu; but others may have been
 added.

 The General Staff (which coordinates combat opera-
 tions) lost two chiefs-of-staff to the purge (first Lo
 Jui-thing, then Yang Cheng-wu), and of the other ten prin-
 cipal officers when the "revolution" began at least five
 have been purged (deputies Chang Ai-ping, Peng Shao-hui,
 and Yang Yung, and operational directors Wang Shang-,Jung
 and Lei Ying-f+i) and another deputy has long been missing
 (Chang Tsung-hsun).   The effective officers are the new
 chief-of-staff, Huang Yung-sheng; the new deputies Wu
 Fa-hsien and Wen Yu-cheng, and (apparently) the old
 deputies Li Tien-yu, Wang Shu-sheng, Wang Hsin-ting, and
 Han Hsien-chu.
 The General Political Department, as an organ
 responsible for political control and surveillance, has
 been wiped out, although the department nominally exists.
 Its director (Hsiao Hua) and at least two of its deputy
 directors (Liang Pi-yeh and Liu Chih-chien) are known
 to he been purged, two others (Fu Chung and Hsu Li-
 ching) have apparently been purged, another (Yuan Tzu-
 chin) has long been missing,  and only one (Li Tien-yu)
 has appeared in favor (and not in this post).
 The other key departments and sub-departments (e.g.
 rear services, training, cadres, intelligence, security)
 continue to elude assessment, as few of their directors
 were known when the "revolution" began, and very few have
 been identified in those posts since that time.   Some
 have remained in favor as individuals, some apparently
 have not.
 Of the 13 principal figures of the seven principal
 service headquarters* as of late 1965--the commanders and
 political officers, with one dual--six are known or be-
 lieved to have been purged.  Of the Air Force, commander
 *There is apparently an eighth service headquarters,
 of the Signal Corps;  it is not considered here because
 it is not known when Chiang Wen and Huang Wen-ming as-
 sumed their posts.

 Wu Fa-hsien has prospered and risen, but political of-
 ficer Yu Li-chin was recently purged.  Of the Navy, com-
 mander Hsiao Ching-kuang has survived, but political of-
 f icer Su Chen-hua was purged.  Of the Armored Forces, com-
 mander Hsu Kuang-ta was purged, while political officer
 Huang Chih-yung has survived. Of the Engineers, command-
 er Chen Shih-chu apparently survived (but has been out
 of sight), and the presumed political officer Tan Fu-jen
 has also made it.  Of the Railway Corps, both commander
 Li Shou-hsuan and political officer Tsui Tien-min have
 apparently been purged.   Of the Artillery Forces, com-
 mander Wu Ko-jua has apparently been purged, while poli-
 tical officer Chen Jen-chi has apparently survived.   And
 of the Public Security Forces, Hsieh Fu-chih, believed
 to be still both commander and political officer, has
 risen high on the "revolution."
 In sum, of the 65 top positions in the central
 military leadership, the occupants of at least 35 of these
 positions--at least 28 individuals--are known or believed
 to have been purged, and several others have been dis-
 placed as active leaders.   Half of the 28 purged officers
 of the central leadership were military professionals, and
 half were political specialists.
 The picture is much the same for the 13 military
 regions.  Of the Peking MR, Yang Yung and Liao Han-sheng
 were both purged by early 1967 (successors Cheng Wei-?sha n
 and Hsieh Fu-(,,hih have remained in favor).   Of the Inner
 Mongolian MR, Ulanfu (dual) was purged in 1966 (succes-
 sors Teng Hai-ching and Wu Tao have remained in favor).
 Of the Shenyang MR, Chen Hsi-lien has prospered but Sung
 Jen-chiung was replaced (successor Pan Fu-sheng has ap-
 parently remained in favor).   Of the Tsinan MR, Yang Te-
 chih remains in favor but Tan Chi-lung was purged (suc-
 cessor Wang Hsiao-yu is in favor).   Of the Nanking MR.
 Hsu Shih--yu has remained in favor but the political o -
 ficer was replaced (by Chang Chun-chiao, who has prosper-
 ed).   Of the Foochow MR, Han Hsien-chu has remained in
 favor, but Yeh Fei was purged (his replacement has not
 been identified).  Of the Canton MR, Huang Yung-sheng
 has been transferred to Pelting (in high favor) while Tao
 Chu was purged (neither replacement has been identified).

 Of tine Wuhan MR, Chen Tsai-tao and Wang Jen-chung and his
 successor Chung Han-hua were all purged (successors Tseng
 Szu-yu and Liu Feng are still in favor).   Of the Kunming
 MR, Chin Chi-wei has apparently been removed (his replace-
 ment has not been identified), while Yen Hung-yen was a
 suicide (successor Li Tsai-han is in favor).  Of the
 Chengtu MR, Huang Hsin-ting and Li Ching-chuan were
 purged in 1966 and their successors Wei Chieh and Kan
 Wei-han were removed and perhaps purged in 1967 (succes-
 sors Liang Hsing-chu and Chang Kuo-hua appear to remain
 in favor).   Of the Lanchow MR, Chang Ta-chih and Hsien
 Heng-han have apparently remained in favor from the start
 (the only such case, where both survived). Of the Sinkiang
 MR, Wang En-mao (a dual) has survived but has been removed
 from Sinkiang and may yet be purged.   Of the Tibet MR,
 Chang Kuo-hua kept the title but was transferred to Chengtu
 (acting commander Jen Jung has appeared in favor, although
 there is some .doubt about him), and the political officer
 has not been i ,entified.    In sum, of the 24 key figures
 (two dual) of the regional commands when the "revolution"
 began, at least 15 have been purged or removed, and three
 of their successors have already been purged or removed.
 Only four (of the 15) or five (of the 18) were strictly
 military commanders; two were duals, and the rest were
 political officers, mainly purged for their roles in the
 party apparatus.
 Finally, of the 44 key figures of the 22 provincial
 military districts when the "revolution" began, about 20
 are known or believed to have been purged or removed, and
 the status of several others has been and remains in doubt.
 Most of those purged were political officers, and, again,
 mainly for their party roles.
 Many of the regional and provincial military lead-
 ers who have survived were exposed to the kind of "rebel"
 attacks which had preceded the downfall of political
 figures.   It is not known whether these attacks refle'-t
 an intention on the part of the militant leaders in Pk-
 ing to bring down these regional and provincial figures
 at a later date.   Some observers belie u   that Mao's team
 in Peking has already tried and failed to bring down these
 military leaders outside Peking, but Peking's reorganiza-
 tion                    of several military commands has indicated an ability
 to purge any military command whenever it chooses.

 Mao's Domination
 The first and fundamental conc'Lusi'n is that Mao
 Tse-tung has been the central figure in, and the source
 of basic policies for, the "cultural revolution"--the
 man in charge, if not always in control of events.   At
 the heart of the revolution is Mao's conviction of the
 absolute correctness of his "thought," central to which
 is his belief in the power of the fanatical revolution-
 ary will, and Mao's obsessive concern with developing
 "revolutionary successors" who will be vehicles of that
 will and faithful to that "thought."  The "revolution"
 has exhibited throughout such features of Mao's char-
 acter as his boundless vanity, his increasingly paranoid
 suspicion, and his vindictiveness.
 In conducting the "revolution" Mao has exhibited
 certain unstable and irrational practices ??'hich,  parti-
 cularly since 1957, have come to pervade his style of
 leadership.  He constructs fantasies and insists that
 others act as if these were the real world.  He establishes
 as policy contradictory aspects of his "thought" without
 explaining how the contradictions are to be reconciled,
 and he issues equivocal directives which permit him to
 shift at will without admitting a reversal r-f course.
 He defines his own posit-n (when decisions must be made)
 automatically as the true center between the errors of
 the "right" and the "extreme 'left', "'   and, when these
 practices aad policies lead to disaster, insists that his
 great losses have really been gains.      The purge through-
 out has also exhibited, or. a grand scale, such features
 of Mao's past campaigns as setting traps for leaders he
 has already decided to purge (i,e., giving them jobs which
 cannot possibly be done right), and setting "tests" for
 those he is undecided about while providing no clear
 criteria for passing those tests.   He finds scapegoats
 for his own errors, and creates new opponents by his
 arbitrary behavior and decisions.   He relies primarily

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 on ignorant fanatics to carry out his program, thereby
 affording opportunities to ambitious underlings to ad-
 vance themselves and destroy their enemies under the pre-
 text of being faithful to Mao and to his "thought."  And
 he punishes cruelly those he feels have "failed" him.
 The role that Madame Mao has come to play in it-
 self argues strongly that Mao has dominated and continues
 to dominate the leadership.   It is most unlikely that any
 other leader would have given the Madame such position
 and authority.   The role of the Madame in the "revolution"
 has illustrated both Mao's increasing isolation and his
 "revolutionary" contempt for such isolation, which is
 really a contempt for other leaders   He appears supremely
 confident that no matter how much the others are alienated,
 they will not or cannot effectively combine against him
 and prevail.  The most interesting question of the "revo-
 lution" is whether he is right abort that.
 Inherent Instability
 The fact that it is the regime in power that is
 conducting the "revolution" in China does not necessarily
 give the situation an inherent instability.   Theoretically
 the leaders could manage the affair.  As Mao says, there
 is no necessary conflict between the desire to purge and
 the desire to build,   Bad institutions and bad men can
 be ..eought down, and good institutions and good men can
 be found or developed to replace them.  But in the present
 case of China's "cultur;il revolution," the defects in the
 character of the principal figure, and the irrationality
 of his thought and practice, make it impossible for the
 "revolution" to follow an orderly course or to arrive at
 a stable end.   Mao can accept periods of relative modera-
 tion and quiescence !all of his campaigns allow for these),
 and he can engage in some construction concurrently with
 destruction (as he in fact has done, since early 1967),
 but he is heavily committed to carrying the revolution
 through '"to the end'''--which seems to mean ? in practice
 the continuing purge and weakening of the very structures
 he is seeking to build.   This has already happened to the

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 central CRG and the PLA/CRG, special organizations formed
 by and for the "revolution."   It is beginning to happen
 to the new revolutionary committees, and will probably
 happen to any new party apparatus formalized at the Ninth
 Congress.  The destructive process may not occur on the
 scale of 1966-67 (which was a time of outright anarchy,
 rather than instability), and,  in fact, each convulsion
 might be weaker and might claim fewer victims.   But Mao
 apparently wants the process to continue on ea scale suf-
 ficient to keep China in a state of turmoil.  And as he
 further disrupts his already severely disordered. society,
 he further cuts away his already narrow base of support
 among those capable of contributing substantially to the
 constructive features of his program (i.e., people like
 Chou En-lai, Li Fu-chun, Nish Jung-chen, and Chen Yf,
 as distinct from the theorists and fanatics like Chen
 Po-ta, Kang Sheng, Madame Mao, and most other officers
 of the special groups set up to conduct the purge).   A
 high degree of instability is evident in the tension
 among individual leaders and in the pronouncements of
 the party press.   Instability is apparent in the leader-
 ship's current line that it must chart a precarious pas-
 sage between the right and the "ultra left," constantly
 in danger of attack from either extreme, and constantly
 threatened by those who pretend to be supporting Mao but
 are really "double-dealers."   In such turbulent seas, so
 the line goes, only the "great helmsmad'can be sure where
 the boat is and where it is supposed to be going.
 Divisions in the Leadership
 No large group of party and military leaders could
 be expected to be united on an undertaking as extreme as
 the "cultural revolution."  Moreover, the revolution was
 conceived to wipe out resistance--whether conscious or
 unconscious--to Mao's will; thus additional resistance
 and disunity was inevitable.
 The picture that emergc-s, however,  is not that of
 a top leadership composed of v. clearly definable "radical"
 faction and a clearly definable "conservative" faction
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 locked in a struggle for power or influence in which
 changes in policy can be attributed to the "victory" of
 one faction over the other.   For one thing, all of the
 principal leaders have been concerned with both the
 destructive and the constructive elements of Mao's ven-
 ture.   For another,  the groups describer! with these
 terms have not been stable.   Both ?.:~,,:;ely-defined groups
 have been heavily purged, and the leaders of each have
 sometimes taken the initiative to rehabilitate or to purge
 or criticize lesser figures of the group (e.g. the Madame
 purging the "ultraleftists" of the central CRG, Chou En-
 lai criticizing Chen Yi).  But of greatest importance,
 Mao has remained above both groups,  has assigned their
 roles to both groups and to their leaders, and has been
 the ultimate arbiter as to which persons are to prosper
 and which are to fall. In other words, the vacillation
 in Peking's policies has reflected primarily Mao's own
 unsteadiness and caprice as the "helmsman."
 Nevertheless, with these caveats in mind,  there
 have been important differences of disposition and incli-
 nation among Mao's lieutenants--differences which support
 the concept of "groups" and which have seemed to be sharp-
 ening.   In the course of the "revolution," those around
 Mao have seemed to sort themselves out into (a) the true
 Maoists, those who are temperamentally inclined to a
 militant (even fanatical) course and have happily played
 the leading roles in the purges, and (b) those who are
 inclined toward order and stability and have appeared to
 exercise a moderating influence when this has been pos-
 sible.  The first group includes Lin Piao,who is some-
 times, like Mao, above the battle, and at other times
 fully engaged in it.   Included also are the five prin-
 cipals of the central CRG (Chen Po-ta, Madame Mao, Karg
 Sheng, Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan), Madame Lin
 Piao (who has been with Madame Mao on the PLA/CRG), and
 their followers at all levels, including the leaders of
 some of the most militant Red Guard and "revolutionary
 rebel" organizations.  The second group is composed of
 government leaders such as Chou En-lai, Li Fu-chun, Nieh
 Jung-chen, and Chen Yi, men responsible for the practical
 aspects of operating the government, and most of the
 military leaders below Lin Piao's level.   This second group
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 probably includes even those military leaders who have
 profited from the revolution like C/S Huang Yung-sheng,
 and those forced into key positions in conducting the
 purge of the PLA, such as Hsieh Fu-chih and Wu Fa-hsien.
 The tension and conflict between these groups have been
 increasingly evident, and there have probably been con-
 scious efforts by members of each to limit the influence
 of the other and to discredit some of its members.
 The destructive component of the "revolution" has
 thus far been dominant.   This has given the militants the
 opportunity to encourage Mao to continue along lines on
 which he wanted from the start to go, and this closer
 association with Mao has meant that the militant's have
 been in a stronger position than the relative moderates,
 even in periods of relative moderation.   While the mili-
 tants have found it expedient to sacrifice some second-
 level figures when their zeal has been judged excessive,
 the positions of the leaders has'seemed comparatively
 secure; the relatively moderate leaders have been more
 heavily attacked and have lost more supporters, and
 only one of them--Chou En-lai, an apparently indispensable
 man--has seemed comparatively- secure.  Beyond this, the
 leaders of the militants have given an impression of
 greater cohesion, of working closely together toward agreed
 objectives.   The relative moderates have not seemed to
 be a disciplined group with a "spokesman" (as Chou En-
 lai is frequently described).   They have seemed to be
 organized only in the sense of recognizing a community
 of interest.    They have tried to reduce the damage in
 periods of militant advance, .,.dve sometimes been able
 as individuals to influence Mao j.r. those periods in which
 rapidly increasing disorder and the prospect of chaos have
 made him amenable to influence (e.g., by Chou En-lai and
 some military leaders in August 1967), and they have play-
 ed leading roles in the administration of his policies
 in relatively moderate periods.
 Developments in the period from September 1967 to
 the present (late May) illustrate pretty well the rela-
 tionship between the militants and the relative moderates.
 In early September, in the face of greatly increased dis-
 order, the principal figures of Mao's team (including the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Madame) acted together to call off attacks on the PLA.
 They authorized the PLA to use force to prevent seizures
 of weapons, and they purged some of those who had most
 aggressively harassed the PLA.   For mouths thereafter,
 although there were militant initiatives and features,
 the emphasis was on stabilization, the formation of al-
 liances,  the ending of factional activity, and the build-
 ing of a new administrative apparatus.  The mi.litants
 seemed to be on the defensive, and there was speculation
 that these changes might have been imposed on Mao by a
 coalition of government and military leaders.   By March
 there was speculation that the position of the militants
 had deteriorated so far that little remained of the "cul-
 tural revolution" but the name.  However, the centrai role
 of Mao in calling for a "constructive" phase in September,
 and his continued central role since that time was con-
 firmed in early March, at which time a group of military
 leaders directly challenged the militants of the central
 CRG around Madame Mao.  Mao immediately backed the mili-
 tants,  purged the military leaders, launched a nationwide
 campaign against the "rightists," and stimulated militant
 factionalism among mass organizations and even in revolu-
 tionary committees.  Since that time, Mao has repeatedly
 displayed the militants as the dominant figures of the
 team.
 The PLA as an Instrument
 The PLA as an instrument of the "cultural revolu-
 tion" has suffered from Mao's style of work.   It was or-
 dered into action in January 1967 to 'support the Left'
 without being told how to separate the 'left' from the
 'right,'  it was thereafter sharply restricted and rebuked
 for taking its directive as a mandate to restore order,
 and several of its top-level officers (of the MAC) were
 set aside.   It was then subjected to increasing attacks
 by the "rebels," and, when told to restore order again,
 it was not given the necessary authority.   Many of its
 judgments as to the support of the 'left' were again over-
 turned in the summer of 1967, and it was threatened with
 a large-scale purge.  When this harshness toward the PLA
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 led again to increased disorder and disruption by mass
 organizations, the PLA was told again in September to
 take action,  but it was given very limited authority to
 use force, and, twice burned, it held to a narrow, 'self-
 protective interpretation of its orders.   After it had
 achieved some success in restoring order during the
 autumn of 1967, Madame Mao again (perhaps involuntarily)
 stirred up the "rebels" against it.   When disorder again
 increased, Mao's team in Peking failed to back local PLA
 commanders in using even the amount of force authorized
 in September.   Finally, while Mao's team in Peking helped
 to reduce disorder during the winter of 1967-68 by cam-
 paigning against factionalism and s'iowing signs of favor
 for some of the regional and provincial military leaders
 attacked by the "rebels;" the collision of three PLA
 leaders in March 1968 with Madame Mao and the central CRG
 was followed by fresh criticism of the PLA and fresh in-
 citement of the "rebels."
 In the course of these events, the PLA has lost
 some degree of the control it had over its own affairs.
 Loosely responsive in the past to party organs like the
 Secretariat and the General Political Department, it must
 now respond to several special organs in addition to the
 MAC--the central CRG, the PLA/CRG and/or the three poli-
 tical work groups, and the 'Support the Left' Group.   This
 has also made for confusion.
 The PLA has been periodically held up as a model
 and praised by Mao and others (including the Madame), and
 it has gained in power, having been in military occupa-
 tion of the main centers in China since early 1967 and
 having dominated the revolutionary committees (local ad-
 ministrations) formed since that time.  However, it has
 never seemed to have the power--either at the center or
 in the regions and provinces--to successfully defy the
 central party leadership dominated by the militants; the
 leaders in Peking have seemed able to reorganize and purge
 the military commands at will.
 Moreover, its increased political power has been
 gained at the expense of its military capabilities.   It
 was much too small (2.5 million) to replace the party
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 (20 million), it has been spread thin, its military train-
 ing and weapons program have been disrupted.  its combat-
 readiness has decli:,ed, and its morale has probably suf-
 fered.
 On balance, the PLA leadership has probably been
 left with a greater sense of resentment than of pride.
 This situation contains elementb of serious danger to Mao.
 The PLA as an Object
 In the first stage of the purge--to August 1966--
 the victims in the PLA, like the victims in the party,
 were primarily the pre-targeted, such as Lo Jui-ching,
 who could not have done anything to save themselves short
 of staging a successful coup.   In the second stage--of
 "bombardment" by the Red Guards, to January 1967--the
 victims in the PLA, again like the victims in the party,
 were primarily those regarded as having failed the "test"
 (although some were really pre-targeted); that is, they
 handled the Red Guards poorly, or they resisted the dis-
 ruptive impact of the "revolution" in their areas of con-
 cern, or'they were insufficiently militant as instruments
 of the purge, or they had overly close associations with
 purged leaders.   In the next stage--the early months of
 1967, during which discredited party leaders outside Pek-
 ing were removed from their posts in "seizures of power"--?
 the military victims were comparatively few, as Mao needed
 the PLA's good will for the restoration and maintenance
 of order; in this stage, however, a number of PLA leaders
 made themsolves eligible for later purging by being too
 hard on the "rebels."  The PLA victims in the nex:- stage
 --summer 1967--were some of those aggressive local mili-
 tary leaders, plus the insubordinate Wuhan commanders,
 plus those held responsible for the poor indoctrination
 that led to this (all of the remaining officers of the
 General Political Department).   In the next stage  through
 February 1968, in which the leaders in Peking were re-
 penting their over-reaction to the Wuhan Incident and
 attempting to soothe the PLA--the PLA was again given a
 respite from the purge, while scapegoats were found among

 second-level civilian "militants" for the policies which
 had offended the PLA as a whole during the summer.   In
 the most recent stage, the high-level victims were those
 PLA leaders who came into conflict with the central CRG
 and with Madame Mao in particular.   In all stages, some
 PLA leaders, like some party leaders, fell as a result
 (or partly as a result) of speculative ventures that
 failed--that is, attempts to dislodge or discredit other
 leaders who turned out to be more powerful.
 Despite the inability of any individual to defend
 himself successfully, there has apparently not been, in
 any stage of the purge, any broad or coordinated effort
 by any group of military leaders to resist the purge.
 There has been maneuvering for survival--trying to de-
 flect attacks, trying to evade or blunt directives, play-
 ing for time, and so on--but, so far as is known, there
 has been no attempt to coordinate resistance outside
 Peking or to stage a coup in order to depose Mao and get
 rid of Lin Piao and the other militants of the central
 CRG.  The reason may be that Mao has never taken on a
 large enough group of PLA figures at, one time--that is,
 he has brought them down in small groups, months apart,
 and has periodically reassured the PLA that he did not
 intend to carry out a large--scale purge; the one threat
 of such a purge, in late July 1967 (part of the over-
 reaction to the Wuhan Incident), was soon withdrawn.
 Nevertheless, the various small, separated purges
 of the PLA have added up to a large-scale purge--more
 than half of the central military leaders (half of whom
 were military commanders), and about half of the regional
 and provincial military leaders (but mostly politicals),
 or, overall (including armies), an estimated one in four
 of the PLA's military commanders and half of its political
 officers.   It seems certain that many or most of the re-
 maining PLA leaders do not regard those who have fallen
 as guilty as charged, and that there is much resentment,
 as well as fear that such arbitrary criteria will be ap-
 plied to themselves.   Some of this feeling is doubtless
 focussed on Madame Mao, as she has had the starring role
 in carrying out the purge of the PLA, has led the attack
 on the leaders of almost every group purged, and has

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 accused them of offenses against herself personally;  but
 most PLA leaders surely recognize that she has been act-
 ing as Mao's instrument, and some may surmise that Mao
 has been using her to deflect resentment from himself.
 Thus, while Mao has succeeded in -purging a large
 number of his real and fancied opponents in the PLA as
 in the party, in so doing he has almost certainly in-
 creased the ranks of the alienated.   This accumulated
 resentment of the  treatment of the PLA both as instru-
 ment and as object, when combined with the well-founded
 fear of purges still to come, makes the PLA (the party's
 "gun") an explosive weapon.   To topple Mao himself would
 probably require his assassination or a'military coup,
 rather than some form of defiance from commanders outside
 Peking.
 Mao's Narrowing Base
 Thus far, Mao seems to v?.ew the results of the
 "cultural revolution" as worth their staggering cost in
 terms of social disorcer, economic dislocation, popular
 demoralization, and d!.sruption of the military establish-
 ment.                          As he seems to view the situation, he has success-
 fully purged those whom he wanted to purge, even though
 the numbers-go far beyond his earlier calculations.   As
 he sees it, he is separating the true believers from the
 revisionists, and creating "revolutionary successors" from
 the young.   He also seems to believe that he is building
 a new and better governing apparatus, and that in so doing
 he is making additional contributions to Cor;.unist doctrine
 and practice.
 To an outside observer, however,  the dominant im-
 pression of the past two years is how narrow Mao's base
 of support has become--much smaller, one would think, than
 even Mao believes it to be.   This consequence of the
 "revolution" is clearly illustrated by the composition
 of the small group which Mao and Lin began in May to pre-
 sent as their first team.   The team consists mainly of
 Mao and Lin and eight others who have risen in and on the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010031-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010031-2
 "cultural revolution" and have been in charge of the
 special instruments of the "revolution"--the two wives
 (both former actresses), three propagandists, and three
 policemen.   It includes only two military leaders in
 addition to Lin (Huang Yung-sheng and Wu Fa-hsien) and
 only one or two government leaders (Chou En-lai, and Li
 Fu-chun sometimes).  Of the 13 or 14, only four or five
 (Mao, Lin, Chou, Kang Sheng, and Li if included) were
 on the first team when the "revolution" began.
 The status of Madame Mao both illustrates and con-
 tributes to the narrowing of Mao's base in the central
 leadership.   Part of the problem is the deterioration of
 Mao's judgment.   Ten years or even five years ago he would
 not have imposed his wife on other leaders; he would have
 found someone else to do the job.   The same point can be
 made for Mao and Lin as a partnership, by pointing 'co the
 role of Maaame Lin as well; Lin's wife may soon have, if
 she does not already have, a role second only to Mao's
 wife in conducting the ongoing purge of the PLA.
 There seems no doubt that other party and military
 leaders--including some on the first team--resent the
 status of Madame Mao (and the emerging status of Madame
 Lin, although she is not yet on the same level and is
 not yet accorded the Same veneration).   It was bad enough
 when Mao alone had to be treated as infallible and sacro-
 sanct:  now there are two of them, and the second is, if
 anything, more irrational, suspicious, vain, and vindictive
 than the first.
 Although Madame Mao and other members of the first
 team have defended and praised one another, there is
 evidence of disagreement between the Madame and some of
 them on the conduct of the "revolution."  The military
 leaders on whom Mao's position--the position of the entire
 first team--directly depends are probably those who most
 resent Madame Mao, and Madame Lin as well.  The "revolu-
 tion" in itself has given the military leaders much addi-
 tional reason to dislike and distrust both Mao and Lin.
 And nothing could be better calculated than the roles
 of the two women in purging the PLA to provoke additional
 resentment--to the point of alienation--on the part of
 Chinese military men:   as Chinese, as military, acid as
 men.

 In addition to the narrowness of Mao's base among
 central leaders, it is hard to believe that the military
 figures who dominate most of the revolutionary committees
 throughout China are truly reliable "revolutionary succes-
 sors," or that the rehabilitated party figures are.   It
 is not credible that military and party leaders who have
 been put through what these men have in the past three
 years would come out of it as dedicated servants of the
 man who put them through it.  While they may be so awed
 by or frightened of Mao that they will try to do what he
 says (when they understand what it is), they would seem
 to be poor material for "revolutionary" programs.  Mao
 himself may see them this way, and may plan to replace
 them when he has developed more promising leaders among
 the young.
 Mao has made some stupendous mistakes in recent
 years.   The "hundred flowers" campaign ended by alienat-
 ing the intellectuals whom it was originally designed to
 enlist, and led to the systematic attacks on Mao and his
 policies which persuaded him that another "revolution"
 was necessary.  The "great leap forward" was another and
 worse disaster, setting the Chinese economy back by some
 years.  The dispute with the Soviet party and thereafter
 with other parties further damaged the economy, left China
 without an important military ally, and left the Chinese
 party with the Albanian and New Zealand parties and a
 number of quarreling t;plinter groups as political allies.
 In the present case, the "cultural revolution" too has
 been a disaster for China on at least that scale.   It is
 not clear whether it is to be a disaster for Mao person-
 ally--that is, will lead to his overthrow by others led
 by the military--but his position seems to be in greater
 danger than it has ever been.

 China's political situation will remain unstable.
 So long as Mao dominates the leadership, his personal
 instability will be the central reason for this; ;he will
 work toward fantastic ends through irrational and often
 conflicting policies, will periodically redefine the
 "correct" position in terms to protect himself,  and will
 purge those who have failed him.   Moreover.', his team is
 mismatched, and there will continue to be tension and con-
 flict among its elements.   If Mao dies or is set aside,
 a period of even greater instability is likely.
 The revolutionary committees are also inherently
 unstable, and there will continue to be conflict among
 their three elements, each contending with the other two.
 This will lead to periodic purges, and r;ay become serious
 enough to force Mao to prolong or return to a de facto
 military )ccupation of much of China.
 A Ninth Party Congress may yet be held in 1968,
 although Mao's spokesmen have seemed to be retreating
 from this.   In any case, the militants are likely to be
 predominant in the new politburo and secretariat.   While
 these militants are likely to dominate the process of
 constructing the new party apparatus throughout China,
 a conflict may be building in the camp of the militants
 .--between the central CRG on one hand and Lin Piao on the
 other.  That is,  if Kang Sheng and Madame Mao are to run
 the new secretariat (taking over from the central CRG),
 they presumably have an interest in keeping military
 leaders--who now dominate the revolutionary committees--
 out of key party posts throughout. China, and getting
 their own followers in; but Lin Piao,  looking ahead to
 the succession, may want military leaders to occupy key
 party posts concurrently.
 Mao's team seems likely (as it has been implying
 in recent weeks) to carry the purges further.  This would
 mean'to take harsher action against the former leaders
 already disgraced (Liu, Shao-chi et al.). to bring down
 some of those "rehabil:.tated" in the course of the revolu-
 tion, and to discover "hidden" counter-revolutionaries

 among party and military leaders not yet touched.   (If
 not, it will probably mean that Mao is being blocked.)
 In any ca?,.,, zo long as Mao continues to dominate the
 leadership, there will be periodic purges; his style of
 work requires that, with every upsurge of the "revolu-
 tion," some of those who opposed it must fall, and, with
 every retreat, some scapegoats must be found for "excesses."
 It is idle to prophesy which individuals will fall; ex-
 cept for Lin Piao and Madame Mao (the fall of either of
 whom would probably mean that Mao himself was on the way
 out), no one seems entirely secure, not even the other
 leaders of the central CRG or Chou En-lai.  Several of
 the central and regional military leaders seem particu-
 larly insecure, in the wake of the Yang Cheng-wu case.
 The greatest danger to Mao's own position will
 continue to lie in the threat he poses to others,  in
 particular his further purges of the PLA.  The worst
 of all mistakes would seem to be to give Madame Mao a
 really free hand.   Apart from the possibility of assas-
 sination by an isolated individual with a grievance, Mao
 might provoke PLA leaders (other than Lin) to combine
 against him--in the form of a coup, planned in Peking
 and carried out either there or on one of Mao'a tours.
 He might provoke this by taking action which would be
 seen as presaging the general decline of the military,
 or by again threatening the PLA (as in July 1967) with
 a large-scale further purge of tenth;? and regional le&.d-
 ers, or, conceivably, by threatening Chou En-lai, who is
 probably regarded by PLA leaders as being at least as much
 their champion as Lin Piao is.   (A coup against Mao would
 probably be also a coup against Lin Piao as the foremost
 Maoist.)  Mao's base of support seems already so narrow
 that he might be unable to protect himself if other key
 figures--who seem at best to be qualified supporters of
 the old man--come to believe that their survival is at
 stake.  To spell it out:  he might have so few support-
 ers left among the military that none of those who were
 approached to join a coup, or who learned of it through
 other means, would tip him off.   (This is essentially
 what happened to Khrushchev.)

 Mao may die or become disabled at any time.   In
 this event, instability would be expected to increase
 in the short term, as it always does in a Communist suc-
 cession.   And it might increase greatly, if the succes-
 :3or tries to carry out the revolution along Mao's lines
 "to the end."  That is, the designated successor (Lin
 Piao) will probably in fact succeed to the post,  he may
 really be as dedicated as he seems, and he may surroand
 himself with other militants, but there is probably only
 a handful of Chinese leaders who genuinely share Mao's
 vision--which is essentially that of unending "struggle,"
 with brief periods of remission--and who would cooperate
 to that end.   (In other words, Mao has failed to produce
 any significant number of reliable "revolutionary" suc-
 cessors", Maoism without Mao is not viable.)  On this
 reading, Lin either would change or would lose control
 of the forces around Chou En-lai and of a large part of
 the military, and there would then be a sc. ions "strug-
 gle for power" (thus far, under Mao's domination, a
 secondary feature of the "revolution").   Lin's assets
 among other leaders, in a struggle along these lines,
 would not be overwhelming; even if Lin has the coopera-
 tion of the other militants (of the central CRG), these
 are almost certainly not held in high esteem by other
 leaders (Madame Mao herself would not be an important
 factor; she might not even survive Mao), and, moreover,
 they have probably not yet developed a strong base of
 supporters.  Thus Lin's effective support would have to
 come from elements of the PLA and of the police (control
 of which is now divided between the central CRG and the
 MAC), supported by armed Red Guard and "revolutionary
 rebel" organizations.   Ranged in opposition would be
 other elements of the PLA and of the police, supported
 by other mass organizations.   A struggle could conceivably
 continue for years.   But it seems more likely that Lin
 Piao would modify the "revolution" (in the course of which
 he might have to dispose of some of the other present mili-
 tants in order to preserve his own position), and that
 he in turn would be succeeded by a group of leaders who
 would modify it further.  Thus Mao's virulent doctrines
 would become attentuated and die out--until such time,
 perhaps, as another group*of leaders were to despair of
 solving China's problems by conventional means and were
 to turn back to the fanatical old visionary.
