 COMMUNIST CHINA -- DEVELOPMENTS IN
 LEADERSHIP    R
 rid ing on JB-May)
 (since last
 I.   A shake-up o-f Mao Tse-tung's inner circle of ad-
 visers definitely appears to be taking place.
 A.    Last week we told you that we had been de-
 tecting signs that a behind-the-scenes power
 struggle was under way.
 B.    Mao Tse-tung's personal position still seems
 to be secure.   His grip probably was loosened
 for a time during his recent 52 month absence
 from public view, but he appeared to be healthy
 and alert in movies taken in early May.
 C.    This is what we now think about the status
 of his five top advisers:
 1.    Peng Chen, sixth in the power structure,
 has probably been the victim of a power
 play engineered by his old rival Teng
 Hsiao-ping.   He is still out of sight

 2.    Teng is the powerful general secretary.
 Peng's removal would strengthen his po-
 sition and likely weaken that of Liu
 ?Shao-chi who has been number two in the
 party since at least 1945.   It is even
 possible that the highly militant and
 vigorous Teng has supplanted the color-
 less Liu as Mao's chosen successor.
 3.    The flexible Chou En-lai--China's Mikoyan
 --appears thus far to have managed to
 stay aloof from the fray.   He is a useful
 technician and as such has a good chance
 to survive.
 4.    Contrary to Western press speculation,
 Defense Minister Lin Piao probably is
 not a contender for power.   His name is
 often used to reinforce Mao's authority,
 but he has been chronically ill for
 nearly 30 years.   Lin seemed to be ex-
 tremely frail in recent movies taken
 with Mao Tse-tung.   He probably does
 not aspire to the top job.
 II.   The Chinese Communists still haven't named any
 important victims.

 A.      This indicates that the shake-tip is still un-
 folding.
 Lo Jui-ching had been removed
 as army chief of staff two months or so ago.
 Lo,  a 'top security man as well as chief of
 the army,  is one of a group of key officials
 who have been out of public view for many
 months and who may have been casualties of
 the struggle.   Others on the list are the
 head of the central committee's propaganda
 department and the commander of the Peking
 Military Region, who is Yang Yung.
 C.    On 26 May a deputy director of the Central
 Committee Propaganda Department was accused
 of backing an "antiparty" play produced in
 Shanghai.   Certain other "muddleheaded" high
 officials were also said to have supported
 the play.
 D.    A new nationwide campaign has been develop-
 ing this past week against unnamed high of-
 ficials who have ridiculed the practical
 value of Mao Tse-tung's political tracts.

 1.    One of the most widely publicized cases
 involves a Shanghai melon peddler who
 wrote an article in 1965 explaining how
 Mao's works had helped him sell his
 melons before they rotted.   This article
 was republished on 14 May by Liberation
 Army Journal, which as we pointedoout
 las-t week has been spearheading the at-
 tack on "antipar-ty" officials.
 2.   The melon peddler on 25 May then pub-
 lished a statement demanding the unmask-
 ing of a high official who,  he said, had
 ridiculed his article.
 3.   A similar incident involving a ping pong
 player who claims he was greatly benefited
 by Mao's thinking has been widely publi-
 cized.
 4.   Referring to these incidents, Liberation
 Army Daily promised "to fight to the bit-
 ter end against anyone that-strikes at
 Mao's thinking regardless of how powerful
 he may be,  how high his position is,  how
 famous,  or how strong a backer he has."
 E.   On 27 May "antiparty" charges were leveled
 for the first time against a provincial

 official.   This was a ',Vice governor'of Shantung
 Province, who was also director of the cul-
 tural department of the provincial party com-
 mittee.   He was accused of working hand in
 glove with the group of conspirators in the
 Peking city apparatus whom,.we told you about
 last week.   The charges against this man
 probably will lead to attacks on higher of-
 ficials in Shantung and perhaps other prov-
 inces.
 III.   We still feel strongly that factions in the lead-
 ership have been disputing with one another.
 A.    This is indicated by the conflicting positions
 taken by various party newspapers over several
 of the crucial issues.
 1.   The initiative in launching the attacks
 has been consistently taken by Liberation
 Army Journal, not the Peoples Daily and
 Red Flag,  normally the two most authorita-
 tive journals in China.
 2.   In fact Peoples Daily and Red Flag have
 at times directly opposed the army paper.
 A major charge implicating Peking Mayor
 Peng Chen has been that the journals of
 his municipal party committee refused to

 accept a dictum laid down by Liberation
 Army Journal on 29 November 1965 that
 a certain play was a quote big poison-
 ous weed unquote.
 3.    Although the parallel has not yet been
 publicly drawn, we have checked and
 found that Peoples Daily and Red Flag
 also took the incorrect line of the
 Peking city journals.   Our check also
 reveals that neither Peoples Daily nor
 Red flag got around to labeling the
 play a poisonous weed until:April.
 B.   What the confusing record of these news-
 papers indicates to us is that Mao Tse-tung
 has been standing above the struggle while
 the acting party leader has been under at-
 tack by someone who controls the Liberation
 Army Journal.
 1.   During Mao's absence the acting party
 leader would be Liu Shao-chi.
 2.   Teng Hsiao-ping could control the army
 paper, which is not actually published
 by the army but by the army's General
 Political Department.   This is directly

 headed by Teng.

 both fallen in line with the army paper,

 DCI BRIEFING NOTES
 I.   Fidel Castro's recent actions appear to result
 from deepening personal frustrations over the
 regime's continuing inability to surmount basic
 economic and administrative problems.
 A.   The administrative purge of a number of
 medium-level officials in the ministries of
 foreign affairs,  foreign trade,  and CUBANA
 airlines was designed to restore dynamism
 to Castro's regime and to revive revolution-
 ary enthusiasm.                                          It may have had the opposite
 effect, however.
 1.   The March 7 to March 11 trial of Major
 Rolando Cubela,  sentenced for plotting
 to assassinate Castro, probably had the
 same goal, as well as the aim of deter-
 ring other would-be plotters.
 2.   Armed Forces Vice Minister Ameijeiras was
 dismissed on March 17.   A drunkard and
 a marijuana user, he had long been in
 disfavor with the regime.   Several top
 military commands have been routinely

 reshuffled since the first of,the year;
 the principals involved were not cashiered
 and retain their prominence as political
 bureau members of Castro's Communist
 Party.
 B.    In his speech on March 13 at Havana University,
 Castro hurled new insults at Peking and charged
 that the Chinese leaders,  in their old age,
 have confused Marxism-Leninism with fascism.
 The attack was essentially a reiteration of
 Castro's earlier statements and came exactly
 one year after his first criticism of China.
 1.   For the first time Castro has denounced
 President Eduardo Frei of Chile and his
 Christian Democratic Party.
 a.         He said that in Chile "the only way
 to win the revolutionary struggle
 will be by armed struggle," and he
 denounced Frei as a coward, a liar,
 and a reactionary.   Havana radio has
 begun beaming a special:'propaganda
 program to Chile attacking Frei and
 his government.
 b.   The attacks reflect the same mili-
 tancy displayed at the January

 Tri-Continent Conference and indicate
 that Castro is losing interest in co-
 existence and compromise in the hemi-
 sphere.
 C.    The state of alert declared throughout Cuba
 on May 27 was ostensibly a Cuban reaction to
 US moves,  the most outstanding of which was
 the killing of a Cuban soldier by a sentry
 at the Guantanamo Naval Base on May 21.   In
 reality,  there are indications that Cuba in-
 tended to provoke an incident with the US in
 order to reinforce its "anti-imperialist"
 posture and to divert the attention of the
 people from current economic difficulties.
 1.   The soldier was shot and killed by the
 US sentry after penetrating the base per-
 imeter during a reconnaissance of a newly
 laid minefield.   Such penetrations of the
 base perimeter have continued--presumably
 at the direction of the Cuban Government.
 Any additional incidents will further
 heighten the already tense situation on
 the island and provide the Castro regime
 with additional "justification" to demand
 greater sacrifices of the people.

 Approved For Release 2005/O     GIIIRR8QR00025R000700080002-9
 2.   The alert also is probably intended to
 test the efficiency of the Cuban defen-
 sive system, provide realistic training
 for armed forces personnel, and flush out
 "counterrevolutionaries" unfortunate
 enough to misjudge the reasons for the
 alert.
 II. Despite Castro's deepening frustrations, his po-
 sition in Cuba remains pre-eminent.
 A.    The large and efficient military and security
 forces under Raul Castro are strong and loyal
 to the regime.   We think they are more than
 adequate as a defense against insurrection
 or invasion--barring substantial US assistance.
 B.    The 55,000 members of the Cuban Communist Party
 are drawn from an elite core of Castro's most
 militant supporters.   They form the regime's
 inner bureaucracy.
 1.   Last October Castro announced the formation
 of a political bureau, a secretariat, and
 five standing committees within a 100-man
 central committee.
 2.   The party controls provincial and local
 affairs, education and indoctrination,
 and the mass organizations.

 Approved For Release 2005/OIS.I4RR00025R000700080002-9
 3.   About one fifth of the party members and
 two thirds of the central committee mem-
 bers are from the Cuban armed forces.
 C.    Factionalism in the regime appears to be at
 its lowest level since Castro came to power.
 1.   Nearly the entire top civilian and mili-
 tary leadership is included in the central
 committee.
 a.   About 20-prominent "old" Communists
 have gained added stature thrdUUgh
 membership.
 b.   There are no adherents of the eco-
 nomic policies of Che Guevara on the
 central committee.
 D.   Despite these factors contributing to the re-
 gime's stability,  there is no doubt that the
 over-all political climate in Cuba has shifted
 somewhat in the past year.   An air of uncer-
 tainty is prevalent in Havana which--if not
 checked--could lead to further disenchantment.
 III.  Castro recognizes that he has no alternative to
 continued large-scale aid from the Soviet Union.
 As a result,  he has continued to move closer to
 Moscow, and has cooled toward the Chinese.

 A.    The October visit of Soviet Foreign Minister
 Gromyko to Cuba and Raul Castro's six-week
 visit to the USSR and Eastern Europe in
 October and November were probably gener-
 ally aimed at reviewing Soviet-Cuban rela-
 tions.
 B.    Castro probably no longer views all of Latin
 America as on the brink of revolution.   He
 now limits clandestine Cuban support and con-
 centrates it where revolutionaries are most
 active.   Nevertheless, Cuban propaganda on
 behalf of armed revolution since the Tri-
 Continent Conference has reached a level of
 intensity not seen since 1963.
 1.   Venezuela, Guatemala, and Colombia are
 Castro's three principal targets.
 2.   In addition, Cuba has sent military
 personnel to help insurgents in the Congo,
 and to train other African revolutionaries
 in Brazzaville.
 IV.  Ernesto "Che" Guevara,  the former minister of
 industries, and the regime's foremost revolution-
 ary,  left the Cuban political scene last spring.
 He may also have left Cuba.

 A.   Guevara may be carrying out the pledge attributed
 to him by Castro to assist other revolutionary

 B.   Guevara's eclipse stemmed from differences
 with Castro over basic questions relating to
 the development of the Cuban economy, and to
 the attitude Cuba should take toward revolu-
 tionary activity elsewhere in the hemisphere.
 V.    Cuba's economic performance remains spotty, and
 the long-range outlook is uncertain.
 A.   The 1965 sugar harvest of about 6 million tons
 surpassed the yearly harvest of the pre-Castro
 years.
 1.   This demonstrated the effectiveness of
 wide economic and administrative reforms
 applied during 1965.
 B.    The 1966 harvest probably will be in the neigh-
 borhood of 4.5 million tons--2 million tons
 short of the goal.   Severe drought has been
 blamed by Castro for this shortfall.
 1.   The outlook for future sugar earnings is
 clouded by continuing harvesting and mill-
 ing problems, and by uncertain world
 sugar prices.
