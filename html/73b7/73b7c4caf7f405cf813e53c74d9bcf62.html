 ISRAEL-IRAN:   Oil Vulnerability
 Israel's vulnerability to the Iranian oil embargo
 hinted at by the Shah Zast weekend is Zess than might at first
 seem apparent.
 The Shah publicly implied that he might consider em-
 bargoing oil exports to Israel in order to make the Israelis
 more flexible in peace negotiations. Israel relies on imports
 for all but a tiny fraction of the 140,000 barrels of oil it
 consumes per day. It gets 70 percent of its oil from Iran. It
 is, however, not as vulnerable as this would suggest.
 After the agreement with Egypt in 1975 that returned
 the Sinai oilfields to Cairo, Israel received nearly all of its
 crude from Iran. Subsequently it began importing oil from
 Mexico and other countries. Israel currently could satisfy
 its needs by buying oil on the spot market and relying on its
 stockpiles. It has a five-month supply at normal consumption
 rates.

 //Some 44 military advisers and two.missile-armed
 helicopters are going to Abeche, where they will join a French
 commando company already in place. Abeche, the largest town in
 eastern Chad, has a sizable French civilian community that al-
 most certainly would be endangered by renewed fighting.//
 //In addition, several small French command and
 support units have already gone to Ndjamena, along with an Air
 Force detachment of four military transport aircraft and 40 Air
 Force personnel. An advisory team slated for use in Mongo and
 several other support units are said to be on standby in France.
 If all of the troops arrive in the country, the size of the
 French military presence there will more than double, to over
 650 men.//
 //Giscard still hopes to avoid any direct involve-
 ment in the fighting, but the quick collapse of Chadian forces
 during the fighting last month apparently has convinced him that
 France must play a more direct--if covert--role to defend the
 more heavily populated southern part of the country.
 GHANA: Problems in the Regime
 Ghanaian leader General Acheampong is worried that
 his proposal for a nonparty form of government could be de-
 feated in a national referendum on 30 March. Acheampong sees
 his vaguely defined concept of "union government"--a partner-
 ship between civilians and the military--as a way of ensuring
 that he continues in power as an elected president.  His op-
 ponents may be gaining strength as they step up their campaign
 against the proposal.
 The referendum is an outgrowth of Acheampong's prom-
 ise to restore constitutional rule by July 1979. He made the
 commitment last summer in response to antigovernment demonstra-
 tions by student and professional groups.

 Approved For Release 2007/07/17: CIA-RDP79T00975AO30600010012-8
 Popular support for Acheampong's proposal now seems
 to be eroding in at least some areas as a result of Ghana's
 continuing economic decline and of the opposition generated
 by the newly formed People's Movement for Freedom and Justice
 led by retired General Afrifa. Despite Acheampong's control of
 the government media and his ban on political rallies, Move-
 ment leaders are busy campaigning for a "no" vote and apparently
 are drawing good crowds in some places. Afrifa--a key partici-
 pant in the coup that overthrew President Nkrumah in 1966 and
 a leader of the military regime that ruled until 1969--and
 other leaders of the opposition group advocate a return to
 civilian government based on party politics.
 Recent intensified campaigning by Acheampong and his
 c lleagues on the ruling military council suggests he is con-
 cerned over the Movement's potential strength. If he concludes
 that the referendum might go against him, Acheampong may well
 manipulate the electoral process to try to ensure his victory.

 EC-CANADA: Economic Cooperation
 //EC Commission President Jenkins is in Canada
 this week to discuss trade issues and attend the second meeting
 of the EC-Canada Joint Cooperation Committee.//
 //Under their 1976 economic and trade cooperation
 agreement, the EC and Canada have tried to remove trade barriers
 and have identified areas for cooperation such as uranium exploi-
 tation and nuclear energy, aerospace, telecommunications, nonfer-
 rous metals, and forest-based products.//
 //The two parties have made little headway to date
 in expanding trade or investment, but their agreement emphasizes
 Canada's desire to lessen its dependence on the US by develop-
 ing closer economic ties with other countries. The EC hopes to
 gain access to Canadian raw materials in order to be less vul-
 nerable to the Third World suppliers. The agreement with Canada
 offers the EC a model for future links to other resource-rich
 countries like Australia.//

 SWEDEN-USSR: Missile Submarines
 Sweden last week criticized the USSR for stationing
 ballistic missile submarines in the Baltic Sea.
 The demarche
 probably was prompted by Swedish concern over Soviet policy
 toward Scandinavia and is also related to the domestic Swedish
 debate on production and deployment of the neutron warhead in
 Western Europe.
 A senior official of the Swedish Foreign Ministry in-
 formed the Soviet Ambassador earlier last week of Sweden's
 "anxiety and dissatisfaction" over the presence in the Baltic
 of six submarines armed with nuclear missiles.  Swedish officials
 explained their sudden concern by saying that the submarines'
 presence, now apparently permanent, could encourage NATO to in-
 troduce similar weapons into the area. The Foreign Ministry
 offical told the Soviet Ambassador that Sweden considers the
 submarines to be a "whole new weapons system" in the area and
 that their nuclear armament contradicts Moscow's professed wish
 for a nuclear free zone in the northern region.
 The basing
 in the Baltic eliminates the need for the submarines to make
 the dangerous week-long transit from the Northern Fleet around
 Norway to get within range of many West European targets.)
 The Swedes may be trying to demonstrate how tough and
 balanced their neutrality can be in advance of planned Foreign
 Ministry meetings with the Soviets this year.  Swedish officials
 are expected to meet shortly with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
 Zemskov, the usually hard-line Soviet official who smoothed over

 Norwegian-Soviet relations following Premier Kosygin's blast in
 December against Norway's role in NATO. Foreign Minister Soder
 will visit the USSR later in the year.
 The Swedish Government may also have shown its concern
 in order to head off further criticism from the opposition
 Social Democrats who, in a parliamentary debate later this month,
 are already expected to try to embarrass the government by charg-
 ing that its opposition to the development and deployment of the
 neutron warhead in NATO countries has been only lukewarm. The
 government also may be reacting against President Brezhnev's
 letter urging opposition to the neutron warhead, which the Swedes
 have criticized as a Soviet effort to manipulate their foreign
 policy.
 TASS' political commentator Yuriy Kornilov yesterday
 noted the "noisy propoganda campaign" in Sweden over the issue
 of the Soviet submarines in the Baltic. He defended their pres-
 ence there as "quite natural" and termed the alleged campaign
 an attempt to "whitewash the actions of those forces that would
 like to turn Western Europe into a testing range for neutron
 weapons."

 North Korea has strongly protested a joint South
 Korean - US military exercise,  Team Spirit  '78,  that begins
 today. Pyongyang has characterized the exercise as a serious
 attempt by the US to threaten the North, but the rhetoric stops
 short of that used in August 1976,  just prior to the Panmunjom
 incident, when the North Koreans charged that the US was ac-
 tively preparing to attack.
 A protest statement yesterday by a Foreign Ministry
 spokesman was the first official North Korean pronouncement
 prompted by US military actions on the peninsula since mid-1976.
 Between 1974 and 1976 the North routinely issued several such
 statements each year.

 North Korea has been stepping up its diplomatic ac-
 tivity around the world in an apparent effort to regain the
 initiative in its competition with South Korea. The North clearly
 hopes to exploit the South Korean - US exercise in its diplo-
 matic and propaganda campaigns.
 CHINA: United Front Campaign
 The Chinese Government is now emphasizing
 "united front" tactics  cooperation with non-Communists--in its
 30-year-old struggle to gain control of Taiwan. Peking appar-
 ently sees the "united front" campaign as part of a tong-term
 "softening up" process during which it will highlight political
 rather than military means to achieve the integration of Taiwan
 with the mainland.
 //The Chinese have emphasized political action
 against   e Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan since the
 fall of the "gang of four" in October 1976.
 Isolation of the Nationalist Government also is a
 publicly proclaimed goal of Peking's new, more open policy
 toward overseas Chinese. By emphasizing patriotism and an or-
 derly China that extends a warm welcome to "compatriots from
 Taiwan," Peking hopes to recruit more supporters from overseas
 Chinese communities throughout the world, and to tap the pool
 of professional and technical people who have left Taiwan over
 the years. Peking's recent publication of the rewards to be
 given military defectors from Taiwan is another facet of the
 broad effort to undermine Taipei's prestige and play on any
 grievances among the island's citizens.
 In the US, Peking hopes to use increased influence in
 Wiese-American community to generate broad support for
 normalization of Sino-US relations. This long-term approach
 seems to reflect recognition of the resistance that normalization

 Approved For Release 2007/07/17: CIA-RDP79T00975AO30600010012-8
 faces in the US. It includes promoting the establishment of pro-
 Peking organizations in the US and placing advertisements in
 leading US newspapers urging early normalization. In its own
 publications, Peking also has been attempting to improve its
 image by painting China's future in glowing colors and empha-
 sizing the government's unity and stability.
 Peking in the past has achieved only limited success
 in gaining the allegiance of pro-Taipei overseas Chinese. While
 overseas Chinese sometimes exhibit pride at Chinese accomplish-
 ments such as space satellites and the development of atomic
 weapons, they often remain suspicious of Peking's intentions.
 This is particularly true of overseas Chinese businessmen, many
 of whom had relatives in China who lost property or were other-
 wise mistreated during past political campaigns.
 A speech last month by Liao Cheng-chih, an important
 official in overseas Chinese affairs, took these concerns into
 account by playing down any hostility to the "bourgeoisie" and
 emphasizing that visits to China would not entail any risks to
 property or personal safety. Liao also stressed the importance
 of the "united front" in completing China's reunification. He
 attempted to reassure the people of Taiwan that reunification
 would not hurt their interests.
 Peking's increased activity faces vigorous competition
 from Taipei's own efforts to maintain or improve its influence
 among the overseas Chinese. While professing unconcern about
 Peking's effort, the Nationalists will probably increase their
 activity in order to meet the challenge. Although the National-
 ist Government faces more vigorous political opposition at home,
 few people on Taiwan endorse the island's integration with the
 mainland.
 China-is preparing to participate in the special UN
 General Assembly session on disarmament in May. This will be the
 first time the Chinese have become involved in any of the UN's
 disarmament forums.
 We do not expect the Chinese to present any new pro-
 posals at the session. China's UN representatives, who have been
 uncharacteristically active in recent weeks informing themselves
 on the disarmament issue, have stated that the basic Chinese

 position remains unchanged. That position calls for the nuclear
 powers to declare that they will not be the first to use nuclear
 weapons. The Chinese also advocate the eventual destruction of
 all nuclear weapons.
 Peking will probably try to mobilize Third World sup-
 port behind its call for total nuclear disarmament and its cri-
 ticisms of the strategic arms limitation talks. While the Chinese
 consider SALT a "fraudulent" exercise by both the USSR and the
 US, they doubtless will aim their sharpest rhetorical barbs at
 the Soviets.
 China also apparently wants to improve its image as a
 response le nuclear power. Foreign Minister Huang Hua told a
 Western leader last month that,Pekina had turned down a Libyan
 request to buy an atomic bomb.

 Returns from Guatemala's presidential election on
 Sun ay have been delayed and clouded by charges of fraud in the
 Guatemala City mayoral vote that was held at the same time. The
 elections apparently were conducted without violence.
 Fernando Romeo Lucas, the government's candidate, and
 conservative candidate and former chief of government Enrique
 Peralta Azurdia are running a surprisingly close race. The lead
 has seesawed between them. Ricardo Peralta Mendez--whose Christian
 Democratic party won a plurality in the last presidential election
 but was denied victory by vote rigging--is unexpectedly running
 a distant third. With close to one-half of the anticipated returns
 announced, Lucas and Peralta Azurdia have 37 percent each, and
 Peralta Mendez trails at 26 percent.
 Peralta Mendez will probably disavow the results; he
 has previously said he would encourage civil violence if he felt
 he had been defrauded. If his position in the race were to re-
 main poor, however, he would have to persuade followers that a
