 China: The Year in Review
 Summary
 Economic considerations dominated China's political agenda in 1985
 to an unusual degree.  Buoyant after the October 1984 party meeting that
 endorsed urban economic reforms, Deng Xiaoping and his supporters
 within the Chinese leadership sought to make 1985 the "Year of Reform,"
 carrying out controversial new economic policies and seeking to improve
 and consolidate their hold on the levers of power.
 But economic policies did not fulfill the reformers' expectations, and
 they even exacerbated a number of China's existing economic problems.
 The government was rocked by soaring inflation, an overheated industrial
 sector, a sharp trade deficit and diminished foreign currency reserves, a
 7-percent dropoff in grain production, and a growing corruption problem,
 all of which gave political critics of reform the opportunity to renew their
 attacks at mid year.
 This memorandum was prepared by                                     Office of East     25X1
 Asian Analysis.  Information available as of 28 March 1986 was used in its preparation.
 Comments and queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Domestic Policy
 Branch, China Division, OEA,                                                           25X1

 Despite the increased pressure, Deng and his allies were able to
 bring off a significant political victory at the September Conference of
 Party Delegates. At that meeting, Deng managed to secure the retirement
 of numerous members of the party's conservative Old Guard--including 10
 members  of the  Politburo--and  replaced  them  with  younger,  better
 educated  leaders more committed to the principles of reform. Party
 conservatives nonetheless remain a formidable force.   Party reformers
 have recovered somewhat from the political difficulties of last year, but
 the complexity of the economic problems that face China has evidently
 made them more cautious, and they have set as their goal for 1986
 "consolidation and digestion" of reforms already undertaken, and economic
 stabilization.
 Economic considerations played a major role in China's foreign
 relations as well, although strategic concerns remain the central focus.
 Chinese leaders expressed satisfaction with the "stable" nature of relations
 with the United States, which permitted a 25-percent increase in bilateral
 trade (to about $8 billion).  No major trade or political issues emerged in
 1985, although the usual problems of Taiwan, textiles and technology
 transfer remain in dispute.
 Last year saw a concerted attempt on China's part to test the new
 Soviet leader's interest in rapprochement:  anti-Soviet polemics were
 reduced, and the level of official contact between the two governments
 was  raised  somewhat.   Gorbachev  did     not  offer  any  significant
 concessions on the fundamental issues dividing the two sides, however,
 and, by the end of the year, the atmospherics had cooled noticeably, with
 the  Chinese refuting  Soviet claims that   relations   were improving.
 Economic relations between China and the Soviet Union continued their
 slow trend of improvement in 1985, with bilateral trade approaching $2
 billion.
 Last year, the first full year in which to measure China's performance under
 economic reform guidelines and policies, was a trying one for China's reform leadership.
 Starting off the year full of enthusiasm for the economic reform policies approved at the
 landmark Third Plenum of the 12th Central Committee (October 1984), party leaders went
 from ebullient confidence to gnawing doubt and defensiveness to stiff determination as
 they watched the economic, political, and social effects of their policies.  Having based
 their political philosophy on their ability to bring about economic improvement, party
 reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, were bruised by accusations from conservatives last
 summer that they mishandled economic policies in 1985. Although the problems did not
 prevent Deng from making important political gains at the Party Delegates conference
 held in September, they clearly were enough to slow the momentum of political and
 economic reform.

 Deng Xiaoping, 82, is still the linchpin of the political system in China, and
 concerns about the state of his health emerged when Deng stopped making public
 appearances for a two-month period in late 1985 and early 1986.  Deng showed up for
 Chinese New Year in his home province of Sichuan, but speculation about him and
 possible succession changes intensified last year.  Deng himself evidently helped fuel
 the rumors at mid year, when, according to Hong Kong publications, he developed a
 "second stage" succession package. According to the unsubstantiated account, at some
 point in the next two years, the following leadership changes will take place: Deng will
 resign as Chairman of the party Military Commission, and will be replaced by Hu
 Yaobang;   Hu Yaobang will give up his post as General Secretary of the party to
 Secretariat Standing Secretary Hu Qili; President Li Xiannian will retire and his job will be
 taken over by Premier Zhao Ziyang; Zhao will be succeeded as premier by one of his
 younger Vice Premiers, Li Peng or Tian Jiyun.
 Although the changes were not put into effect at the September Conference of
 Party  Delegates--as  some  had  speculated--Deng  did  bring  off a  major political
 realignment at that meeting, a rejuvenation of the party's leadership that is consistent in
 intent with the "second stage" succession scenario. At the Central Committee plenum
 that preceded the Delegates Conference, 65 elderly members of the Central Committee
 resigned, including 10 members of the Politburo and one of six members of the crucial
 Politburo Standing Committee.    The full Delegates Conference then chose 91 new
 Central Committee members, preparing the way for the "election" at the ensuing Central
 Committee plenum of six new Politburo members and five additional members of the
 Generally speaking, the leadership changes shifted the balance within all the
 leading party organs in favor of those associated with reform.  Almost all of the
 Politburo retirees were considered "conservative" on reform issues, and seven of them
 were representatives of China's armed forces, which sometimes has been viewed as
 being in opposition to Deng's reforms. Most of the new leaders meet Deng's succession
 criteria of younger, better educated, professionally qualified, and politically reliable (read
 non leftist). Within the Politburo in particular, the addition of Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Wu
 Xueqian, and Qiao Shi appears to significantly strengthen the reform group within the
 leadership.   New Politburo members Yao Yilin and Li Peng, although they publicly
 support  and  administer  reform  policies, seem to  lean toward  Politburo  Standing
 Committee member Chen Yun, who emerged last year as reform's principal detractor.
 Deng by no means swept away all opposition to his programs at the party
 meetings. The strongest voices in the conservative cause, in fact, maintained their party
 positions: Chen Yun and Li Xiannian on the Politburo Standing Committee, Peng Zhen
 and Hu Qiaomu on the Politburo, and Deng Liqun on the Secretariat.  It also appeared
 that Deng had to compromise on some personnel issues, on the pace of implementation
 of reform policies, and on the ideological tone of the party's programs.  Deng's own
 speech to the assembled delegates stressed some conservative themes, including the
 need to improve the knowledge of Marxist theory within the party. Deng also had to sit
 through a bitter diatribe from Chen Yun, who made his complaints about some aspects
 of reform completely clear, and implicitly warned Deng not to try to stifle dissent within
 the party.

 In the period leading up to the conference, leadership tensions had been quite
 high, and we believe this was a factor in the way Beijing handled economic policy
 during the middle part of the year. China's leaders were confronted with a considerable
 amount of bad news during the late spring and early summer: high industrial growth
 rates, a startling increase in the money supply and capital construction expenditures,
 urban food price inflation, skyrocketing imports and a downward plunge in foreign
 exchange reserves, a gloomy agricultural forecast, and a host of corruption scandals,
 many of them involving the Special Economic Zones. Reform critics seized on these and
 other issues and, in our view, forced the reformers into a defensive position.  This
 accounts for, among other things, Deng's statements in July that the SEZs were
 "experimental," and could fail.
 Since the party conference, reformers have continued to be defensive in their
 speeches and articles about economic policies, but less, we believe, because they fear
 conservative attacks, and more because the policies themselves have been flawed, or
 incorrectly implemented.   Moreover, reformers such as Tian Jiyun and Wan Li have
 begun openly to rebut the criticisms leveled at reforms by conservatives last year,
 particularly on such issues as grain production and rural industry, and the linkage
 between reform policies and corruption. In sum, we believe the reformers have regained
 the  initiative as a  result of the changes  brought about by the Party Delegates
 Conference, but will not use it to push through any controversial new reforms.  Instead,
 they have declared 1986 to be a year of "consolidation and digestion" of reforms already
 Foreign Policy
 China  increasingly  is  tailoring  its  foreign  policy  to  serve  its economic
 modernization drive.     This is reflected in Beijing's efforts over the past year to improve
 relations with both Washington and Moscow.  Relations, however, continue to be closer
 and smoother with the United States. Indeed, the Chinese continue to regard the United
 States as an important strategic shield against Soviet military pressure as well as a key
 source of investment capital and technology.
 Chinese leaders repeatedly stress that Sino-US relations are "stable"--reflecting
 their interest in  seeing  the economic  relationship in  particular  continue to  grow.
 Bilateral trade jumped last year by more than 25 percent, from $6 billion to about $8
 billion, according to US customs statistics.  Direct US investment also increased to just
 over $1 billion--most of it in offshore oil exploration and drilling. Economic ties are
 likely to geta further boost as a result of recent US efforts to streamline COCOM
 procedures for handling Chinese requests for licenses for Western technology.         US
 exports of advanced technology in fact rose to $500 million in        1985 and almost
 certainlywill increase again this year.
 The US-China military relationship is developing at a gradual pace but has hit
 some snags along the way.  The United States has taken some initial steps to assist
 China with military modernization.  A key component of that assistance--the sale of an
 avionics package for the Chinese F-8 fighter--is now before the US Congress for

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/21: CIA-RDP04T00794R000201160001-9
 approval.  But Chinese demands that Washington give private assurances that visiting
 US warships would not be carrying nuclear weapons forced the US Navy last spring to
 postpone indefinitely a planned port call to Shanghai.
 The differences over the port call appear to reflect an increasing reluctance on
 the part of some senior Chinese leaders to have China identified strategically with the
 United States--lest that complicate Chinese efforts to improve relations with Moscow
 and compromise China's more independent foreign policy posture.  Over the past year
 or so, and especially since the accession of Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev, Beijing
 has made several symbolic concessions designed in part to test the new Soviet leader's
 interest in seeking a rapprochement with China.  In addition to referring once more to
 the USSR as "socialist," and Soviet leaders as "comrades," the Chinese have cautiously
 agreed to reestablish some long-severed ties--trade union and parliamentary relations.
 They have stopped short of agreeing to restore formal party-to-party ties, presumably
 hoping to extract a significant Soviet political concession in exchange.
 Thus far, Moscow has been unwilling to offer such a quid pro quo. At the recent
 Soviet party congress, Gorbachev reiterated the standard Soviet line of offering to
 improve relations with China as long as it was not at the expense of any third party--a
 not very veiled reference to Soviet allies in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Mongolia.  As a
 result, progress toward an expansion of political relations appears to have stalled once
 more over China's demands for satisfaction on the so-called "three obstacles"--that is,
 that the Soviets either withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, cease their support for
 Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, or substantially reduce Soviet forces along the
 Sino-Soviet border, including those in Mongolia.
 After months of muting their criticism, the Chinese in fact have increased the
 volume recently of their attacks on Soviet foreign policy.  They also have rebuffed
 Moscow's efforts to pin down dates for the exchange of visits by Soviet and Chinese
 foreign ministers, which Beijing agreed to in principle last fall. It would appear that the
 Chinese are trying to exploit the Soviets' interest in the visits to induce Moscow to
 adopt a somewhat more flexible approach to some of the security issues that divide
 Sino-Soviet economic relations continue to improve.   Over the past three years,
 bilateral trade has increased substantially, approaching $2 billion.  The Chinese and
 Soviets are moving ahead, for example, with plans for the Soviets to help modernize
 some factories they built in the 1950s, and to build several new projects.  Even if
 political relations remain stalemated, the Chinese probably calculate that expanding
 economic ties will help to keep tension with Moscow manageable, and will give them
 access to some useful Soviet technology.
 China's relations with Western Europe, Japan, and much of the Third World also
 are being shaped increasingly by economic considerations--that is, the desire for
 markets, raw materials, technology, and investment capital.  In the case of Western
 Europe and countries around China's periphery, strategic considerations of course still
 weigh very heavily.  The Chinese continue to strongly support Pakistan and the Afghan
 resistance as well as Thailand and the Cambodian insurgents as a means of keeping the

 Soviets and their allies in check.  By the same token, they remain supporters of a strong
 NATO as a counterweight to the USSR.  In Northeast Asia, Beijing would like the United
 States and Japan to make some overtures to North Korea to help China counter the
 recent increase in Soviet influence in P'yongyang.  Chinese leaders continue to urge
 Washington in particular to agree to hold tripartite talks with North and South Korea as
 a means of reducing Moscow's ability to exploit tensions on the peninsula.

 The Chinese Economy in 1985: An Overview
 Summary
 In 1985, Beijing confronted numerous problems arising from the
 implementation  of   economic  reforms.   Poor  weather  and     confusion
 surrounding new agricultural policies caused China's grain output to fall
 for the first time in five years. Industrial output, spurred by greater use of
 economic incentives and relaxed central controls, grew more rapidly than
 Beijing  intended--worsening    longstanding bottlenecks  in the  economy.
 Inflation tripled, while the balance of trade worsened sharply and foreign
 Despite  these  problems,  China's   economy     registered  some
 significant gains--including an  11-to-12-percent increase in real GNP.
 Energy output increased by over 8 percent, largely because of production
 incentives,   increased  state  investment, and  technology  acquisitions.
 Despite inflation, workers experienced an improvement in their standard of
 living.  Finally, government revenues increased over 20 percent in 1985,
 and Beijing claimed success in narrowing its budget deficit.
 This   memorandum  was       prepared  by               Office  of  East  Asian  Analysis.
 Information available as of 28 March 1986 was used in its preparation.    Comments and

 Agricultural Performance in 1985--Mixed Results
 After three consecutive years of record harvests, grain output fell 7 percent in
 1985--a result of reduced acreage, flood damage, and confusion over new reforms that
 eliminated grain quotas and replaced them with a market-oriented contract system.
 Rapidly developing rural industries also pulled peasants away from less lucrative grain
 production.  Reform leaders maintain, however, that surpluses from previous years will
 more than make up for the shortfall.  The decline in grain output was offset somewhat
 by increases of 10 to 30 percent in the production of meat, eggs, milk, vegetables, and
 oilseeds.
 Industrial Performance--Overly Rapid Growth
 China's industrial output increased 18 percent last year, according to Chinese
 statistics.  This continued a trend of double-digit growth in industrial production that
 began in 1983 and accelerated in the second half of 1984.  During the first half of 1985,
 industrial output expanded at a 23-percent annual rate, but efforts to cool the economy
 reduced the growth rate to 10 percent by the end of the year.
 Rural industry was the most rapidly growing sector of China's economy in 1985.
 According to a Chinese press report, the output value of rural factories shot up by 35
 percent and constituted almost a third of total industrial production.
 In light industry, buoyant consumer demand sustained a boom in the production
 of electrical home appliances.   Output of building materials, heavy equipment, and
 machinery generally increased more than 15 percent during the year, while production of
 rolled steel increased about 9 percent.
 We  believe that  rapid  industrial  growth  has  been  caused  by skyrocketing
 investment spending--up by 35 percent in 1985--and a surge in wages and bonuses for
 industrial workers.   Successful rural reforms have increased the availability of raw
 materials for industrial use, while boosting rural incomes and fueling consumer demand.
 Rapid industrial growth also has been facilitated by industrial reforms, particularly those
 allowing enterprises to sell overquota production at prices above the state-set levels.
 To a lesser extent, rapid growth last year was due to the technical modernization of
 some segments of Chinese industry.
 Burgeoning Trade Deficit
 Loosened central oversight of foreign trade and a surge in investment and
 consumer spending led to a flood of imports--up more than 50 percent last year,
 according to Chinese customs data.   Because of strong domestic demand, Chinese
 exports increased by only 6 percent--leaving Beijing with a 1985 trade deficit of $14.9
 billion.   Because of  the deficit,  China's foreign  exchange reserves  fell 25  percent
 between September 1984 and September 1985, and China devalued its exchange rate
 about 15 percent during the year.

 Improved Budget Outlook
 Strong industrial growth, rising prices, and increased tariffs on some imports
 pushed up government revenues by over 20 percent in 1985, despite media reports of
 widespread tax evasion. Although statistics on government spending have not yet been
 released, Chinese press reports indicate that Beijing believes the budget deficit was
 eliminated last year.   Chinese accounting practices, however, record Chinese foreign
 borrowing and  government  bond  sales  as  "revenue."  As  measured  by Western
 standards, China's 1985 budget may still have had a deficit of over $3 billion.
 Problems Associated With Rapid Growth
 Although Chinese leaders tout rapid growth as an indicator that industrial reforms
 are working, they are concerned that a continuation of the fast-paced expansion will
 exacerbate longstanding economic problems, heighten social tensions, and undermine
 reform efforts.
 Despite sharp increases in the production of coal, oil, and electricity last year,
 energy supplies in China are strained. Additions to the transportation network have not
 kept pace with the growth in industrial output, and the system remains seriously
 overburdened.  Chinese  media  report that factories still must suspend production
 occasionally because of shortages of electricity and delayed shipments of raw materials.
 Chinese media reports also suggest that key reform goals, such as improvements
 in industrial efficiency and product quality, are being undermined by the rapid growth.
 Beijing acknowledges that higher output in some cases is caused not by efficiency gains
 but by the use of large amounts of inputs. Press reports also suggest that rapid growth
 is  wearing out equipment at excessive  rates,  increasing  occupational  hazards  in
 factories, and generating higher levels of environmental pollution.  Moreover, according
 to Premier Zhao Ziyang, recent output levels were possible only because China imported
 large amounts of raw materials.
 Beijing intends increased competition between state-owned enterprises to spur
 improvements  in  product quality.  The shortages caused    by strong  demands for
 consumer goods and construction materials, however, have actually eased pressure on
 firms to maintain quality standards. Press reports emphasize that low product quality
 remains a serious problem throughout the economy.
 Although output grew rapidly in 1985, it was not sufficient to meet the strong
 demand for consumer goods, equipment, and building materials.  China's retail price
 index showed prices rising 8.8 percent, triple the rate in 1984.  We believe Beijing is
 especially concerned that rising prices will jeopardize popular support for economic
 reforms.  Although large increases in wages and bonuses have cushioned the impact of
 higher prices for some consumers, a jump in retail food prices has caused widespread
 complaints among urban residents, and the rising cost of living apparently was a factor
 in student protests last fall.

 After industrial output increased at a 23-percent annual rate during the first
 quarter of 1985, Beijing implemented a combination of market-oriented macroeconomic
 adjustments and administrative controls.  China's 1985 budget, announced last April,
 called for narrowing the budget deficit by slowing the growth of government spending.
 In particular, Beijing ordered a 10-percent cut in administrative expenditures.  Beijing
 also began pursuing a tight money policy.
 ? In April, Beijing raised interest rates on time deposits and on loans for working
 funds.  In August, Beijing boosted rates on capital construction loans and again
 hiked time deposit rates.
 ? To soak up excess currency, Beijing set aside $2 billion in foreign exchange
 reserves to be used to import scarce consumer durables, and the Ministry of
 Commerce  was  ordered  to  mark  down  prices  of  overstocked  domestic
 commodities and increase sales to the public.
 Many of the administrative controls were employed through China's banking
 system.
 ? China's central bank was ordered to set and enforce quarterly credit limits for its
 branches and the specialized banks.
 ? Banks were ordered to stop offering loans to inefficient enterprises and to firms
 that produce poor-quality products.
 ? Banks were prohibited from extending credit for capital construction projects
 whose spending exceeds the state quota or for projects not listed in the state
 plan.
 ? To prevent indiscriminate increases in wages and bonuses, enterprises were
 required to place wage funds in special accounts to be monitored by the banks.
 Apparently, the payroll accounts of some units were frozen.
 Although industrial production has slowed since July 1985, recent statements by
 Chinese leaders suggest that Beijing remains very concerned with inflation, excessive
 investment spending, and its large trade deficit.  We believe Beijing will continue to
 tighten control over credit and capital construction this year.
 Readjustment and Consolidation
 Deng Xiaoping and other top Chinese leaders remain committed to reform,
 despite the economic dislocations in 1985.  The economic problems, however, have
 forced Beijing to slow the pace of reforms.  In major speeches early this year, Chinese

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/21: CIA-RDP04T00794R000201160001-9
 leaders called for a period of consolidation and adjustment in the reform program.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang stated recently that no major price reforms would be implemented
 in 1986, and, in his speech to the national party conference in September 1985, he
 suggested  that  Beijing  might  need  a  two-year  readjustment  period  to  perfect
 macroeconomic control techniques.
 We believe Chinese leaders realize that some reforms--such as relaxing price
 controls or allowing wage funds to rise with enterprise profits--might be destabilizing in
 an inflationary economy, and that they must improve their ability to use indirect
 economic levers, such as taxes and interest rates, to regulate the economy. In our view,
 the two-year time frame mentioned by Premier Zhao probably is a guideline for the
 readjustment period.  We expect Beijing to move ahead with key reforms as soon as it
 is confident that capital construction is under control and that it has improved its
 economic regulatory mechanisms.

 China's Foreign Trade in 1985 and Prospects for 1986
 Summary
 Over the past year, Beijing has tightened its control of the foreign
 trade apparatus, largely in response to declining foreign exchange reserves
 and a sharply rising trade deficit. High demand in China's industrial sector,
 however, will keep imports high, while increasing protectionism in the
 West will continue to dampen export growth. Moreover, lower prices for
 petroleum and petroleum products--which represent approximately
 one-fifth of the country's export revenues---will decrease Beijing's foreign
 exchange earnings. In an effort to narrow its trade deficit, we believe
 Beijing will continue to exert more control over its foreign trade as a
 means of reducing imports in the face of expected low export growth. We
 believe, however, that the impact on US exports to China will be marginal.

 After more than five years of progressive liberalization of many foreign trade
 practices, over the last year Beijing has begun to reimpose selected central controls
 over foreign trade. The reassertion of control by the Ministry of Foreign Economic
 Relations and Trade (MFERT) is apparently in response to a 25-percent decline in foreign
 exchange reserves between September 1984 and September 1985, and to the
 leadership's concern about a growing trade deficit. Although Beijing's current level of
 foreign exchange reserves is sufficient to cover three months' imports, Chinese officials
 prefer to maintain a five-month foreign exchange reserve cushion.
 One Step Back for Decentralization
 Recentralization began with MFERT regaining control over the establishment of
 new trading organizations. China's open-door policy had given rise to a proliferation of
 import-export companies, many of which lacked the necessary skills for conducting
 trade. As a result, foreign and domestic traders encountered considerable confusion.
 Moreover, the competition among the many Chinese entities--both national and
 provincial--authorized to trade had initiated a price war, driving down the prices of
 China's exports and dampening foreign exchange earnings. Under the new guidelines, a
 new organization may be approved only if its business scope does not overlap existing
 companies and the new firm has qualified personnel.
 In another move to strengthen management over foreign trade, last spring MFERT
 implemented a system of licensing imports and exports. Initially export licenses were
 required for 30 products; later the list was trimmed to 15 key export products. Last fall,
 however, Beijing broadened its export license requirement to 151 items, covering almost
 every major product the country exports. Import licenses were also imposed to dampen
 the flow of incoming goods--many of which China could 'produce domestically--and to
 conserve foreign exchange. In addition, in the past year Beijing announced changes in
 its customs regulations--increasing some tariffs to protect infant industries from
 imports, reducing import duties on some goods including raw materials and
 high-technology items, and abolishing nearly all export duties. These measures will help
 reduce the variation in local assessments of duties and licenses, which had caused
 confusion among foreign traders.
 Despite these measures, China posted a record $14.9 billion trade deficit last
 year, according to Chinese customs statistics. Imports soared more than 50 percent in
 1985 as rapid industrial growth and high consumer demand--sparked by an increased
 money supply--led to sharply higher purchases of raw industrial materials and
 consumer durables. Although petroleum export revenues increased, earnings by other
 major exports--such as textiles and apparel--were sharply lower and, according to
 Chinese data, overall export earnings rose by only 6 percent.
 The Search for New Export Markets
 Developing New Partners. While Beijing recorded only a marginal increase in
 exports to its major trading partners (Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States), its
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/21: CIA-RDP04T00794R000201160001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/21: CIA-RDP04T00794R000201160001-9
 exports to the Soviet Union, Latin America, and Eastern Europe showed substantial
 increases. We estimate that exports to the Soviet Union increased more than 35
 percent over 1984, along with an additional 22-percent increase in goods to Eastern
 Europe. Exports to Mexico and Chile more than tripled in 1985, reflecting Beijing's
 strong interest in developing ties to Latin America.
 Hong Kong continues to be China's largest export market, accounting for more
 than one-fifth of China's total trade. Beijing has actively pursued closer economic links
 to promote the territory's stability and prosperity. Moreover, China is particularly in
 need of a host of services that Hong Kong can provide--financial, trade, and shipping.
 Earlier this year, Hong Kong opened an office in Beijing to further promote trade--its
 first official representation in China--with a second office scheduled to open in
 Shanghai before yearend.
 Moving Into New Commodities. Although grain output fell 7 percent, China
 became a net exporter of grain last year, almost tripling grain export levels to over 9
 million metric tons. Imports--15 percent of which were from the United States--totaled
 about 5.4 million metric tons. Corn constitutes nearly half of China's grain exports with
 the balance in soybeans and rice. Sales to Hong Kong, the Soviet Union, West Germany,
 the Philippines, and Singapore account for more than half of China's grain sales.
 Although revenues from exports of petroleum and petroleum products jumped 25
 percent in 1985, Beijing's search for new export markets will intensify this year as China
 feels the effects of lower oil prices. For the past six years, petroleum and petroleum
 product exports have accounted for roughly one-fifth of total export earnings,
 amounting to nearly $6.4 billion in 1985. If Beijing carries out its promise to hold oil
 export volume at the 1985 level in support of OPEC's attempts to shore up oil prices,
 China could lose at least $1.6 billion in foreign exchange earnings this year.'
 For the next few years, we expect manufactured goods to provide the largest
 source of export growth as the Chinese substitute sales of processed goods for raw
 materials wherever possible. In addition to the higher value-added earnings that
 processed goods command, this strategy is also directed toward compensating for the
 increase in volume quotas developed nations impose on imports from China. The
 Chinese are also attempting to increase their gains from trade by moving into exports
 that reflect their comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufactured goods. For
 example, earlier this year, Beijing announced its plan to export $1.5 billion worth of
 carpets in the next five years and established the China Carpet Import and Export
 Association to coordinate international sales.
 ' This assumes that oil prices will average $18 per barrel in 1986 and that petroleum
 products--nearly 20 percent of China's oil-related export volume--will earn
 approximately 25 percent more per barrel than crude.

 Implications for the United States
 China has little chance of turning to alternative commodities to compensate for
 the expected drop in oil export revenues--attempts over the past several years to
 diversify exports have met with limited success. Hence, Beijing will probably focus on
 slowing runaway imports. We believe much of the slowdown in import growth will be
 effected through stricter foreign exchange controls, including an additional curtailment
 of the purchase authority previously granted to local traders under decentralization.
 Beijing will also continue other restrictive measures such as import licensing and
 selective tariff increases. According to Hong Kong press reports, Beijing's attempts to
 conserve foreign exchange are driving some small, marginal Chinese import-export
 companies out of business. These same sources caution that, because of foreign
 exchange shortages, China may also renege on negotiated contracts--similiar to the
 cancellations of grain and synthetic fiber contracts that occurred in 1983.
 We believe that tightening import restraints will change the composition of
 China's purchases over the next year. Restrictions are already in place on commodities
 that China can produce domestically, including such consumer durables as color
 televisions, refrigerators, radios, and motor vehicles. But Beijing will also need to cut
 deeper into its import shopping list. We believe these cuts will begin with capital
 equipment purchases for postponed or cancelled government projects.
 We believe, however, Beijing will continue to encounter problems slowing
 economic growth and therefore will achieve only moderate success in reducing
 industrial and capital equipment purchases. Consequently, the effect on US exports to
 China, more than one-third of which are machinery and transport equipment, will be
 marginal. Moreover, demand for raw materials and chemicals--which represent an
 additional 25 percent of US exports to China--probably will also be sustained.

 Foreign Investment in China: Impact of New Regulations
 Summary
 Since 1979 more than 5,000 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises,
 and businesses wholly owned by foreign firms have been established in
 China.  By the end of 1985, we estimate that total paid-in foreign
 investment in these enterprises reached $5.4 billion.  We believe that
 through the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) Beijing will continue to seek
 higher levels of foreign investment, although changes in Chinese
 regulations may work against small investors.  In addition, the drop in oil
 prices will probably delay further investment in China's oil industry.
 How Much Foreign and US Investment Now?
 Foreign investment in China has been growing rapidly over the past five years.
 According to China's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MFERT),
 between 1979 and 1985 Chinese authorities granted approval for nearly 2,300 joint
 ventures and over 3,700 cooperative enterprises.  In addition, there were 30 offshore oil

 exploration and exploitation projects' as well as 120 wholly owned foreign enterprises.
 According to MFERT, by September 1985 paid-in foreign investment totalled $5.4 billion.
 total US investment in China as of last
 December was about $1 billion, $600 million of that in oil exploration. US firms also are
 involved in some 100 joint equity ventures with investments of about $150 million. The
 balance of US investment is probably in cooperative enterprises.
 Driving Forces Behind Foreign Investment in China
 Hong Kong is responsible for roughly two-thirds of all foreign investment in
 China and as much as 80 percent of all joint equity venture projects. Hong Kong
 businessmen find China, especially neighboring Guangdong Province, an attractive place
 to invest partly because of family ties and other personal linkages.  In addition, China
 has designed some of its investment incentives--such as establishing the Shenzhen
 special economic zone adjacent to the Hong Kong border--specifically to attract Hong
 Kong investment. Potential investors, faced with a 3.4-percent unemployment rate that
 makes enterprise expansion difficult within Hong Kong itself, find China's labor
 costs--one-third lower than Hong Kong's--especially attractive.
 China has also improved its investment environment by developing its legal
 infrastructure. In 1983, Beijing began to enact scores of laws to attract or protect the
 foreign investor. In September of that year, China issued regulations to clarify its 1979
 law governing joint ventures. The new rules offered longer tax holidays, increased
 opportunities to sell the output of the venture in the domestic Chinese market, and gave
 more decisionmaking autonomy to the venture. In early 1984, China exempted joint
 ventures from import duties and abolished selected taxes on ventures that import
 advanced machinery and technology. In April 1984, the National People's Congress
 formally ratified the leadership's decision to open 14 additional port cities and Hainan
 Island to foreign investment, giving entrepreneurs many of the advantages available in
 the Special Economic Zones. However, the central government has since withdrawn
 plans to invest heavily in infrastructure in these areas.
 In May 1984, Beijing extended the maximum limit of the term of joint ventures
 from 30 to 50 years, giving the foreign investor more time to recoup its investment and
 make a profit. In December of that year, China also joined the Paris Convention for the
 protection of industrial property rights thereby easing concerns of investors about
 pirating protected technologies.
 1 We count only 25 offshore contracts total. MFERT may also count areas where bids
 have closed but no firm contracts have been signed.

 Last year, Beijing revamped its tariff regulations, lowering duties on raw materials
 and high-technology items and gave special tax reductions and exemptions to joint
 ventures and projects in Special Economic Zones. The State Council also eased
 regulations for high-technology joint ventures giving them more discretion over the
 level of their reserves and greater access to domestic markets.
 Investment in the Seventh Five-Year Plan
 China will continue to try to attract foreign investment throughout the Seventh
 Five-Year Plan but with a few modifications. Priority will be given to the development
 of natural resources, transport, upgrading existing enterprises, and tourism. Because of
 foreign exchange difficulties, however, China has revoked some of the autonomy allowed
 local planners. Beijing also is instituting regulations to prevent foreign exchange loss in
 certain types of investment. For example, wholly foreign-owned ventures will be
 required to export part or all of their product; officials stress that this rule is not
 intended to limit foreign investment but to stem foreign exchange loss.
 Beijing is also implementing internal regulations designed to limit the share of
 borrowed funds that can be used to finance small investments. The rule permits no
 debt for any investment less than $3 million; Beijing believes low levels of equity have
 been a major cause of bankruptcies. The limitations could undermine plans of small
 investors who lacked sufficient financial resources to cover the cost of their venture but
 hoped to profit from China's growth in the late 1980s.
 Of special interest to the United States over the past few years, investment in oil
 exploration probably will slow as long as oil prices remain low. This will adversely
 affect the total share of future US investment in China inasmuch as oil represents
 two-thirds of all US investment in China and has been the one area where US firms
 have been dominant. This, too, is more likely to affect small, independent firms that
 have insufficient financial resources to survive until oil prices rise again.

 China's Energy Picture in 1985: Good
 Performance, Uncertain Prospects
 Summary
 China's energy sector turned in a strong performance in 1985, with
 record production of coal, oil, and electric power. Energy growth of 8
 percent, supplemented by improved efficiency and conservation, helped
 sustain China's double-digit industrial growth last year. Nonetheless,
 chronic problems with power shortages and coal transport continued to
 disrupt the economy, and offshore oil exploration showed little promise of
 providing a new long-run source of supply.
 This memorandum was prepared by                              Office of East Asian
 Analysis. Information available as of 28 March 1986 was used in its preparation.

 China's future energy prospects are further clouded by budget and
 foreign exchange problems that may reduce funds needed for expansion.
 Planners are taking a hard look at planned "big ticket" items like the
 civilian nuclear program and the Three Gorges dam, and have already
 cancelled a major coal venture with Japan. In the short run, US exports to
 China of energy technology and equipment may be hurt by these cutbacks,
 but the United States is likely to remain China's principle foreign investor
 in the energy sector and a key source of energy technology crucial to its
 Last year's energy growth of 8 percent (down slightly from 9 percent in 1984)
 was enough to sustain an 18.4-percent increase in China's gross industrial output (see
 table 1). Even so, the Chinese claim that one-fifth of their industrial capacity is idled by
 chronic power outages. Industry is using energy more efficiently, but these advances
 are more the result of better resource management than of technological improvements.
 Because these are largely one-time gains, China's ability to maintain double-digit
 industrial growth with single-digit energy growth remains highly doubtful.

 Last year's runaway industrial growth--which taxed domestic resources and
 contributed to a drain in China's foreign exchange holdings--threatens Beijing's ability to
 expand energy supplies. Indeed, despite the high priority the Chinese have given the
 energy sector over the past few years, proposed energy investments face stiff
 competition from other rapidly growing sectors of the economy for scarce state funding,
 foreign exchange, and building materials.' With less money likely to be available, China
 will be forced to weigh carefully decisions on expensive, long-term projects such as
 nuclear plants and the massive Three Gorges hydroproject against the construction of
 cheaper, coal-fired power plants that are faster to build. China may also have to cut
 imports of Western technology that are critical to its efforts to expand oil and coal
 production. Transport improvements--essential to moving energy to consumers--could
 also be hit by the budget and foreign exchange crunch. The net effect of lower
 ' The funding shortage will be exacerbated by the drop in world oil prices, which could
 cost Beijing $1.6 billion in earnings in 1986.

 investments in energy and related transport projects over the longer run would be to
 impose further constraints on economic growth; similar cuts in 1981 dampened later
 energy output and economic growth and are still being felt.
 The United States--which to date is China's largest foreign investor in the energy
 sector and a key supplier of energy-related technology--is likely, in turn, to be affected
 by any cutbacks.2 In fact, the United States already appears to be out of the running in
 supplying China with nuclear power plants, despite passage of the nuclear cooperation
 agreement. We still expect US firms to account for a major share of China's
 energy-related imports for some time. Just as China presses Japan to meet US levels
 of direct foreign investment, however, it will continue to prod the United States to
 match Japan's lower-cost project and equipment financing.
 We believe that reforms in mine ownership, wages, and prices have been the
 primary reasons for the strong growth in China's coal output. Beijing's decision in 1983
 to allow individuals and collectives to mine coal did much to encourage peasants, eager
 to profit from small-scale industries, to increase production. Last year, 62,500 such
 small mines produced about one-fourth of China's coal; another quarter came from
 medium-sized mines owned by provinces or localities, and China's large state-owned
 mines produced the remaining half. According to preliminary figures issued by Beijing,
 production last year at small- and medium-scale mines grew two and a half times
 faster than at the state mines, largely because of the opening of 12,500 new small
 At all levels, the use of piece wages and special bonuses continued to improve
 productivity. Beijing has also raised the average price of coal to encourage production.
 While the official price of coal remains low, prices are negotiable for above- uota
 production from large-scale state mines and for all coal from smaller mines.
 The United States is the largest foreign investor in China's energy sector. China's
 two biggest joint ventures--the Pingshuo open-pit coal mine and the offshore natural
 gas field near Hainan -- both involve US firms. The United States also has provided
 key energy technologies that helped China to find more oil and accelerate oil
 production, to upgrade hydro and thermal power plant construction and operation,
 and to develop safety procedures for new nuclear plants.

 Last June, China signed a $650 million joint venture with the US firm Occidental
 Petroleum to jointly develop the world's largest open-pit coal mine--Pingshuo--located
 in Shanxi Province. The project, which will produce 15 million tons a year beginning in
 1988, would have been signed several years ago, but the declining international price of
 coal made financing difficult. Falling prices also recently contributed to Royal Dutch
 Shell's cancellation of an open-pit mine project in Shandong Province, and to Japan's
 indefinite postponement of another large open-pit mine planned for Inner Mongolia. If
 international prices stay low, China may find it difficult to market its coal abroad, and
 could be forced to dip into its foreign exchange reserves to pay off foreign investors.
 Oil--Offshore Exploration
 Foreign oil companies exploring China's offshore basins began trial production of
 oil from offshore wells in 1985, with commercial production and export scheduled for
 later this year. Even so, offshore efforts continue to be a major disappointment for
 China's long-run energy planning. The Chinese originally hoped to find a 1 to 2
 million-barrels per day (b/d) supply offshore, both to meet growing consumption and
 export needs and to offset expected eventual declines at mature onshore fields.
 Production this year will reach only 20,000 b/d, from sites developed by the Japanese in
 the Bohai and by the French in the Beibu Gulf. In the absence of a now-unlikely major
 find, we believe China will be lucky to eventually produce one-tenth the amount it
 anticipated offshore.
 The big financial losers in the offshore effort, of course, are the foreign oil
 companies who bore all survey and exploration costs, spending almost $2 billion. Three
 US firms found oil, but all will carry out more drilling before committing themselves to
 commercial production. Most firms fared much more poorly; China had to give some
 unsuccessful participants additional acreage to keep them from quitting.
 China in 1985 offered for bid a second set of exploration blocks, before foreign
 interest had waned any further. Of the 19 blocks available, contracts have been signed
 for six of the more promising areas. Declining world oil prices and continued poor
 showings from first round drilling are, however, likely to dampen Western enthusiasm
 and leave most of the remaining blocks unsigned.
 China's 9-percent increase in crude oil production during the past year came as a
 result of new finds, improved recovery techniques, and greater productivity at existing
 onshore fields. The Shengli oilfield, located in Shandong Province, has made particularly
 impressive production gains and provided almost 40 percent of last year's total growth.
 The Chinese predict that Shengli's major new finds will double the field's production by
 1990 to 1 million b/d. Over 50 Western technicians are working at Shengli to find and
 develop new wells.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/21: CIA-RDP04T00794R000201160001-9
 Recent discoveries on the periphery of several existing fields led Beijing to
 predict that China's oil output will grow by 5 percent per annum through the current
 Seventh Five-Year Plan, reaching 3 million b/d in 1990. We believe China can reach this
 goal, but sustaining it will require additional new finds to replace declining production at
 China's ambitious oil production goals hinge on maintaining output at China's
 largest field, Daqing, a mature field in Heilongjiang Province. Almost half of China's
 current oil supply is produced at Daqing. We believe production at Daqing could start
 declining in the next few years, despite recent Chinese claims that they can sustain
 Daqing's current production for another 10 years.
 In March 1985, China opened 1.83 million square kilometers in 10 southern
 provinces to oil exploration by foreign firms, in the wake of the offshore program's
 disappointing results. The areas Beijing opened have few existing fields and are largely
 unexplored. An Australian consortium signed the first--and to date only--onshore oil
 exploration contract in May 1985 for an area on Hainan Island. In July China opened its
 first onshore basin to international bids--the Subei Basin in Jiangsu Province.
 Meanwhile, Beijing continues to contract with foreign firms, including ones from the
 United States, to provide seismic survey crews and equipment to search for oil in
 Almost all of China's increased oil production last year was exported as either
 crude oil or petroleum products. We estimate that China exported 580,000 b/d of crude
 oil and 120,000 b/d of petroleum products in 1985, worth $6.4 billion, almost 25 percent
 of China's exports. Beijing has nearly doubled the volume of its crude oil exports in the
 last two years by undercutting OPEC prices, marketing aggressively, and conserving
 domestic supplies. But in February, China announced that it will freeze the volume of its
 oil exports at the 1985 level to help support the falling international price of oil. If
 China sustains a freeze and crude oil prices average $18 per barrel, we believe China's
 foreign exchange earnings from oil could decline by $1.6 billion this year.
 Electric Power: Shortages Force Equipment Imports
 Faster power growth in 1985 stemmed from improved coal shipments to power
 plants, good rainfall in hydropower areas, and accelerated power plant completions.
 Nevertheless, chronic shortages remained serious as the economic policies encouraging
 industrial growth collided with inadequate power capacity--fallout from ill-conceived
 investment cutbacks in the early 1980s that slowed power plant construction through
 China added 6,100 megawatts of new capacity in 1985, the most in one year
 since the late 1970s and the direct result of power budget increases of 25 percent in
 1983 and 35 percent in 1984. About 90 percent of the new plant capacity came from
 thermal plants in the power-starved east and northeast, many brought to completion

 Hydroplant construction problems--only one major generator became operational
 in 1985--have forced Beijing to emphasize construction of coal-fired plants that are
 cheaper and faster to build, even though they are more expensive to operate. China's
 ability to supply power generation equipment is still not up to the task, however.
 China's three major power equipment factories have all imported US technology but are
 still unable to meet demand. Meanwhile, China has said it will import 10,000 MW of
 thermal generators over the next five years, over half of its planned capacity additions.
 Reportedly, China will buy up to 6,000 MW of these imports from the USSR and Eastern
 Europe as part of its efforts to expand trade with the Soviet Bloc.
 Beijing already recognizes that even these additions will not solve the power
 crises in its eastern cities. In 1985, China established the Huaneng Energy Corporation
 to negotiate imports of complete power plants outside of the state plan. On 26
 February, a consortium led by the US firm General Electric signed contracts in Beijing to
 provide Huaneng's first two whole-plant imports for Nantong in Jiangsu Province, and
 for Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei. The Chinese are unlikely to award all Huaneng
 contracts to a single source--and Tokyo is considering new low-cost financing so
 Japanese firms can improve their competitiveness--but prospects for additional US
 China's Nuclear Power Program
 Progress has been slow in China's efforts to begin commercial nuclear power
 production. In March, China signed letters of intent with France to supply reactors for
 its planned 1,800-megawatt nuclear plant at Daya Bay in Guangdong Province, but final
 contracts have not yet been signed. Work continues on a small (300 MW), domestically
 built reactor at Qinshan that relies substantially on components and technology
 imported from Japan and West Germany. Meanwhile, China has postponed or cancelled
 plans for additional nuclear plants at Sunan (Jiangsu Province), and in Liaoning and
 Fujian; China will probably scale back its plans to have 10,000 MW of nuclear power
 operational by the year 2000.
 Natural gas production had its best year since 1980; the discovery of a massive
 offshore natural gas reserve by the US firm Arco bolstered China's interest in gas as a
 source of energy. The Chinese in 1985 signed a $500 million agreement with
 Arco--China's second-largest joint venture after Pingshuo--to develop the field off
 Hainan Island and bring the gas ashore. China expects the project to yield 3.25 billion
 cubic meters of gas per year--equal to one-fourth their current output--for about 20
 years, beginning in 1992. Beijing also plans to accelerate growth of onshore gas
 exploration and production while awaiting development of the Arco find. China
 announced recently that it will double production by 1990 at gasfields in Sichuan
 Province, the source of half of China's natural gas.

 China has also stepped up efforts to collect oil-associated gas at oilfields like
 Huabei and Liaohe and is adding to pipelines that transport the gas to eastern cities.
 China hopes to expand its use of natural gas at smaller power plants and in urban
 households for heating and cooking, to reduce coal consumption and urban pollution.

 China: Policy Response to Economic Instability
 Summary
 Economic     developments  in  1985  highlighted  the  fundamental
 problem of managing an economy that is being transformed from a
 centrally planned system to one that mixes planning and market elements.
 We believe Beijing's response to the problems, particularly the absence of
 a reflexive clamp down on reforms, provides insight into the leadership's
 approach to economic policymaking, and reform prospects in general.
 As Premier Zhao Ziyang stated in a recent interview, one of the key problems
 Beijing's reform program faces is how to maintain economic stability while reducing
 direct government control over state enterprises.  Reforms implemented in the past two
 years have significantly diminished administrative control over production, investment,
 and pricing decisions.  Enterprises now retain a much larger share of earnings--which
 they can  use for investment or worker remuneration--and are permitted to sell
 This  memorandum  was      prepared  by               Office  of  East  Asian  Analysis.

 overquota production of industrial goods at prices above state-set levels. Price controls
 have been relaxed for some products, and more retail goods are marketed outside
 government-run commercial channels.
 Although mandatory planning still plays an important role in China's economy, in
 our view, Beijing has given up an element of direct control over aggregate demand by
 allowing increased enterprise autonomy.  Reformers hope to control aggregate demand,
 and maintain economic stability, by employing indirect economic levers such as interest
 rates, credit levels, and taxes.
 We  believe  Beijing's  ability to       implement  comprehensive  economic  reform*
 depends on its success in using indirect economic levers in place of administrative
 directives. When reforms were launched in 1979, opponents warned that Beijing could
 lose control of the economy if the central planning mechanism was weakened--and
 argued that strict limits should therefore be placed on economic decentralization.
 Reforms  proceeded,  in  part,  because    Chinese  leaders  became  convinced  that
 macroeconomic levers could be used to regulate economic activity occurring outside of
 the plan.
 We believe economic developments in 1985 highlighted the fact that Beijing has
 not yet perfected a new macroeconomic control mechanism.  A surge in investment,
 wages and bonuses, and credit that began in the middle of 1984 caused industrial
 output to shoot up at a 23-percent annual rate during the first half of last year.  Efforts
 to cool the overheated economy gradually reduced the industrial growth rate, but
 inflation tripled and Chinese imports soared.  At the beginning of 1986, Beijing was still
 concerned with overly rapid growth in credit, capital construction, and wage levels.
 Party conservatives, who oppose some aspects of the pragmatic reform program,
 criticized reformers for the economic problems last year. The sharpest attack came at a
 party conference in September 1985, when Chen Yun, a Politburo Standing Committee
 member and the doyen of China's economic bureaucrats, warned that market forces
 were unreliable economic levers.  According to Chen, "market regulation involves no
 planning, blindly allowing supply and demand to determine production... planning is the
 essence of macroeconomic control."   We believe, that in a broader sense, Chen's
 argument carried the clear implication that economic reform was progressing too
 quickly and that there are limits on how far economic decentralization can go without
 threatening social disorder.  In our view, reformers themselves recognized the need to
 improve economic controls and have therefore decided that major economic reforms
 will be put on hold until after 1986.
 In one sense, the potential for economic dislocations is endemic to the reform
 process.  In the transition from a centrally planned economy to a more market-oriented
 system, Beijing must loosen some types of central controls before testing the economic
 levers slated to replace them.  In our view, enterprises have been quick to respond to

 enhanced decisionmaking authority--such as the right to sell overquota production at
 market prices--but have not been as responsive to macroeconomic levers as Beijing
 expected.  For instance, higher interest rates on  loans do  not effectively curtail
 borrowing by some enterprises that rely on the state budget for their operating
 expenses.  Other enterprises have proved adept at evading taxes or raising funds for
 capital construction outside of the banking system. To increase the responsiveness of
 enterprises to economic levers, we believe Beijing must press ahead with industrial
 reforms--but further decentralization may temporarily increase economic instability.  In
 our  view, the  conflict  between  enhancing  enterprise  autonomy  and      maintaining
 macroeconomic   control   will  impart  a  pattern of  rapid  growth  followed        by
 government-induced retrenchment to China's economic performance.
 Sources of Instability
 We believe that policy errors, a one-sided grant of enterprise autonomy, and
 strong local pressures for rapid growth contributed to economic problems last year.
 Policy Errors
 A major source of economic instability was the 50-percent increases in currency
 in circulation and loans to industrial enterprises that occurred in 1984.  In our view, the
 money supply surge was caused by errors in the implementation of new banking
 reforms.  In 1984, Beijing granted increased autonomy to local banks and urged them to
 adjust their loan policies to support economic reform.  Intense demand for funds by
 enterprises and local officials, and lax oversight and muddled accounting by the central
 bank, however, allowed credit to increase much more than Beijing intended.
 One-Sided Enterprise Autonomy
 Chinese press reports indicate that many managers have taken advantage of
 increased autonomy by excessively increasing capital construction and rapidly expanding
 wages and bonuses.   In our view, this growth in investment spending and worker
 remuneration was another source of economic problems.  Chinese reformers recognize
 that the grant of autonomy is onesided--managers have more flexibility in using
 enterprise revenues, but their decisionmaking is not yet disciplined by market forces.
 Because Beijing still subsidizes state enterprises that lose money, managers increase
 wages--or take more loans--without worrying about bankruptcy.  We believe reformers
 recognize that bankruptcy is a necessary lever for restraining autonomous enterprises,
 but experiments with bankruptcy laws have been limited: a working group was formed
 only recently to draft bankruptcy laws.  A major impediment to enforcing bankruptcy, in
 our view, is China's irrational price system, which makes it difficult to determine whether
 enterprises are losing money because of inefficiency, or because of low state-set prices.

 We believe the implementation of bankruptcy laws also will meet strong resistance from
 local officials who fear they will have to bear the-economic--and political--costs of
 workers who lose their jobs when enterprises close.
 We believe Beijing faces enormous pressure from workers, managers, and local
 officials for rapid growth.  Promotion of "10,000 yuan households" by the media in 1984
 and exhortations to get rich through hard work generated rising expectations among
 workers for an improvement in their standard of living.   Rising food prices have
 intensified worker demands for raises, while the relaxation of state controls over some
 enterprises has weakened the ability of managers to resist them.
 Given years of emphasis on meeting quantitative targets, many managers still
 believe that  they  must  prove  their competence  by  rapidly  expanding  enterprise
 production. To boost local revenues, low-level officials pressure enterprise managers to
 increase  output  and  speed  completion  of  local  construction  plans.    Although
 downplaying the extent of the problem, recent editorials have warned that, if officials set
 unreasonable output targets, enterprise managers may resort to falsifying production
 data--making it more difficult for Beijing to judge how well control measures are
 working.  We believe Chinese leaders are also worried that rapid growth of enterprises
 operated by rural towns has caused a proliferation of small, inefficient, and redundant
 firms that compete with state enterprises for funds and raw materials.
 Beijing's Response to the Economic Problems
 We believe that the political strength of the reform coalition and the increased
 economic sophistication of its leaders was evident in Beijing's reaction to the economic
 problems in 1985.  Instead of halting the reforms and quickly damping the overheated
 economy by reimposing   strict administrative controls--as they might  have in the
 past--Chinese leaders implemented a combination of market-oriented macroeconomic
 adjustments and state directives that were designed to slow the economy gradually.
 We believe Beijing's willingness to use economic levers to stabilize the economy
 was particularly significant.  China's 1985 budget, announced last April, called for a
 reduction in the rate of growth of government spending and a 10-percent cut in
 administrative expenditures.   Beijing also clamped down on credit and twice raised the
 general level of interest rates.   Administrative directives were issued that required
 enterprises to place wage funds in special accounts to be monitored by the banks, and
 that prohibited banks from extending credit for construction projects not listed in the
 state plan.
 During the year, Beijing began to recentralize some aspects of its foreign trade,
 and it ordered a halt in construction of some projects, but it did not backtrack on
 fundamental  reforms.  Despite surging consumer and investment demands, Beijing

 implemented  planned hikes  in  urban food  prices,  and  introduced--after a  lengthy
 delay--new wage  scales for teachers and government workers.  At the           national
 conference last September, the Chinese Communist Party formally made reform its
 primary economic goal for the five-year period beginning in 1986. Although Beijing
 recently announced that major economic reforms will not be implemented this year, we
 believe that some types of reforms, such as the removal of central government units
 from the direct management of enterprises, will proceed.
 Improving the Mechanisms of Macroeconomic Control
 To improve its ability to maintain economic stability with indirect economic
 levers, Beijing is increasing the powers of China's central bank and making greater use
 of taxes as regulatory tools.  We believe Beijing has given the central bank expanded
 authority to administer China's specialized banks (such as the Agricultural Bank and the
 Industrial and Commercial Bank).   For instance, the central bank's credit plan now
 includes the funds of all of the specialized banks, and the specialized banks no longer
 have overdraft rights with the central bank.   Beijing recently announced a new tax
 scheme for individual entrepreneurs, and Chinese press reports suggest that in 1986
 Beijing will increase enforcement of taxes on capital construction.  Media reports also
 suggest that Beijing will boost taxes on rural industries, in part to slow their rapid
 growth.  Beijing also is improving its ability to collect taxes from enterprises.  We
 believe these changes in the banking and taxation systems will eventually provide
 Beijing with better economic levers.
