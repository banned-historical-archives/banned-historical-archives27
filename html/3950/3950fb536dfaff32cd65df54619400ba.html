 Possible Chinese Motives for the Overtures to Gorbachev
 Summary
 Since the December 1984 visit of First Deputy
 Premier Arkhipov, Beijing has signaled its interest
 in improving relations on a broad front with
 Moscow.   Chernenko's death and the rapid rise of
 Gorbachev have prompted the most dramatic gestures
 to date.   The fact that the Chinese have made such
 gestures without a corresponding indication that
 Moscow is prepared to be flexible on China's key
 security concerns raises questions about Beijing's
 motives.   Although Beijing seems most concerned
 about improving the atmospherics of the
 relationship, the possibility now exists that China
 may moderate its demands on the security issues  and
 that progress will  be made on political  issues,
 including the formal  restoration of party-to-party
 ties.
 ILLEGIB
 This memorandum attempts to put Beijing's
 recent gestures in perspective, to examine an array
 of possible motives and to point up some of the
 potential  risks in China's relations with regional
 neighbors, the West and the United States.   We
 speculate that China's gestures may be the result of
 a combination of factors,  including pressure from
 conservative opponents who are concerned about the

 ideological correctness of Deng's economic and
 bureaucratic reforms and advocate a more normal
 relationship with Moscow.   Whether Deng can
 initially accommodate and then brake these
 pressures--as he has in the past--is a key
 uncertainty.   Moreover,  if China's gestures are the
 product of intensified internal debate rather than
 merely an effort, for example, to seek more
 maneuvering room in the triangle, then we would
 expect the months leading up to the major party
 conference in September to be characterized by
 increased wrangling on domestic and foreign issues
 as each side maneuvers for position.
 This memorandum is tentative and speculative
 because we as yet lack sufficent intelligence on
 Beijing's motives and perceived options.   We
 believe,  however, Beijing will  continuously evaluate
 and reevaluate its relations with Moscow as
 Gorbachev settles in.   These reevaluations will  be
 heavily influenced by the reactions of the United
 States and Japan in particular.   In 1982, the
 Chinese moved quickly to assure Washington and Tokyo
 that they were not embarked on a fundamental policy
 alteration.   The manner in which Beijing
 characterizes its recent gestures toward the Soviets
 to the United States and Japan should provide a
 gauge for the seriousness of the Chinese effort and
 some indications of the degree to which Washington
 can influence Beijing's course.  FI
 What's New?
 Since Chernenko's death, China has greatly improved the
 atmospherics of Sino-Soviet relations and the Soviets have been
 responsive:
 --        China's party chief, General Secretary Hu Yaobang sent
 "hearty congratulations" to his Soviet counterpart.
 -         Beijing referred to the USSR as "socialist" for the first
 time since 1967.
 National People's Congress Chairman Peng Zhen referred to
 Gorbachev as "comrade"  in extending congratulations to
 him.
 A Foreign Ministry spokesman broke precedent by
 congratulating the new Soviet leader on his party
 promotion.   But no party-to-party message was sent.

 --   Vice Premier Li Peng repeated in Moscow earlier Chinese
 statements that it "does not establish strategic
 relations with other countries"  in an apparent effort to
 portray China's expanding ties with the United States in
 a non-threatening manner.
 --   Gorbachev received a senior Chinese official  after
 Chernenko's funeral, the first such meeting with a top
 Soviet official  since the 1960s.   Chernenko did not grant
 a private meeting to a higher ranking Chinese delegate at
 Andropov's funeral  last year.
 Even before Chernenko's passing, the Chinese were sending
 strong indications of a desire for better relations with the
 USSR.    Beijing went to extraordinary lengths to insure the
 success of last December's visit to China by First Deputy Premier
 Ivan Arkhipov:
 --   The Chinese toned down and in some cases avoided
 criticism of the Soviet role in Afghanistan and
 Indochina,  long the subject of Chinese accusations of
 "hegemony."
 --   During his visit, Beijing signed a significantly expanded
 trade agreement plus new agreements on economic
 cooperation and exchanges in culture and science and
 technology.
 --   Arkhipov was received by senior Chinese officials despite
 the lack of a protocol requirement to do so.   Both side
 used party appellations to refer to the officials in
 their media accounts for the first time since the 1960s.
 --   Beijing has avoided a showy display of force against
 Vietnam during the most intense and successful dry season
 offensive yet against Chinese-supported Cambodian
 resistance forces.   Although the Chinese have quietly
 applied considerable force against Vietnam at times this
 dry season,  it appears to be avoiding the sort of
 conspicuous action that would force Moscow to react
 publicly against China in support of Vietnam.
 What are Beijing's Motives?

 judgment based on previous Chinese thinking and our understanding
 of the political  situation that the followi              in some
 combination influenced Beijing's thinking.
 We believe a desire to get off to a positive start with the
 new Gorbachev administration is one factor.   The Chinese appear
 to be under no illusions about the prospects for a sudden change
 in the Soviet security posture toward China.   After all, they
 have firsthand experience with the problems of an aging politburo
 and ossified bureaucracy.
 But we believe the Chinese see the chance of flexibility
 under Gorbachev as worth the risks of its recent gestures.
 Chinese-controlled Hong Kong media are portraying Gorbachev as
 someone open to new ideas and better relations,  and they claim to
 see in his speeches something of their own reformist character.
 They may believe their moves could provide Gorbachev ammunition
 to bring his ,politburo colleagues along in improving relations at
 In any case, the Chinese have always placed unusual  emphasis
 on the opportunities presented by leadership transitions--despite
 their ideological  stress on the importance of systems over
 some point.
 individuals.   When Khrushchev fell during an intense phase of
 Sino-Soviet polemics, for example, Premier Zhou Enlai  travelled
 to Moscow to explore for new opportunities to ease the split.
 Just as important in Chinese thinking, we believe,  is
 Beijing's perception of an opportunity to strengthen itself vis-
 a-vis Washington and Moscow in the "strategic triangle."                     China
 is sensitive about its dependence on the United States as a
 strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union and recognizes it is
 the weakest of the three parties.   A more normal relationship
 with Moscow improves its leverage in both capitals.   We believe
 China's treatment of Arkhipov was aimed at spurring Washington to
 be more forthcoming on technology transfer and to remind the
 United States not to take Beijin  for granted as bilateral
 security cooperation expands.
 The more assertive United States posture toward the Soviet
 Union in recent years has,  in Beijing's view, blunted Soviet
 expansionism, and their own expanding political and military ties
 with the United States may have given Beijing confidence that it
 can approach the Soviets from a position of relative strength.
 Beijing may also calculate that Moscow may feel  pressed enough
 around the world to be willing to discuss some of China's
 security concerns.

 Public overtures to Moscow also serve wider foreign policy
 concerns.   China stresses that it has an "independent foreign
 policy,"  and is sensitive to past criticism in the third world
 that it is in fact allied with the United States.   We believe
 Beijing sees such actions as the Arkhipov visit as increasing its
 credibility as an independent power and as enhancing its ability
 to compete with Moscow in the third world.  F__1
 The beginning of strategic arms discussions in Geneva and
 the possibility of measureable improvement in US-Soviet relations
 may also be a factor in Beijing's thinking. The Chinese have
 long feared the United States and USSR might reach agreements
 that would ignore or harm Chinese interests
 In the past, the Chinese
 have voiced their concern    a   an agreement on SS-20s might
 permit the Soviets to shift additional missiles to east of the
 Urals.   More recently, the Strategic Defense Initiative has
 raised fears that the United States and USSR may terminate the
 ABM treaty and thus permit Moscow to expand its strategic
 defenses.   In Beijing's view, this could neutralize its limited
 nuclear deterrent against the Soviets.
 We believe Beijing may also be concerned that the Gorbachev
 succession will  lead to improved US-Soviet relations independent
 of progress on arms talks.   The Chinese may be concerned that
 their position in the triangle will deteriorate si     icantly
 unless their relations with Moscow also improve.  7i~
 As logical as these factors are, we believe they do not
 fully explain the Chinese overture.   We speculate that Deng
 Xiaoping, who maintains tight control over Chinese foreign
 policy, may be playing to a domestic audience as well  as an
 international one.   We have no direct evidence that the Gorbachev
 overtures are a response to domestic politics, but a
 circumstantial  case can be made.
 Deng is actively pushing forward a sweeping economic reform
 program that threatens a wide-range of vested interests in the
 party and government.   Deng has made clear that these reforms,
 which require close ties to the West,  are his number one
 priority.   The program has caused considerable concern,  not only
 about the open door to the West and the social costs of the
 program,  but about its ideological  correctness as well.
 Our reading of the Chinese media
 leads us to conclude that these concerns may have
 grown in recent months.   The Deng controlled media have devoted
 considerable attention to justifying the ideological  correctness
 of the reforms,  and the reformers have recently launched a

 We believe that most Chinese leaders are satisfied with
 Deng's program, but there are a number of senior figures who are
 disturbed by aspects of it.   Politburo members Chen Yun and Peng
 Zhen are most often identified by Chinese as the leading
 advocates of a more cautious approach to reform,  including
 greater reliance on Soviet-style planning and a more limited role
 for Western investment.   They do not seem to have as broad a
 network of supporters in the party and government as Deng but we
 believe they may be spokesmen for all who have some complaint
 about the program.   In any case, they are powerful men whose
 We believe Deng is approaching another one of these
 junctures.   A major party meeting is planned for September at
 which we believe Deng will  attempt to strengthen the reform
 group, weaken his critics--including Chen and Peng--and nail  down
 the final  planks of his reform program.   We believe the
 preliminary meetings for the September conclave are underway,  and
 if past practice is a guide, Deng will   have to compromise in some
 areas to build the leadership consensus he need to achieve his
 primary goals.
 China's relations with the United States and the Soviet Union.
 We speculate that although Deng remains one of the strongest
 critics of the Soviet Union in the leadership,  he may have
 authorized the gestures to Gorbachev as a way to mollify those in
 the leadership like Chen and Peng who have raised doubts about
 the program and have voiced concern about a lack of balance in
 We also speculate that Deng may see another advantage in
 making an overture to Moscow at this time.   If the Soviets do not
 respond, Peng and Chen are undercut,  leaving Deng in a stronger
 position to push forward both his domestic and foreign
 policies.   The clear risks in this course for Deng may be reduced
 by his control over the foreign policy bureaucracy.   Presumably
 Deng will  attempt to retain control over determining what
 constitutes an adequate reponse.   F__]
 The Costs to Beijing.
 A gesture to the Soviets here or there could be relatively
 cost free,  but the concerted Chinese effort of the past few
 months,  culminating in the recent spate of signals to Gorbachev,
 could exact a price internationally, if viewed in their most

 negative light.   China's delayed and mild criticism of the Soviet
 role in Afghanistan and Indochina has already produced strains in
 relations with Pakistan and the ASEAN states.
 In the case of Southeast Asia,  the Gorbachev overtures will
 raise further doubts in ASEAN about China's commitment to the
 Cambodian resistance and to Thailand's defense against Vietnam.
 This may strengthen the position of those in the Thai  government
 who are suspicious of Chinese motives or favor a more flexible
 policy toward Vietnam.   For the moment, China continues to supply
 the Khmer resistence and has offered to give military hardware to
 Thailand.   If China continues to play down its role as a regional
 counterweight against Hanoi,  however, by avoiding showy military
 action on the China-Vietnam border, Bangkok could become more
 inclined to accept a political solution in Cambodia on terms
 favorable to Hanoi.
 In attempting to build leverage in Washington, Beijing runs
 the risk of undercutting its efforts to obtain US technology,
 weapons,  and investment.   By stressing China's lack of strategic
 relations with the United States, Beijing could also find itself
 cut off from consultations involving Vietnam, Pakistan,  or other
 areas where common strategic interests have been identified in
 the past.
 The Chinese leadership will  also have to calculate that
 Taiwan's voice in the United States will  be greatly enhanced if
 Beijing continues movement toward Moscow.   New strains in this
 area could quickly undermine the perception of stronger US-China
 relations that Beijing is capitalizing on in its gestures to the
 Sovi ets.
 Further moves toward the Soviets could have an impact in
 Japan, where management of the Soviet threat has long depended in
 part on an independent and preferably pro-West China tying down
 Soviet forces.   If China permits the perception of improving
 relations with the USSR to grow,  it will  stimulate Japanese
 anxiety about a possible increase in the threat from the Soviet
 Union.   This would be likely to provoke requests for reassurances
 regarding the strength of the US security guarantee and could
 prompt realignments in Japanese domestic politics that would
 permit a more rapid military buildup.   Viewed from the
 perspective of China's experience in World War II, they would be
 seen as pressures for a resurgence of Japanese militarism.
 If our speculation about the role of  internal  politics is
 correct, Deng also could face major problems if the Soviets
 respond with a serious offer to accommodate one of China's
 security concerns, such as visibly reducing support for Vietnam

 or altering its forces on the Sino-Soviet border.   Such a move
 could easily spark sharp debate in the leadership.   Forging a
 consensus on how to respond in such a case without further
 damaging relations with Washington and equities in Southeast Asia
 would be very difficult.
 What Next?
 The current swing in the Chinese pendulum merits careful
 observation,  particularly because the secrecy of the Chinese
 system and the relatively short track record of the reformers
 provide few reliable indicators of their intentions.   We believe
 the essence of China's strategic view remains unchanged.   As
 Beijing assesses the world and its position,  it:
 --   Continues to believe the only serious external  threat to
 China comes from the Soviet Union.
 --   Remains committed to economic modernization, which means
 it requires trade, technology,  and investment from the
 West,  and particularly the United States.   The USSR
 cannot do this for China.
 --   Needs a US counterweight;  a preoccuopied Soviet Union is
 less threatening to China.
 --   Recognizes  its armed forces cannot modernize fast enough
 to keep pace with Soviet force improvements and need a
 military tie with the US.
 From the Soviet perspective as well, there are factors that
 place real  limits on how far and how fast the relationship can
 progress:
 --   China and the Soviet Union might eventually develop party
 relations patterned on the Yugoslav model,  but the Soviet
 demands on members of its "socialist" community would be
 very hard for China to accept.
 --   The Soviets give no sign of a willingness to improve
 their relations with China at the expense of their ties
 with Afghanistan, Vietnam,  or Mongolia.
 --   Moscow's calculations of its Asian military requirements
 are complicated by measures by the United States  and its
 allies to strengthen their posture in East Asia and the
 Western Pacific.
 We believe Deng recognizes the potential  costs to China,  and
 he may calculate that he can manage them through private
 assurances and continued close ties with Washington and the West
 in general.   In a sense, the Chinese have been playing this game
 since 1979 when they started talks with Moscow,   and since they
 began to speak in terms of "an independent foreign policy"  in

 reassure United States officials that little had changed aft.er
 Beijing opened political  talks with Moscow.
 By going as far as it has,  however, Beijing may be
 overplaying its hand and underestimating the potential
 reaction.  The greetings to Gorbachev raise questions about what,
 if any,  limits the "three obstacles"  (Soviet troops on China's
 border,  aid to Vietnam,  and presence in Afghanistan) place on
 Sino -Soviet relations.
 Deng's need to get his political        reform proposals through
 important party meetings this summer and fall may cause the
 reformers to continue to finesse the question of improving
 relations with Moscow and delay a serious reexamination of the
 present course.   An increasing requirement to play to an anti-
 Western,  anti-US gallery could keep the option of a balancing
 relationship with the Soviet Union very much alive.
 We believe the next few weeks will  provide some important
 clues for determining just how far Beijing is willing to go.   We
 expect China will want to offer some explanation of its actions
 to foreigners in general  and the United States officials in
 particular.   The level  at which these assurances are offered, as
 well  as their content and tone will  be significant.   The next
 round of Sino-Soviet talks is scheduled for April,  and China's
 public treatment of these discussions as well  as how they are
 portrayed to us privately should also provide important clues.
 Finally,  propaganda treatment of the three obstacles may provide
 some indication of whether Deng and company intend to use a lack
 of progress on security issues with Moscow to provide a brake on
 the relationship.
