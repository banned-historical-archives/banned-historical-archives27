 There is at l
 t
 f
 eas
 one
 armer we know who
 hasn't overlooked the political repercussions
 stemming from wheat sales to the Soviets.
 Such repercussions occurred amazingly right
 on his farm on Tuesday, October 1, 1963.
 That was the day that bread rationing was
 begun In Moscow. It was the day that Khru-
 shchev made a speech, and it was the day our
 farmer acquaintance decided to sell his soy-
 beans (not wheat),  How all these things
 got linked together in a way that made our
 friend fighting mad is something every Amer-
 ican farmer should think about.
 First of all, the farmer called his local
 elevator and asked what it was paying for
 beans. The answer was $2.48 a bushel.  The
 farmer said, "I'll be right in with a load,
 and pay my bill, too."
 In Moscow, U.S.S.R., about that time, Pre-
 mier Khrushchev told his people: "If we use
 bread economically, the resources we have
 will be sufficient for the normal supply of
 the population."  This word, passed along
 like lightning to American grain traders,
 meant to them that U.S. wheat might not
 be needed at all.  It scared them so much, in
 fact, that those contacted by our friend's
 country elevator withdrew all their bids on
 soybeans. By the time our friend got to his
 elevator, asked for instructions to dump, his
 elevator wasn't buying any beans at any
 price.  Not one bushel could he sell them.
 From the time he left his farm to the time
 he got to town, his market had evaporated.
 "Why?" he demanded.
 "Khrushchev says he doesn't want our
 wheat," was the reply.
 And so, logically or Illogically, depending
 on how you view it, the supersenaitive soy-
 bean market momentarily went all to pieces.
 Our friend trucked his beans home, where
 he waited for the market to recover.  He
 still wants to sell beans but is not one bit
 inclined to sell wheat to the Communists.
 "It's not that simple," he says. "If we sell
 them wheat in a regular manner, it would be
 all right.  But every time we do something
 with those Communists, they make monkeys
 out of us.  They made a monkey out of me
 on Tuesday. They're making monkeys out of
 our Government people right now.  And the
 next thing you know, we won't be giving
 them permission to buy our grain. No, air.
 we will be begging them to buy it. And then
 they will make it look as if they did us a big
 favor if they take it.
 "Khrushchev planned the whole thing. He
 knew after four crop failures, he couldn't
 stand a fifth without buying free world
 grain. He did us the favor of signing a test
 ban treaty to soften us up.  He dangled a
 wheat dollar In front of us and bo  ht what

 WILL OxrOaD LASE ITS FACULTIES?
 (By Arthur Hoppe)
 OXFORD, ENGLAND.-The Labor Party, which
 is favored to win next year's elections, Is
 vaguely thinking about abolishing Oxford
 and Cambridge as the peculiarly British
 institutions they are and making them into
 "more  normal universities."  Like "Oxford
 Normal" and "Cambridge Normal," I sup-
 pose-
 So naturally I hustled up here to see what
 was going to be abolished.    And after a
 day's tour my sympathies lie with the Labor
 Party.  Or at least with the Labor Party
 official who might have to come up here to
 abolish the place.  I can see him  now, a
 plain-talking Yorkshireman probably, as he
 marches Into the offices, say, of the president
 of Magdalen College.
 Official: "Nice college you've got here, sir.
 Bit of a shame to see old Magdalen go."
 President:  "We  pronounce It  'Mawdlin,'
 old boy.  And the demies will be sorry to bear
 of your plans.  We've got about 50 now, you
 know.  All topnotch scholars."
 Official: "All studying bard in their class-

 started. eh?"
 President:  "'Mikklemusa '  And we don't

 students either."
 Official:  "Odd bit, that.  Well, if you'll
 kindly call the presidents of the colleges
 together-"
 President: "You mean the 21 old colleges,
 probably; sorry, but only 4 have presidents.
 Two are run by masters, two by rectors, three
 by provosts, four by principals, one by a dean
 and five by wardens, Including Wadham (pro-
 nounced 'Waddum')  which to run by  the

 not include the three new foundations, five

 WE AMEEICANs ARE UNQUESTIONABLE
 (By Arthur Hoppe)
 WILTON PARK, ENGLAND.-It's high time I
 got back to telling you what an international
 conference Is like.                       And you'd like It.  It's a
 lovely life.
 We have breakfast at 8:30; read the news-
 papers; have tea; attend a 2-hour morning
 session; eat lunch; chat, stroll, or play ten-
 nis; have tea; attend a 2-hour afternoon
 session; eat dinner; attend a 2-hour evening
 session; and chat and drink until 11.  It's
 not only pleasant, but stimulating. Because
 if you've never attended an international
 conference before, you've got a lot to learn.
 Like how to ask questions.
 Nothing's more important.  You see, they
 send these truly brilliant experts down from
 London for each session-ministers, scien-
 tists, economists, and the like.  The expert
 opens the session with an hour-long extem-
 poraneous address.  And then the warden of
 Wilton Park, Dr. H. Koeppler, who is kind of
 our den mother, invites us to ask the expert
 questions.  And while our warden is not
 only a highly Intelligent but very kindly
 man, he dearly loves us to ask questions.  Or
 else.
 Unfortunately, when his eye lights sternly
 on me, the only question I can think of put-
 ting to the expert might be phrased: "What,
 Lord Curmudgeon, In hell were you talking
 about?"
 This would be very bad form.  It's not so
 much the question.  It's the way I put it.
 The proper method is to begin by telling the
 expert what you think. Or, more accurately,
 what a lot of other people think.  Like:
 "There is a considerable body of opinion in
 East Peoria, Sir Jocelyn, as confirmed by 16
 Gallup polls, a WCTU survey, and the entrails
 of a love-sick sheep, that ? ?  ?"   And so
 forth. And If you go on for at least 10 min-
 utes, you can then ask him what the hell he
 was talking about.  Because nobody will be
 listening.  Including the expert.  Who will
 use his turn at the microphone, anyway, to
 make  a point he forgot  to  make in his
 speech.  Such as the Increased egg produc-
 tion in western Oxfordshire.
 Of course, how you ask your 10-minute
 question depends on your nationality.  If
 you are Spanish, you must Include a defense
 of Spain's economic development.  The Por-
 tuguese are different.  They must include a
 defense of Portugal's colonial policy.
 The Italians just get emotional and never,
 ever mention statistics. The French are pre-
 cisely the same except they're very belliger-
 ent about it.  The Germans, on the other
 hand, must do nothing but cite figures in
 their 10-minute questions.  Which invariably
 take 20 minutes to ask, due to the length of
 German verbs and the requirement that any
 public statement in German must be sop-
 orific.  As for the British, they don't care
 what they say as long as they phrase it
 properly.
 That leaves us Americans.  Well, we just
 kind of bumble along, asking brief questions
 out of naive curiosity and usually uninten-

 of yellow tinge.  In my office. I heard about
 others who had the same symptoms.  I called
 ,the county health department.  We've got
 an epidemic of yellow jaundice on our hands.
 I told them,  AID the local doctors had been
 phoning to tell them the same thing.  So
 they called idle State health officials, who, I
 gather, caIIed you"
 She drew out a map she had made of the
 town.  At the site of each house where there
 was a patient sick with hepatitis she had
 made a cross with a red pencil.
 To Dr. Mosely, this was a first clue.  On
 the eastern side of town, the crosses were
 thick; there were only scattered crosses else-
 where.  This meant the disease was cen-
 tered in one part of town.  It was unlikely,
 he felt, that the source of the epidemic was
 something the whole town was eating or
 drinking.
 Two weeks later, Dr. Mosely studied a
 larger, more complex version of the map
 the school nurse had given him.  The red
 crosses at the site of each hepatitis case
 had been changed to black pins, and there
 were 129 of them stuck in the map-mostly
 still on the east side of town.  But there
 were some pins scattered In the west and
 even outside of town.   -
 During the preceding 2 weeks. Dr. Mosely
 had been to see everyone In town who was
 in any way associated with the epidemic-
 doctors, patients, nurses, the superintendent
 of schools. He bad gathered all the informa-
 tion he needed.
 "The fact that there have been no new
 cases reported for 3 whole days settles one
 thing in my mind," Dr. Mosely reported.
 "The sick people got hepatitis from a com-
 mon source-from one  thing or place-
 probably not from each other."  When an
 epidemic of hepatitis is spread from person
 to person, through close contact, the epi-
 demic lasts about 6 months. That's because
 the disease has an incubation period of about
 a month.  In other words It takes a month
 for a person to get sick after he's been ex-
 posed.  So the disease is spread out over a
 longer period than when everyone Is exposed
 to the germs simultaneously.
 In addition to the time factor, there were
 other clues.  There was the age factor:
 the disease bad chosen as its victims mostly
 high-school youngsters and young adults.
 When germs are spread from person to per-
 son, most of the victims are young children
 who catch things easily.  And there was
 also the geographic factor: the people who
 were sick outside of town were all children
 who came there to school and grownups who
 came to work. But most cases were actually
 in tpwn and on the east side, as the nurse's
 map told the doctor his first day on the job.
 All clues, therefore, pointed to the epi-
 demic coming from one source. To find that
 source, however, was a complicated problem.
 The water supply had been considered at
 first. But the town had only one large reser-
 voir for drinking water. When it was tested,
 it showed no trace of contamination. What's
 more, if the reservoir water had caused the
 epidemic, it would have been more scattered.
 As for food, there had been no common place
 where all the sick people had eaten.  Most
 people ate at home, not in restaurants.
 Milk and canned foods were also investigated.
 But the sick people drank milk from all
 three dairies in town, not just one.  And
 they had eaten no one canned or bottled
 food.
 The source of the epidemic, Dr. Mosely
 concluded, had to be a common gathering,
 such as the district wrestling meet which
 attracted the right age group, or the monthly
 basketball games. But not enough sick peo-
 ple had attended any of these functions.
 It suddenly occurred to Dr. Mosely that the
 sick people were at the age for going to the
 movies-and there was just one movie house
 in town.
 At this point, things began to move fast.
 Dr.  Mosely  called  the sanitary engineer
 who was responsible for the local water sys-
 tem. The engineer and his assistant accom-
 panied the doctor to the theater.  When
 Dr. Mosely sighted a water fountain, he
 asked the manager where the plumbing for
 It was.  If there was a crass connection, a
 place where the fresh water and sewage pipes
 crossed, they might really be on their way
 to finding whatdunit.  There was.
 Back In the office, Dr. Mosely asked the
 district engineer for an approved map of the
 sanitary and water supply systems.   He
 studied It a few minutes, then let out a low
 whistle.
 He had considered the water supply as a
 possible epidemic source at the very begin-
 ning, but dropped the idea when he learned
 the whole town drank from one reservoir
 and most of the sickness was on one side of
 town.  Now he saw that in the hills above
 the town were two springs he had never
 heard of. and from these springs ran a fresh
 water supply pipe no one had told him
 about-right Into the east side of town where
 the epidemic centered and where the movie
 theater was.
 Up above and parallel to the town was a
 pretty little stream near an underground
 spring which fed the pipeline to town. The
 municipal water system was privately owned
 and the previous summer the owner had
 gotten complaints from his customers on
 the other side of the hill that they didn't
 have enough water pressure In their faucets.
 So he simply ran a pipe from the little
 stream Into the main pipeline.  If a surface
 stream is used for water supply, it should be
 chlorinated.  But no one had been up to
 check on the spring for 5 years; it was no
 wonder that the spring house, which should
 have been watertight, was broken down and
 leaking.
 What's more, the man who owned the
 water system also owned a summer cabin
 right below another spring which was sup-
 posed to  be  cut off and opened only in
 emergencies such as fire.  But he needed
 more water for his cabin. So he had opened
 the cutoff.
 The water from this spring, then, was also
 running into the main pipeline.  And up
 the dirt road were houses which emptied
 their septic or sewage tanks right across an
 open field Into the spring.  In January a
 man who lived In one of those houses had
 come down sick with hepatitis.  A girl who
 lived in another house had gotten It in Feb-
 ruary.  So their sickness had spread through
 the spring, through the wrongly opened cut-
 off, to the whole eastern side of town.
 An a result of this revelation, the pipeline
 was overhauled and brought up to proper
 health standards, and the source of the dis-
 ease eliminated.
 These are many other dramatic instances
 of the quick work done by the Center's dis-
 ease detectives.
 A team from the Communicable Disease
 Center and Baylor University, for example,
 rushed off to British Guiana shortly before
 Christmas last year to fight a polio epi-
 demic.  By setting up mass immunization
 clinics and assisting in essential vaccine ad-
 ministration, the group scored a double suc-
 cess. Not only did they stamp out the
 epidemic, but they also did much to counter
 anti-American   propaganda   In   British
 Guiana.
 And a year ago last summer. CDC's in-
 vestigators went to. St. Petersburg, Fla., to
 aid the local and State health authorities
 In controlling an epidemic of encephalitis
 in the Tampa Bay area.  Scientists suspected
 a mosquito known as Culex nigripalpus,
 which was common in this area.  After ex-
 haustive tests, It was found that this mos-
 quito was indeed carrying the virus of St.
 Louis encephalitis.   This made possible a
 mosquito control program, specifically di-
 rocted toward the control of this particular
 species and eradication of the disease.
 Again, a mysterious ailment struck down
 43 young school children in a small southern
 town. Psittacosis was suspected because the
 children's classrooms each contained a pair
 of parakeets.  But the blood samples which
 were taken during the investigation by a
 team of Communicable Disease Center in-
 vestigators, proved the disease to be histo-
 plasmosis, a lung fungus disease which re-
 semble tuberculosis, and which is transmit-
 ted by pores which form in dust. Here, too,
 tracking down the cause of disease was the
 essential first step to its treatment and cure.
 The Communicable Disease Center is an
 arm of the Public Health Service, which is
 a vast enterprise geared to keep disease from
 happening and from spreading if it does
 appear.  Its workers strive to keep as many
 people as possible in as good health as pos-
 sible, for as long as possible.
 Through such agencies as the Communica-
 ble Disease Center, and its fast-moving, fast-
 thinking  detectives,  the  Public  Health
 Service Is able to offer services that individ-
 ual doctors cannot. Contagious diseases can
 spread like brush fires unless there are skilled
 people on guard to find them, then stamp
 them out. Your medical FBI is your fam-
 ily's partner in  a vast  health enterprise
 whose mission Is simply stated-to advance

 HON. KATHARINE ST. GEORGE
 or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, November 7, 1963
 Mrs. ST. GEORGE. Mr. Speaker, the
 following article, appearing In the last
 issue of the National Review, is written
 by our former colleague, Clare Boothe
 Luce.                          .
 The article on Madam Nhu is one of
 the most interesting pieces on the lady
 to appear in our press.  Mrs. Luce has
 done considerable research into the ques-
 tions she discusses.  She has courage
 enough to state her views and she has
 Intelligence enough to back them up
 with reason and logic. She also unveils
 some of our own hypocrisy and the bet-
 ter-than-thou attitude of some in high
 places:
 THE LADY Is FOR BURNING: THE SEVEN DEADLY
 SnV8 or MADAM NHU
 (By Clare Boothe Luce)
 Madam Ngo Dinh Nhu, the First Lady of
 Vietnam, who recently left our shores,  is
 beautiful, dynamic, courageous, intelligent.
 And even her worst enemies do not doubt
 her piety or virtue.  A militant Catholic,
 mother of four, she is a devoted and fiercely
 loyal (if not subservient) wife.  But what
 makes Madam Nhu important Is the great
 political power she wields in her country.
 For a moment, however brief, In history,
 some part of America's prestige if not-secu-
 rity, seems to lie In the pale pink palm of
 her exquisite little hand.-
 South Vietnam, although an underpopu-
 lated country (14 million), is the latest spot
 in America's 17-year-old struggle to contain
 communism.  The United States is spending
 better than a million dollars a day there to
 help the Vietnamese fight a guerrilla war.

 booted out?  For there can be little doubt
 that the big boot will have to be used, since
 MM-dam Nhu, among other things, is a fight-
 lug lady.
 Not long ago Madam Nhu said that Amer-
 icans are "Ivanhoes" who are perpetually In
 love with the underdog, but confused about
 who the underdog really is.  She thinks the
 underdogs that the U.S. press corps In Viet-
 nam and the State Department are sobbing
 over are the Vietcong Communist provoca-
 teurs who have inflamed some Buddhist
 opinion.  Madam Nhu believes she herself
 is the real underdog in the situation.  Cer-
 tainly the china doll-sized stateswoman from
 South Vietnam has been taking enough
 punishment from the American press to
 smash her Into a tiny heap of porcelain
 scraps.  Fortunately for her, and possibly
 for her country, Madam Nhu is not a china
 doll. Backhanded by the State Department,
 bullied and scratched at by reporters, lec-
 tured at by her  own lecture audiences.
 Madam Nhu travels along singing her song.
 Chin up, eyes flashing, long delicate hands
 gesticulating gracefully and forcefully, she
 is still pretty solid on her 3-inch heels.
 The charge that Madam Nhu, her hus-
 band, her brothers-in-law President Ngo
 Dinh Diem and Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc.
 have "persecuted" South Vietnamese Bud-
 dhists Is certainly the toughest charge she
 has bad to meet. But meet it she did.  And
 meet it she must, for her fellow Catholic
 President Kennedy does not Intend to face
 into the 1864 election campaign defending
 himself against accusations from the liberal
 left that he has supported a government
 just because it is Catholic.  He can better
 afford to lose Vietnam than to have that
 calumny tied to him.
 THE CHARGE of FEV0CUTIuNN
 The fact L that the charge of religious
 persecution against the family is pretty
 'recent.   And i Indeed they are persecuting
 BuddFste this will mark the first time in
 democratic history that a small religious
 minority has successfully persecuted an over-
 whelming religious majority in a democracy.
 South      V4ie-team  Catholics  number  1.5
 million of the 14 million population.  There
 are approximately 5.25 million Buddhists
 and the remainder of the population Is made
 up of Taoists, Confucianists, and members
 of other sects.  Leas than one-third of the
 Cabinet members are Catholics; only 3 of
 the 19 generals,  But Catholics are about
 half of the civil service and the Assembly.
 The season for this, given and accepted until
 a few months ago by Iii foreign observers
 in Vietnam, is that the Catholics under the
 French built an extensive parochial school
 system.  over the years this system has
 turned out relatively well-educated graduates
 with a lively interest in Western democratic
 government.  The Buddhists have not been
 able to compete with these educated Catholic
 Vietnamese In civil service examinations.
 Until last May, there was no evidence of
 great discontent with the Diem government
 by the Buddhist population.  On the con-
 trary, thanks to the annual 8350 million
 economic and military aid, and with the
 help of 14,000 U.S. military "advisers," vic-
 tory, last spring, seemed near for the Diem
 government, and the people seemed to know
 it.
 . Then, in the space of 5 months  the
 flaming ' deaths of six Buddhist bonzes. or
 priests, led to a aeries of public demonstra-
 tions which brought about the present polit-
 ical crisis in "which Madam Nhu herself Is
 also being badly burned.
 fOSCED TO "LOSE FACE" _
 now did these deaths come about?  Were
 the Buddhist priests dragged by force from
 their homes or temples by Catholics and put
 to the torch-as In the not so distant past
 in America. Negroes were torn from their
 home, or jails, and lynched or burned-by
 white Americans?  Were the bonzes butch-
 Bred as were thousands of Mao Tse-tung's
 recalcitrant Chinese farmers?  Were they
 tortured, beaten, brainwashed, shot, liqui-
 dated as millions of Russians, Poles. Hun-
 garians were by Stalin and Khrushchev?
 They were not.  The saffron-robed monks
 were living unmolested by anyone in their
 own pagodas, when one by one they stole
 forth  Into  public  squares,  where  they
 squatted In lotus pose. poured gasoline over
 themselves, applied the match. and com-
 mitted suicide.
 In America, If a Catholic priest were to
 burn himself to death In protest to the Gov-
 ernment's failure to provide free bus rides
 for parochial schoolchildren, or if a Prot-
 estant minister were to make of himself
 a living torch to express his opposition to
 the Supreme Court decision against prayer
 in public schools, we would consider them
 religious  maniacs.  And  our  Government
 would take stringent measures to prevent
 any repttion of such acts.  This is precisely
 the view Madam Nhu has taken of the self-
 immolating bonzes.  They are slaves, she
 said, "it not to others, at least to their own
 folly."  And the government of President
 Diem has used the police force to prevent
 further emulations of such follies.  What,
 then, was the particular gtlevance which led
 these Buddhists to encompass: their own cre-
 mation?
 Last May, the Buddhists of Hue were for-
 bidden to unfurl their flags. In honor of
 Buddha's 2507th birthday, above the flag of
 Vietnam.  As in America. no flag in Vietnam
 may fly above the national flag.   (In this
 land of many religions. separation of church
 and state Is. of necessity, the law of the
 nation.)  Refusal by Diem's government to
 permit the Buddhists to fly their flag above
 the national flag caused the leaders of the
 Bud pagoda to lose face.
 In America. self-immolation is not thought
 to be a useful or particularly democratic
 way to protest grievances or discrimination.
 However,  an  Insult which  might  barely
 cause one American to punch another, could,
 say In Japan. lead to bars-kirl.  A Japanese
 who loses face disembowels himself with a
 ritual sword. ofted aided by a friend or
 a relative. In India, for hundreds of years.
 widows threw themselves onto the funeral
 pyres of their husbands; if they did not, they
 lost face.  Although suttee has been out-
 lawed for a century In India, In backward
 villages it is still occasionally practiced.
 HUMANA ATTUNED
 The Buddhist monks in Vietnam who in-
 cinerated                                                                    themselves  not  only  regained
 "face" f.:z the temple, but Nirvana or Para-
 dise and sainthood for themselves.  For at
 .at three of the monks who were over age
 70, this must have seemed a rather good
 deal.
 (Probably no American c"n understand
 the Asiatic concept of "face."  This is per-
 haps forunate. In view of how much "face"
 the United States has lost in the Orient, we
 would have to burn Washington to recover
 it.)
 In our country. protestors sign petitions,
 picket, hire halls or rabblerouse.  Recently
 our Negroes (a minority)            have taken to
 sit-ins,  sit-downs,  mass          denwnstratlons,
 handcuffing themselves together, until the
 police break them up.
 While we are on the subject of discrimina-
 tton, it may help us to think a little more
 charitably about President Diem's and Mad-
 am Nhu's alleged persecution of the Bud-
 dhista, if we remember that despite 4 years
 of mass Negro demonstrations in America,
 the President still has not found it con-
 venient to appoint a Negro to his Cabinet,
 to help elect a Negro Senator, or Governor,
 .or even a big city mayor.  And yet Negroes
 represent 20 percent of our population, and
 time and again their vote decides presiden-
 tial elections.
 in America. It depends on wthat you can
 get away with. But not so in Vietnam. Not,
 anyway, on our money.  In Vietnam you
 have to be perfect.
 Consequent to the Buddhist sacrifice s,
 there have been. since May, a half-don n
 demonstrations of Buddhists in the streets.
 In the attempt to keep order, the Vietnam
 police have encountered the same difficulties
 our police have encountered with unruly
 crowds of demonstrators in Alabama, Chi-
 cago. New York's Harlem, New Jersey.  And
 In Vietnam as in America. some people got
 hurt.  A  bomb  thrown by  an unknown
 provocateur killed several people in Vietnam.
 U.S. Embassy officers expressed themselves as
 being "shocked and disgusted" at this occur-
 rence and at the police suppression of the
 Buddhist demonstrators.
 The State Department no doubt failed to
 inform our Embassy In Saigon that similar
 episodes were happening in Alabama, where
 four children were killed in a church bomb-
 tag, and In the wake, two boys were killed by
 police.  Nor did they send out over the Voice
 of America to Vietnam a very clear account
 of riots and police methods used to quell
 Negro-white rioters In other parts of the
 country.
 And speaking of corruption in Vietnam,
 what about the Casa Nostra operation in
 America?  An, well, In America, democracy
 isn't perfect.  But in Vietnam It had better
 be-on our money.
 The last charge against Mme. Nhu and the
 Diem government is that their failure to be
 an  Ideal  democracy which their American
 critics carry about In their heads-will now
 make it Impossible to win the war against the
 Vietcong Communists.
 Is this true, or Is it false?  Viata,atn has
 been at war for almost a decade. The South
 Vietnam population is suffering 5,000 casual-
 ties a year. Women and men, many of them
 Buddhists, have gone forth day after day,
 year after year, to meet and repulse their
 Communist enemies.   A few months  ago
 victory was In eight. If the United States
 gives firm support to Diem now, the crisis
 will pass and the war may still be won. If the
 .U.S. support Is withdrawn on the grounds
 that the United States can no longer sup-
 port the Diem government because 6 men-
 or 16-insist on making human torches of
 themselves, then South Vietnam will fall
 and the political vacuum left by the Ngo
 Dinh family will soon be filled by the "Yu-
 No-Hu" family: the Chinese Communists.
 is the history of the liberal press in :,hung-
 king and Havana going to repeat Itself? The
 evidence is that It Is.
 The Christian Science Monitor wrote last
 week: "The confusion (in American public
 opinion) stems from the fact that the United
 States does not wish to say, in so many words,
 that it Is working for a revolution in South
 Vietnam.  But so long as the Ngo Dinh
 family remains unbending, that Is the fact"
 if Indeed, that is the fact, the adminis-
 tration will no doubt begin to boast along
 .about 1965 that It has- relieved tensions in
 Vietnam by negotiating peace with Ho Chi-
 minh, the Communist leader of that coun-
 try.  And no doubt wheat and arms will
 then soon  be  sent to him, to strengthen
 "the Vietnamese Tito" against Red China.
 Poor Madam Nhu.  The lady is sure for
 burning.

 ,4 .Whereas there are. others to follow with
 the details on how contracts are let and how
 payments for research are made, let us briefly
 consider, the subject in broad terms.
 Ours is a capitalistic society, and we feel
 very strongly that the capitalistic system is
 -responsible for our unquestioned strength.
 ? The profit motive must continue to operate,
 as it has so well in the past, to provide the
 incentive and the reward to those whose
 genius and labor contribute to the common
 good.
 We are spending more and more money for
 research every day, but the rules are chang-
 ing.                   The systems that are used to contract
 for research, or to repay research costs on
 independently produced items, are constantly
 being modified to meet new conditions, to
 improve them and to make them more re-
 sponsive to the needs and demands of the
 situation.
 The whole fabric of our society, the most
 successful yet devised by man we believe, is
 woven, of the warp of individual and col-
 lective integrity and the woof of conflicting
 interests justly compromised-of checks, and
 balances, and safeguards.
 .:Whereas the Communist theory is, "from
 each according to his abilities, to each ac-
 cording to his needs," we question who is to
 decide those abilities and those needs.
 We know that man is imperfect-he is im-
 provable, and capable of great sacrifice and
 achievement-but he should never be al-
 lowed too much uncontrolled power.  As the
 old Romans put it "quis custodiet ipso cus-
 todies"-"whoshall guard the guards?"
 In the realm of payment for research for
 military applications, a similar system of
 justly compromised conflicts of interest-of
 checks and balances and" safeguards-needs
 also to apply.  This system is still being per-
 fected.                   It is a complicated problem, and
 every legitimate  interest must be justly
 served.
 I believe our present strength is ample
 evidence of past success.  I have some" per-
 sonal knowledge of this since not too long
 ago I served in the Navy Bureau of Aeronau-
 tics as Assistant Chief for Research and De-
 .velopment.
 As fleet commander of the 7th Fleet re-
 cently, I was a consumer of our own prod-
 Ucts, and so my evaluation of necessity had
 some degree of objectivity.
 Now I am back on the producer side of the
 house, and as part of my catching up with
 ?what has gone on while I was happily em-
 ployed as an operator, I have .been re-
 freshing myself on developments in the field
 of -procurement.  Inso' doing I. came across
 two qualifications which I thought might
 add substance to my rather general remarks
 on this subject.
 The Armed Services Procurement Regula-
 tion issued by the Department of'Defense,
 in" the revision issued on August 15 this year,
 has this to say about profits: "* * s low
 average profit rates on defense  contracts
 overall are detrimental to the public in-
 terest.  Effective national defense in a free
 enterprise economy requires that the best
 * * * 'capabilities be attracted to defense
 contracts."
 `Another portion of the regulation sets
 forth the` following' specific policy for re-
 search and development:
 "A 'fundamental mission of research and
 developmeni programs is to maintain scienti-
 fic and technolooeal supe'rio'rity requisite to
 promote and advance' the effectiveness of
 military operations.  The accomplishment of
 this mission requires the broadest possible
 'base pf contractor and subcontractor sources
 including the optimum use of manpower and
 'reeoflrces. ` It is essential that the best tech-
 nical competence be located and fully uti-
 lized,  The departments shall continually

 Of course these aren't the only considera-
 tions.  The interest of the Government must
 be protected-that is profits should not be
 too high.  And the interest of the consumer
 must be protected-that is performance must
 be assured. But within those obvious limita-
 tions, our free and competitive society must
 be served.
 As the Chief of Naval Material, I am
 vitally concerned with supporting the com-
 mendable philosophy embodied in those two
 quotations.
 It is certainly an honor and a pleasure to
 be with you here today.

 What Does Vietnam Coup,Mean?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. STEVEN B. DEROUNIAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, November 6, 1963
 Mr. DEROUNIAN. Mr. Speaker, there
 is great concern in the United States
 over the coup in Vietnam, which had the
 approval of President Kennedy.
 In yesterday's Washington Evening
 Star, William S. White gives us his anal-
 ysis of the seriousness of the situation,
 WILL THE Coup AID WAR ON REDS?
 (By William S. White)
 A long night of worry for the, future in
 South Vietnam has settled in for high Amer-
 ican. policymakers.  .If any jubilation was
 initially felt here among junior officials at
 the destruction of the government of Ngo
 Dinh Diem-with which Washington had
 long been having trouble-nothing of that
 sort is anywhere discernible now.
 Instead, there is a morning-after mood.
 In part, this is produced by genuine regret
 at the assassination of a man our people
 would, in fact, have liked to see remain in
 power if only he would have 'got rid of his
 erratic brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu..  Ironically,
 American Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
 had prepared a cable reporting that Mr. Diem
 seemed to be moving a bit more our way on
 the.very day the insurrection was mounted.
 In larger part, however, the air of concern
 is caused by these new fears:
 1. That "super patriots" attached to the
 revolution of the 20 generals which deposed
 Mr. Diem may go on killing and thus further
 stain the new regime and raise: questions of
 its capacity to govern in decency.
 2. That one or two among the generals
 might conceivably not be so reliably anti-
 Communist .as the great majority is, and so
 begin what above all else is to ,be feared.
 This  is some  under-the-cover  negotiation
 with the Communist invaders of South Viet-
 nam so long fought off by the Diem govern-
 ment backed by 15,000 American troops.
 3. That the new provisional, government of
 the generals, with. Nguyen Ngoc Tho as pro-
 visional President, might become politically
 ambitious  rather  than solely concerned
 with the war against the Communists.
 - TWO u.S  HOPES --             - -
 Mixed with all this are two; strong An eri-
 can hopes. One is that there may now" be an
 end to the exploitation of religious differ-
 ences iii Vfetnam-no more talk of-"who is
 A6967
 who' was, to blame for it-was endangering
 the war.  In this connection, some comfort
 Is taken officially here in the fact that all
 three of the top Catholic generals joined in
 the uprising.
 The second American hope Is that the new
 regime wil be in no hurry to orderpopular
 elections.  Washington is not'?interested in
 seeing a political campaign, with all its in-
 built divisiveness to a country at war, sweep
 over Vietnam.  The United States would be
 quite content to see the new outfit maintaiii
 its provisional character-with power diffused
 among the generals.  For Mr. Diem's fate
 established the inherent danger of having
 all power concentrated in one or two pairs of
 Nhu.
 WILL WAR EFFORT BE AIDED? `-  '
 But all this is mere prelude to the crucial
 question: Will the war against the'Commu-
 nists now be promoted or retarded?  If it is
 promoted all, of course, will be well.  If it
 becomes bogged down by disunity in Saigon,
 twin disaster will lie ahead.
 Any failure of the American military, effort
 there would not only lay all southeast, Asia
 open to creeping Communist aggression.  It
 also would bankrupt a wise American strategy
 to halt such aggressions by limited commit-
 ments of our, -own forces, cooperating with
 full commitments of local forces.  The alter-
 natives to this policy would be to submit to
 local aggressions or to face major war on
 the Korean scale-Or -beyond.
 .Moreover, a collapse in South Vietnam
 could quite simply, destroy the Kennedy
 administration.  Careful and persistent in-
 quiries have convinced me, for one, that the
 United States neither ordered nor directly
 participated in the bloody Ouster of Mr.
 Diem.  But nothing can alter the fact that
 Washington long had been deliberately shak-
 Ing his regime-not to smash it, but in the
 hope of thus forcing him to make accommo-
 dations with his Buddhist-led opposition to
 permit the war to go full tilt.  Since America
 has helped, if indirectly, to push him down,
 the administration's responsibility will  be
 frightful If the new. regime ever abandons the
 war on communism.

 EXTENSION OF

 Thursday, November 7, 1963
 Mr. DINGELL.  Mr. Speaker, pur-
 suant to permission granted, I insert into
 the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL REc-
 oee an editorial appearing in the Wash-
 ington (D.C.) Post of Tuesday, November
 5, 1963, entitled. "J.F.K. on Price Fix-

 clearly pointed out the. probability of a
 Presidential veto for this most destruc-

 "I've never been for the quality stabiliza-
 tion bill.  I have to look at the bill when
 It finally comes in the form it's In.  I quite
 obviously can't comment on legislation be-
 fore it finally comes to the desk of the White
 House, but the administration witnesses have
 spoken my view."
 The President's reluctance to comment in
 greater detail was doubtless prompted by the
 fact that a number of leading members of
 his own party have been so foolhardy as to
 sponsor legislation which would infringe
 upon the right of the retailer to set prices
 at competitive levels.  The bill would saddle
 the American consumers with an enormous
 burden.
 With a backlog of unfinished business that
 runs the gamut from the budget for the cur-
 rent fiscal year to tax reduction and civil
 rights legislation, Congress should not waste
 precious time on a bill which so clearly vio-
 lates the spirit of free enterprise and stands
 so small a chance of Presidential approval.
 Time will be saved and embarrassment avoid-

 National Day of Fast and Prayer To
 Protest Soviet Anti-Semitism

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, November 7, 1963
 Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi
 Dr. Julius G. Neumann, chairman of the
 board of governors of the National In-
 formation Bureau of Jewish Life, Inc.,
 of which I am honorary president, has
 Just concluded a one-man 3-day fast to
 dramatize to America the oppression,
 persecution, and tyranny of the Soviet
 Union toward Russia's 3 million Jews.
 An extension of Rabbi Neumann's pro-
 test is planned for Monday, November
 25, when a national day of fast and
 prayer will be observed to protest Soviet
 anti-Semitism.
 Having made numerous and serious ef-
 forts to bring this situation to the atten-
 tion of the administration, and the
 American people, I am pleased to insert
 in the RECORD the statement made by
 Rabbi Neumann at the conclusion of his
 dramatic protest:
 NATIONAL DAY or PAST AND PRAYER To PaoT7sr
 8ovnr ANrx-SzMrrlsM
 As pledged and in all accord with rab-
 binical teachings, I have concluded an in-
 dividual 3-day fast.  I abstained from food
 and drink on Monday, October 28; Thursday,
 October 31 and Monday, November 4 as a pro-
 test against Soviet anti-Semitism and to
 dramatize to all Americans the tragic plight
 of Russian Jewry.
 For Americans of all faiths to know-that
 persons are being condemned to death and
 executed  for  minor  economic  offenses,
 charged with committing criminal acts if
 they sell matzohs, that kosher meat Is not
 available, that Yiddish books may not be
 printed, and that Jewish dead may not be
 buried in a Jewish cemetery; to learn-that
 In the Soviet Union synagogues are closed.
 prayer books and religious articles are un-
 available; Jewish instruction banned; Yid-
 dish theaters, books and culture prohibited;
 Jewish lay organizations barred;  families
 separated and reunion thwarted; equal rights
 for Russian Jews openly denied, all this
 midst a violent anti-Jewish press campaign-
 to do nothing about this spiritual genocide is
 just as sinful as abetting such atrocities.
 At times, the Soviet Government has been
 shown to be cognizant of world  public
 opinion.  If the crescendo of International
 protest mounts, there to hope that some
 amelioration of the oppressive treatment and
 tyranny meted out to Russian Jews may be
 obtained.
 Therefore, after consultation with many
 religious and lay leaders of all faiths. I urge
 the last Monday in November to be net aside
 as a "National Day of Fast and Prayer" to
 protest vigorously the persecution of the
 Jewish minority by the Soviet Union.
 My congregation Zichron Moshe will join
 me in a 1-day 24-hour fast beginning at
 sundown, Sunday, November 24, and con-
 tinuing until sunset, Monday. November 25.
 On Sunday evening, a special prayer service
 will be held in the synagogue at 8 p.m. on
 behalf of the 3 million Russian Jews.
 Furthermore,  the  National  Information
 Bureau for Jewish Life. Inc., of which I am
 chairman of the board of governors, has con-
 tacted 77 community leaders In various cities
 in our 50 States of the Union who we expect
 to participate in joining this 1-day fast for
 November 25 and arrange for special prayer
 services on the preceding Sunday evening in
 houses of worship of all faiths in their re-
 spective cities.  The bureau in New York
 City and the surrounding metropolitan area
 are reaching more than 1.250 institutions of
 spiritual guidance to cooperate In this public
 demonstration of solidarity against Soviet
 discrimination.
 I trust that my humble one-man, 3-day
 fast will be transformed into a thunderous
 8 million, 1-day fast which will reverberate
 to the very rooms of the Kremlin.  Let 3
 million Americans stand up and be counted
 as each a brother of 3 million Russian Jews.

 Mr. LIPSCOMB.  Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks, I submit for
 inclusion in the RECORD an editorial en-
 titled "Will We Ever Wise Up?" from
 the Lusk (Wyo.) Herald.
 The editorial contains pertinent com-
 ment on the proposed sale of wheat to
 the U.S.S.R. which I believe will be of
 interest to Members of the House.
 WILL WE EVER WIsx Us'?
 We Americans just don't seem to be adept
 at playing the cold war game.
 Somehow the makeup of Americans is such
 that we can't deal with the Russians.  Our
 usual error is that we think the Communists
 of Russia are honorable.  Time and again
 this thinking has been proven erroneous, but
 we keep trying.  Just take a look at the re-
 cent happenings.
 On the afternoon of October 9 President
 Kennedy said he would sell 4 million tons
 of wheat to the Soviets. The following morn-
 ing, as a display of gratitude, the Soviets
 prevented a convey of U.S. troops from using
 the autobahn to Berlin, despite the fact
 that America had in a treaty with Russia
 the right to use the autobahn.
 While the Soviets held up the American
 troops President Kennedy was entertaining
 Gromyko, Russia's Foreign Minister, in the
 White House.
 Then too, the wheat deal doesn't smell ex-
 actly good.  In answer to our inquiry Sen-
 ator MILWABD  SIMPSON reports the  We  of
 wheat to Russia Is in essence about a 50-50
 credit cash deal.  In other words Russia is
 going to, if the deal goes through, pay about
 half of the world market price (usually be-
 tween$1.75-81.80).  American wheat farmers
 will get about $2.03 per bushel.
 Can you imagine charging anything to
 Russia when they already owe $11 billion to
 the United States?

 the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL REC-

 men's Press on October 25, 1963 pointing
 out very well that West Virginia doctors,
 whose State and National medical asso-

 pitalization for the aged under the social
 security program, are not in the least op-
 posed to socialized State and Federal
 funds, of which they collected more than
 $2 million last year for treating patients
 too poor to pay.
 One physician, I assume a stanch
 supporter of the AMA and its position,
 received $44,391 in socialized State and
 Federal funds for treatment of certain,
 West Virginians.
 Another doctor contrived to receive
 $40,596 worth of socialized State and
 Federal funds to confer, according to
 AMA, $49,596 worth of socialized medi-
 cine upon a number of other unfortunate
 West Virginians.
 It strikes me that there is brazen
 hypocrisy abroad in the land when the
 American Medical Association would
 engage In violent opposition to "social-
 ized medicine" and measures to respon-
 sibly meet the need of people of this
 country, and at the same time support
 other programs like Kerr-Mills, which is
 fully as socialized but which does not,
 according to recent findings of the Sen-
 ate Special Committee on Aging, do the
 job for the vast number of people 65 and
 over.

 Whereas there are others to follow with
 the details on ,how contracts are let and how
 payments for research are made, let us briefly
 .consider,the subject in broad terms.
 Ours is a capitalistic society, and we feel
 very strongly that the capitalistic system is
 responsible for our unquestioned strength.
 .The profit motive must continue to operate,
 .as it has so well in the past, to provide the
 incentive and the reward to those whose
 .genius and labor contribute to the common
 good.
 We are spending more and more money for
 research every day, but the rules are -chang-
 ing:  The systems that are used to contract
 for research, or to repay research costs on
 independently produced items, are constantly
 -being modified to meet new conditions, to
 improve them and to make them more re-
 sponsive to the needs and demands of the
 situation.
 The whole fabric of our society, the most
 successful yet devised by man we believe, is
 woven of the warp of individual and col-
 lective integrity and the woof of conflicting
 interests justly compromised-of checks, and
 balances, and safeguards.
 Whereas the Communist theory is, "from
 ,each according to his abilities, to each ac-
 cording to his needs," we question who is to
 decide those abilities and those needs.
 We know that man is imperfect-he is im-
 provable, and capable of great sacrifice and
 achievement-but he should never be al-
 lowed too much uncontrolled power.  As.the
 old Romans put it "quis custodiet ipso `cus-
 todies"-"who shall guard the guards?"
 In the realm of payment,for research for
 military applications, a similar system of
 justly compromised conflicts of interest-of
 checks and balances and safeguards-needs
 also to apply. This system is still being per-
 fected.  It is a complicated problem, and
 every legitimate  interest must be justly
 served.
 I believe our present strength is ample
 evidence of past success.  I have some per-
 sonal knowledge of this since not too `long
 -ago I served in the Navy Bureau of Aeronau-
 ties as Assistant Chief for Research and De-
 "velopment.
 As fleet commander of the 7th Fleet re-
 cently, I was a consumer of our own prod-
 ucts,, and so my evaluation of necessityhad
 some degree of objectivity.
 Now I am back on the producer side of the
 house, and as part of my catching up with
 what has gone on while I was happily em-
 ployed as an operator, I have been re-
 freshing myself on developments in the field
 of procurement.  In so doing I came across
 two qualifications which I thought' might
 add substance to my rather general remarks
 on this subject.
 The' Armed Services Procurement Regula-
 tion issued by the Department of Defense,
 in the revision issued on August 15 this year,
 has this to say about.proflts: "* * * low
 average profit rates on defense contracts
 overall are detrimental to the public-
 Effective national defense in a free
 enterprise economy requires that the "best
 *" * * capabilities be attracted to defense
 contracts."
 Another portion of the regulation sets
 forth the following specific policy for re-
 search and development;
 "A fundamental mission of research and
 development programs is to maintain scienti-
 hc and technological superiority requisite to
 promote :and advance the, effectiveness of
 military operations.  The accomplishment of
 this mission requires the broadest possible
 base of contractor and?subcohtractor sources
 including the optimum use of manpower and
 resources. 'it is essential that the best te h-
 'nical competence be" located and fully uti-
 lized.  The departments shall continually
 'search 3or and  develop  information' "on
 sources :(including small business concerns)
 competent to perform research and ?develop-
 meht.'*
 Of course these aren't the only considera-
 tions.  The Interest of the Government?must
 be protected-that is profits should not be
 too high. And the, interest of the consumer
 must be protectedthat is performance must
 be assured. But within those obvious limita-
 tions, our free and competitive society must
 be served.
 As the Chief of Naval Material; I am
 vitally concerned with supporting the com-
 mendable philosophy embodied in those two
 quotations.
 It is certainly an honor and a pleasure to
 be with you here today.
 I wish you the greatest success in your
 endeavors here in the clinic.
 What Does ietn   Coup Mean?
 EXTENS  N OF REMARKS,
 HON. STEVEN B. DEROUNIAN
 OF NEW YORK.
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, November 6, 1963
 Mr. DEROUNIAN. Mr. Speaker, there
 is great concern in the United States
 over the coup in Vietnam, which had the
 approval of President Kennedy.
 In yesterday's Washington Evening
 Star, William S. White gives us his anal-
 ysis of the seriousness of the. situation.
 WILL THE Coup AID WAR ON REDS?
 (By William S. White)
 A long night of worry for the future in
 South Vietnam has settled in for high Amer-
 ican policymakers.  If any jubilation was
 initially felt. here among. junior officials at
 the destruction of the government of Ngo
 Dinh Diem-with which Washington had
 long been having trouble-nothing of that
 sort is. anywhere discernible now.
 . Instead, there is ,. a morning-after mood.
 In, part, this is.produced by genuine regret
 at the assassination of a man our people
 would, in .fact, have liked to see remain in
 power if only he would have got rid. of his
 erratic brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu.  Ironically,
 American Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
 had prepared a cable reporting that Mr. Diem
 seemed to be moving a bit more our way on
 the very day the insurrection was mounted.
 In larger part, however, the air of concern
 is caused. by these new fears:
 1. That `.'super patriots" attached to the
 revolution of the 20 generals which deposed
 Mr. Diem may go on killing and thus further
 stain the new regime and raise questions .of
 its capacity to govern in decency.
 2. That one or two among the generals
 might conceivably not be so reliably anti-
 Communist as the great majority is, and so
 begin what above all else is to be feared.
 This is some under-the-cover negotiation
 with the Communist Invaders of South Viet-
 nam so long fought off by the Diem govern-
 ment backed by 15,000. American troops.
 3. That the new provisional government of
 the generals, with Nguyen Ngoc The as pro-
 visional President, might become politically
 ambitious  rather  than  solely  concerned
 with the war against the Communists.
 Two U.S. HOPES -"
 Mixed "with all this are' two strong Ameri-
 can hopes.                                                                       One is that there may now bean

 who'was to blame for it-was endangering
 the war.  In this-connection, some comfort
 is taken officially' here in the fact that all
 three of the top Catholic generals joined in
 the uprising.        '                .
 The second American hope is that the new
 regime wil be in no hurry to order popular
 elections.  Washington is not interested in
 seeing a political campaign, with all its in-
 built divisiveness to a, country at war, sweep
 over Vietnam.  The United,States would be
 quite content to see the new outfit maintain
 its provisional character=with power diffused
 among the generals.  For Mr; Diem's fate
 established the Inherent danger of having
 all power concentrated in one or two pairs of
 hands as it was with Mr. Diem and Mr.
 Nhu.
 WILL WAR EFFORT BE AIDED?
 .But all this is mere prelude to the crucial
 question: 'Will the war against the Commu-
 nists now be promoted or retarded? If it is
 promoted all, of course, will be well.  If it
 becomes bogged down by. disunity in Saigon,
 twin disaster will lie ahead.
 Any failure of,the.American military effort
 there would not only lay all southeast Asia
 open to creeping Communist `aggression.  It
 also would bankrupt a wise American strategy
 to halt such aggressions by limited commit-
 ments of. our own forces cooperating with
 full commitments of local forces.  The alter-
 natives to this policy would be to submit to
 local aggressions or to face major war on
 the Korean scale-or beyond.
 Moreover, a collapse in South Vietnam
 could quite simply, destroy the Kennedy
 administration.  Careful and persistent in-
 quiries have convinced me, for one, that the
 United States neither ordered nor directly
 participated in the bloody ouster of Mr.
 Diem.  But nothing can alter the fact that
 Washington long had been deliberately shak-
 ing his regime-not to smash it, but in the
 hope of thus forcing him to make accommo-
 dations with his Buddhist-led .opposition to
 permit the war to go full tilt.. Since America
 has helped, if indirectly, to push him down,
 the administration's responsibility will  be
 frightful if the new regime ever abandons the

 One physician, I assume a stanch
 supporter of the AMA and its position,
 received $44,391 in socialized State and
 Federal funds for treatment of certain
 West Virginians.
 Another doctor contrived to receive
 $40,596 worth of socialized State and
 Federal funds to confer, according to
 AMA, $49,596 worth of socialized medi-
 cine upon a number of other unfortunate
 West Virginians.
 It strikes me that there is brazen
 hypocrisy abroad in the land when the
 American  Medical  Association would
 engage in violent opposition to "social-
 ized medicine" and measures to respon-
 sibly meet the need of people of this
 country, and at the same time support
 other programs like Kerr-Mills, which is
 fully as socialized but which does not,
 according to recent findings of the Sen-
 ate Special Committee on Aging, do the
 job for the vast number of people 65 and
 over.

 funds last year for treating patients too poor
 to pay.
 One physician, the Charleston Gazette re-
 ported, received $44,391 in State payments-
 presumably in addition to the fees he re-
 ceived from noncharity patients.  Another
 doctor managed to see enough charity pa-
