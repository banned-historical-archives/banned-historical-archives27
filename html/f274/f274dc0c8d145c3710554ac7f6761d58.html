1476 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
ence table. The other side refused to 
talk. 
I spent some time in Vietnam this fall. 
I talked to a good many troops because 
went up into the forests and the jungles 
where they were fighting. I can report to 
you that the morale of those troops out 
there, as far as I was able to ascertain it, 
is better than the morale of some of the 
people who are marching here and burn-
ing draft cards and holding sit-ins and 
teach-ins here. The only complaint I 
heard out there among these troops was, 
"What is wrong with some of these people 
back home? Yes, and what is wrong with 
some Congressmen who are holding 
forums for these people to air their views 
making the North Vietnamese believe 
that we do want to quit?" Some people 
say, "Well, if we do not get out of there 
Communist China is going to come in." 
talked to a good many people in Hong 
Kong, Bangkok and Vietnam itself and 
almost universally they say that if we 
make it perfectly clear to Peiping that if 
they do come in that same afternoon 
their atom-bomb-making complex will 
disappear from the face of the earth, 
then they will not come in. The reason 
for that is these Chinese I talked to say--
and some of them visit Red China occa-
sionally?that the Chinese Communist 
leaders believe and are planning on a 50-
year program to get enough atom bombs 
to annihilate the rest of the world. They 
will do anything to keep from having 
their atom bomb apparatus immobilized. 
They said. and I believe it is true, that if 
we make it perfectly clear to Peiping that 
the first time a Chinese soldier is found 
engaged in combat that that atom bomb 
complex will disappear?and we can 
make it disappear with one Polaris mis-
sile?then they will think a long time 
before coming in. If they do come in I 
think we ought to use every weapon we 
have to stop them in their tracks as Mr. 
Truman had the courage to use the ulti-
mate weapon in the war against Japan 
and thereby save 1 million American cas-
ualties. I do not advocate the use of any 
terrible weapon lightly. I do not want to 
see any noncombatants, women and chil-
dren, killed. However, as the Secretary 
of State said last week, what is the differ-
ence between a bomb dropped from an 
airplane which kills civilians and a bomb 
delivered on a bicycle or in a Renault 
which kills as high as 50 or 69 women and 
children in Saigon. I cannot make the 
distinction and I cannot get as upset as 
some of the people do who seem to have 
a double standard. 
Their attitude is that it is not fair to 
do anything to North Vietnam but it is 
perfectly fair for North Vietnam to do 
anything they want to do to the civilians 
of South Vietnam. 
I support the President in this and I 
hope the card burners and the marchers 
will also decide to close ranks and sup-
port the United States of America. 
PERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
(Mr. FOLEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.)

uary 27, I was unavoidably absent during

VIETNAM 
(Mr. FOLEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, as an in-
dividual Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives I wrote to the President last 
week and expressed my full :ripport in 
the event he found it necessary to resume 
the bombing of North Vietnam 
As I stated in that letter it; is the 
President, and he alone as Commander 
in Chief who has the responsibility and 
the right to make this momentous de-
cision. It is clear that the decision has 
been made, after the most careful anal-
ysis of all the relevant facts at issue 
and with the deepest resolution on his 
part, not only to maintain the freedom 
and the integrity of South Vietnam but 
to seek every honorable means of restor-
ing peace in southeast Asia. 
I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that the 
President's action will have the support 
of the overwhelming majority of the 
American people of both parties here in 
the Congress and throughout the 
country. 
PROBLEMS OF APPALACHIA 
(Mr. PERKINS asked and was given 
permission to extend his remarks in the 
body of the RECORD and to include a news-
paper article.) 
Mr. PERKINS. Mr. Speaker, the 
problems of Appalachia have been of con-
cern to this Congress for some time and 
we have taken a number of legislative 
actions to assist that section as well as 
other depressed areas. Therefore, I be-
lieve you will share my pleasure in know-
ing about one of the very fine arid hope-
ful things that is happening in my State 
as a result of some of this legislation. 
I refer specifically to the work experi-
ence and training program which was 
started the winter of 1963-64 in 9 coun-
ties of Kentucky and is now operating in 
19 counties. The Federal laws which 
made this program possible are the 1962 
amendments to the Social Security Act 
and the Economic Opportunity Act of 
1965. The program is designed to help 
needy families become self-suporting and 
is administered by the Welfare Admini-
stration of the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare in cooperation 
with the Kentucky Department of Eco-
nomic Security. This program has 
built-in safeguards?including m:wit-sys-
tern appointed personnel?to assure that 
its benefits reach those who need them 
most and that it is operated in ways that 
will help them most. 
Today, I was notified by the Welfare 
Administration that a grant of $13.4 mil-
lion has just been approved to enable the 
nine counties, where the program started, 
to carry it on for another year. The 10 
other counties, which started later, are 
still operating on their original grants. 
January .'?i, 1966 
I want to take just a few minutes of 
your time to tell you why the approval 
of this grant today was especially good 
news to me, why I believe it will be 
equally good news to you, and why I know 
that to several thousand families in Ken-
tucky, it is not merely good news but 
almost literally lifesaving news. 
The people I am talking about live 
where I live in the most remote hill sec-
tions of eastern Kentucky. Their plight 
has been my chief concern since I have 
been a Member of Congress, but every 
legislative proposal designed to provide 
programs of educational, employment, 
economic development assistance for the 
most part have been sidetracked and 133,-
passed until the very recent sessions cif 
the Congress. The plight of people living 
in these regions has been the focus of 
nationwide attention thanks to the excel-
lent reportorial services of the New York 
Times and the Louisville Courier Journcl 
who went into these sections and ex-
posed the many, many families who were 
living on the razoredge of starvation. 
As I have said, I have been anxiously 
concerned about the plight of these fami-
lies who could look forward to little more 
than more hunger, more deprivation, and 
more hopeless years of unemployment. 
Regular grant-in-aid programs fashion-
ed for the Nation as a whole seem to 
bypass and do little for this area. As a 
consequence, I have worked actively for 
national attention to the specific prob. 
lems of the area through specific pro-
grams to cope with educational and eco-
nomic needs of this isolated region of 
our Nation. A regions I might add, 
which is vast in many natural resources 
not yet developed. 
Many of the mothers and fathers in 
those families could not .read or write 
and their children were growing up the 
same way. You can not send ragged, 
half-sick, half-starved children off to 
school and even if you do, they are in no 
shape to learn. Other factors contribute 
to providing barriers to education not the 
least of which is the deplorable lack of 
roads. 
For over 6,000 of the most desperate 
of those families, the winter of 1966 is 
very different from the winter of 1963 
because of the work experience rind 
training program. Unfortunately, that 
change has often been described by a 
phrase that distorts its real meaning?
"happy pappies." Yet in a literal sense, 
the description is true. These men are 
happy. 
They are happy because their chil-
dren?some 23,000 of them?go off to 
school every morning with a breakfast 
under their belts and with shoes on 
their feet and warm coats on their 
backs. Most of these families still live 
far below the poverty line of $3,000 a 
year but now they at least have the bare 
essentials. 
They are happy because they know 
that if anyone in the family is sick, he 
will get attention?and many of them 
can remember when loved ones suffered, 
perhaps even died, for lack of such 
attention. 
But most of all, these fathers are 
happy because they can look to a

dump of unsightly debris, graveled the drive, 
gathered and burned trash in one spot, and 
built a wide unloading area. Formerly trucks 
and cars did not have enough room to turn 
after unloading trash at the dump. 
Most of the jobs would have gone undone 
or would have had to wait had it not been for 
the program. 
But in the long run, only time will tell 
how successful the new program will be in 
teaching participants to actually become 
steady wage earners. The 24 who currently 
have progressed to traneeships is not a large 
percentage of the 171 on the program. 
And always there is the possibility that a 
private employer will be tempted to take ad-
vantage of the program to obtain free labor 
for some menial task under the pretext of 
teaching the worker specific work skills. 
In the end much of the program's future 
value to the public will depend on the alert-
ness of officials in finding worthwhile jobs 
for the men, and citizens in calling attention 
to jobs that need doing. 
VIETNAM 
(Mr. ROGERS of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
the President's announcement to resume 
the bombing of North Vietnam is sym-
bolic of this Nations determination to 
keep its commitment in southeast Asia. 
President Johnson has kept all doors to 
negotiations open in an effort to bring 
about a peaceful settlement to the prob-
lems of South Vietnam. Yet the Com-
munist aggressors have both rejected and 
maligned his repeated pleas for peace. 
In the face of their unwillingness to dis-
cuss on any level the complex problems 
which the world is faced with, President 
Johnson has made the right decision. 
During the lull in U.S. bombing the 
Communists have been given the chance 
to repair damage and replinish supplies 
which had been destroyed by previous 
American raids. The current U.S. ef-
forts should spare no military target of 
strategic importance. I urge the Presi-
dent to render ineffective the vital North 
Vietnamese supply port of Hiaphong. 
The port of Haiphong should not be-
come a sanctuary as the Yalu River did in 
North Korea. The port of Haiphong is 
currently the main port of supply for the 
aggressive forces of North Vietnam and 
so long as it continues to be the conduit 
of aggression, it should receive priority 
consideration and be rendered inopera-
tive. 
VIETNAM 
(Mr. HOSMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
prove of this decision of the President to 
resume the bombing, but I think it ought 
to be given an assessment of actually 
what it is. Despite all the leaks from 
the White House during the past few 
days about all the "To be or not to be" 
soliloquizing going on down there, I do 
not think it is anything that we should 
go into emotional orbit about. The pro-
longed "Be kind to Hanoi week" which 
stretched out to 5 weeks and 2 days aim-
No, 15-2 
ply did not accomplish its objective. It 
was a failure and it was time to stop it 
and take another tack. And, now that 
We are going to do so I think we should 
also take realistic stock of the success or 
failure of the bombing as it was carried 
on up to the Christmas holidays. It was 
suposed to, first, slow down the infiltra-
tion of North Vietnamese military units 
into the South and, second, raise the 
price of the war in the North to the point 
where they would determine to cease 
their aggressions. That bombing failed 
utterly to accomplish either of those two 
purposes. So the score so far is two 
failures in a row and again I say it is 
nothing to go into a state of euphoria 
about as so much of this Presidential 
adulation seems to indicate. 
Instead we had better do some hard 
thinking about what kind of bombing 
we ought to be doing from here on out 
to accomplish the objectives we have set 
instead of failing to accomplish them. 
If we are thinking about doing some-
thing which will discourage them from 
doing the things the President, Secre-
tary McNamarra, and Secretary Rusk say 
we are trying to discourage them from 
doing, we should realistically admit that 
the use of TNT bombs on targets we 
have thus far selected has failed of its 
purpose. A repetition of that kind of 
action should not prove any more suc-
cessful in the future than it has been in 
the past. I am not thinking in terms of 
blowing up Hanoi and Haiphong or 
using atom bombs, but I am thinking in 
terms of using some intelligent analysis 
to determine what kind of targets are 
meaningful to those people and using 
some creative imagination to determine 
what kind of ammunition should be used 
against those targets to succeed in 
achieving our purpose. Both the targets 
and the ammunition may turn out to be 
quite unconventional. I shall say more 
about them in the near future. The 
point I want to make now is that if civil-
ians in Washington are going to insist 
on running this war without paying any 
attention to the advice of the military, 
then they should start to make sense 
about the way we fight it and stop mis-
managing it before they turn it into a 
fiasco. They should stop fighting the 
last war, which this one is not. They 
should stop thinking about the war as a 
conventional war which it is not and 
start thinking about it as the unconven-
tional war it is. If they do so intelli-
gently and imaginatively, that will bring 
us victory and we will not have to fight 
forever to get it. 
THE SPACE PROGRAM?MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 371) 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was 
read, and, together with the accompany-
ing papers, referred to the Committee on 
Science and Astronautics and ordered to 
be printed with illustrations: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
The record of American accomplish-
ments in aeronautics and space during 
1965 shows it to have been the most suc-
cessful year in our history. 
More spacecraft were orbited than in 
any previous year. Five manned Gem-
ini flights were successfully launched. 
Our astronauts spent more hours in 
space than were flown by all of our 
manned spacecraft until 1965. Ten as-
tronauts logged a total of 1,297 hours, 42 
minutes in space. 
The five manned flights successfully 
achieved included a walk in space, and 
the first rendezvous between two manned 
spacecraf is. 
A scientific spacecraft completed a 
325-million-mile, 228-day trip to Mars. 
Mariner 4 thereby gave mankind its first 
closeup view of another planet. 
The Ranger series, begun in 1961, 
reached its zenith with two trips to the 
moon that yielded 13,000 closeup pic-
tures of that planet. The entire Ranger 
series produced 17,000 photographs of 
the moon's surface which are being 
studied now by experts throughout the 
world. 
Equally inmortant were the contribu-
tions of our space program to life here 
on earth. Launching of Early Bird, the 
first commercial communication satellite 
brought us measurably closer to the goal 
of instantaneous communication between 
all points on the globe. Research and de-
velopment in our space program con-
tinued to speed progress in medicine, in 
weather prediction, in electronics?and, 
indeed, in virtually every aspect of Amer-
ican science and technology. 
As our space program continues, the 
impact of its developments on everyday 
life becomes daily more evident. It con-
tinues to stimulate our education, im-
prove our material well-being, and 
broaden the horizons of knowledge. It is 
also a powerful force for peace. 
The space program of the United 
States today is the largest effort ever un-
dertaken by any nation to advance the 
frontiers of human knowledge. What we 
are discovering and building today will 
help solve many of the great problems 
which an increasingly complex and 
heavily populated world will face tomor-
row. 
The year 1965?the year of Gemini, 
Ranger, and Mariner?is a brilliant pref-
ace to the coming years of Apollo, sta-
tions in space, and voyages to the planets. 
I have great pride and pleasure in trans-
mitting this remarkable record to the 
Congress that, through its enthusiastic 
support, has made possible.

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF NA-

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 
NO. 372) 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was 
read and, together with the accompany-

18O CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I said in my state of the Union message 
this year that, "We must change to mas-
ter change." 
Failing that, this Nation will surely 
become a casualty to the relentless tide 
of history. For in assessing our pros-
pects, we must remember that mankind 
faces not one but many possible futures. 
Which future our children's children en-
joy?or endure?depends in large meas-
ure on our ability to adjust to the needs 
of the times. 
But change comes not of itself. Nei-
ther the requirement for change nor the 
desire for change will see us through. 
In a complex world?growing more com-
plex every year?only knowledge can 
keep us apace. 
We must achieve a better understand-
ing of our environment and our place in 
that environment. 
We must continue to unlock the secrets 
of the earth below us, the sea around us, 
and the heavens above us. 
And we must intensify our search 
into the very meaning of life itself. 
ft is not too much to say that every 
aspect of our lives will be affected by 
the success of this effort. The military 
and economic strength of our Nation, and 
the health, the happiness, and the wel-
fare of our citizens all are profoundly 
influenced by the limits?and potentiali-
ties?of our scientific program. 
In the furtherance of this program, no 
organization, agency or institution has 
had a more profound or lasting influence 
than the National Science Foundation. 
The establishment of this Foundation by 
the Congress, 15 years ago, was one of the 
soundest investments this Nation ever 
made. 
In the field of basic research, many of 
the major scientific breakthroughs of 
our time would have been impossible?or 
at the very least, much longer in com-
ing?had it not been for National Science 
Foundation grants in the basic sciences. 
In the field of education, it is enough 
to say that more than half of all our high 
school teachers have now received vital 
refresher training through the Founda-
tion's education program. 
In the classrooms, the Foundation has 
played a major role in modernizing 
scientific curricula to make them respon-
sive to our age. 
And in a more recent activity, the 
Foundation has launched a program to 
strengthen the science departments of 
many of our smaller universities 
throughout the Nation by providing new 
laboratories, modern equipment, and fel-
lowships to promising graduate students. 
It should be emphasized that the role 
of the National Science Foundation is to 
aid, not to arbitrate. But through its 
aid--akillf ally administered and intel-
ligently applied?it has brought Ameri-
can science to a new level of excellence. 
This, the 15th Annual Report of the 
National Science Foundation, reflects 
another year of scientific growth and 
progress, and I am pleased to commend 
it to the attention of the Congress. It 
mirrors the past and illuminates the fu-
ture. 
It is the story of change?to master 
change.

RESUMPTION OF BOMBING 
IN NORTH VIETNAM 
(Mr. CALLAWAY (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
..........----"Arririrovedrdrftstea'strtf3eefllffIfrrCM*L 
January 31, 1966 
Mr. CALLAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend the President on his decision to 
resume bombing over North Vietnam 
feeling that under the circumstances, 
this was the right and only choice to 
make. This Nation sincerely warts 
peace, but knows full well that appease-
ment is not the answer. Only throuoh 
strength and firmness in the face of a ;-
gression can we truly achieve the peace 
we seek, and therefore I am convne id 
that this decision is a necessary and peal-
tive step toward winning the war. More-
over, this action is needed to back up the 
efforts of our fighting men. I have long 
said that in committing vast numbers of 
troops to fight and die in Vietnam, we 
are honor and duty bound to back them 
up in every way we can. Let us hope that 
this decision is only a first step towa 
the full military backing needed to win 
this war, and that it will be followed by a 
further step?the closing of Haiphong--
that is so yital to victory in Asia. 
No CUTRATE BENEFITS FOR OUR 
VIETNAM VETERANS 
(Mr. RANDALL asked and was given 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and include extra-
neous matter.) 
Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, the 
House Veterans' Affairs Committee faces 
a large stack of bills that have been re-
cently introduced relating to proposed 
benefits for what is improperly described 
as our cold war veterans. In some re-
cent remarks on the floor of the How: e, 
I urged upon the chairman and members 
of that committee that the time had come 
for more action and less talk both by the 
committee and the Congress, to provide 
too long delayed benefits for those who 
are now serving in some hot spots of the 
cold war. 
Our Veterans' Affairs Committee has 
a big job, if it does nothing more than 
compare the provisions of more than 11'0 
such bills already introduced in the 89th 
Congress. Very few of these bills are 
identical. They differ as to effectice 
dates, eligibility, termination dates, and 
the extent of benefits provided. 
The several bills can be divided into 
two general classes. First is a group of 
bills that follow S. 9, sponsored by Sena-
tor Yanackaouax, which has already 
passed the Senate and which would pro-
vide benefits for all veterans who serve 
between January 31, 1955, and July 1, 
1967, who have been released under con-
ditions other than dIshonorable and win 
have served for a period of more than 
130 days. Under this kind of bill, the 
benefits for education and training would 
be related to length of service. As a rule 
of thumb, the formula for entitlement for 
education and training would be 11/2 elay3 
of schooling for each day served since 
induction. In other words, 2 years of 
service would earn the maximum of :36 
months as a period of education or train-
ing to which an eligible veteran would be 
entitled. Such a formula would seem to 
be fair and equitable and even a lesser 
formula which provides 1 day's education

January 31, 1966 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 1481 
for 1 day's service could not be the sub-
ject of strenuous objection. 
Over in another category is a classifi-
cation of bills which generally follow 
H.R. 1006 which provides only limited 
benefits to persons serving in combat 
zones after January 1, 1962. In other 
words, benefits are limited under this 
class of bills to those post-Korean vet-
erans who have served 90 days of active 
duty in a combat zone. These proposals 
are called the "hot spot" bills. The so-
called administration bills heretofore in-
troduced by request are described as lOw-
cost bills, in that they would limit the 
cost to approximately $100 million for 
the first year. The so-called high-priced 
bills would require expenditures of up to 
$275 million for the first year. These 
would not be limited to education and 
job training, but would include housing 
benefits, hospital benefits, job counsel-
ing, placement rights, numerous other 
readjustment benefits, including service-
connected compensation at wartime 
rates, specially equipped automobiles for 
those who have lost use of a limb, and 
specially built homes designed for those 
confined to a wheel chair. 
As we observed at the beginning of 
these remarks, it is the content or sub-
stance of these bills that is important 
rather than any particular title that may 
be affixed to any of them. Some are 
called Combat Veterans Equalization 
Benefits Act. Some are titled Cold War 
Readjustment Assistance Act. Others 
are called Vietnam Era Veterans Read-
justment Act. But, again, the name or 
title is not nearly so important as the 
provisions contained for eligibility and 
the range of benefits granted. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think very much 
argument is needed to underscore the 
necessity that some sort of veterans 
benefit bill for those now serving should 
receive early approval. It should be a 
bill which will contain comprehensive 
veteran benefits. These thousands upon 
thousands of our young Americans who 
are subject to compulsory draft have 
been required to interrupt their civilian 
pursuits. They should receive benefits 
comparable to those received by veterans 
of World War II and the Korean conflict. 
Yet, since January 31, 1955, which was 
the cutoff date for eligibility under the 
Korean GI bill, about the only assistance 
the Federal Government has offered 
these post-Korean veterans is unemploy-
ment compensation. 
It is high time to right this inequitable 
situation. Those who now serve in our 
Armed Forces are being called upon to 
share a disproportionate burden of citi-
zenship. While they serve, others near 
their age go on preparing for occupa-
tional and professional careers. Enact-
ment of a bill providing for some benefits 
is nothing more or less than an act of 
justice toward those who are sacrificing 
civilian gain for military duty. 
Opponents abject to the cost. Those 
who argue for a slowdown in domestic 
spending contend that no new programs 
should be begun, yielding high priority to 
funding for Vietnam. Yet these same 
persons forget that the cost of an edu-
cation and training program for today's 
servicemen should properly be viewed as 
just one of the necessary costs of the 
current war. While on the subject of 
the costs, there is a temptation to con-
sider such cost as an outlay that may 
never be returned rather than an in-
vestment that will yield big returns. It 
is true the original GI bill involved an 
outlay of over $15 billion, yet it has since 
been proven that this bill actually "cost" 
the taxpayers nothing. It has been 
demonstrated that it generated over $20 
billion of new income and that those 
who were educated, according to the 
Census Bureau estimates, are now paying 
an extra $1 billion a year in Federal in-
come taxes because of added earnings 
directly traceable to their education 
made possible by the GI bill. 
On the 20th anniversary of the orig-
inal GI bill, which was called the Serv-
icemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, 
statistics show this bill helped produce 
460,000 engineers, 360,000 teachers, 197,-
000 in the health field, and 150,000 scien-
tists, as well as 699,000 in business ad-
ministration and 2,500,000 skilled crafts-
men in the trades and industrial pursuits. 
If the figure of $1 billion a year in 
new or additional income taxes paid be-
cause of the GI bill is correct, then on 
the 20th anniversary of the bill, this 
would mean $20 billion in new income 
from the 7.8 million veterans who re-
ceived benefits of some kind. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my intention to pre-
pare for immediate introduction a bill 
which contains a range of benefits com-
parable to those provided for World 
War II and Korean veterans. My bill 
will propose more liberal eligibility pro-
visions than the combat or hot-spot bills, 
with an effective date nearer the Korean 
cutoff than most that have been thus far 
submitted. 
While it is understandable that greater 
benefits should be provided for those 
serving in "hot spots," it is very disap-
pointing that a program should be lim-
ited only to such veterans as the admin-
istration measure would propose. Re-
member, these young men had no con-
trol or choice over the area to which they 
were assigned. Remember also we plan 
to spend several billion more dollars on 
our race to the moon. We have already 
allocated over $11/2 billion for the anti-
poverty program. It has been an-
nounced we plan to continue our costly 
foreign aid program. Then why is it 
we cannot find a way to provide gen-
erous benefits to these young men who 
are sent to support our foreign policy 
and respect for our flag. 
The question might well be asked, Is 
it not wiser to spend national funds to 
help a man receive an education than it 
is to give him a relief check later as an 
untrained and uneducated person who 
cannot find a job? The burden of mili-
tary service does not fall on all alike. 
The very least a grateful nation can do, 
In my judgment, for these young vet-
erans who have lost time from their nor-
mal lives in order to serve their country, 
is to provide benefits that they may equip 
themselves to reenter the mainstream of 
life and live as -Americans should?free, 
productive, and self-supporting. 
This Congress must meet its respon-
sibility to our returning veterans as 
earlier Congresses have done. The time 
has come for less talk and more action. 
Now is the time to get on with the job 
of passing a good GI bill. Above all, let 
us pass a bill that is not a cutrate piece 
of legislation, watered down by admin-
istration proposals to omit home or farm 
loan provisions and omit also on-the-job 
or on-the-farm training provisions. 
May there be no radical departure from 
the time-hondred philosophy expressed 
in the previous GI bills which provided 
generous benefits for a man's willingness 
to put his life on the line for his Nation. 
FEDERAL ACTION NEEDED TO 
CRACK DOWN ON HIGHWAY 
DEATHS 
The SPEAKER. Under previous or-
der of the House, the gentleman from 
New York [Mr. HALPERN] is recognized 
for 10 minutes. 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, it was 
my privilege to serve for 7 years as chair-
man of the New York State Joint Legis-
lative Committee on Motor Vehicle 
Safety, and I am heartened to see that 
the programs we initiated then, such as 
the driver education program, have 
served as models for many other States 
But there is a clear need for Federal 
action in this area, too, and if we want 
to make the 89th Congress a truly his-
toric session, we must enact legislation 
to eliminate the carnage on our high-
ways. 
There is a definite need for a Federal 
role here, for if ever there was an in-
terstate instrument it is the automobile. 
Clearly, action at the national level is 
needed to effectively supplement State 
efforts. I have introduced legislation 
to provide a comprehensive Federal pro-
gram to attack the mass murder on our 
roads which claims the lives of 1,000 
Americans every week. And I urge my 
colleagues to join in solving this appal-
ling and ever mounting problem. 
My bill, H.R. 9629, is a broad measure 
designed to provide the States with the 
Federal assistance they require. The 
bill establishes a traffic safety center 
in the Department of Commerce and 
assigns it the responsibility for coordi-
nating all Federal and State efforts 
toward mitigating traffic accidents. It 
provides incentives for States to estab-
lish and improve motor vehicle inspec-
tion and driver education programs; 
promotes research and development nec-
essary for the production of safer cars; 
and lays the groundwork for standardiz-
ing minimum safety requirements, traffic 
control devices, accident reporting and 
driver licensing. In addition, the bill 
would create an Advisory Council on 
Highway Traffic Safety, consisting of ex-
perts in the field, to assist in drafting of 
national standards. 
This legislation is a companion bill to 
S. 2231, introduced in the Senate by Sen-
ator RisicoFF?a great leader in the 
cause of traffic safety?and cosponsored 
by Senators BARTLETT, LONG Of Missouri, 
MONDALE and TYDINGS. I think that the 
need for Federal action in this area, 
which we have recognized and advocated, 
has been clearly corroborated by the in-
tensive investigation of the American

1482 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE 
Trial Lawyers' Association. I can highly 
commend to my colleagues, and to all 
who are concerned with this problem, the 
Association's excellent study, "Stop Mur-
der by Motor," which was just released 
this month. I salute the Association's 
President, Mr. Joseph K nner, for this 
outstanding example- of public service, 
in this critical area. And I strongly 
urge the House Public Works Committee 
and the Senate Commerce Committee to 
schedule early hearings on this im-
portant legislation. 
One simply cannot exaggerate the 
havoc and the human misery wrought 
by traffic accidents. More Americans 
have been killed on our highways in the 
last 25 years-1,510,000?than have died 
in all the wars from the Revolution un 
to Vietnam-605,000. In 1964 alone, 1.7 
million Americans were injured in traffic 
accidents--precisely the same number as 
the total hospital beds in the entire 
United States. Latest statistics show 
that last year's deaths on U.S. highways 
totaled over 50,000. These ever-grow-
ing figures are outrageous, but they are 
starkly realistic and something must be 
done about it. The time for bold and 
forward-looking action is long overdue, 
and we must not lose any time in making 
an all-out attack on the highway death 
toll. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Center, which my bill seeks to establish, 
would work with the States in develop-
ing adequate standards of vehicle safety, 
strict licensing and inspection require-
ments, and driver education programs 
for secondary schools. In 1962-63, only 
60 percent of our public schools offered 
driver education programs, and only 24 
States provided financial support to these 
programs. When one considers that 
about 8,000 children of secondary school 
age reach driving age daily, I think it be--
comes clear that a more determined ef-
fort is required to afford them the in-
struction they need and deserve. 
In addition, the Federal Government 
must take the lead in establishing uni-
form safety standards for automobiles, 
as it has for airplanes and trains. The 
recent contribution of $10 million by the 
auto industry, to the Highway Safety Re-. 
search Institute at the University of 
Michigan, evidences its recognition of 
the fact that more work needs to be done 
in the promotion of motor vehicle safety. 
Senator GAYLORD NELSON has observed 
that 87 percent of all accidents occur at, 
speeds of 35 miles per hour and below, 
and that countless lives could be saved 
each year if cars were equipped with 
such modest devices as collapsible steer-
ing columns, shoulder harnesses, and 
doors which would remain closed in a 
crash. Senator NELSON has long and 
actively sponsored legislation to promote 
the production of safer cars, and I be-
lieve that his bills, too, represent the 
kind of responsible, progressive action 
which is needed at the Federal level. 
Mr. Speaker, there is obviously no 
panacean solution to this grievous prob-
lem, but a number of excellent measures 
have been introduced in this Congress, 
all of which take cognizance of the need 
for imaginatively conceived and vigor-
ously implemented Federal action. The 
;.*r _?. 
Fur 1i 
need for Federal action is clear beyond 
doubt; the nature of this action may re-
quire more precise delineation. I believe, 
however, that my bill and those intro-
duced in the Senate, go a long way to-
ward defining the role which the Federal 
Government should be playing, and are 
specific and thoughtful enough to war-
rant the immediate attention of the ap-
propria committees. 
VIETNAM?LET US CLOSE THE 
CREDIBILITY GAP 
The SPEAKER. Under previous 
order of the House, the gentleman from 
Wisconsin [Mr. LAIRD] is recognized for 
20 minutes. 
Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, leaks from 
the White House?the principal source 
of information these past weeks on de-
velopments in Vietnam?indicated last 
week that the administration planned to 
return to the policy of bombing selected 
targets in North Vietnam. Tho public 
relations campaign for this reversal of 
policy got underway with a conference 
at the White House between administra-
tion policymakers and leaders of the Con-
gress followed by the announcement 
from anonymous informed sources that 
most congressional leaders "are taking 
a harder position than when they went 
home aftcr the last session." 
Some reports suggest that American 
troop strength in Vietnam will be more 
than doubled and could exceed by 60 per-
cent or more the number of troops sent 
by this Nation to Korea. 
Mr. Speaker, I worry?as do our col-
leagues on both sides of the ais1---about 
the conduct of this tragic war in Viet-
nam--about the unexplained shifts of 
policy, the starting and stopping of 
bombing in the North, the failure to 
make any real progress after the com-
mitment of 200,000 American troojps, the 
uncertainty about our objectives, the 
failure to divulge information which 
those who sacrifice in this war have a 
right to be told, and the gap between 
what they are told and reality. 
After the decision was made to escalate 
this war on the ground, along with others 
of both major parties, I have made pub-
lic suggestions such as a Kennedy-type 
quarantine of North Vietnam. My pur-
pose, whenever I have made such policy 
suggestions, has been to urge a course 
that would safeguard the freedom and 
independence of South Vietnam with a 
minimum loss of American lives. No one 
can argue against a policy that would 
value the lives of our gallant servicemen 
so highly that not one soldier, not one 
sailor, nor one airman would be unneces-
sarily sacrificed. I hope and pray that 
the administration will seek to minimize 
American casualties in southeast Asia. 
On this point serious doubts have been 
expressed by responsible public spokes-
men. For example, former Air Force 
Chief of Staff, Gen. Curtis LeMay, on 
October 22, 1965, is reported to have 
said that U.S. actions in Vietnam up to 
that time "were getting people killed who 
Should not be killed." More recently, re-
liable newsmen on the scene in South 
Vietnam have been reporting that the 
cessation of air attacks on the North has 
DFAS 7 
January 31, 1966 
given the enemy the opportunity to in-
crease and strengthen significantly the 
forces against which American troops 
will be fighting. 
One columnist, Joseph Alsop, writing 
from Saigon in a column published on 
January 26, 1966, in the Washing ton 
Post, reports: 
The pause for the peace offensive has al-
lowed all the worst damage to be repaired, 
new defenses to be moved into place, and 
huge forward stockages to be built up for 
added pressure on the south. Thus most 
of the fruits of the hard effort or the last 
8 months have now been thrown away. 
Worse still, however, has been what meg 
be called the morale loss in the north. It 1'3 
a truism that just as the South Vietnamese 
build their hopes on confidence in America's 
strength of will, so the North Vietnanacce 
build all their hopes on the belief that Amer-
ica lacks the strength of will to survive the 
present test, Every Vietnamese expert in 
the service of the U.S. Government agrees 
on this point. 
Every sign indicates that the peace offen-
sive has strongly bolstered this North Viet-
namese belief that they can count on vic-
tory in the end, because the United tSates 
is basically weak willed. 
Their main response to the peace offensive 
has been to push into South Vietnam, with 
much aid from the bombing pause, more 
and more of 'North Vietnamese regular troops 
So many are now present in the South that 
they add up to a major invasion. 
When the country is at war with 200,000 
troops in the field, the only serious consid-
eration should be the gains and losses in 
the war. And as far as the war is con-
cerned, the balance sheet shows no gain and 
much loss. 
The Secretary of Defense has acknowl-
edged the serious military loss for the 
United States and South Vietnam result-
ing from the removal of any effective 
military Pressure on North Vietnam. He 
asserts, however, that "these military 
penalties are a small cost to pay because 
the United f3tates is achieving the goal. of 
showing the world that we want peace." 
He does not tell us in specific terms 
what the gains and benefits have been so 
that we can judge whether they are in 
fact adequate compensation for increased 
American casualties. They have not 
been enough to lead any additional na-
tions?even among our SEATO allies?
to send a division or even a company to 
fight with American and South Vietna-
mese troops. These gains have not cut 
off the flow of goods carried on ships fly-
ing the flags of our allies to North Viet-
nam. What concretely have we gained 
by the so-called peace offensive? What 
fore7gn nation that opposed the policy of 
the United States before the peace offen-
sive is now ready to endorse it? 
Mr. Speaker, all Americans earnestly, 
ardently want peace. There are no war-
hawks here. The warhawks are in Ha-
noi, Peiping, and Moscow. To attain 
peace without abject surrender of South 
Vietnam to the Communists, our enemies 
must want peace. Any reading of the 
latest Mansfield report would convince 
one that Hanoi and Peiping do not want 
peace now except under terms similar to 
the Laos agreement.

confers on the Congress the power to de-

clare war and although this Nation is in 
fact at war?as the President has said?
the Congress today finds itself unable to 
provide even useful advice to the admin-
istration because it does not know enough 
of the facts needed to form valid judg-
ments. 
For 2 years, the press has been predict-
ing a great debate in Congress on Viet-
nam. There has been none. Epithets 
such as "McNamara's war," "hawks," 
and "doves" have been heard in the Con-
gress, but little calm and reasoned de-
bate. The debate, such as it is, has gone 
on in teach-ins and demonstrations, 
often by uninformed people substituting 
publicity gimmicks for logic. 
It is time for this long-deferred debate 
to get underway in the Congress. Now, 
as policy is again changed, is the appro-
priate hour. 
Mr. Speaker, the debate will be con-
structive and informed only if it is be-
gun with a full report from the President 
clearly and specifically stating the Na-
tion's current objectives in Vietnam, re-
viewing the conduct of the war so far, 
and presenting the facts which argue for 
and against the various courses of policy 
now open to the Nation in Vietnam. 
Perhaps the debate should be stimulated 
by a new congresisonal resolution on 
Vietnam. 
The need for a report from the Presi-
dent to the Nation is clear to anyone 
who has read the report on Vietnam by 
a group of 'U.S. Senators headed by the 
distinguished majority leader of that 
body. This group made its tour of south-
east Asia and conducted its study at the 
request of the President. Its report to 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the 
Senate has been issued under the title, 
"The Vietnam Conflict: The Substance 
and the Shadow." 
Senator MANSFIELD, who has made 
several earlier trips to Vietnam, thought-
fully included in this report as an ap-
pendix the report which he and another 
group of Senators made after completing 
a similar mission 3 years ago. 
This latest Mansfield report has re-
ceived much attention in the press. Its 
conclusions have been characterized 
rightly as grim. It concludes by report-
ing: 
The situation, as it now appears, offers 
only the very slim prospect of a just set-
tlement by negotiations or the alternative 
prospect of a continuance of the conflict in 
the direction of a general war on the Asian 
mainland. 
It offers little hope of a satisfactory 
peace by negotiations and finds "the 
only visible alternative" to be "the indefi-
nite expansion and intensification of the 
war which will require continuous in-
troduction of additional U.S. forces." 
I am surprised that this somber assess-
ment has not stirred more alarm than 
it has. I am equally surprised that the 
administration has expressed no opinion 
on the conclusions of this report. If it 
Is an accurate assessment, I cannot un-
derstand the failure of the administra-
tion to alert the Nation to these grave 
dangers before they were reported by 
Senator MANSFIELD'S delegation. If it 
is an inaccurate assessment, it is incum-
bent on the administration to correct its 
errors. 
The Mansfield report, if ,sound in its 
conclusions, is a -more stinging indict-
ment of the administration than any 
which I have encountered. 
A comparison of this latest Mansfield 
report with its predecessor of 3 years ago 
indicates that substantial Communist 
gains took place between the start of 1963 
and early 1965. On February 25, 1963, 
Senator MANSFIELD offered this appraisal 
of the outlook in South Vietnam: 
Success was predicted to the group almost 
without exception by responsible Americans 
and Vietnamese, in terms of a year or two 
hence. The word "success" is not easy to de-
fine in a situation such as exists in South 
Vietnam. n would mean, at the least, a 
reduction of the guerrillas to the point where 
they would no longer be a serious threat to 
the stability of the Republic. If that point 
is reached, road and rail communications 
would once again become reasonably safe. 
Local officials would no longer live in con-
stant fear of assassination. Rice and other 
major commodities would again move in vol-
ume to the cities. Development throughout 
the nation would be feasible. In short, the 
situation in South Vietnam would become 
roughly similar to that which eventually 
emerged in Malaya, and it is significant that 
a good deal of the present planning in South 
Vietnam is based upon the Malayan experi-
ence. 
While such a situation would fall far short 
of the development of a bastion in South 
Vietnam, as the objective has been described 
on occasion, it would, nevertheless, be ade-
quate to the survival of free Vietnam. It 
would not necessarily permit any great re-
duction in U.S. aid to the Vietnamese Gov-
ernment for some years, but it would, at least, 
allow for a substantial reduction in the di-
rect support which American forces are now 
providing to Vietnamese defense. 
Although the 1963 report expresses 
some caution about the "rapid accom-
plishment" of these goals, they were 
clearly in sight. 
What a contrast is the 1966 report. It 
describes the situation in South Vietnam 
early in 1965 as "near desperate." It 
goes on to say: 
After the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, 
repeated coups had weakened the cohesive-
ness of the central authority and acted to 
stimulate public disaffection and indifference 
to the war. At the same time, there was a 
greatly accelerated military drive by 
strengthened Vietcong forces. Their control 
expanded over large areas of the country, par-
ticularly in provinces adjacent to the western 
borders. Communications and transporta-
tion between population center8 became in-
creasingly hazardous, except by Vietcong 
sufferance. In short, a total collapse of the 
Saigon government's authority appeared im-
minent in the early months of 1965. 
At present, after the commitment of 
200,000 American troops, the Mansfield 
renort declares: 
The overall control of the country remains 
about the same as it was at the beginning 
of 1965. 
Mr. Speaker, I have called this Mans-
field report an indictment of the admin-
istration. For example, during the pe-
riod when the optimistic hopes of South 
Vietnam were dashed and the situation 
became desperate, there was no frank 
statement from administration leaders 
informing the public of the disaster. 
The administration did not revise its 
prediction of October 1963 that Ameri-
can troops would be withdrawn by the 
end of 1965. The dominant theme of 
Presidential utterances was that the 
United States would not widen the war, 
and would not send American troops to 
do fighting that Asian troops should do. 
The Secretary of State assured the public 
that our plans "pointed the way to vic-
tory" and that there was "steady im-
provement" in South Vietnam. 
In January 1965, when according to 
the Mansfield group the Saigon govern-
ment was near "total collapse," the 
President delivered his state of the Union 
message assuring the Congress that 
things had improved so much on the in-
ternational scene that "today we can 
turn increased attention to the charac-
ter of American life." 
Vietnam received only 140 words in 
the 1965 state of the Union message, and 
none of them had the tone of urgency. 
This year the state of the Union mes-
sage, though wordier about Vietnam, 
was again completely devoid of any in-
formation about the progress of the war. 
In short, the administration has not 
been candid with the American people. 
When Ambassador Goldberg publicly 
acknowledges that a "crisis of credibil-
ity" hampers the administration, it is 
clear that something is seriously wrong 
with the administration's public infor-
mation program. There is nothing 
wrong, however, that candor will not 
correct. 
Let me suggest some of the questions 
to which the administration should now 
give frank answers: 
First. What facts support Secretary 
McNamara's recent statement, "We have 
stopped losing the war"? When were 
we losing it and when did the change 
take place? 
Second. How much, and in what ways, 
did the bombing of North Vietnam be-
tween February and December of 1965 
impede the military and economic ac-
tivity of the enemy? 
Third. What is the balance sheet in 
concrete terms of the peace offensive 
and the bombing pause? What advan-
tages and what losses have resulted or 
will result for the United States and 
South Vietnam? 
Fourth. To what degree are the mili-
tary and economic efforts of North Viet-
nam sustained by goods brought in by 
sea? What flags do the ships involved 
fly? 
Fifth. Would the administration agree 
to an end to hostilities on the basis of 
an agreement like that which was 
reached on Laos in 1962, giving Com-
munists a place in a coalition govern-
ment and a veto in the commission es-
tablished to supervise the execution of 
the agreement? 
Mr. Speaker, these are some of the 
questions that cry to be answered pub-
licly and authoritatively. With this in-
formation the Congress and the public 
could better judge the effectiveness and 
wisdom of past administration policy and 
aid the administration in moving wisely 
in the future. 
Unless there is a full report to the Na-
tion on Vietnam, the administration will 
find it increasingly difficult to hold the 
support and the confidence of the public.

ORD and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. WC)LFF. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
sad day indeed. 
The acknowledgement that all our ef-
forts toward peace have been of no avail, 
and that a resumption of the bombing of 
North Vietnam has been ordered, is a 
serious blow to those of us who have 
urged an exhaustive exploration of every 
possible chance for negotiations. 
However, at long last, we have overtly 
moved toward the United Nations. This 
has been the recommendation of many of 
us in Congress. As recently as 2 weeks 
ago many of my colleagues and I sent a 
letter to the President urging him to put 
this problem before the U.N. Now that 
move has been made. Let us pray that 
this international body will bring under-
standing from the chaos and that we will 
see an end to the killing and wanton de-
struction wrought by this dreadful war. 
Let us hope, as well, that all other im-
pediments to peace are swept aside and 
that all parties to the war?Pecping, 
Hanoi, the National Liberation Front, 
and South Vietnam?are brought to the 
peace table so that a lasting peace will 
ensue. For this is what we seek?a peace 
that will be secured by a mutual under-
standing that brute force and aggression 
does not solve problems, but creates 
them. 
Never before in times of adversity has 
there been as much divergence of opinion 
within our citizenry. We must insure 
that which we fought for in Vietnam--
true freedom?by enlisting the support of 
all Americans in common purpose. I 
speak for my constituency who truly seek 
peace and are concerned lest even the 
slightest avenue be overlooked. 
As an individual Member of Congress,]: 
have made three separate trips to Viet-
nam at my own expense to gather as fully 
as possible the facts necessary to sustain 
informed judgment and appraisal. I 
have attended weekly briefings by State 
and Defense Department officials and 
joined with his Holiness Pope Paul in 
calling for a Christmas truce. I have 
been in constant touch with the Presi-
dent, urging that all efforts be extended 
In exploring every possible avenue to 
peace. I have in progress a survey of the 
opinion of the residents of my district to 
guide me in representing them before the 
Congress. I have held four town meet-
ings so that the people in my district can 
directly communicate their views to me. 
There is no door closed between my con-
stituency and my office for residents to 
articulate their views in guiding me. 
This is the way it must be in a democ-
racy?and this same procedure must be 
followed between our various branches of 
Government to honestly interpret the 
views of the people of this Nation. 
I have made numerous appeals in Con-
gress and have joined my colleagues to 
bring reason to bear before precipitous 
action, just as today I am again calling 
for a concurrence and full debate by the 
House before further escalations are 
made and that the 1934 resolution passed 
by Congress is not a continuing mandate 
but one that requires constant review 
with changing circumstances and condi-
tions. For many, including myself, are

to peace. 
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION 
(Mr. DADDARIO (at the request of 
Mr. HUNGATE) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include els traneous 
matter.) ? 
Mr. DADDARIO. Mr. Speaker, during 
the past 15 months, through its Subcom-
mittee on Science, Research, and Da-
velopment, the Science and Astronautics 
Committee has conducted a review of the 
National Science Foundation. That ac-
tivity has resulted in a report entitled 
"The National Science Foundation: Its 
Present and Future," which is now sub-
mitted to this body as a House report. 
The main thrust of the report i.s sim-
ple. It is based on the premise that a 
large portion of our Nation's welfare in 
the future rests with science and tech-
nology?and that a more active and 
stronger Foundation will be necessary if 
we are to secure that welfare. 
The report itself is relatively complex 
and sophisticated, if for no other reason 
than that it is dealing with complex and 
sophisticated matters. Hence, it at-
tempts to describe some of the back-
ground of government-science relation-
ships and to highlight the current extent 
and nature of these relationships as a 
basis for its rationale. Indeed, our sub-
committee spent months in studying 
these facets before it ever began hear-
ings, and the hearings in turn were car-
ried on over a period of 7 week;. 
This is the first general legislative re-
view of the National Science Foundation 
since it was founded more than 15 years 
ago. It is natural that within that pe-
riod, during a time when there bas been 
more concentrated scientific growth than 
in any other period of our history, 
changes have occurred which demand 
our attention and compel us to close 
examination and recommendations in 
keeping with the shifting scene. 
There can be no doubt about the im-
portance of the National Science Foun-
dation in a world which looks to us for 
leadership. The Vice Presidcnt, the 
Honorable HUBERT H. HUMPHREV, placed 
this in a most succinct perspective the 
other day when he addressed the Com-
mittee's Panel on Science and Technol-
ogy. He pointed out that the exporta-
tion of knowledge and know-how was as 
important as the exportation of capital 
in relieving the critical needs of the 
the world. This is a proposition with 
which few will argue. 
We believe that this report contains 
important suggestions for strengthening 
the National Science Foundation so that 
it may fulfill its unique role in the de-
velopment and growth of knowledge. 
We face a challenge in too many fields to 
enumerate where only knowledge can 
provide solutions. 
I commend this report to my col-
leagues for their study. 
INDEPENDENT BANKERS OPPOSE 
GRAB BY CHASE MANHATTAN 
BANK TO FURTHER CENTRALIZE 
BANKING IN NEW YORK STATE 
AND FURTHER WEAKEN THE 
DUAL BANKING SYSTEM 
(Mr. PATMAN (at the request of Mr. 
HUNGATE) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, what with 
a half dozen or more giant banks in New 
York with assets exceeding $1 billion, as 
well as a long history of holding company 
operations, it is not inaccurate to say that 
banking in the State of New York is tend-
ing more and more toward superconcen-
tration and eventual monopoly. 
By at least two separate rulings from. 
his Office, Comptroller of the Currency 
Saxon has given permission for Chase 
Manhattan Bank, NA., a $11 billion 
financial behemoth, to acquire the stock 
of the Liberty National Bank & Trust Co., 
of Buffalo, itself with assets of over one-
third of a billion dollars. 
The Independent Bankers Association 
of America is opposing this shocking and 
disturbing move by Chase in the hopes 
that independent banking and free com-
petition may not be further eroded in 
New York State. 
Following is the association's brief in 
opposition to Chase Manhattan's appli-
cation under the New York holding com-
pany law:

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 
To the Banking Board of the State of New 
York: 
The Independent Bankers Association of 
America appreciates this opportunity ex-
tended by your chairman, Mr. Prank Wine, to 
present its views in this brief in opposition to 
this application. The association has a mem-
bership of more than 6,300 banks, including 
107 in New York State. 
In its 35 years of existence, the IBAA has 
stood for the preservation of competition In 
banking and against the devises which lead 
to concentration in banking. 
Our association and the Independent Bank-
ers Association of the 12th Federal Reserve 
District were active in securing enactment 
of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. 
The IBAA opposes the acquisition pro-
posed in this application became if approved 
it could become a pattern for expansion of 
the power of large banks not only in N(.'W 
York State but throughout the country. 
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS 
Section 142(1) (f) states among other fac-
tors, that "the banking board shall take into 
consideration * * * primarily, the public in-
terest and the needs and convenience there-
of." This factor would appear to exhort the 
board to view this proposal in the light of 
its impact upon banking customers, not 
merely the interest of the banks involved; 
in the light of the impact upon the economy 
of a repetition of such proposals, not merely 
the effect these may have on the banking 
structure of the future.

ever, interest rates are too high and loans too 
restrictive. We are fully in support of the 
efforts of Congressman WRIGHT PATMAN, 
chairman of the House Banking and Cur-
rency Committee, to draft legislation to give 
Congress a voice in monetary policy now in 
almost complete control of the Federal Re-

(Mr. PATMAN (at the request of Mr. 
lItiNcArE) was granted permission to ex-

REnOals and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, Federal 
Reserve Board's action raising interest 
rates on December 3 shocked the entire 
Nation. 
The people were appalled at the ability 
of a bare majority of the Federal Reserve 
to completely thumb its nose at the Presi-
dent and to take action to slow down or 
destroy much of the Great Society pro-
gram. 
Much of the dismay and deep concern 
over the Federal Reserve's arrogant ac-
tion was reflected in the Nation's press. 
Many columnists spoke out eloquently 
against the action. In particular, I 
commend to my colleagues the following 
articles from the Washington Post and 
the New York Times: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Dec. 12, 
19651 
litEn INDEPENDF.NCE WORRIED .7.F .K. 
(By Hobart Rowen) 
At the Democratic Convention in Los An-
geles in 1960, one question that worried can-
didate John F. Ketinedy's advisers was how 
can we handle Federal Reserve Chairman 
William Me.Chesney Martin if he balks at the 
New Frontier program? 
tnasmuch as the Eisenhower years had 
been dominated by Martin's tight money 
policy, the Kennedy men assumed that some 
drastic measures might be in order. 
With the brashness of Inexperience, some 
of the Kennedy "rnalia" suggested that Mar-
tin be fired, outright. Bt others in the brain 
trust evolved a more complicated and the-
oretically more practical plan for a super co-
ordinating committee, similar to the Na-
eional Security Council, which would estab-
lish a uniform economic policy. 
When publicized, the plan agitated the 
banking and business communities. But 
Mr, Kennedy abandoned this awkward 
scheme for the simple reason that Martin 
not try to run a course independent of 
the White :House. Like Mr. Kennedy's own 
economic advisers, Martin was concerned by 
eavy unemployment and idle plants. 
And while he never fostered a money 
policy as easy as Representative WR/GHT 
Parmasi would have desired he didn't return 
to the automatic tight money posture of the 
Eisenhower days. So no club was needed, 
and Martin joined amiably with three other 
key presidential advisers in what has become 
known as the "qundriad." 
All of this is relevant because the divided 
eciirse that Mr. Kennedy's advisers feared in 
lee? has finally come to pass-5 years later?
under President Johnson, The President, 
,isoligh mindful of economic factors that 
hld an inflationary potential, doesn't think 
the time has come to pat on tile brakes. 
;stertin, on the other hand, convinced by 
the opposite analysis, hns moved to tighten 
Hirmey, so as to head off inflationary prices 
"before they have become full blown and the 
damage has been done." 
The upshot is that a coordinated monetary 
and fiscal policy, so successful since 1961. is 
shattered?for the moment, anyway. 
No one yet knows what really will hap-
pen, because much will depend on just how 
much credit the Federal Reserve feeds into 
the banking system. 
The Fed can tighten up the supply of 
money by selling securities on the open mar-
ket. That drains money from the banks?
money they otherwise could lend. 
The Fed, on the other hand, can increase 
the money supply by buying securities, thus 
pumping cash into the banks. 
When the Fed raised the discount rate 
last weekend it underscored this part of 
Its announcement: "'The action contemplates, 
however, the continued provision of addi-
tional reserves to the banking system, in 
amounts sufficient to meet seasonal preseures 
as well as the credit needs of an expo riding 
economy without promoting inflationary 
pressures," 
This has been confusing to some people. 
H the Fed's game is to slow down the 
economy, why does it raise interest rates on 
the one hand, but insist that it will provide 
additional reserves? It seems, at first Mush, 
to be a meaningless exercise in which the 
amount of money remains the same?bat at 
higher coet to everyone, to the pleasure of 
no one but the banks. 
The rationale of the majority at the Fed is 
that the higher rate will choke off mine 
marginal plans for business expansion. But 
in view of the escalating Vietnam war, the 
relatively small increase in the cost of bor-
rowing isn't likely to deter many business-
men. 
A spot check of economists in Washington 
doesn't suggest that the new forecast for 
skyrocketing plant and equipment spending 
next year will be seriously affected by higher 
interest rates. 
One possible explanation for the seeming 
paradox is that bank reserves will nor. in 
reality be as ample as the Fed has promised. 
The level of additional credit needed for "an 
expanding economy" will probably be less 
by Martin's definition than it would be by 
the administration's definition. 
This is the problem that the President 
will have to consider as he resumes the 5-
year-old search for ways to box Martin in. 
I suggest hi:3 best route is through a gradual 
realine:ment of the Federal Reserve struc-
ture. 
Be might, for example, recall the 1961 
recommendation of the highly respected 
Commission on Money and Credit, which 
suggested cutting the number of FRB Gov-
ernors from seven to five, and limiting the 
term of each from 14 to 10 years, with one 
expiring every odd-numbered year. This 
would give a President a steady stream of 
his own appointments to the Board. 
The 2-year gap which now exists between 
the beginning of a presidential term and 
the 4-year term of the FRB Chairman should 
also be eliminated. (Martin himself agrees 
that it was only a legislative accident that 
failed to synchronize these terms.) What-
ever the mechanics, Ways must be found to 
coordinate the role of the central bank with 
the rest of the Government. Any other 
course makes no sense. 
[From the New York Times, Dec. 13, 19651 
WHAT ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE? 
(By /VI. J. Rossant) 
If past performance is a guide, the Join t 
Economic Committee's new investigation of 
Federal Reserve-Administration relations will 
get bogged down debating the pros and cone 
of the latest policy decision of the money 
managers, neglecting the far more impor-
tant Issue of whether the latter should be 
making their decisions independently. 
Money, of course, cannot manage itself; so 
the critical question is who should do the 
managing. At the moment the independent 
Federal Reserve has both critics and defend-
ers. There are some who disagree with what 
the money managers did but, like Voltaire, 
defend its right to have done it. There are 
others who think it did the right thing but 
deplore its acting unilaterally. 
ROLE OF THE MANAGERS 
The champions of independence for the 
Federal Reserve argue that this is the only 
way to insure sound policy. Encouraged by 
Its decision to part company at long last 
with the Johnson administration, they point 
out that continued coordination would clear-
ly have been unsound. In this view, the 
money managers must be like judges, isolated 
from politicians and political pressures in 
carrying out their responsibilities. 
The Federal Reserve is a creation of Con-
gress, but it has the right to act independ-
ently of both the legislative and executive 
branches, Yet its control over the Nation's 
money supply?Its ability to create or ex-
tinguish credit?is so powerful an economic 
weapon that it may well be too important to 
be left to the money managers. 
This was not the case in the days when 
the Federal Reserve was first established. 
Then it was responsible only for price stabili-
zation. Then too the executive branch took 
the view that it had no business interfering 
with the vagaries of the business cycle. 
Today, the Federal Reserve is committed 
to promote full employment and economic 
expansion in addition to price stability. 
What is more, the White House has respon-
sibility, as well as formidable weapons of its 
own, for maintaining prosperity. so there 
is a strong case for integrating the flexible 
restraint of monetary policy with the blunter 
weapons of fiscal policy. 
Some critics in fact call for complete coor-
dination. They do not think that the Fed-
eral Reserve should be considered as a su-
preme court of economic policy, with what 
amounts to a veto power over the party in 
power. Instead, they argue that the Presi-
dent, who is charged with formulating overall 
economic policy and is answerable to the 
electorate, must not be thwarted by a small 
group of men shielded from the public. 
During his long reign as head of the Fed-
eral Reserve, William McChesney Martin, Jr., 
has generally been prepared to compromise, 
aware that the adoption of too independent a 
position, might endanger his freedom of ac-
tion. He has often sounded as if he were at 
odds with the President, but his bark has 
been far worse than his bite. In failing to 
act as independently as he talked, Mr. Martin 
has guaranteed his own survival?and that 
of the Federal Reserve. And precisely be-
cause he has been accommodating, it is prob-
able that his present failing out of step, while 
dramatic, may be only temporary. 
THE BANK'S POWER 
Even if it is, and even if it was the right 
thing to do, the Federal Reserve has demon-
strated that it has the means to throw a 
monkey wrench into the plans of the White 
House. Many who are not on the Johnson 
administration's side, question whether such 
freedom is desirable in a democracy. 
The most potent argument against giving 
increased authority to the executive branch is 
that it would encourage inflation as it did 
after World War II, when the money man-
agers increased the money supply at the 
behest of the Treasury. 
But the Federal Reserve then was under no 
compulsion to do so. It could have refused 
to cooperate, as it finally did. Indeed there 
seems to be a far greater risk of swinging 
from defiance to subservience under its pres-
ent status than if the Federal Reserve had a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE January 31, 1966 
POLITICAL CONTROL 
With such an arrangement, the money 
managers might be less inclined to disruptive 
talk and more to effective action. If they 
were a recognized part of an economic gen-
eral staff, they might be more successful in 
making their presence felt in the inner circle 
of policymaking. 
Some authorities believe that political con-
trol might result in greater freedom for the 
Federal Reserve as well as smoother coordi-
nation of economic policies. But if It did 
not, if limiting its independence resulted in 
mere subservience on the part of the Federal 
Reserve and unsound policies for the econ-
omy, the Nation's voters would at least be 
able to fix the blame. 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Dec. 7, 
1965) 
THE PEP JUMPS TILE Gust 
By raising the discount rate in advance of 
a scheduled meeting of the Government's 
policymaking quadriad, the Federal Re-
serve Board has underscored the danger of 
investing power over monetary policy in an 
independent agency. 
There are legitimate grounds for differences 
of opinion over the need for less stimulative 
policies, as Treasury Secretary Fowler 
pointed out in his New Orleans speech. But 
inflationary pressures can be combatted by 
fiscal as well as monetary measures. What 
the Fed has done with its gun-jumping deci-
sion, taken in advance of a thorough analysis 
of next year's budget, is to deprive the ad-
ministration of the freedom that it requires 
in order to conduct an effective economic 
policy. 
If one could accept at face value the 
Board's claim that it win continue to supply 
the banking system with sufficient reserves 
to meet the needs of an expanding economy, 
the boost in the discount rate and the up-
ward drift of interest rates in the money 
markets might not be so serious. But the 
day-to-day implementation of Fed policy Is 
in the hands of the Federal Open Market 
Committee (POMC), a body that includes 
five presidents of the District Federal Reserve 
banks as well as the seven Governors of the 
Federal Reserve Board. Since the bank presi-
dents are insulated from the authority of 
both Congress and the White House, the 
FOMC is free to pursue restrictive policies 
that may be sharply at variance with the 
aims of the administration. 
President Johnson will be able to redress 
the balance on the Federal Reserve Board 
when the term of Vice Chairman Balderston 
expires in January, and a second opportunity 
will come in 2 years with the expiration of 
the partial term of Governor Daane. But 
these moves may not affect the unbridled 
power of the FOMC. 
If Congress is to discharge its constitu-
tional responsibility for controlling the 
money supply, if monetary policies are to be 
coordinated with the other economic policies 
of the Federal Government, the following 
reforms will be needed. The term of the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board 
should be made coterminous with that of the 
President, a proposal that has been endorsed 
by Chairman Martin. The inordinately long, 
14-year terms of the Governors should be re-
duced to 5. And, finally, responsiveness to 
the wishes of the electorate should be insured 
by limiting the membership of the FOMC to 
the seven appointed Governors of the Federal 
Reserve Board. 
Congress would never entertain the notion 
of delegating its fiscal power to an independ-
ent agency, and by the same logic it should 
not surrender its control over the money sup-
ply. Power over monetary policy, for better 
or worse, should be invested with the incum-
ment administration. The Board's action, 
the end of which is not yet in sight, exposes 
the pitfalls of an anomalous system in which 
the Presidents' ability to shape economic 
policy is sharply attenuated. 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Dec. 8, 
1965] 
FOXES IN L.B.J.'s HENHOUSE 
(By Rowland Evans and Robert Novak) 
Soon after Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded 
to the Presidency, he received this private 
advice from one of his most influential ad-
visers: No domestic problem will be tougher 
than controlling Bill Martin. 
The full impact of this prophecy fell last 
weekend like a sledgehammer. 
The decision of the Federal Reserve Board, 
under Chairman William McChesney Martin, 
to boost interest rates was President John-
son's worst political setback. Not only does 
further tightening of money threaten eco-
nomic expansion, but the bold defiance of 
his wishes is a severe blow to the President's 
prestige. 
This question then arises: Why could a 
President who tamed Congress, big labor and 
big business not tame Martin? 
The answer: The cherished independence 
of the Federal Reserve Bank is all but un-
assailable. Moreover, Treasury Secretary 
Henry H. Fowler's year-long strategy of ap-
peasing Martin by avoiding an open rupture 
all these months was perhaps less successful 
than a frontal assault on the Fed. 
The Federal Reserve Board?acting as the 
national bankers' bank?is a deviation in the 
otherwise symmetrical American system. 
Martin, a nonpolitician with rigidly orthodox 
economic views, need not heed the advice of 
the White House. 
But Martin does have his own constitu-
ency: The Nation's commercial bankers?or 
more specifically, the New York banking 
community. Martin has privately informed 
administration officials of the increasing 
pressure on him to tighten credit. Its 
source: Big bankers, obsessed with the bug-
aboo of inflation. 
This banker's mentality was aggressively 
articulated to Martin by Alfred Hayes, pres-
ident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York. Financial insiders regard Hayes?not 
Martin?as the grey eminence of the interest 
rate hike. And Hayes, an unabashed tight-
money man, is concerned first with bank-
ing?not the overall economic results of 
higher interest rates, such as a possible rise 
in unemployment. 
The Manhattan bankers' influence over the 
Fed is direct control over Washington's de-
cision affecting their own pocketbook. In 
the opinion of one L.B.J. adviser, this means 
the foxes are guarding the henhouse. 
Nevertheless, despite Martin's clear legal 
power, it may be argued that administration 
strategy in dealing with Martin only em-
boldened him. 
From the time he took over at the Treasury 
last March, Fowler took the soft approach. 
Last spring he tacitly acquiesced in Martin's 
reduction of bank free reserves?money held 
in excess of money loaned out (thus tighten-
ing the money supply). Treasury officials 
privately told Democratic Senators they had 
no intention of interfering with the Fed's 
regulation of the money supply. 
As recently as his November 8 appearance 
at the Economic Club of New York City, 
Fowler defended?to ringing applause of the 
conservative-oriented audience?the Fed's in-
dependence and noted that he had been 
criticized by Democratic Senators for that 
stand. 
All the while, Fowler privately urged Mar-
tin to postpone any decision on interest 
rates until the President's budget was re-
leased early next year. By that time, Mr. 
Johnson would be able to change the ideo-
logical complexion of the Reserve Board by 
filling a vacancy coming up January 1. 
Martin apparently decided early last week 
to defy the President and Treasury. Al-
though specifically asked to call the President 
before such action, he did not call. Rather, 
he was determined to raise interest rates be-
fore a scheduled meeting at the LBJ Ranch 
last Monday so that he would not have to 
say "no" to the President's personal appeal. 
As a result, Martin informed Fowler last 
Friday morning at the White House that lie 
had made up his mind. It was too late to 
stop him. The Federal Reserve Board voted 
the increase that afternoon. 
Some critics of Martin hold that since 
there was no conceiviable way for the Presi-
dent or Fowler to stop the Fed's action, they 
should have secretly agreed to the increase 
effective early next year, thus avoiding the 
political?though not the economic?defeat. 
But that avoids the real issue. The Martin 
affair again raises the question whether this 
vital economic henhouse should be guarded 
by the banking foxes of New York?or by the 
public's elected officials. 
111L" VIETNAM 
(Mr. BROWN of California (at the 
request of Mr. HUIsiGATE) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the REcoao and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. BROWN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, the President has today an-
nounced the resumption of bombing of 
North Vietnam. Many of my colleagues 
have risen to praise this decision. The 
leadership from both sides of the aisle 
here in the House have pledged their sup-
port to the President. Some voices are 
raised to call for more than just a re-
sumption of the bombing?they call for 
a vast increase in the level of bombing, 
for the hitting of Hanoi and Haiphong, 
and for the use of more powerful non-
conventional weapons. 
From all sides we hear it said that 
"The pause was a failure?the other side 
is not interested in peace." I do not wish 
to debate this point at this time. But 
those who are honest will admit that the 
previous 11 months of bombing was a 
failure. That 11-month period saw the 
United States forced to multiply its 
ground forces many times over merely to 
hold its own in South Vietnam. That 
11 months saw a substantial increase in 
the fighting forces of the National Lib-
eration Front, both from infiltration 
from the north and from local recruit-
ment in the south. That 11 months saw 
a strengthening of the will to resist the 
bombing in North Vietnam, and an in-
crease in the assistance coming from 
other countries. More than anything 
else, that 11 months saw the end of any 
fiction that we were merely helping sup-
port and maintain a friendly govern-
ment, and made it clear that the United 
States was waging an American war to 
show the world that the American man-
date runs wherever the President of the 
United States says it runs, including the 
mainland of Asia. 
To resume the bombing, after this 11 
months of failure to achieve any con-
structive results with such a policy, 
demonstrates again and more forcefully 
the sterility of the U.S. position in 
Vietnam. 
I feel the deepest sorrow for the Presi-
dent, that he feels compelled within him-
self to take this course, for I know that 
he would do what was right. I feel even 
more sorrow for the American people, 
and for the people of Vietnam. There 
comes a point of no return in the course 
of events, and we may well have reached 
that point in Asia. We may now be com-
mitted to a course leading to the death of

millions and the destruction a any hope 
for a new order of law and justice in the 
world in our lifetimes. 
I do not believe in the imminent arrival 
of an ideal world. I do not think that 
the time has come in human history 
when force as an element in human rela-
tionships can be eliminated. But I know 
as certainly as I know anything in this 
life that the United States cannot achieve 
any worthwhile goal from the course it 
is pursuing in Vietnam. It can and will 
bring untold suffering to all of Vietnam. 
It can and probably will deny South Viet-
nam to communism, if it wishes to oc-
cupy that country with hundreds of 
thousands of troops for generations to 
come. It can and probably will spend 
$50 or $100 billion to do these things-
billions that could be used to solve the 
problems of this country and the world, 
instead of making them worse. 
And in doing these things we will 
weaken democracy and strengthen the 
totalitarian tendencies of our own so-
ciety, we will condemn American impe-
rialism in the eyes of all Asia, we will 
strengthen the ideological power of com-
munism around the world, we will weaken 
still further the ties of the western 
alliance. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons I can-
not join in the chorus of praise we have 
heard here today for the President's de-
cision to resume the bombing of North 
Vietnam. I think that he has made a 
tragic mistake. And I think that time is 
running out for the President to correct 
the mistakes this country has made in 
Vietnam over the past 15 years.

Senate 
MONDAY, JANUARY 31, 1966 
(Legislative day of Wednesday. January 26, 1966) 
The Senate met at 10 o'clock a.m., on 
the expiration of the recess, and was 
called to order by the Acting President 
pro tempore (Mr. METCALF) . 
Rev. Edward B. Lewis, pastor, Capitol 
Hill Methodist Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Dear Lord of all, we recognize today 
that the peace we seek for the world is 
beyond our understanding. Thus, we 
need Thy help. 
We have not consistently followed the 
path of peace. Now we find ourselves 
with others in the world in the wilderness 
of bewilderment in finding again that 
path. We come to Thee in prayer asking 
for light in darkness and courage in the 
? principle of freedom and justice for all 
men. 
We pray for Thy guiding and staying 
hand in the deliberations and decisions of 
our President, his Cabinet, his advisers, 
and especially this session of the Senate 
of the United States on national and in-
ternational issues. 
Give to our leaders hope that will keep 
alive negotiations for peace, faith that 
there is a way, and love for God and man-
kind that will clarify thinking and 
decision. 
We pray in the name of the Creator of 
life and peace. Amen.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the SenatOr from Vermont yield, with-
out losing his right to the floor, so that 
I may ask unanimous consent, with the 
concurrence of the distinguished acting 
minority leader, the Senator from Ne-
braska [Mr. Corms], to suggest a recess 
until 10:30 o'clock, at which time the 
Senator from Vermont would have the 
floor. 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, I intended 
to ask if I might proceed for 7 or 8 min-
utes for a discussion on current events 
after the Senate reconvened. I make 
that request. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, the Senator 
from Vermont will have the floor for 7 
or 8 minutes when the Senate recon-
venes. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. That will be for 7 
or 8 minutes.

ing the right to object?
Mr. MANSFIELD. We shall return 
after the recess, because the Senator

of routine business.

tana. 
Mr. ER'VIN. Mr. President, do I cor-
rectly understand that the request for 
the morning hour is merely for the pur-
pose of making statements? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. To have a morning 
hour for the purpose of allowing Sena-
tors to make speeches, and matters of 
that kind. 
Mr. ERVIN. And that no motions will 
be made? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is 
correct. 
ROBERT G. THOlVIPSON 
Mr, HART. Mr. President, will the 
distinguished Senator from Vermont 
yield to me for a moment, to permit me 
to insert an editorial in the RECORD? 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, without 
losing my right to the floor, I am glad 
to yield to the Senator from Michigan 
for the purpose of inserting an editorial 
in the RECORD. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD an editorial entitled, "Be-
yond Death," published in yesterday's 
Washington Post. 
I underscore nothing in the editorial; 
It speaks eloquently and to the point. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
BEYOND DEATH 
When mortal men consider their own 
frailty and folly, they may well conclude that 
death ought to bring its own absolution for 
even the sorriest of sins. The pursuit of 
punishment beyond the grave is mere vin-
dictiveness. We think the majesty of the 
United States is marred by the decision of 
the Defense Department to forbid the inter-
ment of Robert G. Thompson's ashes in Ar-
lington National Cemetery. 
Good men and bad men alike lie at rest 
In Arlington. Men of every faith?and of 
no faith?slumber there. In this cemetery, 
created on the estate of Robert E. Lee, there 
is, as indeed there should be, a Confederate 
Monument, erected by the Daughters of the 
Confederacy in honor of the South's dead 
heroes?men who believed it honorable and 
right to take up arms against the United 
States. And there rests there, too, in hon-
ored glory?whether in life he had been 
valiant or craven?an American soldier 
known but to God. 
Robert Thompson was a Communist when 
he was inducted into the Armed Forces early 
in the Second World War. He was a Com-
munist when he was awarded the Distin-
guished Service Cross for valor in the Pacific 
and when he was honorably discharged from 
service. He was a Communist when he died 
last October. It can be said in his behalf 
that he made no effort to conceal the fact. 
It is true that in 1949, he and 10 other 
Communist Party leaders were convicted un-
der the Smith Act and sentenced to 3 years 
In prison and that he jumped bail and was 
subsequently sentenced to an additional 4 
years for criminal contempt. On the basis 
of these sentences and the fact that a year 
ago an Army regulation was adopted denying 
burial in a national cemetery to anyone sen-
tenced by a Federal court to more than 5 
years imprisonment, the Attorney General 
has given the Defense Department a petti-
fogging legal justification for its act of empty 
meanness. Thompson was punished in life; 
there is no point to punishing him in death.

1494 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE 
RECESS UNTIL 10:30 O'CLOCK A.M. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
nOre. Does the Senator from Montana 
renew his request for a recess? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
renew my request that the Senate stand 
in recess until 10:30 o'clock a.m. 
The motion was agreed to; and at 10 
o'clock and 4 minutes a.m. the Senate 
took a recess until 10:30 o'clock a.m. 
today. 
At 10 o'clock and 30 minutes am., on 
the expiration of the recess, the Senate 
reconvened, when called to order by the 
Acting President pro tempore. 
THE JOURNAL 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Vermont yield to me 
without losing his right to the floor? 
Mr. AIKEN. Without losing my right 
to the floor, I yield to the Senator from 
Montana. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, do 
I correctly understand that the Journal 
is considered as read and approved? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator is correct. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, do 
I correctly understand that permission 
has been granted that when the Senate 
finishes its business today, it will stand in 
recess until 10 o'clock tomorrow morn-
ing? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, if 
the Senator from Vermont will permit me 
to do so, without losing his right to the 
floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum, 
the time for the quorum call not to ex-
ceed 2 minutes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Will the Senator withhold that 
request for a moment? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Yes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. The Chair announces that the 
unanimous-consent request for routine 
business has now been granted without 
objection. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem.. 
pore. Under the previous agreement, 
the order for the quorum call is re-
scinded, and the Senator from Vermont 
is recognized. 
THE RESUMPTION OF BOMBING 
IN VIETNAM 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, President 
Johnson has now directed a renewal and 
possible increase in the bombing of North 
Vietnam. 
Under the constitutional and statutory 
powers vested in the Presidency he has 
authority to do this. 
Even if 90 percent of the American 
people were opposed, he would still have 
this power. 
Now that the decision has been made 
to engage in an expanded military ac-
tion which may ultimately lead to a con-
filet of unprecedented and unlimited pro-
portions, we must spare no effort to avoid 
defeat and to hold our losses to a mini-
mum. 
Although the Communist countries ap-
parently gave little credence to the recent 
peace offensive of the President, there is 
no question in my mind that President 
Johnson did earnestly desire to put an 
end to the war in southeast Asia. 
Any person in his position wants to 
be liked and admired as well as to earn 
a good spot in history. 
He wants to be highly respected by the 
rest of the world and, as President Eisen-
hower so ably demonstrated in 1953, the 
surest way to popular acclaim is through 
the restoration of peace. 
President Eisenhower fur her en-
hanced his popularity and secured an 
enviable place in history when he backed 
Gen. Matthew Ridgway in Ins opposi-
tion to sending large numbers of U.S. 
troops into Vietnam in an effort to make 
secure that part of their colonial empire 
for the French. 
Since we now seem to have passed the 
point of no return, we should take a good, 
hard look at the situation as it is today. 
The number of U.S. servicemen sup-
porting the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment has now increased to about 200,000, 
will be doubled within the next few 
months, and it will likely be redoubled 
within the next year. 
This figure is exclusive of the Navy and 
other forces based at Guam, in the 
Philippines, in Thailand, in Honolulu, 
and elsewhere. 
It is exclusive of the 16,000 to 18,000 
South Korean troops engaged in the con-
flict. 
Aside from the forces from South Ko-
rea and Australia, we can look for only 
minor assistance from other countries in 
our Vietnam efforts. 
In fact, if South Korea is now being 
infiltrated by Communist operators to 
the extent recently indicated by Marine 
Gen. Wallace Greene, it is unlikely that 
we can look for any substantial increase 
in our strength from that source. 
Most of the land area in South Viet-
nam has come under Vietcong; control, 
while U.S. bases are all virtually under a 
state of siege?an unorthodox siege, it is 
true, but, nevertheless, one effective 
enough so that it is hardly safe to ven-
ture outside the fortified arms except in 
force. 
Our forces have to date suffered ap-
proximately 10,000 casualties. 
Some who a year ago supported the de-
cision to bomb North Vietnam. now feel 
that the reason this operation failed is 
that it has not been vigorous enough. 
They now insist that Hanoi and Hai-
phong Harbor and other than strictly 
military targets be also bombed. 
Some substantial and respected per-
sons have advocated the use of atom 
bombs?small ones, that is The other 
day a representative of a respected and 
well-known national organization came 
to my office to urge the use of atom bombs 
in the Vietnam war. The demand that 
we use atomic weapons will increase as 
our casualty lists grow. 
Regardless of the fact that an atom 
bomb could not distinguish between bel-
ecI.gof-Releese-2,00?0101713@ar,e+ALR011'e7' 
January 31, 1966 
ligerents and nonbelligerents, is there 
any reason to doubt that, should we use 
the atomic weapon against North Viet-
nam, that the Communists would almost 
at once retaliate by using the same type 
of weapon against our air and military 
bases in the south? 
We should think long and hard before 
resorting to nuclear weapons in south-
east Asia. 
We are now at the point where we have 
to deal with realities, not desires. 
It is no longer possible for us unilater-
ally to call the shots. 
It is not what might have been or what 
ought to be that now concerns us. It is 
what is. 
As indicated by the Mansfield mission 
report, there is "only the very slim pros-
pect of a just settlement by negotiations." 
Since much of the world has regarded 
the bombing of North Vietnam as "ag - 
gression" by the United States and since 
the assistance by the North Vietnamese 
to the Vietcong in carrying out their 
savage operations against the people of 
South Vietnam have been minimized, I 
believe that the President's peace offen-
sive was necessary even though its effec-
tiveness as a means for ending the war 
may be questioned. 
It seems to have convinced some na-
tions of the justice of our assistance to 
South Vietnam, even though they are 
unable or unwilling to assist us. 
Who is making the decisions in south-
east Asia today? Is it Russia or China? 
The reaction of Russia to the Presi-
dent's plea for peace has been particu-
larly disappointing. 
From her attitude one might well con-
clude that Russia not only does not de-
sire peace but actually seeks to encourage 
a greater war in southeast Asia, evidently 
hoping that we will concentrate such a 
large part of our Armed Forces there that 
the defenses of democracy will be weak-
ened in other parts of the world. 
Or is China undertaking to shape 
events so that the two great nuclear 
states will ultimately destroy each other, 
leaving the Chinese Republic the domi-
nant power in world affairs? 
Actually the tiny nation of North 
Vietnam appears to be the catalyst 
which is welding the two great Commu-
nist nations together for military 
purposes. 
I trust that those who make the de-
cisions for our country will hear in mind 
that while the war of democracy versus 
communism cannot be won in southeast 
Asia, it can be lost there. 
In fact, communism will not be de-
feated on the battlefield anyway except 
on the battlefield of men's minds. 
If any phase of the conflict between 
these two ideologies must be fought with 
arms, we should not let our enemies 
choose the battleground. 
From now on our No. 1 concern must 
be the preservation of the United States 
and its institutions. 
There can be no halfhearted effort 
In this respect. 
Our people, regardless of whether or 
not they support the acts of this admin-
istration, must be prepared for extraor-
dinary sacrifice. 
Approved For Release 2006/11/06: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010002-4 
January 31, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the distin-
guished Senator from Vermont may 
have as much time as he may desire, and 
that the time be extended to allow other 
Senators to participate in discussing this 
most momentous speech. 
Mr. AIKEN. I thank the majority 
leader. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, this sac-
rifice will have to be paid in terms of 
resources, freedom, and life itself. 
There may be a chance that a world 
nuclear war can be avoided. 
There may be a chance that we may 
escape the devastating effect of a gen-
eral land war in Asia, the kind of war 
we are least likely to win. 
We cannot proceed on the hope for 
miracles, however, therefore, we must be 
prepared for the worst?and without 
delay. 
President Johnson has asked for some 
$13 billion with which to increase the 
tempo of the war in Vietnam. 
This $13 billion is only the first drop 
in the bucket. 
Commonsense and experience should 
tell us that. 
The President asks us to rescind the 
tax cut on telephone charges and auto-
mobiles in order to help to meet this 
cost. 
It is ridiculous to expect that the in-
come from these recisions would even 
begin to pay the cost of an escalated 
war. 
If President Johnson means busi-
ness?and I believe he does?he will ask 
for the suspension of the General Tax 
Reduction Act of 2 years ago. 
He will ask to have the loopholes of 
overgenerous deductions and special tax 
privileges plugged. 
And he will ask for such new taxes 
as may be necessary. 
There is no sense in waiting until after 
election to recommend the inevitable. 
Lives are more precious than votes. 
Secretary of Defense McNamara asks 
for an increase of 113,000 men in the 
Armed Forces. 
Whom does he think he is kidding? 
Winning a guerrilla war requires a ra-
tio of 10 to 1 on the side of the law, and 
the enemy already has 200,000 men in 
the field. 
The Secretary knows that an escalated 
war will require universal conscription. 
To wait until after election to an-
nounce this is just another attempt to lull 
the people. 
Besides increased taxation and con-
scription, we must be prepared to accept 
the concentration of powers and restric-
tions on our liberties which inevitably 
accompany any major war. 
We must be prepared to accept these 
controls for an indefinite number of 
years. 
Are we ready to accept a system of pri-
orities?price controls and wage con-
trols? 
What about ration cards? 
Are we prepared to control hoarding 
which may already be underway? 
No. 15-4 
Are our shelters adequate to insure the 
perpetuation of at least a part of our pop-
ulation in the event of a nuclear war? 
Have we the facilities necessary for the 
control of sabotage, subversion, riots, 
and criminal law violations? 
We do not like to contemplate these 
things; yet they must be considered and 
acted upon unless the danger is far less 
than it now appears. 
This time we cannot wait until catas-
trophe strikes. 
So long as there is the slightest chance 
for peace, we should pursue it, even while 
preparing for the worst, but we must pre-
pare. . 
Since the Vietnam war began to esca-
late rapidly 3 years ago, I have re-
peatedly tried to make clear my belief 
that a major war would have disastrous 
results for the United States either mili-
tarily or in the loss of personal liberty 
at home. 
Although I have at all times recog-
nized the responsibilities of the United 
States to the people of South Vietnam, I 
never for an instant regarded my vote 
for the concurrent resolution of August 
1964 as a vote to give the President au-
thority to wage war at will in southeast 
Asia. 
I opposed as strongly as I could the 
start of a new war in North Vietnam. 
And I believe the President has erred 
In taking new steps which may lead to a 
cataclysmic world conflict. 
It appears, however, that my voice has 
been ineffective and that the President 
has decided to take such steps. 
The most that is left to me now is the 
hope that the President is right and that 
I have been wrong. 
If, through the renewed action for 
which he assumes responsibility, the war 
can be brought to a quick and satisfac-
tory ending, I will gladly admit the error 
of my judgment and be among the first to 
render him acclaim. 
To this end, it is my purpose to support 
his request for higher taxes and for such 
controls over the American economy as 
may seem necessary to hold our losses 
to a minimum and to enhance the pros-
pects for ultimate victory. 
To divide our Nation in this time of 
crisis would be to court certain disaster. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. AIKEN. I yield. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Once again, the 
distinguished Senator from Vermont has 
performed a public service. I say "once 
again" because that has been his forte 
down through the years, regardless of the 
issue which was being discussed. 
There has been a good deal of refer-
ence in the press in late months to the 
categories of the dove and the hawk. 
Personally, I do not pay too much atten-
tion to those designations. What I think 
the Senator from Vermont typifies and 
personifies, if I may use the word, is the 
owl. He is the wise man, the man who 
looks ahead, the man who is unswerving 
in his support of the United States, but 
who is also aware of the dangers which 
confront us in any given situation. 
Before I comment on the distinguished 
Senator's speech, I should like to read a 
1495 
statement which I made this morning be-
fore the Senate convened. The statement 
reads as follows: 
The President has weighed the arguments, 
considered the alternatives, and made his de-
cision. He had counseled with the leader-
ship on a number of occasions on this matter 
and requested our views, which were frank-
ly given and fairly considered by him. 
On the basis of his constitutional responsi-
bility, the President has acted. He has my 
sympathy and understanding, and I will do 
my best to support him to the best of my 
ability. I fully appreciate the difficulty and 
the agony of the decisions which was his?
and his alone?to make. 
I listened to a portion of his broadcast 
to the people this morning, and I was 
pleased and impressed with his statement 
that he had instructed Ambassador Ar-
thur Goldberg, a real "owl," to take this 
matter of peaceseeking to the U.N. Se-
curity Council. I applaud him for so 
doing. 
I was also impressed by his reference 
to Pope Paul's appeal for neutral arbitra-
tion and his interest in the proposal of 
the Holy Father. 
I would suggest also that it could not 
be out of tune at this time, or at any time, 
to ask the two cochairmen of the Geneva 
Convention the Soviet Union and the 
United Kingdom?to try once again to 
get together so that this agreement, this 
meeting first set up in 1954, and then in 
the Laotian crisis in 1962, this grouping 
of States, be once again reconvened. 
I know that this has had and still has 
the full support of the present adminis-
tration. 
The Senator from Vermont has men-
tioned something about the possibility of 
nuclear activity. The very use of the 
word "nuclear" makes me shudder, and I 
hope that those who are in favor of the 
use of such weapon?and unfortunately 
there have been some who have so 
stated?will not be taken too seriously, 
because I do not believe such advocacy 
represents the feelings of the adminis-
tration, of Congress, or the American 
people, nor does it, for that matter, rep-
resent the feelings of the peoples of the 
world. 
Last week I also heard the figure "600,-
000 Americans in Vietnam" being used 
by a Member of this body in an address 
which he made before an audience in his 
home State. Today the distinguished 
Senator from Vermont [Mr. Arum] has 
raised the figure to the vicinity of 800,-
000. I think he gave a very good break-
down of the number of Americans now in 
Vietnam, the number of Americans be-
ing used by the 7th Fleet, the number 
of Americans stationed in Thailand, and, 
inferentially, at least, the number of 
Americans on the way. He also pointed 
out that when we fight a guerrilla war, 
we must have a ratio in the vicinity of 
10 to 1. I have seen figures as high as 15 
to 1 and as low as 5 to 1. What the exact 
figure is I do not believe anyone is in a 
position to know at this time, because it 
seems that the ratio differs with the cir-
cumstances and the needs requisite at 
a particular moment. 
The distinguished Senator from Ver-
mont also referred to other possibilities 
inherent in an Asia land war. He men-

tioned General Ridgway, one of the out-
standing soldiers in the history of this 
country, a man who follows well in the 
tradition of Gen. George Marshall. He 
did not mention, however, General Mac-
Arthur, who is quoted as saying that the 
only way to win is through victory, and 
who also said what the difficulties would 
be if we were engaged in a land war in 
Aria. 
should like to read a brief comment 
ine de by General Ridgway when he was 
ecnimander of the 8th Army in Korea 
at the time the truce negotiations were 
under way. 
The American people must realize the need 
for infinite patience. There will be no im-
mediate, final solution. The American peo-
ple must learn to accept a solution that 
reflects reality. In the world of today we 
must maintain an equilibrium of force so 
that none of them become destructive. A 
modus vivendi must be found for people who 
were put on earth to live, and a way must be 
found to enable them to exist side by side 
without being at one another's throats. It 
can be done. 
May I take this occasion, if the Senator 
will allow me to do so, to express my 
wholehearted sympathy and support for 
the efforts, covering 37 days, made by the 
President of the United States to seek 
an avenue or a door to the negotiating 
table. 
think T probably know Lyndon John-
son as well as any other Member of this 
body knows him. I have been closely as-
sociated with him for 24 years. I know 
how deeply concerned he is about Viet-
nam. I know the agonizing days and 
nights he goes through. I know of his 
intense desire to bring this most difficult 
of all situations which has ever faced an 
American President to some sort of hon-
orable conclusion. 
believe that President Johnson faces 
today, and has faced over the past sev-
eral months, difficulties far exceeding 
those faced by President Wilson at the 
Lime of the First World War, far exceed-
ing those faced by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt at the time of the Second 
World War, and far exceeding those 
faced by President Harry Truman at the 
time of the Korean war. 
This is a most serious situation, and 
I applaud the President for the many 
avenues he has sought and tried, for the 
many doors on which he has knocked, for 
the many times he has had conversa-
tions and conferences, for sending am-
bassadors over the world and for the 
instructions which he gave to the am-
bassadors?all to try to bring this sit-
uation to the conference table so that a 
satisfactory solution and conclusion 
might be reached. 
It is therefore no fault of the Presi-
dent, as the distinguished Senator from 
Vermont has said, that these attempts 
have failed over the past 37 days. He has 
tried. He is concerned deeply. I do not 
think it is so much a matter of his place 
in history as it is a matter of finding a 
way by which he can, under honorable 
conditions, bring this most difficult con-
frontation to a satisfactory conclusion. 
The American people must know the 
truth. They must know the potential in-
volved in southeast Asia. They must be 
Im.PIRIORIIIIMMMterter,111.01,9,,Mennw, 
made to know all of its ramifications. 
We in the Senate, regardless of our views, 
whether we are called doves, hawks, or 
owls, have a responsibility. That re-
sponsibility is being lived up to, and I am 
sure it will be lived up to even more in the 
future. 
This is a grave time for the Nation, and 
It is a grave time for the President, who, 
under the Constitution, has this awesome 
responsibility. He cannot shove the buck 
to us. He knows that. He knows that, 
in the final analysis, there L3 only one 
man in this Republic who can make the 
decision. He is subjected to that respon-
sibility as Commander in Chief of the 
Armed Forces of the Republic and as 
President of the United States of 
America. 
I. repeat: So far as the Senator from 
Montana is concerned, he will do his very 
best to give the President of the United 
States as much in the way of support as 
he possibly can. 
I thank and commend the distin-
guished Senator from Vermont for laying 
out what he thinks should be done and 
for making the Senate?both sides of the 
Senate?more aware of the difficulties in-
herent in the situation which faces us 
and by making it known, in his simple, 
Logical manner, to the American people, 
as well. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that there may be inserted at the appro-
priate point in the RECORD the statement 
made by the President of the United 
States today, a statement male by Sec-
retary Rusk at his news conference today, 
and a letter to the President of the Unit-
ed Nations Security Council from Arthur 
J. Goldberg, the American Ambassador to 
the United Nations, requesting that an 
urgent meeting of the Security Council 
be called promptly to consider the situa-
tion in Vietnam. 
There being no objection, the state-
ments were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT BY THE PRESTUENT 
My fellow Americans, for 37 days, no 
bombs fell on North Vietnam. During that 
time we have made a most intense and de-
termined effort to enlist the help and sup-
port of all the world to persuade the govern-
ment in Hanoi that peace is better than war, 
that talking is better than fightfig? and that 
the road to peace is open. Our effort has 
met with understanding aml support 
throughout most of the world? but not in 
Hanoi and Peiping. From those two capitals 
have come only denunciation and rejection. 
In these 37 days, the efforts ef our allies 
have been rebuffed. The efforts of neutral 
nations have come to nothing We have 
sought without success to learn of any re-
sponse to efforts made by the governments of 
Eastern Europe. There has been no answer 
to the enlightened efforts of the Vatican. 
Our own direct private approaches have been 
in vain. The answer of Hanoi to all is the 
answer that was published 3 days ago?they 
persist in aggression, and they insist on the 
surrender of South Vietnam to communism. 
It is plain that there is no readiness to 
talk?no readiness for peace?in that regime 
today. 
And what is plain in words is also plain in 
acts. Throughout these 37 days?even at 
moments of truce?there has been continued 
violence against the people of South Viet-
nam, against their government, against their 
soldiers, and against our own American 
forces. 
prI5Vetirlar"'"PM' St9"200fIlt 
'LRDFT7 
January 31, 1966 
We do not regret the pause in the bombing. 
We yield to none in our determination to 
seek peace. We have given a full and decent 
respect to the opinions of those who thought 
that such a pause might give new hope for 
peace. Some said 10 days might do it. 
Others said 20. Now we have paused for 
twice the time suggested by some who urged 
it. Now the world knows more clearly than 
ever before who insists on aggression aid 
who works for peace. 
The Vietnamese, American and allied 
troops that are engaged in South Vietnam?
with increasing strength and increasing suc-
cess?want peace, I am sure, as much as any 
of us here at home. But while there is no 
peace, they are entitled to the full support 
of American strength and American deter-
mination. We will give both. 
As constitutional Commander in Chief I 
have?as I must?given proper weight to the 
judgment of those responsible for counsel-
ing with me: the Secretary of State, the 
Secretary of Defense, my national security 
adviser, and America's professional military 
men represented by the Joint Chiefs of Stiff. 
These advisers tell me that if continued im-
munity is given to all that supports North 
Vietnam aggression, the cost in lives?Viet-
namese, American, and allied?will only be 
greatly increased. In the light of the words 
and actions of the government in Hanoi, 
It is our clear duty to do what we can to limit 
these costs. 
So on this Monday morning in Vietnam, at 
my direction?after consultation and agree-
ment with the Government of South Viet-
nam?U.S. aircraft have resumed action in 
North Vietnam They struck lines of supply 
which support the continuing movement of 
men and arms against the people and Gov-
ernment of South Vietnam. 
Our air strikes on North Vietnam from the 
beginning, have been aimed at military Ix r-
gets and controlled with great care. These 
who direct and supply the aggression have 
no claim to immunity from military reply. 
The end of the pause does not mean the 
end of our own pursuit of peace. That pur-
suit will be as determined and unremittiog 
as the pressure of our military strength on 
the field of battle. In our continuing pur-
suit of peace, I have instructed Ambassador 
Goldberg to ask for an immediate meeting of 
the United Nations Security Council. He 
will present a full report on the situation 
In Vietnam and a resolution which can open 
the way to the conference table. This report 
and this resolution will be responsive to tae 
spirit of the renewed appeal of Pope Paul; 
that appear has our full sympathy. 
I have asked Secretary Rusk to meet with 
representatives of the press later this rnor a-
ing, to give to the country and to the world 
a comprehensive account of the diplomatic 
effort conducted in these last 5 weeks In our 
continuing policy of peace and freedom for 
South Vietnam. 
SECRETARY RUSK'S NEWS CONFERENCE OE 
JANUARY 31,19E16 
(NomE.?The following is the State Depart-
ment's release of Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk's news conference, which is authorized 
for direct quotation:) 
Secretary Rusx. Earlier this morning Pres-
ident Johnson confirmed that U.S. aircraft 
have resumed action against the lines of com-
munication which support the continuing 
movement of men and arms against the peo-
ple and Government of South Vietnam. 
I wish ter summarize for you the unprece-
dented diplomatic effort of the past 40 days?
an effort aimed at peace?and the tragically 
negative response from Hanoi. To under-
stand the full import of the past 40 days you 
must recall the months and years of unre-
mitting effort by the United States and others 
to achieve peace in southeast Asia.

January 31, 1966 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1497 
We had no assurance at Christmas time 
that a suspension of the bombing of North 
Vietnam would move us closer to peace. 
Hanoi had refused to come to the Security 
Council of th United Nations in August 1964, 
in response to an invitation initiated in the 
Council by the Soviet Union. A call by 17 
nonalined nations for negotiations without 
preconditions had been harshly rejected by 
Hanoi, as was President Johnson's call for 
unconditional discussions at Baltimore last 
April. A Commonwealth committee had been 
rebuffed. The Secretary General of the U.N. 
had not been permitted-to visit Hanoi and 
Peiping. Suggestions by the President of 
India were denounced. The machinery of 
the Geneva conferences was parlyzed by 
Hanoi's recalcitrance. Contacts with Hanoi 
and Peiping had failed to disclose a serious 
interest in peace. A pause in the bombing 
last May had yielded only a polemical 
rejection. 
Nevertheless, the President decided, on the 
advice of myself and his other senior ad-
visers, and in agreement with the Govern-
ment of Vietnam to extend the Christmas 
pause for a further period. He did so be-
cause of America's strong preference for peace 
in southeast Asia, a desire which takes into 
full account the decades of suffering and 
violence inflicted upon the people of Vietnam. 
He did so because a number of governments, 
including a number Of Communist govern-
ments, had insisted that a suspension of the 
bombing would create a situation in which 
the possibilities of peace could be greatly 
Improved. He did so because there was un-
necessary confusion at home and abroad 
about where the responsibility lies for the 
absence of peace?or even of discussions or 
negotiations about the possibility of peace. 
Shortly after Christmas, therefore, we were 
in touch with all the governments of the 
world, more than 115 of them, as well as with 
his Holiness the Pope, the Secretary General 
of the United Nations, the North Atlantic 
Council of NATO, the Organization of Amer-
ican States, the Organization of African 
Unity, and the International Committee of 
the Red Cross. Six special Presidential en-
voys visited 34 capitals and personal com-
munications from the President went to the 
chiefs of government of many more. 
Hanoi was informed at an early stage of 
the suspension of the bombing. They were 
told that no decision had been made regard-
ing a resumption of bombing and that if 
Hanoi would reciprocate by making a serious 
contribution toward peace, it would obvi-
ously have a favorable effect on the possi-
bility of further extending the suspension. 
There was no ultimatum, in word or in fact, 
but rather an invitation to move toward 
peace. All governments were reminded of 
the far-reaching suggestions which the 
United States had made about the possibili-
ties of peace, suggestions which were sum-
marized in the so-called 14 points. It was 
made clear that, as far as we were concerned, 
there could be a conference, less formal dis-
cUssions, or private and tentative contacts 
through the most discreet channels. 
We know that many governments, includ-
ing Communist governments, were active 
during this period and that our own direct 
and indirect contacts were strongly rein-
forced from many capitals. We were in 
touch with most governments several times 
during this period. 
It is with genuine regret that I must re-
port that the response has been negative, 
harsh, and unyielding. Channels which had 
been opened by us, one after the other, 
yielded no move toward peace. Throughout 
the period since Christmas, Hanoi and Peip-
ing denounced our efforts toward peace with 
a continuing barrage of such epithets as 
"fraud," "trick," "deceit," "swindle," "hoax," 
"farce." The negative attitudes of Hanoi and 
the liberation front have been clarified in 
the last few days in an unmistakable fash-
ion. Ho Chi Minh in letters addressed to a 
number of heads of state stated: "If the 
United States really wants peace it must rec-
ognize the NFL SV as the sole genuine rep-
resentative of the people of South Vietnam 
and engage in negotiations with it." In a 
statement released just yesterday, the front 
itself said, "All negotiations with the U.S. 
imperialists at this moment are entirely 
useless if they still refuse to withdraw from 
South Vietnam their troops and all kinds of 
war materials." 
But they made clear their negative view 
by deeds as well as words throughout the 
period of suspension of bombing. Infiltra-
tions of men and materials from the north 
into South Vietnam continued at a high 
level. Acts of violence in South Vietnam 
itself continued with relatively minor fluc-
tuations at virtually the same record high 
levels set in the last quarter of 1965. By 
these acts they made it entirely clear that 
their purpose remained what it has been 
from the beginning?namely, to take over 
South Vietnam by force. 
It has been necessary, therefore, for us to 
meet our responsibilities to our commit-
ments to South Vietnam and the South Viet-
namese people. I joined with other senior 
advisers to the President to recommend to 
him that he resume the necessary military 
action to support the South Vietnamese and 
allied forces and to meet the aggression from 
the north. 
This does not mean that, as far as we are 
concerned, the search for peace will stop. 
Far from it. The President told you this 
morning that the matter is being presented 
to the Security Council of the United Na-
tions. I will add that the other processes of 
diplomacy will continue in full operation, 
publicly and privately, directly and indi-
rectly, in order that any possibility of peace 
can be explored and tested. 
It is passible that one of the obstacles to 
peace has been a failure on the part of Hanoi 
to understand that the United States will in 
fact meet its commitment. It is not easy 
for a democracy such as ours to prevent such 
a basic miscalculation on the part of a total-
itarian regime. If they are relying upon a 
military victory in the south, they must 
abandon that hope. If they are relying on 
international opinion to divert the United 
States from its commitment, they must rec-
ognize that the world community does not 
support theiv aggression. If they are relying 
upon domestic differences among us to save 
their cause, they must understand that that 
will not occur. The way to shorten this war 
is to make it very clear to Hanoi that the 
course upon which they are embarked is 
futile and that if they are prepared to sit 
down and talk like reasonable men, answers 
can be found which will relieve both them-
selves and their brothers in the south-of the 
violence of which there has been more than 
enough. 
JANUARY 31, 1966. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: -I have the honor to 
request that an urgent meeting of the 
Security Council be called promptly to con-
sider the situation in Vietnam. 
As you know, the U.S. Government has, 
time and time again, patiently and tirelessly 
sought a peaceful settlement of this conflict 
on the basis of unconditional negotiations 
and the Geneva Accords of 1954. We have 
done so both inside and outside the United 
Nations. 
In President Johnson's letter of July 28, 
1965, to the Secretary General, in my letter of 
July 30, 1965, to the President of the Security 
Council, and in my letter of January 4, 1966, 
to the secretary General, we appealed for 
whatever help in ending the conflict the 
Security Council and its members or any 
other organ of the United Nations might be 
able to give. We have also been in constant 
touch with the Secretary General in order to 
keep him fully informed and to seek his 
counsel and assistance. A great number of 
U.N. members, acting jointly or separately, 
have with our earnest encouragement sought 
to find a means of moving the conflict from 
the battlefield to the conference table. 
As you are also aware, because my Govern-
ment was advised by many others that a 
pause in the bombing of North Vietnam 
might contribute to the acceptance by its 
government of our offer of unconditional 
negtotiations, we did suspend bombing on 
December 24 and continued that suspension 
for some 37 days. At the same time, Presi-
dent Johnson dispatched several high-rank-
ing representatives to explain to His Holiness 
the Pope and to the chiefs of state or heads of 
government of a number of states our most 
earnest desire to end the conflict peacefully 
and promptly. Our views were set forth in 
14 paints which were communicated to a 
very large number of governments and later 
published and which were summarized in the 
third paragraph of my letter of January 1, 
1966, to the Secretary General. 
I should like to repeat that summary to 
you as follows: 
"That the United States is prepared for 
discussions or negotiations without any 
prior conditions whatsoever or on the basis 
of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962, that 
a reciprocal reduction of hostilities could 
be envisaged and that a ceasefire might be 
the first order of business in any discussions 
or negotiations, that the United States re-
mains prepared to withdraw its forces from 
South Vietnam as soon as South Vietnam is 
in a position to determine its own future 
without external interfrence, that the United 
States desires no continuing military pres-
ence or bases in Vietnam, that the future 
political structure in South Vietnam should 
be determined by the South Vietnamese peo-
ple themselves through democratic proc-
esses, and that the question of the reuni-
fication of the two Vietnams should be de-
cided by the free decision of their two peo-
ples." 
Subsequently, the President in his state 
of the Union address on January 12 reit-
erated once again our willingness to consider 
at a conference or in other negotiations any 
proposals which might be put forward by 
others. I am authorized to inform the Coun-
cil that these U.S. views were transmitted 
both directly and indirectly to the Govern-
ment of North Vietnam and were received 
by that Government. 
Unhappily, there has been no affirmative 
response whatsoever from Hanoi to our efforts 
to bring the conflict to the negotiating table, 
to which so many governments lent their 
sympathy and assistance. Instead there have 
been from Hanoi, and of course from Peiping 
as well, merely the familiar charges that our 
peace offensive, despite the prolonged bomb-
ing pause, was merely a "fraud" and a "swin-
dle" deserving no serious consideration. The 
most recent response seemed to be that set 
forth in President Ho Chi Minh's letter to 
certain heads of state which was broadcast 
from Hanoi on January 28. In this letter 
President Ho Chi Minh made quite clear his 
unwillingness at this time to proceed with 
unconditional negotiations; on the contrary, 
he insisted on a number of preconditions 
which would in effect require the United 
States to accept Hanoi's solution before 
negotiations had even begun. This is ob-
viously unacceptable. 
Therefore, Mr. President, my Government 
has concluded that it should now bring this 
problem with all its implications for peace 
formally before the Security Council. We 
are mindful of the discussions over the past 
months among the members of the Council 
as to whether a formal meeting could use-
fully be held in the context of other efforts 
then in train. We are also aware that it may 
not be easy for the Council itself, in view 
of all the obstacles, to take constructive ac-

tion on this question. We are firmly con-
vinced, however, that in light of its obliga-
tions under the charter to maintain inter-
national peace and security and the failure 
so far of all efforts outside the United Na-
Lions to restore peace, the Council should ad-
dress itself urgently and positively to this 
situation and exert its most vigorous en-
deavors and its immense prestige to finding 
a prompt solution to it. 
We hope that the members of the Security 
Council will agree that our common dedica-
tion to peace and our common responsi-
bility for the future of mankind require no 
less. In this connection, we are mindful of 
tne renewed appeal of His Holiness the Pope 
only 2 days ago in which he suggested that 
"an arbitration of the U.N. confined to neu-
tral nations might tomorrow?we would like 
to hope even today?resolve this terrible 
question." 
Accept. Excellency, the assurance of my 
highest consideration. 
ATerHT.TE J. GOLDBERG. 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, I thank. 
the Senator from Montana for his re-
marks. I repeat that I never questioned 
the desire of the President to establish 
peace in the world. Any President would 
so desire. I am sure Lyndon Johnson is 
no different in that respect from the 
others. 
I also appreciate the Senator's refer-
ence to Gen. Matthew Ridgway, who, I 
believe, was Army Chief of Staff at the 
time we went through a similar conflict 
of opinion, and who he advised against 
our sending large numbers of men to 
southeast Asia to help the French. 
[ well recall General Ridgway telling 
me after a hearing one day that if we 
sent 2 million men into the Vietnam area, 
they would be swallowed up. Now con-
ditions are different from those in Korea, 
where we had relatively nearby bases and 
short supply lines. I do not believe that, 
If the Soviet Union and the Chinese 
worked hard in trying to find a location 
for a showdown they could have found 
one more disadvantageous to us than in 
southeast Asia. 
Again I thank the Senator from Mon-
tana for his statement. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. AIKEN. I yield to the Senator 
from Oregon. 
Mr. MORSE. I am deeply moved, and 
millions of Americans will be deeply 
moved, by the outstanding speech the 
Senator has just made in this body. It 
is my hope that the Senator's speech will 
be printed verbatim not only for the New 
York Times, but across this Nation in 
newspaper after newspaper. 
Not only did we hear a historic speech 
from the Senator from Vermont, but we 
heard a historic speech from the major-
ity leader I Mr. MANSFIELD]. It, WO, must 
receive very wide circulation among our 
people, for, in my opinion, this has now 
become an issue for the people. This is 
an issue of which the American people 
want war or peace. The people are en-
titled to know all the facts on both sides 
of this historic controversy. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Ver-
mont stated that he had taken a position 
f or some time urging that we not get our-
selves involved in an escalation of the 
war in Asia. He has said that he hoped 
he was right and that if the President 
NINIMPFFIPINIPMEIPPIRNIMF,R1.,f,,,MEr 
pf5757ed or "g65?' 
proved himself to be right he would be 
the first to acclaim the President. 
Let me say to the Senator from Ver-
mont that I, too, would acclaim the 
President if his course of action leads to 
peace. However, I do not believe that 
escalating the war will produce peace. It 
may produce a surrender, but not peace. 
Then eventually the Asias will reorganize 
and continue their war against us until 
we too come to recognize that we can-
not maintain a dominating foothold in 
Asia. 
The Senator from Vermont has been 
right in his position, but I say regret-
fully, but respectfully, that I believe my 
President has been dead wrong in con-
ducting his Executive war in Asia and is 
dead wrong in his announcement this 
morning that he has ordered a renewing 
of the bombing and of the inevitable es-
calating of the war. 
The majority leader spoke of his close 
association with the President and his 
great affection for him. 
Let me say that I love the President 
of the United States as an individual, as 
a friend, and as a leader. But, I love my 
country more. 
In my judgment, the course of action 
that my President is following in con-
nection with escalating the war in Asia, 
is not in the best interests of my country, 
for I share the view of the Senator from 
Vermont that Asia, of all places, is no 
place for us to become involved in a 
massive war. If woe betake us and we 
have to go into such a war, I believe such 
a war is immoral, illegal, and unjusti-
fiable. I believe that war is unthinkable 
forevermore. We should face the fact 
that humanity cannot survive another 
world war. I cannot share the hope, 
because I believe that it is simply a false 
hope, that we can obtain a peace by 
making war in Asia. 
Of course, I am pleased that the Presi-
dent has announced he is going to take 
the issue to the Security Council. I am 
sorry that at the same time he is going 
to escalate the war. 
want to see the resolution he is send-
ing to the Security Council. Taking it 
to the Security Council, so far as it is 
possible success is concerned, is depend-
ent upon what position we take in the 
Security Council and what the resolution 
proposes. The proposal to take' it to the 
Security Council comes at least 21/2 years 
late. But, better late than never. 
I highly commend my Eb esident for 
coming to the point of view that the 
United States should go to the Security 
Council. I have pleaded for that for a 
long time past?many times. I have 
been requested in the past by the White 
House to prepare a series of proposed 
resolutions and legal arguments in sup-
port of taking the issue to the United 
Nations. 
It is extremely unfortunate that at the 
same time he has renewed the air raids 
on North Vietnam, for this will make it 
far more difficult for the U.N. to take 
effective action than if the raids had 
re:mained in suspension. 
I close my remarks by stating that I 
hope, when this matter is taken to the 
Security Council, that we will make clear 
to the Security Council that we do not 
CM7 
intend to let the issue rest there. If the 
Security Council or any member thereof 
decides to veto that resolution, then I 
wish to say to my President this morn-
ing, that we should call for an extraor-
dinary session of the General Assembly 
of the United Nations and lay the threat 
to the peace of the world before it. What 
we need in southeast Asia now are many 
divisions of United Nations peacekeeping 
forces, not warmaking forces. What we 
need in southeast Asia is the drawing of a 
good many neutral buffer zones across 
South Vietnam that will seek to stop the 
killing. What we need, of course, is to 
make perfectly clear to the world that we 
are ready to let the nations of the world 
sit in judgment on this war and seek to 
exercise the procedures called for in the 
United Nations Charter in trying to end 
it. 
That is my plea. That is my prayer. 
I hope that among the various alterna-
tives open to us that at least we will say 
to the Security Council, "We are ask-
ing for a United Nations conference on 
the war in southeast Asia, because under 
the United Nations Charter there are a 
great many procedures that the Security 
Council can follow." The Security Coun-
cil could call for a United Nations con-
ference which would bring not only the 
Security Council members, but all the 
members of the United Nations into focus 
on the problem and lay the matter before 
that enlarged body. I would hope that 
consideration would be given?although I 
will go along with any proposal that 
makes it possible for the United Nations 
to take jurisdiction?to the possibility of 
the Security Council, or the enlarged 
group that I have just suggested, might 
call for reconvening of the Geneva con-
ference. This would bring the Com-
munists into the picture. I know that 
many do not like the thought of bringing 
the Communists into the picture, but to 
think of bombing them out of existence 
is wishful thinking. They happen to be a 
great power and force in Asia, and they 
will continue to be a great force and 
power in Asia, no matter what war efforts 
the United States makes in Asia. 
Under the canopy of the 'United 
Nations, through a reconvened Geneva 
conference, there could be offered some 
hope of trying to bring reason to bear in 
bringing to an end the immoral killing 
that characterizes this war. 
I close by saying that I do not accept 
in full the observation of my majority 
leader in regard to the power of the 
President of the United States. I do not 
believe that the President of the United 
States, under the Constitution, has the 
power to conduct this executive war in 
Asia. He is conducting it, anyway. I 
know that there are many in Congress 
who would like to give him authority to 
continue to conduct it. However, in my 
judgment, the time has come to place a 
check upon the President of the United 
States in regard to conducting an execu-
tive war. 
I believe that one of the salutary effects 
of placing this issue before the United 
Nations might be ending at long last 
the unilateral action of the United States

Charter, as well as the United States, 
should start living up to their obligations, 
too. Let us pray and hope that the 
President's belated decision to go to the 
Security Council will lead to peace. 
Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Mr. 
President, will the Senator from Vermont 
yield? 
Mr. AIKEN. I am glad to yield to the 
Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. I com-
mend the Senator from Vermont for a 
well-reasoned speech full of good judg-
ment, and I believe, timely admonition. 
Apparently, his views have been and 
are much the same as mine, because for 
several years, ever since I visited Vietnam 
some 5 years ago, I have felt that this 
would be the worst place in the world 
to fight communism. I believe that we 
have to fight communism but, like the 
Senator from Vermont, I believe that 
much of this war has to be fought in 
the hearts of people all over the world. 
With our limited resources, both in man-
power and financially, we should not be 
picking out an area to fight the Com-
munists where they have all the advan-
tages and we all the disadvantages, as 
Is the case in Vietnam. 
The administration has been totally 
unrealistic on this war situation, and I 
believe it has been something less than 
frank with the American people in not 
giving them all the information they are 
entitled to have and in not telling them 
all that we would have to encounter in 
fighting a war in southeast Asia. 
Approximately 2 years ago we were 
advised by top officials of the adminis-
tration that the war would be over in a 
few months. They should know better 
than that, I believe that the public could 
and should be told now at least some of 
the real problems we face, certainly 
better estimates as to the cost to the 
United States and more of what is in-
volved in this war. The Communists 
have a pretty good idea of what we will 
need to win. Why cannot we tell our 
people what the Communists already 
know? 
For example, the estimate of 600,000 
troops we will need in southeast Asia is 
a conservative one and is something that 
our people should be told. 
I agree with the Senater from Vermont 
that Congress should appropriate the 
money necessary to prosecute the war 
and raise the necessary money through 
taxation and other means, and fully sup-
port it in every way. 
For myself, I see no alternative at this 
time but to support the President in the 
decision he has made?at least for the 
tiine being. 
Mr. AIKEN. I thank the Senator 
from North Dakota for his kind remarks. 
I join those who hope that the Presi-
dent's appeal to the United Nations may 
be effective in promoting peace in south-
east Asia. We must not forget, however, 
that Russia is a member of the Security 
Council and that Russia has, apparently, 
decided that southeast Asia is the best 
place to have a showdown. 
While I do not give up hope, I seri-
ously doubt that any appeal to the 
United Nations will be effective. The 
United Nations has had plenty of oppor-
tunity to take action, had it been per-
mitted to do so. I have no doubt that 
90 percent of the members of the Gen-
eral Assembly would do all they possi-
bly could to effect peace in southeast 
Asia, but it requires only one member of 
the Security Council to block that 
action. 
Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, will my 
colleague [Mr. AIKEN] yield to me? 
Mr. AIKEN. I am very glad to yield to 
my colleague. 
Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, during 
his many years in the Senate, my senior 
colleague has made many major contri-
butions to the national welfare. How-
ever, today, in my judgment, nothing 
that he has accomplished in all that time 
Is as important as the statement he has 
just made. I commend him for it. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Vermont yield? 
Mr. AIKEN. I am glad to yield to 
the Senator from Kentucky. I am ready 
to yield the floor, but I yield to him at 
this time. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, we are 
indebted to the distinguished Senator 
from Vermont for this plain and simple 
way in which he has pointed out the 
possible eventualities that may fall upon 
this country by an escalation of the war. 
I am one of those who believe that 
the bombing should not have been re-
sumed, at least at present. I did not 
make my statement upon some vague 
hope?important as that may be?but I 
had thought that the military forces 
there would be able to meet any present 
military situation?unless there were 
large introductions of forces from North 
Korea. Also, we know there is a supply 
situation which limits our forces ability 
for a time. I have believed that there 
were at least additional weeks before the 
security of our forces would be affected. 
But the most important factor, was 
whether resumption would lead to those 
extensions of conflict of which the Sen-
ator spoke. 
But the President has made his deci-
sion, and we appreciate his burdens and 
his great responsibility. I join the Sen-
ator from Oregon in the statement he 
made, as I did over a year ago, in appre-
ciation of the President's statement that 
he would submit this issue to the Se-
curity Council of the United Nations. 
We are acquainted with the reasons 
against this course?the fear that the 
Soviet Union would veto any resolution 
and thus harden its position. 
But, if there should be a veto in -the 
Security Council, the issue could be re-
ferred to the General Assembly. 
I know how difficult it would be to 
secure action where the great powers 
would be concerned. Nevertheless, this 
Is a hopeful course that the President of 
the United States will undertake and we 
should support him in his effort to se-
cure action by the United Nations. The 
Senator from Vermont has pointed out 
the task that this country may have to 
assume, and in doing this the Senator 
from Vermont has rendered the country 
a valuable service. 
In conclusion, we are beginning to de-
bate issues which should have been un-
dertaken along time ago. We rely upon 
1499 
the Committee on Foreign Relations. I 
said a year ago that the committee 
should constantly consider this prob-
lem, and advise the Senate on the sub-
ject. We must work together in this 
solemn cause to find an avenue toward 
an honorable settlement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BASS 
in the chair),. Is there further morn-
ing business? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I believe that the President had no 
choice about resuming bombing and the 
other efforts being made by this Nation 
to assist South Vietnam. 
This Nation is there because the Com-
munist aggressors are there. This is a 
part of world struggle that has continued 
since 1946, an effort by Communists to 
subjugate by force everything they can 
subjugate, an effort to take over every-
thing that they can take over. 
They are not going to leave the anti-
Communists any area that borders on 
Russia and China unless they believe we 
have the force to hold them. They have 
made that abundantly clear in place 
after place. This is a part of that over-
all problem. 
The Geneva accords were agreed to. 
This Nation was not a party to it. We 
knew about it. We were consulted about 
It. 
The Geneva accords were violated time 
and time again by Communist aggression. 
We did what we could to help 
South Vietnam sustain itself. It was 
faced with constant aggression to the 
point where our naval vessels were in the 
area and were attacked on the high seas 
by torpedo boats of North Vietnam. 
At that point we voted for a resolution. 
We said that we approved measures 
directing a strike back at aggression in 
the area. We approved of such addi-
tional measures as the President might 
deem necessary to resist aggression in 
that area. 
What did the President do? At that 
time we struck back at the bases from 
which the enemy vessels were operating 
in the waters in the vicinity of North 
Vietnam. That was an act of war. But 
we did not start it. They did. We 
struck back. We authorized the Presi-
dent to take such additional measures 
as he deemed necesary. 
Those people were sending down orga-
nized forces from North Vietnam and 
South Vietnam. The President sent in 
forces to help South Vietnam sustain 
itself. 
Reference has been made to the United 
Nations. My understanding of the United 
Nations Charter is that members of that 
organization agree not to use force 
against one another to settle interna-
tional problems, but they do not agree 
not to use force when the other fellow 
uses force on us. 
Red China is not a signatory to the 
United Nations Charter. They say that 
.the United Nations has no right to be 
consulted in this case. The government 
in Hanoi is not a signatory to the United 
Nations Charter. They will not abide by 
a decision not to use force. 
We are in a fight. One may call it what 
he will, but acts of war are being com-
mitted by both sides against one another.

1500 CONGRESSIONAL 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senator 
from Louisiana may have as much time 
as he deems necessary. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. We hope to 
limit that struggle and keep it within 
bounds and we hope for a peaceful settle-
ment. 
We will discover that when North Viet-
nam thinks they are in a position to de-
feat us before the entire world, with two 
other Communist powers behind them. 
They are not going to let us out of there, 
short of defeating us, if they can. 
When we are in a war we should fight 
to win. That is what we have done in 
the past in any fight when we wished to 
prevail. 
Any time one goes to the conference 
table with the Communist powers they 
are going to let it be known in a hurry 
that they are not going to give victory at 
the peace table that we cannot win on the 
battlefield. This country cannot win, if 
it cannot stand casualties, and blanches 
at the sight of blood. 
We have lost 1,500 men. They have 
lost 30 times that many, at least. They 
have a backward, primitive nation. 
If we have arrived at the point where 
our determination is so weak and our 
support of the President is so little, that 
we cannot stand with our President 
against a small Communist power, then, 
we had better get out of South Vietnam; 
and not just Vietnam but all of Asia. 
Every friendly leader in the area will 
be in a foot race to get out if he has been 
on our side; and the others will find some 
way to accommodate themselves to the 
Communist spirit. 
Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield for a series of questions? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. When I com-
plete this thought I will be glad to yield 
to the Senator from North Carolina. 
If the United States cannot stand fast 
against Communist aggression, does any-
one think that India is going to stand 
against Communist China? Does any-
one think that Pakistan or Indonesia is 
going to stand against Communist 
China? Who is going to stand against 
Communist China when they see that 
they cannot count on the United States 
to stand by with fortitude? 
I yield to the Senator from North 
Carolina. 
Mr. ERVIN. I wish to ask the junior 
Senator from Louisiana if this is not 
true. 
When all is said and done, and the 
matter is faced with realism, there are 
only three possible courses by which we 
can put an end to the fighting in 
Vietnam. 
The first is negotiation. The second 
is by winning the war. The third is by 
withdrawing or surrendering. 
Are there any other alternatives pos-
sible in the Vietnam situation? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. The Senator 
did not put the question quite this way, 
but I assume in the third possibility that 
lie stated could include abject surrender 
the surrendering of all equipment and 
troops to them. 
RECORD -- SENATE January 81, 1966 
Mr. ERVIN. Is not withdrawal a 
surrender? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. At least we 
get some of the men home if we with-
draw. 
Mr. ERVIN. When one withdraws 
from the battlefield one surrenders the 
battlefield to the enemy, does he not? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. The Senator 
is correct. 
Mr. ERVIN. Does the Senator from 
Louisiana agree with the Senator from 
North Carolina that the Prcsident has 
done and is doing everything in his power 
to obtain a settlement by negotiation and 
thus far he has been unable to find any-
body willing to negotiate with him? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. He has done 
exactly that. 
Mr. ERVIN. Does not the Senator 
from Louisiana agree with the Senator 
from North Carolina that communism is 
determined to extinguish the light of 
liberty all over the face of the earth? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. That is my 
opinion. If the Communists feel that 
they can extinguish the lie ht of lib-
erty, they will do everything they can to 
get rid of it. They are seeking by every 
means to prevail. It is more than 
an effort to win over the minds of men. 
Any man who agrees with the philosophy 
of the freedom and liberty of man is 
likely to have his head cut off if he speaks 
against his Government as some people 
here speak against our Revert anent. We 
have seen that in the Soviet Union and 
Communist China. People who express 
such -views against a Communist state 
have their heads chopped off 
Mr. ERVIN. Before putting to you 
my next question I would like to make 
this plain: If I had been running the 
United States all by myself during re-
cent years, I would not have placed any 
American servicemen in South Vietnam. 
But the question confronting America at 
this hour is not whether we should put 
our servicemen in South Vietnam. They 
are already there. Are we not in the 
position which Grover Cleveland called 
a condition and not a theory? 
Mr. TONG of Louisiana. We are. We 
have committed ourselves in Vietnam. 
Mr. ERVIN. Does not the Senator 
from Louisiana agree with me in the 
proposition that if history teaches any-
thing, it teaches that even the most 
righteous man cannot live in peace un-
less it pleases his wicked neighbor for 
him to do so? Does not the Senator from 
Louisiana agree with me in the proposi-
tion that if North Vietnam and those 
who back North Vietnam would stop fur-
nishing men and weapons and equip-
ment, the war would cease? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I believe the 
Senator is correct about that. He is 
correct. 
Mr. ERVIN. One more question. De-
spite our great admiration and our great 
affection for Members of Congress, is it 
not possibly true that the admirals and 
generals who have spent their lives 
studying war can make a more accurate 
determination of what is advisable, not 
only to win the war in South Vietnam, 
but to protect the lives of American boys 
who are already there? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. They can. 
That has been their judgment.. 
Mr. ERVIN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. There has 
been some talk about the difficulties of 
fighting a war on the mainland of 
China. I have heard that statement 
put in many different ways. President 
Eisenhower has been consulted about 
this matter. My best understanding is 
that he has repeated his statement of 
support once again as to the wisdom of 
the course we are pursuing there. 
Furthermore, there is a difference in 
marching an army off into China and 
helping South Vietnam defend itself. I 
recall that General MacArthur favored 
holding South Korea, but not marching 
an army into China itself. 
If China should decide to go into 
India and bring the people of India 
under the domination of the Commu-
nist government of Peiping, it could be 
said that in helping India we were be-
coming involved an mainland Asia. No 
one has contended that we should not 
have helped India or Pakistan to help 
defend themselves if they were attacked 
by the Soviet Union or some other Com-
munist power. 
Our defense positions that we hold in 
South Vietnam are every bit as defen-
sible, and in some respects much more 
defensible, than those that we had when 
we resisted China in Korea. We did 
not fight a land war in China. To say 
that we should not risk a war to resist 
aggression, and help a friendly power in 
Asia resist Communist aggression is 
quite another thing. 
It is always possible to find military 
experts who would disagree, but the pre-
vailing view is that we can and should 
help the people there to defend them-
selves from communism. 
Our positions in South Vietnam are 
excellent compared with those of our 
adversaries. We are located where we 
can haul in the materiel needed for our 
troops. Our adversary has great diffi-
culty in getting in an adequate amount 
for his needs. We can haul in large 
quantities of supplies, as much as we 
need to supply our troops. 
Unless and until Red China and any 
other Communist powers come to decide 
that they really want to live in peaceful 
circumstances with the United States?
and certainly Red China has not decided 
that?neither has Hanoi?they are go-
ing to continue to probe our will, probe 
our determination, test our zeal, and 
test our unity by such activities as we 
are confronted with in South Vietnam. 
When they use force against us, the only 
way to stop it is to use force in return. 
That is what we have been doing. 
It has been said that we cannot win, 
or at least that our difficulties of win-
ning are insurmountable. Someone has 
said that. it is necessary to have a .10-to-
1 advantage to wipe out the guerrilla 
forces. 
My underst.m,lirr;, of wPrfare is that 
when two nations fight and one decides 
that it will resort to guerrilla activity, it 
requires great numbers to combat the 
guerrillas. But the way to get a 10-to-1 
majority in most wars is to keep fight-
ing and winning until the adversary has 
less than a 10-to-1 ratio. 
In the Civil War, when the South had 
paid a tremendous price in casualties, it

January 31, 1966' CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
was suggested the General Lee should 
break his army up into guerrilla bands 
and that their chances would be better 
to win the war as a guerrilla effort. 
Perhaps the war could have been carried 
on on that basis, but with the war con-
tinuing and one adversary winning and 
the other losing, there comes a time 
when the side that is losing must decide 
to quit. 
With the dangers this Nation faces, I 
say we have no hope to come out of this 
situation in any honorable way other 
than to fight it and win it. If we cannot 
win it, we should at least make a genuine 
effort to win. If I do say so, that leaves 
a lot to be desired, so far as what the 
Nation can do. 
What can we do to help? In my judg-
ment, the best thing to do here is to unite 
behind our Commander in Chief. He is 
the one who has to bear the brunt of the 
responsibility. He has to decide what 
we will do. He must take the final step. 
He must make the final plan for victory 
or for the success our forces may achieve 
while fighting on any battlefield. 
It has been suggested that this Nation 
appeal to the United Nations; that the 
President request Ambassador Goldberg 
to suggest that the United Nations look 
into this matter. We shall find that that 
will be a rather frustrating experience. 
The Communist powers will be ready to 
say every false thing that their vicious 
tongues can utter against the United 
States. They will call us every vicious 
word and name that can be said about 
us. If we are able to get any kind of 
resolution to uphold us through the Se-
curity Council, in all probability the So-
viet Union will veto it. After 2 or 3 more 
months of denunciation by a number of 
large and small powers that are Commu-
nist or friendly to Communist powers, 
eventually the General Assembly might 
vote on the question. If any action at all 
were taken that would favor our side, the 
Communists would not respect it. They 
would not abide by it. Once again, we 
would be confronted with the fact that 
we had a resolution from the General 
Assembly, but Communist China is not 
a member of the United Nations. Nei-
ther is the Hanoi government. 
If the resolution is favorable to us 
they would refuse to abide by such a 
resolution. Then, we would be back 
where we started. Who would do the 
fighting? The situation would be as it 
has always been: We would have to do 
the fighting. 
I applaud the President's determination 
to make greater efforts and to use our 
forces so as to make the side of anti-
communism prevail in South Vietnam. 
I pray that we will prevail. 
Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I yield. 
Mr. AIKEN. I have been much inter-
ested in the Senator's spirited defense 
of the administration. But at this time 
I cannot understand why the adminis-
tration needs any defense. Certainly in 
my remarks I emphasized the sincerity 
of the President in desiring peace. I 
called upon the American people to make 
such sacrifices as may become necessary 
to win the war or come as near winning 
it as possible. So I do not see why the 
President needs any defense. 
I have expressed the hope that the 
President's judgment would be right; 
the hope that he has taken the right 
course; and the hope that the war might 
be ended satisfactorily within a short 
time?perhaps not so quickly as Sec-
retary McNamara promised at one time, 
when he said that most of our boys would 
be home by Christmas. That was 2 
years ago. 
But the Senator from Louisiana made 
one statement that bothered me some-
what. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I am not 
undertaking to quarrel with the views 
of the Senator from Vermont; I am 
simply undertaking to state my own 
views. I find some things in the Sena-
tor's speech with which I agree, and per-
haps some things with which I do not 
agree. But other Senators have had 
their say, and I am simply stating my 
views. I am not seeking to take issue 
with the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. AIKEN. I am not disagreeing. I 
think taxes ought to be raised, according 
to the President's request; but the Presi-
dent did not begin to go far enough in 
order to wage war in any satisfactory 
measure. , 
But what disturbed me a little were the 
remarks of the Senator from Louisiana 
that we have to defend democracy wher-
ever we find it in the world. He pointed 
out India as one of the countries we 
might be called upon to defend. I was 
wondering whether the Senator, well in-
formed as he is on administration mat-
ters, could say whether there is any point 
beyond which we would not go to defend 
Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, In-
dia, the African countries, or any other 
place where democracy might be threat-
ened? Is there any point beyond which 
we would not go? ' 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I do not 
know the answer to that question. But 
there is no place in Asia where it would 
do us much goad to make a stand if we 
were to pull out and leave after we had 
committed ourselves, as we have in Viet-
nam. I do not believe the people would 
trust us or count on us, feeling that they 
could not count on the United States to 
fulfill its commitments. 
I should say that all such situations 
would have to be judged by the circum-
stances of the particular case. I would 
certainly hope that where such situations 
arose, the United Nations could be help-
ful to us, just as it was in the difficulty 
between India and Pakistan. So the situ-
ation does depend on circumstances. 
Suppose the Communists decide that 
they will try to take Berlin again, as they 
decided sometime ago they would take it. 
How far would we go? 
President Kennedy said that we would 
go as far as necessary, but we would not 
let them take it. In this case, once we 
are committed, I think we must continue, 
if we can find a way to an honorable 
peace, I would strongly favor following 
such a course; but if not, we shall have 
to fight unless we are willing to let the 
Communists take over. 
Mr. AIKEN. On the 2d of June 1964, 
I took the position that the United States 
1501 
had an obligation to South Vietnam; 
that we might have to station troops in 
Thailand, provided Thailand wanted 
them and would cooperate fully with 
their own forces. But at the same 
time, I questioned the advisability of un-
dertaking to police the whole world or to 
escalate the war further. That is why I 
asked whether there is a point beyond 
which we cannot go. 
In this case, I think perhaps we have 
been mousetrapped into letting Russia 
and China choose the arena for a major 
showdown. I do not know for sure, how-
ever. Cuba would have been much 
nearer to us. But Russia did not choose 
to have a showdown in Cuba. It goes 
without saying that if Russia was able to 
put missiles in Cuba, she can put many 
more in Vietnam without our knowing 
about it. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I approve of 
what was done with regard to taking the 
missiles out of Cuba. I think the Sen-
ator will find I am on record as saying 
that by not making a stronger effort to 
furnish more military aid in the Bay of 
Pigs invasion we made a mistake. 
Mr. AIKEN. I hope, when the Presi-
dent has his tax bill before us, the Sen-
ator will support him in his request to 
retain the tax on automobiles and phone 
calls. I think what he is asking for will 
be but a drop in the bucket compared to 
what will be needed. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. The budget 
provides that twice as much will be 
needed in 1967 in Vietnam as was needed 
in 1966. That is provided in the Presi-
dent's message. It may be necessary to 
do more than that. The President has 
said that if more is needed, he will re-
quest what is necessary. 
Mr. President, that concludes what I 
have had to say. It seems to me we are 
not going to get any peacekeeping force 
in Vietnam to head off the Communist 
aggressors. I have doubts that the 
United Nations will make a useful con-
tribution to this matter. But since the 
President has indicated he wishes to lay 
the matter before the United Nations, he 
is entitled to our support as our Com-
mander in Chief. I hope the President 
may find a way to settle honorably the 
controversy in which we find ourselves. 
Until that time, we should fight to de-
feat the aggressors. 
Mr. GORE. Mr. President, I was 
pleased to hear the distinguished Sena-
tor from Louisiana finally conclude by 
saying that, though he had previously 
doubted the advisability and efficacy of 
taking the issue to the United Nations, 
nevertheless he intertained some hope 
that it might be beneficial. I share in 
that conclusion. 
A basic and, I fear, grievous error has 
been committed over a period of years in 
step-by-step treatment of the difficulty 
in Vietnam as if it were, and in permit-
ting it to become, an American war. 
This violates the principle of collective 
security. 
In the principle and practice of col-
lective security, the free world may be 
able to contain the surge of international 
communism. Standing alone, it is ques-
tionable that the United States has the

power and the resources and the wisdom 
so to do. 
This is a serious hour in the United 
States and in the world. I know there 
will be those who will be critical of the 
Senate in conducting what may appear 
to some to be a divisive debate in this 
hour. Senators have made errors of 
judgment, but so have three Presidents. 
So have the heads of our armed serv-
ices. Unfortunately, there has been a 
plethora of mistakes, and in that all of 
us have shared. 
Where are we? The Communists have 
us committed on a battlefield where we 
suffer the greatest possible disadvan-
tages. They have us standing there vir-
tually alone. I hope that one objective 
of the President's move with respect to 
the United Nations is to enlist the aid 
of the nations of the free world. 
It was for the purpose of averting the 
kind of catastrophe that now threatens 
the world, or to mitigate a catastrophe, 
or to mediate such a threat of catastro-
phe, that the United Nations was formed. 
Mr. President, it is late. The hour is 
very late, I fear. But let us hope it is not 
too late. 
Some people seem to regard Vietnam 
as the end of the earth, or the center of 
the earth.. It is neither. 
The vital interests of the United States 
can be found in many places, and in 
many places they are greater than they 
are in Vietnam. We can no more ex-
clude those other vital interests or ne-
glect them than we can afford to ignore 
the threat to peace in Vietnam. 
The important thing in this conflict 
is not Vietnam, North or South; but, 
rather, it is the equation among the 
three leading world powers today. 
The power struggle in the world in-
volves the vital interests of the United 
States. Indeed, it involves the survival 
of the humanity of the world. 
Shall we pursue a course which prom-
ises one of two results?first, the healing 
of the breach between Communist China 
and Communist Russia, out of which we 
have taken some hope in that there was 
a fissure in the monolithic unity of inter-
national communism? Shall we pursue 
a course which bogs the United States 
down in a war with China, leaving Rus-
sia free to work her machinations in 
Africa, in Latin America, in the Medi-
terranean, in Eastern Europe, or in 
other places? Or shall the principal 
thrust of our Government be to contain 
the limits of this war within bounds 
which we can reasonably hope will be 
manageable, and enlist the offices of the 
United Nations and other neutral pow-
ers and other great influences such as 
Pone Paul, the intellectuals of the world, 
all men of good will, to find a way to 
smother this raging fire? 
1. hope and believe that it is this latter 
course which the President has chosen. 
Mr. President, let us be candid and ac-
knowledge that there are many voices in 
Washington today who say that it would 
be easier to knock China out now than 
it would be 10 years from now. I have 
heard it frequently. I believe it is fair 
to say that it is partly because of that 
ng insistence that the Senate Foreign 
notations Committee has come alive to 
Trrrrkrr"67 
Its public.. responsibility its constitutional 
responsibility. 
I was in the Congress after the end of 
World War II, and I heard voices giving 
the same message, voices from the iden-
tical. sources from which I hear them 
now. 
It will be better, they then said, to 
knock out Russia now than to wait until 
she has nuclear weapons. Fortunately, 
we did not follow the advice of preven-
tive war then. There has been seine rap-
prochement between the Soviet Union 
a:nd the United States; we arc not now 
threatening to destroy each other, though 
events have been marching step by step 
as if inexorably to the point where a 
world conflagration might ensue. Gad 
forbid. 
Let not, the extremists prevail. If the 
extremists do not prevail, there is yet 
hope for mankind to avoid a world war. 
I have been deeply disturbed that it 
has been dangerously near. I frequent-
ly hear the phrase used, "land war in 
Asia." Mr. President, once this Nation 
were committed to a war with China, 
public opinion in this country would not 
permit our men to be matched man to 
man with the masses of China. 
A war between the United Ftates and 
China would quickly degenerate into a 
nuclear war. That is my belief. It may 
be that my view is in error, but feeling 
as I do that the important thing involved 
is the equation among the three great 
powers and the danger of war between 
those three great powers, I have risen to-
day to speak these thoughts. 
The most hopeful event of today is 
the reference of this matter to the United 
Nations. I am not advised of the form 
of the reference, or the manner of the 
resoMtion, but it is a step in the right 
direction that we take the matter there, 
where the pressure of world opinion can ? 
be focused. 
I am not sure how helpful or how ef-
fective it will be, but it is the brightest 
hope of the day. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, it had 
not been my purpose to enter into de-
bate at this time. I feel that the words 
of the President of the United States re-
quire careful study and consideration?
a:nd this will involve no criticism of any-
one for the fine contributions made in 
this morning's discussion--but any Sen-
ator who has not heretofore prepared a 
careful, considered, and extensive anal-
ysis of the situation cannot speak with 
beneli.t to the Senate or the country. 
The events of these days and of this pe-
riod must not to be treated by off-the-
cuff speeches. 
It was my purpose, when the parlia-
mentary situation of the Senate per-
mitted, to make some observations about 
the conduct of the war, commenting par-
ticularly on the lack of candor with 
which Congress, the press, and the peo-
ple have been treated, and commenting 
somewhat on the role played in all of 
these harrowing operations by the Sec-
retary of Defense. This morning, I am 
impelled to make only one observation, 
a:nd that is occasioned by the words of 
the President of the United States which 
have been commented on with much the 
same approach that I have, but so elo-
e1eau?r2t73071 
quently and to the point, by the distin-
guished Senator from Tennessee tMr. 
GORE]. 
Whatever else may be the situation, 
whatever mistakes have been made in 
the past, I, for one, am compelled to ob-
serve that if mistakes have been made, 
Congress cannot divest itself from par-
ticipating in those mistakes, and that the 
vote that we cast?and the Senator from 
New Hampshire participated in voting at 
that time--involves us with the Presi-
dent in the conduct of this. conflict, a 
conflict from which we cannot retreat 
with honor to ourselves, or safety to the 
free-loving and peace-loving peoples of 
the world at the present moment. I sup-
port the President's decision to resume 
bombing. We can do no less as long as 
there is an American boy fighting on the 
ground in Vietnam. 
However, the point in the President's 
remarks this morning that I found par-
ticularly encouraging was the reference 
of this matter to the United Nations. The 
words he uttered in approving the posi-
tion taken by many, including His Holi-
ness, Pope Paul, insisting that solu-
tions of problems we are facing in south-
east Asia shall not be a unilateral solu-
tion. 
I have never believed that the United 
States could get to the conference table 
and effect a unilateral peace at this time. 
I doubt whether the President thought 
so. I suspect that these long negotia-
tions and endeavors?this peace offen-
sive?has been largely for the purpose?a 
purpose which I hope has been accom-
plished?of impressing the world with 
the fact that this country desires peace 
whatever the attitude of our enemies. 
I regret that the comments on this 
matter of participation by the United 
Nations as an organization at this time 
have, in most cases, been either too cyni-
cal or too hopeful. There are those who 
continue to believe that the United Na-
tions in its present situation and under 
its present handicaps has the power and 
the influence to bring about peace any-
where. 
There are those, on the other hand, 
who persist, in the belief that because of 
the handicaps and obstacles it faces, the 
United Nations as a peacemaking and 
peacekeeping organization is useless. 
Such people believe we are only making 
an idle gesture when we try to enlist the 
United Nations. 
The Senator from New Hampshire does 
not adhere to either of those positions. 
The Senator from New Hampshire feels 
very strongly that the United States of 
America has sufficient influence in the 
world, and sufficient power, if it chose to 
exert it, to make the United Nations or-
ganization face these problems. 
The Senator from New Hampshire 
feels that this country has been a1-
together too lenient, altogether too lack 
ing in firmness of approach, in firm-
ness of utterance, in steadfastness of 
purpose, in failing to demand that 
the United Nations perform its func-
tions. When we begin to talk to the 
United Nations in a way that indicates 
to the membership of that Organization 
we are saying what we mean and that wa 
mean what we say, then and then onlo

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 
will those nations within that organiza-
tion who are supposed to be?and at 
heart I hope and believe are?on the side 
of freedom, the side of law instead of 
war, of peace instead of bloodshed, will 
really begin to function. 
Mr. President, I doubt whether they 
are going to face that responsibility un-
til we face ours within the United Na-
tions. 
Let me suggest one point, Mr. Presi-
dent?the only point that I have not 
heard suggested in the discussions of the 
situation in southeast Asia. 
I agree with those who have said that 
this must not be purely an American war. 
So long as the nations of Asia can be 
given the impression that it is the white 
man fighting against the yellow man?
even though there may be some yellow 
men on our side?just so long can it be 
unjustly asserted that this is an Ameri-
can war, a war of American aggression 
and imperialism, just so long will the 
nations of Asia who, however they may 
feel in their minds about communism and 
the principles involved, in their hearts 
will find their sympathy to be with their 
own race, against the white man, who 
has been exploiting them for so many 
generations. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from New Hampshire yield at 
that point? 
Mr. COTTON. I am glad to yield to 
the Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MORSE. I commend the Senator 
from. New Hampshire very highly for the 
statement he is making. I dismiss the 
comment about his remarks being off the 
cuff. The Senator from New Hampshire 
always speaks well extemporaneously; 
and once again is making a valuable 
contribution to this historic debate. 
If the Senator from New Hampshire 
will permit me to make one more com-
ment in reference to the United Nations, 
I completely agree with the observation 
that he has made about the United Na-
tions. Over and over again, I have 
stated .for the past 21/2 years that I did 
not know whether it would work, but 
that we should try. I have stated, in 
speech after speech, that we would place 
the members of the United Nations in 
the posture of finding whether they are 
going to live up to their obligations un-
der the charter; but there has been no 
justification, in my opinion, for their not 
living up to our obligations. That is why 
I have pleaded to carry out our obliga-
tions under the charter and take the is-
sue to the United Nations and make 
clear, as the Senator has declared, that 
they should live up to their obligations 
and proceed with the peacekeeping pro-
cedures of the United Nations to stop 
this war. 
Mr. COTTON. I thank the Senator 
from Oregon. I did not want to take too 
much time in the morning hour for too 
long remarks, but I wish to finish the 
point I was about to make, that we should 
avoid making this a unilateral war a war 
conducted by the United States of Amer-
ica, with only token assistance or par-
ticipation by others, particularly the 
Asiatics. 
No. 15-5 
But there is one point I have not heard 
emphasized. This morning in the Sen-
ate we are prone to feel some gloom and 
discouragement as to the prospect of an 
early victory. Because of that we fail to 
ask ourselves what happens if we win. 
It is hard for the Senator from New 
Hampshire to believe that after all the 
billions of dollars we have invested in our 
military organization and our national 
defense, with all the talent, all the re-
sources, and all the power of this great 
country, we cannot bring this war to a 
successful conclusion. And I mean con-
ventional weapons; we must not resort to 
nuclear weapons. 
But even now, suppose we bring this 
war to a successful conclusion, repel the 
aggressors, and establish boundaries be-
tween North and South Vietnam, what 
happens then? 
Mr. President, we not only do not want 
a unilateral war and a unilateral victory 
by the United States over its foes; we do 
not want a unilateral peace to be en-
forced by the United States alone. Even 
if we take the most optimistic viewpoint 
about the conclusion of hostilities in 
southeast Asia, how many years would 
our men be guarding the borders, as they 
are today between North and South 
Korea? How many years would they be 
policing, and enforcing a successful, vic-
torious peace between North and South 
Vietnam? That, too, we want to avoid. 
The only way to avoid a unilateral war 
and a unilateral peace, the only way not 
to have it a purely American war and an 
American enforced peace, is through the 
concerted action of other nations; and 
the United Nations, imperfect though it 
may be, is the only instrument at hand 
for such united action. We have re-
garded the United Nations?and I think 
justifiably?with much disappointment. 
It has performed some very constructive 
functions in preserving the peace in many 
countries, which those who are critical 
of it are prone to forget. On the other 
hand, we know that it has thus far 
failed in preserving peace between the 
two great protagonists in the world?
the free nations and the Communist bloc. 
This is understandable with a Com-
munist veto in the Security Council and 
many new and neutral nations in the 
General Assembly. 
Mr. President, we have been paying 
far more than our share of the costs?
certainly the peacekeeping costs and, to 
an extent, the regularly assessed dues 
and costs of the United Nations. Mem-
bers of the Senate and Members of the 
House, the press, and the people in many 
sections of the country have been pro-
testing. I never go home to visit with 
my people that someone does not ask, 
"Why don't we make the other members 
of the United Nations pay their dues?" 
I have never failed to resist those 
views. Instead, I have tried to explain 
and to discourage the feelings of our citi-
zens who think we should insist on every 
nation paying its just share in the United 
Nations, or else have us get out and scut-
tle and let the United Nations go where 
the League of Nations went. I count the 
cost very low, even though we bridle a 
1503 
bit about paying more than our share. 
I count the cost really low to contribute 
what we are obliged to contribute to the 
only organization in this world that is 
organized for and dedicated to peace in-
stead of war, to justice, and to the pro-
tection of the weak against aggression. 
Because the United Nations does not 
practice the principle of one man, one 
vote laid down by the Supreme Court in 
our own country, the United Nations has 
constantly been taking in the new, small, 
emerging nations, each of which has the 
same vote and the same power in the 
General Assembly, at least, as does the 
United States of America. 
Year by year, we have seen looming 
on the horizon certain events that some 
of us gravely deplore. Year by year, the 
best that our friendly United Nations 
have felt that they could do for us in 
many cases has been to abstain from 
voting. Year by year, by a constantly 
narrowing vote, we have been approach-
ing the time when into the United Na-
tions might be admitted, or invited, a 
nation or nations that have never once 
even professed, to say nothing of show-
ing by deed, their desire to maintain 
peace in the world and to protect the 
weak against aggression by the strong. 
The time may come when that will hap-
pen. So far as the Senator from New 
Hampshire is concerned, it will happen 
after every effort has been made to pre-
vent it, because I cannot see how the 
United Nations would ever be strength-
ened by admitting into its body nations 
that will not even profess a desire to ful-
fill the peacekeeping functions of the 
United Nations. However, it may hap-
pen; and when it does, we shall hear 
across this country the greatest outcry 
we have ever heard to have the United 
States scuttle the United Nations and to 
get out. 
What has been said heretofore will be 
a mild, mere whisper, compared to what 
will be said then. Even though I have 
raised my voice constantly against the 
admission of Red China into the United 
Nations, and shall continue to do so, I 
am not prepared to say that in any con-
tingency that can be imagined I would 
suggest our deserting the United Nations, 
so long as-there is the slightest hope that 
with our participation and assistance the 
peace of the world may yet be main-
tained. If that hope should disappear, 
the situation would be different. But so 
long as it is certain that if we should 
withdraw from the United Nations at any 
time in the future, the United Nations 
would be doomed?and that would be a 
grave decision for this country to make?
with all those things looking us in the 
face, the question of appealing to the 
United Nations concerning the present 
conflict in South Vietnam or southeast 
Asia becomes almost minor, grave though 
it is, explosive though it is, dangerous as 
It is, and tragic as it is. It becomes al-
most minor, because the United States 
has reached a point?and we should real-
ize it, and I commend the President for 
speaking of it?where we must decide 
whether we are acting firmly and aggres-
sively in insisting that the United Nations

be a functioning body for peace, and be 
absolutely unyielding, and adamant in 
the position we take. 
For many years, the Senator from New 
Hampshire. when he was a Member of 
the House and later as a Member of the 
Senate, voted for every foreign aid bill. 
But for the past 4 years he has voted 
against foreign aid bills, not because he 
does not believe in foreign aid, but be-
cause he believes that foreign aid has 
become improperly administered and im-
properly channeled. He believes we have 
come to the end of the road in lavishly 
and indiscriminately dishing out foreign 
aid to a hundred nations. 
We have been weak kneed and irreso-
lute. The State Department, I know, 
has many explanations. I have heard 
some of them. I suppose that some of 
the distinguished members of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, too, have 
many answers to this charge. But I say 
that so long as we are so yielding, so long 
as we lack the firmness to stand up for 
our rights and stop trying to buy our 
peace, stop trying to bribe people, and to 
stop trying to ingratiate ourselves with 
people?until we stand up and speak with 
a clarion voice in the world, we shall con-
tinue to be spending American lives not 
only in southeast Asia, but all across the 
world. So long as we are willing to fight 
these battles single handed, so long as 
we are willing to finance and to pay the 
price of' giving, giving, and giving to na-
tions, regardless of their willingness to 
stand with us, we shall appeal in vain 
to our friends in the U.N. The idea that 
there is something narrow, something 
selfish, something un-Christian about 
saying that we will not give aid to a na-
tion until it proves and demonstrates by 
deeds, not words, that it stands on the 
side of peace and on the side of freedom 
and self-determination on the part of the 
weak peoples of the world, is dead wrong 
The situation has reached the point 
where other nations have come to regard 
the support of this country militarily, 
financially, spiritually, and in every other 
way, as an inherent right, and we have 
permitted that concept to stand. 
Mr. President, the real ray of hope in 
what the President says is the indication 
that he intends to put real pressure on 
the United Nations to get off of its knees 
and stand on its feet and become an im-
portant factor and force for peace in the 
world. 
I hope he means that. I hope he 
means that from this hour the American 
people can look to the President for that 
kind of leadership. I have the very 
m:eatest respect and deepest affection 
Mr the President resulting from the 
years that we were associated with him 
in the floor of this Senate. 
T. must say very frankly, for these are 
not times to mince words, that I have a 
high regard and respect for the Secre-
tary of State, but I do not want to see the 
Sccretary of State and the State Depart-
ment waging this war. 
I must add that in all of my 19 years 
that I have served in the Congress there 
has not been a single Cabinet officer, Re-
publican or Democrat, in whom I have 
not had confidence, even though I dis-
agreed with them. 
pilov1.011.140 NOMPORIMAROW......01110.7137757 
FOr 
There has not been a single one I 
could not trust until we began to suffer 
under the ministrations of Secretary 
McNamara. I cannot speak of him with 
the same confidence and the same re-
spect that I can speak of the Secretary 
of State. 
I believe that the resignation of Secre-
tary :McNamara would do more toward 
winning this war and strengthening our 
defense posture than the addition of 
400,000 men in South Vietnam. 
But the President is the Commander 
in Chief. I pray to God that his refer-
ence to the United Nations, the demand 
that the United Nations assert itself, is 
not a mere pious hope, but that it rep-
resents a firm determination with re-
spect to the United Nations, of which we 
are not only a part but the part that 
makes it go, that he intends to require 
action by that body as the price of our 
continued support. 
This war must cease to be an Ameri-
can war. The peace that follows must 
not be an American peace, to be enforced 
unilaterally by this country and having 
frontiers in Asia patrolled by American 
boys. 
That is the ardent hope of this Sen-
ator. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. COTTON. I yield to the Senator 
from Oregon. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President. I wish 
to say by way of comment on this great 
speech by the Senator from New Hamp-
shire that my reaction is amen and hal-
lelujah at the same time. It is a speech 
that has been long overdue on the floor 
of the Senate. I congratulate the Sen-
ator. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that there may be inserted in the

forum yesterday afternoon on the sub-

VIETNAM PERSPECTIVE?THE CONGRESS AND

(As broadcast over the CBS televit ion net-
work Sunday, January 30, 1966) 
Guests: Senators JOSEPH CLARK, Democrat, of 
Pennsylvania; 'WAYNE MORSE, Democrat, of

South Dakota; JOHN STENNIS, Democrat, of 
Mississippi, Representative HALE BOGGS,

ANNOUNCER. In its continuing special cov-
erage of the conflict in Vietnam, CBS News 
presents "Vietnam Perspective, the Congress 
and the War." And to lead the discussion, 
here is CBS News Correspondent Eric Seva-
reici. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Good afternoon. 
The United States now has a quarter-mil-
lion soldiers, sailors, and airmen in and near 
the divided land called Vietnam. More ma-
rines have just landed. We are in a major 
war if not a great one. Since Christmas Eve, 
no American bombs have fallen on North 
Vietnam which the Government of Lyndon B. 
Johnson regards as the real motivating 
source, the real headquarters of the attempt 
to take over all of Vietnam. 
January 31, 1966 
This bombing pause was to give the Hanoi 
regime time to think about peace negotia-
tions, we hoped. The President says the 
enemy has not responded and Ho Chi Minh's 
statement of yesterday does appear to be a 
rather flat refusal. 
Here in Washington there is a general con-
viction that we are now about to resume 
bombing North Vietnam and there is a feel-
ing, strong if somewhat vague, that this will 
mean the casting of the die, no turning 
back, and that anything could then hap-
pen?perhaps military victory, perhaps the 
beginning of peace talks, perhaps eventually 
War with China itself. 
The bombing pause also gave the Congress 
of the United States time to think, and in 
the last few days many second thoughts have 
been expressed. Even the President's legal 
authority for making war in Vietnam is ques-
tioned by some. The long-awaited great 
debate in Congress about this war apparently 
has started. 
In the next hour and a half the lines and 
the texture of that debate will, we should 
think, be reflected by what is said around 
this table by six Members of the Congress, 
men who represent at least roughly the full 
spectrum of thought on Capitol Hill. 
Let me say at this point that this city of 
Washington and its surroundings are covered 
by the heaviest snowdrifts in many years 
and these men have come to this city today 
by tow car, police car, and on foot to keep 
this engagement. 
Let me introduce them around the table. 
First, Senator JOHN STENNIS, of Mississippi, 
ranking member of the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, of Oregon, member 
of the Foreign Relations Committee, perhaps 
the Senate's most outspoken opponent of 
our Vietnam policy. 
Representative HALE Boccs, of Louisiana, 
the Democratic whip in the House. 
Senator Mau. MUNDT, of South Dakota, 
member of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Senator JOSEPH CLARK, of Pennsylvania, 
also a member of that committee. 
Representative GERALD FORD, the Repub-
lican leader in the House was to have been 
here. He ma,y yet make it. He is coming 
from the snowdrifts of Virginia. If he does 
make it, there will be a chair for him. 
Well, gentlemen, however we got into this 
war and under whatever commitments and 
authorizations, the immediate question in 
most people's minds seems to be how we go 
about it from here on out. 
A few responsible Americans say we should 
simply get out of Vietnam. Some argue for 
a holding defensive action from the bases we 
already have there. Others want us to pur-
sue an active, hard-hitting battle by all pos-
sible means including the bombing of North 
Vietnam again. 
I would like to start this part of the dis-
cussion as to what we are to do now with 
Senators STENNIS and MORSE. 
Senator STENNIS. 
Senator STENNIS. When we first sent troops 
Into Vietnam in 1954 I strenuously opposed 
the movement on the Senate floor because I 
thought it might lead to war and that we 
would be in there and have to fight it alone. 
But regardless of the original situation, the 
wisdom of going in at all, we are there now 
and I have reached the painful conclusion 
and I have lived closely with this the last 
2 years as chairman of the Preparedne:8 
Subcommittee, I have reached the painful 
conclusion that we must see it through. We 
must fight it through if necessary to a min, 
tary victory or to honorable peace terms. 
Now, we have already put the American 
flag in issue. We have committed our boys. 
The flag and our men have been fired on.

may have to go, to back off now would be 
more costly and would cost us more in the 
long run in additional uprisings, outbreaks 
in Asia, in South America, even in Europe 
Itself, and perhaps in Africa. 
Now, it has become clear to me that the 
Communists in Asia have firmly decided to 
make this war a test, a test of our military 
power, how much will we have to use it, 
and more than that, a test of our national 
purpose and our will to win. 
They believe, I think, that a long, grinding, 
hard war on the ground will drain away our 
willpower and that we will finally withdraw; 
our way to easy peace, largely on their terms. 
So I think now we must make a national 
decision that it is our purpose to win and 
then set about to do the things that are 
necessary for that victory, and, of course, I 
think that will include applying military 
force to break this stalement we are in now 
where we can't possibly win without more 
force. 
We must strengthen our forces and move 
forward, and that means we are driven to 
resumption of bombing of targets in North 
Vietnam as a necessary part of the support of 
our men that are already on the battlefield. 
That includes powerplants and petroleum 
supplies, fuel supplies, ports, harbors, and I 
think on that point that after the President 
as Commander in Chief has made the de-
cision as to whether or not we resume the 
bombing?I think we should?then the mili-
tary, professional military men can well select 
the targets and that we in the Congress 
should not worry about that. 
I believe that if we do not proceed along 
this line, we can expect a continued stale-
mate, a long, long, bloody, unbearable war 
that could last for 10 or 15 years, and also 
that would bleed us and bleed us and that Is 
the Communist line, their hope. 
As I said, if we don't make it here, we will 
have to make it elsewhere in many places. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Thank you, Senator STENNIS. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, of Oregon. 
Senator MORSE. Well, as my very much re-
spected friend, JOHN STENNIS, knows, I think 
he was completely right in 1954. I shared his 
view that it was a mistake to go in. We 
should not be in there. And I think it is 
still a mistake, and I think he is wrong now 
in advocating that we escalate this war and 
for the reasons that I will give briefly now 
and expand them later. 
First, I want to say that I am perfectly 
willing to rest my entire case upon the re-
port of the Mansfield committee, the com-
mittee composed of Senator MANSFIELD, our 
majority leader, Senator MUSKIE, of Maine, 
Senator INOUYE, of Hawaii, Senator AIKEN, 
who is the dean of the Republicans in the 
Senate, and Senator BOGGS, of Delaware, the 
report that they made after they came back 
from their Asian tour entitled "The Vietnam 
Conflict, the Substance and the Shadow." 
And you find in this report many warnings 
to the American people in opposition to the 
major thesis that my good friend from 
Mississippi has just sought to defend. But?. 
and I wish that the American press would 
start printing that report in installments so 
that the American people can see it, for the 
facts of this report have got to get out to the 
American people if we are going to avoid the 
slaughter, in my judgments, of tens upon 
tens of thousands of American boys in Asia 
for the next many years. Because you are 
not going to end the war in Asia by forcing 
the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese to a 
surrender table. A surrender table will never 
be a peace table. 
The major thesis I want to defend this 
afternoon is that we are without a scintilla 
of international law right to follow the course 
of action that we are following in Vietnam. 
Sad for me to say it, but the American people 
must face the ugly reality. We are an inter-
natioanl outlaw in South Vietnam. We have 
no right under the U.N. Charter. We have 
no right under the Geneva Accords to be in 
there. We stand in violation of one section 
of the Geneva accords after another. 
Let me take, for example, our setting up 
the puppet government in South Vietnam. 
The Geneva accords didn't provide for two 
governments in Vietnam. It provided for 
two military zones, one in the north and one 
in the south, to which the French military 
forces repaired; provided for a 2-year period 
for elections in South Vietnam, to call for 
the unification of the area, to provide for 
free elections on the part of the Vietnamese 
people. Who stopped it? Our country 
stopped it. We took a Vietnamese exile out 
of New York City and Washington, D.C., by 
the name of Diem. We financed him, we 
militarized him, we set him up as a puppet 
government in South Vietnam in clear vio-
lation of the literal language of the Vietnam 
accords, 
I am at a complete loss to understand 
why we would violate those accords al-
though at the time we didn't sign them, al-
though we said we would accept them as 
principles of international law. The sad, 
ugly reality in that chapter is going to be 
written against us in the history of inter-
national law. It is the United States that 
from the very beginning was really the major 
aggressor in South Vietnam. 
Next, may I say that I have here 13 articles 
of the United Nations Charter which in my 
judgment we stand in violation of as far as 
carrying out our obligations there. What is 
my remedy? Not to get out. I agree you 
can't get out but bring others in. If we 
just try to get out because of what we have 
done in South Vietnam, there would be the 
greatest blood bath I think in human his-
tory, but what we need to do is to bring 
others in on a peacekeeping basis and not a 
warmaking basis. 
So I applaud again, although I had advo-
cated the use of the United Nations, I ap-
plaud the Pope's suggestion that this matter 
be submitted to the United Nations for ar-
bitration. That is one of the outs and one 
of these articles I point out will provide for 
that. 
But I close these opening remarks by say-
ing in my judgment let the American people 
face the fact that if you think you can win a 
war in Vietnam that will not lead to a mas-
sive war in all of Asia, you are mistaken, and 
you are going to have to keep hundreds of 
thousands of American troops over there for 
decades to police Asia if you try it. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator, I want to turn to 
Representative HALE BOGGS, of Louisiana. 
Are you this pessimistic about it? 
Mr. BOGGS. Well, Eric, remember, I saw you 
the night that I returned and I was not 
pessimistic then and I am less pessimistic 
now. 
Let me say that I am in total and com-
plete disagreement with Senator MORSE,, 
Senator MORSE is consistent in that he was 
one of the two U.S. Senators who voted 
against the Vietnam resolution of 1964. His 
position has not changed, it is not different. 
I would say, however, that what he advo-
cates would lead to only one thing as it was 
described in a very thoughtful editorial in 
the Washington Post this morning entitled 
"Unconditional Surrender." 
Now, one doesn't become an expert by go-
ing to a country and spending a few days, a 
few weeks or an unlimited period of time, 
but I think one does acquire a feel that he 
doesn't have unless he does go. 
I discovered several things in Vietnam. 
No. 1, our position is only now being felt 
there. In order to judge our posture, I tried 
to put myself in the shoes of the other man, 
look at it from the point of view of Hanoi, 
of Peiping, and as I see it, their situation is 
much different from what it was 6 months 
ago. 
We keep referring to 1954 and the years in 
between. Actually, however, we have only 
had power in Vietnam since last summer 
when we started moving troops in. 
At that time there is no question about 
the fact that that war was being lost. Vil-
lage after village was being subjected by the 
Vietcong. The only really secure area in all 
of South Vietnam was Saigon. 
Today the situation is quite different. It 
is different in a great many ways. The peo-
ple have hope. I think they know what they 
are confronted with. There is an American 
presence, and I might say further, Eric, that 
that presence has had a profound impact 
elsewhere in the area. 
Here on the wall?I don't know whether 
our viewers can see it or not?is a map of 
the world. Vietnam cannot be disassoci-
ated from the rest of the world any more ? 
than Greece and Turkey could be disassoci-
ated with the rest of the world after World 
War II, and the same arguments that Sena-
tor MORSE makes with respect to Vietnam 
were made with respect to Greece and Tur-
key after World War II. And the impact in 
the other areas is already being felt, particu-
larly in areas like Indonesia where just a year 
ago the Communists practically had control 
and where today that control has been sub-
stantially eliminated. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Representative BOGGS, I 
think later on in this program we want to 
talk a good deal about this question of the 
effect in other parts of the world and our 
Whole posture in foreign policy in the world 
as a whole because of this war. 
Do I gather from what you are saying that 
YOU would put the emphasis now on fighting, 
not on an attempt to get peace negotiations? 
Mr. BOGGS. I would subscribe to what Sen-
ator STENNIS said, that there are military 
decisions that have to be made and these 
must be made by the Commander in Chief, 
the President of the United States, in con-
sultation with his military people. 
There is emphasis on fighting, Eric. There 
are 200,000 men there and the idea that we 
can let those men stay there with one hand 
tied behind their back is one that I don't 
subscribe to. I think the effect would be that 
the American people would not support that 
type of action. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator CLARK? 
Senator CLARK. I find myself substantially 
more in agreement with Senator MORSE than 
with my good friends from Mississippi and 
Louisiana. And in particular I rely a good 
deal more on the Mansfield report than does 
my good friend HALE Bos whose views 
about the facts appear to be quite different 
from the views of the five Senators. 
Let me point out the last statement in the 
Mansfield report. It is short. 
"In short, such choices as may be open are 
not simple choices. They are difficult and 
painful choices. They are beset with many 
imponderables. The situation offers only the 
very slim prospect of a just settlement by 
negotiations, or in the alternative prospect, a 
continuation of the conflict in the general 
direction of a war on the Asian mainland." 
I am 100 percent opposed to putting the 
prestige of the United States in a general 
war on the Asian mainland where we are 
going to be confronted by ground troops, so 
many more in quantity than we, our chances 
of success are minimal. 
I support the military position of General 
MacArthur who warned us against this, of 
General Eisenhower, who refused to go to a 
ground war on the land mass of Asia, of 
General Gavin, of General Ridgway. 
I think they are right and I think these 
people who want to bring us into this war and 
make it an American war when President 
Kennedy told us that it was their war, the 
Vietnamese people's war, they have to win it, 
they have to lose it, we can help them with 
material, with advisers, with money, but it 
is their war.

1506 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 
ft has now become an Amerisan war and 
if we follow the advice of Senator STENNIS, it 
will become an almost completely American 
war. 
We had 10,000 people in South Vietnam, 
according to the Mansfield report, 2 years 
ago. We had 34,000 1 year ago. We have 
almost 200,000 there now. 
Senator STENNIS has been quoted, and he 
can speak for himself, as saying we will need 
at least 600,000 there. I think it is time to 
stop, look and listen. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator MUNDT, Of South 
Dakota, you have been listening the last 15 
minutes of this--
:ienator MUNDT. Eric, I think--
Mr. SEVAREID. Furrowing your forehead. 
Now, what would you do at this point? 
Senator Muwins I think what we have 
heard here demonstrates what has been dis-
cussed around every coffee table around the 
country, what we hear discussed in the 
cloakrooms and the committee rooms of 
Congress, and perhaps involves some of the 
issues which we should be discussing on the 
floor of the Senate. 
Instead of repeal of 14(b) or some other 
measure, it seems to me this is the biggest 
and most important issue before the country. 
And I have said in the Foreign Relations 
Committee, and my colleagues have heard 
me, and elsewhere that I think under our 
system of government we should have the 
maximum of consultation with Congress in 
I,he formation of policy but a minimum of 
consultation from the standpoint of battle 
strategy, selection of military targets. That 
has to be left to the Commander in Chief and 
to his military commanders in the field. 
I3ut we have been talking this afternoon 
primarily about matters of policy which re-
solved, as opposed to simple language, is the 
issue, do we move forward or do we move 
out? 
Now, there has been injected a third sug-
gestion by Senator MORSE that maybe we 
can duck that issue by having it decided in 
hew York by the United Nations, but it is 
a little late for that when we have got over 
200,000 American boys under gunfire in South 
Vietnam. We have to consider their security 
and their safety, and I am not sure what 
kind of outcome you would get from a Un-
ited Nations debate up there, whether you 
would jeopardize your security or make your 
security better, but in all events, I would like 
to see some kind of declaration of policy, and 
believe WAYNE will agree on this point, sent 
down from the White House to the Senate 
and let us have a debate and resolve whether 
or not our policy is to stay there and make 
sure that we do not reward aggression or to 
pull out, or if it is the will of the majority of 
the Senate to send it to the United Nations, 
:;0 be it. 
WAYNE. I think you introduced yesterday, 
if I remember right, a resolution which 
would have the impact of doing this kind 
of backward by rescinding the resolution to 
which the President continues to allude, 
which was a bit ambiguous concerning 
policy. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Now, gentlemen, you have 
lalked--Senator STENNIS has talked about a 
national decision. You have talked about 
:1 declaration of policy. The President has 
gone :;o far on the authority of that August 
1964 joint resolution opposed by only two 
men in the whole of the Congress, includ-
ing?one of the two was Senator MORSE?I 
am not quite sure what your?
Senator MUNDT. May I suggest that that 
resolution included a lot of other things ex-
cept declaration of policy. It was a bit 
ambiguous. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Yes. That was a resolution 
that gave the President, as he interprets it, 
the right to do what he has been doing in 
terms of military action, the commitment 
of American ground forces. 
V111.1111111MINIIMPPRIAIIROVOMOIPIPAIMmm*A-MMAriplzverrillityr 
How do we get to a point of another decla-
ration of policy? What ought it to be? 
Senator MORSE, Erie, let me say first, as 
KARL mentioned, the two resolutions I in-
troduced yesterday, one to provide for the 
rescinding of the August 1964 resolution and 
the resolution itself has a statement in it 
that authorizes the Congress to rescind it if 
it changes its mind. And I shall always be 
proud to have my descendants read that I 
didn't vote for it. But I also introduced a 
resolution yesterday calling, upon the For-
eign Relations Committee to proceed with 
an investigation and hearings on our Viet-
nam policy. 
But basic to that, understand my position. 
It is that the President ought to be propos-
ing a declaration of war if he wants to take 
increasing thousands of American boys to 
their death in Vietnam. I have si tggested 
In the past that he ought to reread Woodrow 
Wilson's great declaration of war message 
of April 17, 1917, to the joint session of 
Congress. 
It is a good constitutional lesson set forth 
in it for the President because Woodrow 
Wilson pointed out that he was without con-
stitutional authority to make war in the ab-
sence of a declaration of war. And I have 
suggested that President Johnson aught to 
read Franklin Roosevelt's message following 
Pearl Harbor asking for a declaration of war. 
He recognized he couldn't make war without 
a declaration. 
So as Jon/sr and the rest of us around this 
table know, it has been my consistent posi-
tion that no President, including Feesident 
Johnson, has any constitutional right under 
article I, section 8, of the Constitution to 
lead a single America.n boy to his slaughter 
in South Vietnam without a declaration of 
war. 
Again, I say, Mr. President, when are you 
going to recommend it? 
Mr. SEVAREID, Senator STENNIS, 
Senator STENNIS. Well, first, with all de-
ference to Senator MORSE, I think it is really 
tragic and unfortunate that he call this 
position of the United States an interna-
tional outlaw and by inference put that 
stigma on the men that are fighting over 
there. 
Senator MORSE. Not at all on the elan but 
on you people that support it. 
Senator STENNIS. All right. Now, :he idea 
that we are there illegally, with deference 
to you, I think it is ridiculous. We went 
there to their aid at their request. It is 
an old Biblical principle, come o'er into 
Macedonia and help us. 
Now, we want with that altruistic, friendly 
spirit. We knew that the real issue there 
was Asiatic communism because the guer-
rillas were literally cutting thos3 little 
people to pieces. 
My objection then was that we were going 
in alone, but anyway, we went, we are there, 
we are committed. Now debate is ell right. 
like debate. But I think the time for talk 
has about run out. We have been on this 
policy for 12 years. A declaration of war 
now?why, three Presidents of the United 
States have participated in this policy as 
have Congresses for 12 years. We appro-
priated money every one of those years. 
Last year the issue was up on the floor in 
an appropriation bill that I handled. No 
one challenged an item in that bill to pay 
for this war?billions of dollars. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Gentlemen, I wanted to, if 
I may, raise one point in connection with 
what Senator STENNIS has said here. 
Are these actions, the present actions of 
President Johnson, do you feel in consistent 
line with the commitments made by Presi-
dents Eisenhower and Kennedy? 
Mr. Bones? 
Mr. Iloccs. Yes. I think they are totally 
inconsistent with the commitments made by 
President Eisenhower and by President Ken-
January 31, 1966 
nedy and with similar committments made 
by President Truman when he was con-
fronted with Communist aggression in Korea. 
Under our Constitution the President is 
the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. 
President Kennedy probably took the gravest 
risk in the history of mankind when he de-
manded that the Soviets remove the missiles 
from Cuba. Bre didn't wait for a declaration 
from Congress. He had a clear and present 
danger and he acted because of that clear 
and present danger. 
Now, having said that, let's set the record 
straight. No President has conferred more 
with Congress than has President Johnson. 
He has had dozens of joint leadership meet-
ings at the White House with both the Re-
publican leadership and the Democratic 
leadership. As late as a few days ago he had 
20 Members of the Congress there, including 
some who have been quoted here, and out ,3f 
the 20, Democrats and Republicans, I think 
I can say that 18 of them substantially 
agreed with the problems confronting us Xri 
southeast Asia, 
Now, remember, Senator MORSE hasn't 
changed his position one iota as far as I 
know. He said what he said previously. He 
is saying it again. I don't see any solution 
to the problems as he presents--as he talks 
about them, and it is very easy to use expres-
sions like "international outlaw." When you 
go there and you recognize the terror that 
the Vietcong has employed against innocent 
people, slaughtering the mayors of the towns, 
the intellectual leaders, teachers, professors, 
doctors, the word "outlaw" would be best ap-
plied to that group rather than to the United 
States of America. 
Mr. SEVAREID. I want to hear from Senator 
CLARK for a moment. 
Senator CLARK. Again I find myself re-
luctantly in disagreement with my good 
friend from Louisiana. I think President 
Johnson's policy is quite inconsistent with 
that of both General Eisenhower and of Pres-
ident Kennedy. General Eisenhower author-
ized the giving of a small amount of economic 
aid during his term of office. President Ken-
nedy made it very clear, as I said a few 
moments ago, that this is their war and not 
our war. 
I think we crossed the Rubicon to make it 
our war rather than their war when last May 
we authorized another $700 million for Viet-
nam. I made a rather extensive speech 
pointing out that I thought this was a mis-
take but I voted for it in the end because I 
felt the President should have the benefit of 
the doubt. 
There is no doubt to my mind that this 
has now become our war and not theirs, that 
the policy is inconsistent, that the action is 
illegal. This is not to say that the action 
of our vicious and terroristic opponents is 
not illegal, too, because it is. Who broke the 
Geneva accords first, we or they, is still a 
subject of some debate. 
I hope, my good friend JOHN STEN/yrs, that 
there will be no effort made by the Armed 
Services Committee to jam through a $12 
billion appropriation with only 5 hours of 
debate the way it was done the last time. 
I don't think we have had a debate in any 
depth in the Congress about this and I agree 
in that regard with my friend, Senator 
MUNDT. 
Senator STENNIS. Senator, if I may say, I 
invited debate. I handled the appropriations 
bill last year for the Department of Defense, 
the $700 million and the $1.7 billion, and 
I invited debate at that time, and the second 
bill that passed along in August or Septem-
ber, virtually no debate on that subject. 
Senator CLARK, Senator  
Senator STENNIS. That was wide open and 
long thought. We are not going to try to 
jam anything through. 
Senator CLARK. Glad to hear it.

January 31, 1966 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1507 
Mr. BOGGS. Senator CLARK keeps referring 
to me in his disagreement with me, and I 
must say that?
Senator CLARK. That is because you were 
Just speaking. 
Mr. BOGGS. I must say when he describes 
this as an American war that I must re-
spectfully disagree with him. It so happens 
that the description is not proper. There 
are over 600,000 South Vietnamese troops 
armed and carrying on the major part of the 
defense of South Vietnam. That is what it 
is. It is a defense of their country. There 
are 20,000 or more South Koreans there. 
There are Australians, a division, or two. 
Well?
Senator CLARK. Fifteen hundred men. 
Mr. BOGGS. Well, there will be more. New 
Zealand is there. 
Senator CLARK. Two hundred and fifty. 
Mr. Boocs. And there are other commit-
ments being made by other people through-
out the world. It is not an American war 
but it is an Amreican commitment and we 
intend to live up to it. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Gentlemen, all of you here, 
except Senator MORSE, voted for that resolu-
tion of August 1964 which the President 
cites as his authorization for this kind of 
war. Why is it that it is only now that this 
is coming under question? Is the Congress 
changing its mind? 
Senator Minmr. I don't think it is coming 
under question only now really. This was 
tied in with different conditions. It was 
not as clear cut as I would like to have 
had it been. I think we concern ourselves 
a little too much about whether or not there 
are any inconsistencies between what John-
son is doing and Eisenhower was doing and 
Kennedy doing. I don't think they are in-
consistent. They are vastly different. Ei-
senhower went in with an economic com-
mitment, as Senator CLARK pointed out, and 
that only. I think a total of two Americans 
died over there in accidents during the entire 
Eisenhower administration. 
Mr. BOGGS. Senator, if you will yield?
Senator MUNDT. Just a minute. When 
Senator Kennedy came along, he put in some 
troops. Now President Johnson is putting 
in arms. Conditions are different. That 
doesn't mean that it is an inconsistency. It 
was moving in the direction of this whole 
thing, and I do not believe that the President 
should send down a declaration of war but 
he should send down a declaration of policy 
when 15 Senators claim they were confused 
and didn't quite understand what they were 
voting for, that it was too ambiguous 
and?
Mr. SEVAREID. I wonder if we could?
Senator MUNDT. I think we should at least 
be clear enough what the policy is and let 
us vote on it. 
Mr. SEVAREID. I think Senator STENNIS?
Senator STENNIS. Mr. President, I don't 
think it is important to go back into this 
but we sent 200 Air Force mechanics in uni-
form into South Vietnam as early as May 
1954, and that is when I first objected on 
the floor and we were promised that they 
would be withdrawn. 
Senator CLARK. You are right. 
Senator STENNIS. Within 6 months they 
were withdrawn, but 800 more or 400 more 
were sent in. That is the beginning of our 
military participation which has continued 
since that time. 
Now, those things are all moot, though, 
now. We are in there. We are committed. 
This policy is a continuation, slow, gradual 
continuation. 
Mr. BOGGS. Well, now, let's address again 
to Senator Mufmr's statement about policy 
and why we are there. Now, President John-
son made an address, I thought a memorable 
address, at Johns Hopkins University in April 
last year, 1965. He spelled out in great de-
tail why we were there. And, as a matter 
of fact, he invited the Communists?the 
Communists said they had to have uncondi-
tional negotiations and he said, let's have 
unconditional negotiations, and they said, 
well, you have got to stop bombing. So we 
stopped bombing in May for a week or so. 
They said, oh, well, that is not long enough. 
So for 38 days, now, there have been no 
bombs dropped on any target in North Viet-
nam and the reason this debate is going on 
now, Eric, is because the question is right 
before us as to whether or not bombing will 
start again. That is why this debate is hap-
pening. And the issues are exactly the same 
now as they were then except for one very 
significant difference. For 38 days this Gov-
ernment has sought by every honorable 
means to bring up Hanoi to the conference 
table, to negotiate, as the President said, 
unconditionally. 
Not only has the?not only the President 
sought that but Governor Harriman, Am-
bassador Lodge has gone to 30 capitals. Am-
bassador Goldberg has gone everywhere. The 
Holy Father, Pope Paul, has called for nego-
tiations, and yet Hanoi says, as I cited a min-
ute ago, the only negotiation is with the Viet-
cong and you let them take over the country. 
That is the issue. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Gentlemen, we are going to 
come back to this in a moment. I will have 
to interrupt for about 1 minute or less to let 
our stations have a word. So now a pause 
for station identification. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Now back to "Vietnam Per-
spective, the Congress and the War." 
Before we leave the subject of what we 
ought to do in this fight in Asia, in the imme-
diate future, I would like to get?cover one 
point we really have not covered and that is 
what we do about the Vietcong itself, or the 
National Liberation Front. 
Are we leaving some stone toward peace 
unturned here by not giving them some kind 
of recognition? 
Senator Molise 
Senator MORSE. Well, I want to comment 
on that and reply to JOIIN, but I will take 
that point first. 
Of course, Brother BOGGS here has talked 
about the President's Johns Hopkins speech, 
but unconditional discussion, but he didn't 
offer unconditional discussion except seman-
tically because his Johns Hopkins speech ex-
cluded direct negotiations with the Vietcong, 
and let's face it, the Vietcong has the most 
powerful enemy force in South Vietnam. 
They control over 75 percent of the land area. 
They control most of the?the majority of 
the people, and yet we have up until just 
recently wanted to exclude them from nego-
tiations. The President has said they can 
come in with the North Vietnamese but they 
happen to be the most powerful force in 
Vietnam. 
But now I want to say this to JOHN. I can 
well understand how he would take the posi-
tion?many that share his view take the 
position?we mustn't talk about all these 
violations of treaties by the United States 
with the American people. The American 
people mustn't be told- the ugly facts about 
what our Government has been doing. And, 
of course, the German people weren't told 
either before the rise of Hitler. And I want 
to state, the American people as they listen 
to me on this telecast this afternoon, you 
and you alone own American foreign policy, 
not the President of the United States. All 
this talk and this debate about the President 
being the Commander in Chief does not 
justify the Commander in Chief taking 
American boys to their death in South Viet-
nam without a declaration of war or with-
out living up to our United Nations 
commitments. 
And so I ask again, Mr. President, why 
don't you take it to the United Nations 
Security Council? 
And what is our Ambassador's alibi? 
Arthur Goldberg has been saying as his be-
hind the scenes discussions indicate the 
members of the Security Council don't want 
it to be taken, before the United Nations. 
What has that got to do with our treaty 
obligations? I want to put them on the spot. 
I want to put France and Russia on the spot 
in the Security Council and take my coun-
try off. I want to get a resolution before 
the Security Council calling for arbitration 
as Pope Paul has asked for, calling for the 
matter to be referred to the General As-
sembly, calling for a United Nations take-
over for peacekeeping purposes. 
The sad fact is our country is fighting a 
unilateral conducted war in Asia that is go-
ing to lead us, I fear, into a massive war, and 
you, the people, have to stop it. And you 
know how you can stop it. Make clear to 
your President, make clear to your Senators 
and your Congressmen, that you want to 
stop, that you want to use all the procedures 
of international law available to you, and 
then if they don't want to do it, then exer-
cise your precious right as free men and 
women and beat them at the polls starting 
in 1966 and 1968. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator MORSE, I didn't ex-
pect to go on this long with that, but in view 
of that rather lengthy and fervent speech, I 
think a very brief rejoinder from Senator 
STENNIS might be in order. 
enator MORSE. Well, I am pretty well?
Senator STENNIS. Just this. Just this. 
On the United Nations referral, again there 
is nothing illegal or unlawful that these men 
we have sent forth to fight have done or that 
their Government has done, and referral of 
this matter to the United Nations?if you 
have a plan, Senator, or anyone has a plan 
that can be put to them for a matter of their 
approval and use a device to get something 
that has already been agreed on, that would 
be all right, but to defer to them for a solu-
tion would be giving them a problem that 
they cannot solve. We are going to have 
to?
Senator MORSE. Why do you say that? 
Senator STENNIS. We are going to have to 
put up the men and the money to win this 
war and we had better go on and do it under 
our command and those that are fighting 
with us. I am not willing to turn it over to 
anyone. 
Senator MORSE. JOHN, what you are say-
Senator STENNIS. STENNIS. Because we are having 
to carry the load already. 
Senator MORSE. What you are saying is we 
should tear up, just as though it is a scrap 
of paper, this charter that we signed. 
Senator STENNIS. NO. NO. 
Senator MORSE. This calls for exactly the 
procedure that I am calling for and you can't 
erase the indelible language of the charter. 
Senator STEN/sus. The United Nations?
Senator MORSE. Article we have been defy-
ing. 
Senator STENNIS. Intervene and doesn't 
want to have anything to do with it and?
(Stimultaneous conversations.) 
Senator STENNIS. Doesn't want to have 
anything to do with it and we would be---
Senator MORSE. We have a duty to  
Senator STENNIS. Jumping out of the fry-
ing pan into the fire. 
Senator Mos. We have a duty to lay it 
before them. That is what the charter says. 
You are violating the law. You don't like 
to have me call us an outlaw Nation but we 
are as long as we tear up that charter as a 
scrap of paper as far as our failure to keep 
our obligations. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. BOGGS. 
Mr. BOGGS. Senator Mos E has again made 
some rather remarkable statements. In one 
of them he compared our actions to the ac-
tions of Hitler prior to World War II, which 
to me is an astonishing thing for anyone to 
say. 
Senator MORSE. That is not what I said. 
Mr. BOGGS. Well, that is the way I?

corner, wars don't just happen on battle-

lkies on, going to affect every family and 
everybody's foritine in this country. at, borne. 
I think maybe an ought to talk a little :about 
prospective price of this war. Our ability 
and our willingness to pay it. We have had 
taw budget, we have had the economic mes-
aage now, am sore you all have a lot of 
thoughts about that. And I think the Con-
crccS will be expressing its views on the cost 
01 this war in many specific votes for many 
mouths to conic. 
would like to hear now?I think starting 
perhaps with Senator MUNDT, of South 
lialvotit?are we going to have guns and but-
ter or guns or butter, or what, Senator? 
Senator Muivnr. Well, I guess I am stand-
ing in for JERRY FORD on, that because that 
was not the topic assigned to me. but I am 
very glad to respond to it, Eric, because I 
don't believe that we can have guns and-but-
ter with equal emphasis on botls without 
something or somebody being sacrificed, and 
I am afraid it is going to be the war effort, 
and I don't see anything wrong ab till; having 
a little general sacrifice among citizens gen-
erally when we are in a war, and we all agree 
on that around this table. 
You cal; it a major ',Aar. I it is a 
major we, We are in. it whetM r it is de-
clared or undeclared.. The boy who is fight-
ing and daiing is just as deal am, is in just 
as muala peril regardless of the, mine of the 
operation. 
Since We are having this great einatest in 
which we all share in the victory ce ell suffer 
from the defeat, I think the President should 
also insiat on some sacrifices ft fin people 
generally, that there should be a cutback 
in these domestic programs which are not 
essential as of the moment. 
Let's take slum clearance, con ieivably a 
very sound, and desirable program, but we 
have had alums as long as we have had cities 
and I don't think we should do anything to 
detract from the importance of getting this 
Viettameese thing solved satisfacterily with 
an enduring and enforcing peace 
We Filiouldn't do anything in tern it of mak-
ing it "run,: er for the people who are al home. 
That is what I had in mind when I say, Mr. 
Bones, that there should be a dccleration of

factory to me. I understand A.:Hit:I think 
that conditions should change. The war has

January 3/,'1963 
Senator MUNDT. That is 20 out of 531. 
Mr. BOGGS. And I can't speak for the Pres-
ident of the United States, of course, but I 
think I can say without fear of contradiction 
that, No. 1, he has nothing to hide. 
Senator MUNDT. I agree. 
Mr. Bones. And No. 2, if it is necessary that 
he restate our position, I am sure he will cl) 
it. 
Mr. SEVAIIETD, Gentlemen, I don't know 
that we have ever before tried to finance is 
major war on top of a booming economy, on 
top of almost full employment, and on top or: 
already high taxation. I want to turn to 
Senator CLARK for a moment about this. 
Can this be done? Are we going to get wage 
and price controls, for example? 
Senator CLARK, Well, I think the Presi-
dent's budget was a very skillful effort to 
have us have both guns and butter. Of 
course, the question is how many guns and, 
how much butter. 
If we were to adopt the policy which I have 
advocated, which is in short the General 
Gavin position, to hold strong enclaves in 
South Vietnam, not to let anybody throw us 
out, not to scuttle and run, but not to scsels 
out and destroy an elusive enemy hiding in 
elephant grass and jungle, I don't think we 
are going to have to have as much more 
money for guns as some of my belligerent 
friends seem to believe. 
Mr. SMIRCH). I think Senator STENNIS be-
lieves that would cost more in the long run. 
Senator CLARK. Well, he may, and no 
doubt in a moment he will have a chance to 
tell us why. 
I believe, however, that if we get to a 
situation where, despite the objections of 
people like myself, this war is escalated and 
it becomes more and more expensive, then 
we may have to choose between increasing 
taxes on the well-to-do, on the wealthy, on 
those living on inherited income, or in the 
alternative, taking it out of the hides of the 
poor, and I for one would be in favor of 
raising more revenues to keep the Great 
Society programs going as opposed to leav-
ing the present tax structure where it Ls, 
which is pretty much lower than it has ever 
been in any major war before. 
Mr. Bones. Mr. Chairman, I think Senator 
Senator
-
Senator MORSE. Well, I only want to say 
on the guns and butter issue, you can't fight 
a massive war in Asia and not eliminate a 
large part of the expenditures that you plan 
to raise the level of your domestic economy. 
The President's budget message already 
makes substantial cuts in the poverty pro-
gram, makes substantial cuts in public works 
programs, makes substantial cuts already. 
But what concerns me about this dis-
cussion is the failure to meet up to the fact 
that we haven't got any support in Asia. 
My colleagues around this table can't main-
tain any?can't mention a single major 
country in Asia that is supporting, this op - 
oration. 
Listen to what the Mansfield report says, 
and I till say I will rest my cue on. the 
Mansfield report. Ile says: 
"With a few exceptions, assistance has noi, 
been and is not likely to be forthcoming for 
the war effort in South Vietnam frain na-
tions other than the United States. On the 
contrary, the longer the war continues at its 
present pattern and the more it expands in 
scope, the greater will become the strain 
placed upon the relations of' the United 
States with allies both in the Far East and 
in Europe. 
"And I just took a Senate delegation 
through a 5-week tour of Asia and nowhere 
in the 5 weeks did I find anything but Lip 
service for our war in Asia, and in Hong Kong 
we got a briefing that left no room for doubt 
in my mind that if we escalate this war, we 
give China no course but to come in."

January 81, 1966 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1509 
Mr. SEvAraza. That is exactly what I want 
to get into in the latter part of this program 
which I would like to come to in a few min-
utes, but I do think we ought to?people 
ought to be told a little more about what 
this war, if it continues, is going to mean 
to families and?
Mr. Bocce. May I address myself to that 
just a moment? 
Mr. SEVAREID. I think Senator STENNIS has 
asked for the floor. 
Senator STENNIS. I will be brief on this. 
I think the first priority business now is to 
will this war. That is not only in money but 
in sentiment and first priority in policy, not 
only our Government but we ought to try to 
convince our allies in Europe and in Asia, 
too, that it is the first order of business with 
us, and I think that trying to carry on all 
the other programs almost at their top level 
leads our would-be allies to believe that we 
are not as serious about this thing as we 
should, perhaps makes our enemies think 
that we are on our way out after all. 
I do think the President can quickly shift 
his emphasis, though, even in a week's time 
with reference to the funds. 
Now, there is no trouble about getting 
money appropriated. I think if it goes on 
it will have to be on a large scale and that we 
will have to have, well, it almost comes to 
some kind of controls of strategic materials 
and could come very rapidly, but certainly we 
ought to emphasize the winning of the war 
and say we are going to defer many of these 
other programs. 
Senator MORSE. John, you can't possibly 
have a war without price controls and wage 
controls and complete control of the econ-
omy. We had to do it in World War II and 
this is going to get into that kind of a war. 
Mr. SEVAREID. I want to ask Mr. BOGS?
Mr. Bows. Mr. Chairman?
Mr. SEVAREID. What he?
Mr. BOGGS. I think that in order to under-
stand this, we have to look at where we have 
been and where we are. 
Now, Senator MORSE referred to World War 
II and we might refer to several other wars. 
World War I, for instance. We had a gross 
national product of about $40 billion in this 
country, the base for conducting that war. 
Mr. SEVAREID. World War I. 
Mr. BOGGS. World War I. World War II, 
which was an enormous operation, our gross 
national product was still less than $100 bil-
lion. As a matter of fact, when Franklin 
Roosevelt became President of the United 
States, it was less than $50 billion but we 
were in a gigantic depression. 
In Korea the gross national product of this 
country was about $280 billion. Today the 
gross national product of this country ap-
proaches three-quarters of a trillion dollars. 
It is about $700 billion. It is estimated that 
it will be about $725 billion in this calendar 
year. 
The cost of Vietnam at the moment repre-
sents about 11/2 percent of that gross national 
product. 
Now, the base is so much greater that to 
make the analogy between this situation and 
some of the others is not entirely accurate. 
So that I think we have to have all of those 
facts before us. 
As a matter of fact, last year alone the 
gross national product of the United States 
increased by $47 billion, which is the equiv-
alent of the entire gross national product of 
India or the entire gross national product of 
Canada, and it is more than the entire gross 
national product of all nations on earth ex-
cept for three or four of them. 
So the base that we operate from is a very 
strong base indeed. 
Senator CLARK. It is a great pleasure for me 
to agree completely for once with my good 
friend from Louisiana. I think the Presi-
dent's budget is realistic in the light of the 
present situation which confronts us. I 
think what Congressman BOGGS said about 
our gross national product is pertinent. I 
think we can have this war fought the way 
I would like to see it fought and still have 
the majority of the Great Society programs 
go forward, and if that becomes unfeasible 
because we are threatened with some infla-
tion, then in opposition to my good friend 
from South Dakota, I would raise taxes in-
stead of striking out the Great Society 
program. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Gentlemen, I think the 
President predicted a fiscal year deficit, 1967 
fiscal year, of more than?of less than $2 
billion. 
Senator CLARK. Yes, but, Eric, that is on 
a cash receipts and disbursements basis, 
there was a surplus of $500 million. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Does Senator MUNDT think 
that such a prediction over an 18-month 
period?
Senator MUNDT. Out in South Dakota 
where I come from, a merchant doesn't try 
to determine how successful he has been in 
business by simply considering the amount 
of cash he takes in. He always thinks about 
the cash he takes out. 
Now, as Congressman BOGGS talks about 
this great national income, how it has been 
accelerated, getting larger and larger, that is 
true, but it is also true that in this whole 
period we have engaged in so much deficit 
spending that while the national income 
has been getting larger, so has the national 
debt. 
Mr. BOGGS. No, it hasn't. 
Senator MUNDT. Now at an alltime high. 
Mr. BOGGS. No. 
Senator MUNDT. Probably $325 billion, and 
you will be trying to lead your troops down 
the aisle of the House this year for another 
extension of the debt limit, and you know 
you will. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr.?
Senator MUNDT. Because of the fact we 
are not trying to balance the budget?
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Chairman?
Senator MUNDT. We are spending money 
faster than we are taking it in. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, that just isn't 
SO. 
Senator MUNDT. Like the one-eyed mer-
chant. 
Mr. BOGGS. It just isn't SO. 
Senator MUNDT. Are you going to say that 
you are not going to ask the Congress to 
increase the debt limit this year? 
Mr. BOGGS. Let me tell you why it is not 
so. The debt ceiling at the end of World 
War II was about $340 billion but we had a 
gross national product of less than $250 bil-
lion?at that time less than $150 billion. 
Today we have a debt ceiling or debt of about 
$321 billion but we are making $720 billion. 
So that our income is twice what we owe. 
Now, let's leave it?even in South Dakota 
they understand that, don't they? 
Senator MuNor. Are you willing to tell the 
American public today that you will not asit 
for a debt increase limit this year? 
Mr. Bones. No. I am not willing to say 
that. 
Senator MUNDT. Of course you are not, 
because you are still engaging in deficit 
spending. 
Mr. BOGGS. No. I am not willing to say 
that because I don't know?I want to say 
this, that I associate myself with what JOHN 
. STENNIS said. I think that whatever is re-
quired in South Vietnam must be provided 
and I also associate myself With what Senator 
CLARK said, that if it does require additional 
revenues to finance some of these?the war 
In Vietnam, and some of the essential pro-
grams?you know, it is easy to get confused 
in terminology. Let us look at some of these 
things. One of the biggest is education. I 
just don't believe that any society where 
education is a dominant fact in whether we 
move ahead or not, that we can cut back on 
that. I just don't think we can. 
So that as I see it, we have to have a bal-
ance. We have to maintain a balance, but I 
say to you, Mr. Moderator, that never has a 
country been in this kind of a position before 
in all of the history of mankind so far as 
economic strength is concerned. 
Senator MORSE. Can I?
Senator MUNDT. There seems to be -
Mr. SEVAREID. Wait a minute. Excuse me 
1 second. You seem to be saying?are you 
saying that we really can fight this growing 
war in Asia without individuals in this coun-
try running much risk of a personal pinch 
financially? 
Mr. Bones. No, I am not saying that. 
Senator MORSE. I want to make a couple 
of comments very quickly. First, Congress-
man BOGGS' statement on education. As 
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on 
Education, let me say this administration 
is planning to cut back on education and 
drastically on education, and I shall oppose 
it. 
But I want to say that my difference with 
JOE CLARK and with you, Congressman 
Boccs, is that you are arguing from a premise 
that your Vietnam situation is going to con-
tinue to stay within the budget estimate. 
And what I am trying to get you to see is 
that the Vietnam situation, once you resume 
the bombing, is going to escalate into a ma-
jor war throughout Asia. 
Mr. Boccs. Well, that is your premise. 
Senator CLARK. I?
Senator MORSE. But I?
Mr. Boccs. That is not my premise. 
Senator MORSE. I don't think there is any 
way you can possibly avoid it and I heard 
nothing in my trip to Asia that would justify 
anybody believing that you are not going 
to get an escalated war?
Mr. BOGGS. Well, I was there and?
Senator MORSE. Wait until you drop the 
first bomb on China and you will see what 
China is going to do. 
May I say very quickly, Eric, you know 
why they don't want a declaration of war? 
They couldn't enforce that declaration of 
war even against some of our allies. They 
couldn't enforce it against Russia. You have 
a declaration of war and one of the first 
things you do then, you completely change 
your international law relations overnight 
with every noncombatant nation in the 
world, and you drop a blockade around 
North Vietnam?name the countries that will 
respect the blockade. Of course, we can 
start with Russia. She isn't going to respect 
the blockade and the first Russian ship you 
sink, you are in a war with Russia, and it 
will be fought not in Asia but in New York 
City, Washington, D.C., and everywhere else. 
Mr. Bones. Eric, just to get the record 
straight, I don't want to be on an hour and 
a half program and not have my own position 
stated and understood. 
In the first place, I don't advocate war. 
What I advocate I believe leads to peace 
and I realize that I am in complete dis-
agreement with Senator MORSE because it is 
my fundamental belief, based on whatever 
knowledge one can gain from history as I 
read it, that if we surrender, if we pull out, 
If we accept the terms of Ho Chi Minh at 
Peiping, there we will not have achieved 
peace. 
If we could achieve peace by doing that, 
well, maybe it might be a rather cynical 
thing to do, but maybe we could sacrifice 
these people in South Vietnam. But in my 
judgment, this would not bring peace. 
I think we would have to stand somewhere 
else and the escalation would come not on our 
side but in Indonesia, in the Philippines, in 
Thailand, in Australia, and ultimately we 
would be confronted not with peace but with 
world war III on the terms that Senator 
MORSE described. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Well, this is what I think, 
gentlemen?we ought to spend the rest of 
this program talking about it. Exactly the

1510 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE January 31, 1966 
kind of thing that you have just now 
mentioned. 
Senator Mutate. May I say?
Mr. SEVAREID. The affect on the future in 
the world. 
Senator MUNDT. May I say to Hale that he 
has not only said something now with which 
Senator CLARK agrees. He has said some-
thing with which I agree. 
Mr. Boecs. Thank you. 
Mr. SEVAREID. There are many questions, 
many serious and grave questions, obviously 
many of them of a speculative nature at this 
point in this war about our overall foreign 
policy and what is being done to it by this 
war. 
Does it, for example, intensify the so-
called cold war with Russia? Does it tend 
to drive China and Russia closer together 
or further apart? Does it weapon us po-
litically, militarily, in other parts of the 
world? A lot of such questions. 
Senator Morse? 
Senator MORSE. May I say this in answer 
to what I think was a clear implication of 
Congressman BOGGS, that I am seeking a 
settlement that Ho Chi Minh and Peiping 
would approve of. 
certainly am not, but I am also saying 
that we haven't any unilateral right to de-
termine what that settlement should be 
either. It ought to be determined by the 
noncombatants acting through this charter, 
and I am at a loss to understand how we can 
meet in 1965 and forget 1945 so soon, because 
we committed ourselves in this charter not 
to resort to war and that is exactly what we 
are doing, and what makes anyone think in 
this administration or in the country that 
we have either the resources or the man-
power to police the world? 
And let us remember that we are the only 
major power except for that rather weak 
base that Great Britain has in Singapore 
that is maintaining overseas military bases. 
Now, all the other nations of the world 
that tried it in Asia got driven out, and what 
concerns me are the American boys 50 and 
100 years?and girls, too-- from now. We 
cannot police Asia. We have got to work 
out in my judgment an international under-
standing whereby we will have the nations 
lined up against the Communists to enforce 
the peace by peacekeeping procedures. 
That is what I am pleading for. And that 
is why I think we ought to try Pope Paul's 
suggestion of getting it into the United Na-
tions and proposing arbitration and see what 
they do. 
Mr. SEVERETD. Senator STENNIS, isn't this 
war in a very long-range sense a step, an 
effort, however, blundering and groping to get 
some kind of balance of power to keep the 
peace in Asia as it has been kept pretty well 
for the last 20 years in Russia? 
Now, do we feel that?I take it you feel 
that this effort of ours is going to lead to-
ward that kind of stabilization to a degree 
rather than that this effort in itself is going 
to upset Asia into?knock it over into a third 
world war. 
Senator Saraners. Well, I think if we do 
not carry it to a conclusion that is successful 
that that is really the end of any stabilization 
and any policy that we are interested in. 
I believe it Is a total collapse. 
Now, after we have carried it to a success-
fill conclusion, frankly, I think we have a 
terrific problem ahead from our viewpoint 
In getting things stabilized there so as to 
hold in check this spread of Asiatic com. 
munism, and frankly I don't think we are 
going to be able to do it alone because we, 
have only 6 percent of the population and. 
7 percent of the land area and limited in our 
manpower and our resources. 
But certainly how it ought to collapse is 
for us to fail to win this war. It is ab-
solutely essential. And from there on I 
think further steps must be taken success-
fully to consolidate some kind of plan that 
If Annmved Por 
will be effective. I do not think the present 
ones are. That will be effective toward stab-
ilizing that great area of the country. And 
I don't say we would have to withdraw if we 
don't get it, but we certainly would have to 
reconsider the whole policy and move to a 
new position. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator MUNDT? 
Senator MUNDT. Now getting to the topic 
on which you asked me to discuss matters, 
and. I am glad to be on it because this is now 
looking ahead, the thing that has brought 
my support of the administration's policies 
in Vietnam and the thing that will continue 
to bring it so long as I am convinced that 
we are moving in that direction, is that I 
firmly believe we decrease the likelihood of 
global warfare and the nuclear warfare by 
refusing to reward aggression in Vietnam and 
refusing to accept defeat, and as long as this 
administration policy follows that line, as 
long as I think it moves in that direction, I 
am going to continue to support the Presi-
dent, and I wish he would put it that clear-
ly to Congress. This is the thing which I 
have been talking about, not a declaration 
of war. 
Who are you going to declare wae on? Rus-
sia and China and North Vietnam and the 
North Liberation Front? Or do it on the 
installment plan. That might move us in 
the way of escalating the war that we are 
all trying to hold out. 
Now, you asked us to say something about 
what this implies in terms of future rela-
tions with Russia and China, and I think 
that the only way you can discuss that is to 
try to conjecture as to where this war is go-
ing to go. Our relations with Russia and 
China are going to be substantially differ-
ent if we don't accept defeat there than if 
we do accept defeat. So much depends en-
tirely on the imponderables. 
Is there going to be a spreading of differ-
ences between Russia and China? Are they 
going to move toward each other? Nobody 
can speak with accuracy on that. We can't 
tell. Is there going to be any tendency on 
the part of either Russia or China to dis-
continue their continuous aggression by mil-
itary tactics and by subversive activities? 
Are they ever going to be content to let 
little countries like Vietnam work things out 
for themselves? What is going to be their 
attitude on the nuclear bomb, the thing that 
nobody talks about, Eric, but the thing that 
is in the back of the minds of knowledgeable 
people, this terrifying though, what is going 
to be the relationship of the free world to 
China once they get a delivery system for the 
bombs they are building now? 
We say we mustn't do this in Vietnam or 
do that in Vietnam because of the reactions 
of China. China isn't going to go away. In 
4 or 5 years it is still going to have reactions, 
and what are those reactions going to be if 
she gets a delivery system for a whole ar-
senal of atomic bombs and continues her 
hatred of everything sacred and everything 
free and everything white and everything 
American as she does now? 
These are the imponderables. 
Mr. Boccs. Let me recount a bit of history. 
I was there during the week of the Cuban 
crisis with the other congressional leaders 
with President Kennedy and after Khru-
shchev had written his letter to the Presi-
dent saying that he would withdraw the mis-
siles, President Kennedy said almost in an 
aside, he said, "The threat to world peace is 
no longer dominant in Russia. It is now in 
China." And the real test of what happens 
to mankind is what transpires after China 
obtains the hydrogen bomb. 
About 2 years later I was back in the same 
room in the White House with President 
Johnson, most of the same people, and the 
briefing was on that very subject, the fact 
that China had exploded a nuclear device, 
And the question was directed to Secretary 
p0.eIsR 
elease 2 
McNamara?I can say this now because it 
was published in the New York Times just a 
few days ago?as to what the present danger 
is, and the answer came back that there was 
no real present danger but within 10 years, 
assuming the continuation of militant, ag-
gressive communism in China and the de-
velopment of an adequate delivery system on 
the part of the Chinese, the danger would 
be real and very acute. 
Well, now, I think, Senator, that that is 
really what we are talking about and that 
is what the debate is all about in Vietnam. 
And I think that history is pretty much on 
our side. I believe that much of this mili-
tancy was synonymous with the Soviets a 
decade or two ago, and we stood firm in 
Greece and Turkey and Berlin and in Cuba, 
and now we are faced with the same situ-
ation as I see it in China and we must stand 
firm again. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator CLARK? 
Senator CLARK. This is tile subject, Eric, to 
which you asked me to address myself for 
perhaps 3 minutes, and I should like to make 
seven points. 
The most important, indeed the vital mu.-
pect of our foreign policy in the foreseeable 
future, will be our relations with Russia 
and China. The Vietnamese war is really 
only an incident in that overall relationship, 
an unhappy, an unfortunate incident which 
I hope we can terminate promptly with 
honor. 
I agree with Senator MUNDT. I don't want 
to accept defeat. I am against it. I dis-
agree with Senator STENNIS that we could 
fight a holy war against godless communism 
to total victory in this kind of day and age. 
Most wars end short of unconditional sur-
render. I hope this one will. 
My second point is that if we could arrive 
at a detente with the Soviet Union or with 
the various matters with which we are now 
in disagreement, wars of national liberation, 
the German problem, nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, disarmament, most of our 
problems of peace would be solved, and this 
to my way of thinking should be the major 
objective of our foreign policy to deal with 
those rough, tough, mean Russians in a way 
which is to their self-interest, economic and 
social, and to our self-interest. 
I believe this is not impossible. I den't 
think we are doing nearly enough on our 
side to arrive at that result. 
Third, the Russian-Chinese quarrel is se-
rious. We should do nothing to drive them 
together. If we start bombing Hanoi, if we 
start bombing Peiping, not only will we lose 
Saigon but we will throw Russia into the 
arms of a leering China and we will be in 
very grave difficulty. 
My fourth point is that China is still at 
the belligerent stage of its revolution and 
we must persuade China that they are not 
going to win by undue belligerence, whether 
it be by financing wars of national liberation 
elsewhere or by achieving total victory over 
South Vietnam and the Americans. 
And my fifth point is that our diplomacy 
should be adjusting itself to an overall effort 
hopefully with the support of the Russians, 
and the other Communist nations to per-
suade China that mutual and peaceful co-
existence is essential to her well-being as 
well as to ours. 
My sixth point is that world war III is 
unthinkable, under no circumstances should 
we allow the thought of a nuclear war, the 
bombing of Peiping, the unleashing of au-
clear weapons in Vietnam or China to drag 
us into a holocaust which would destroy our 
civilization. 
And finally, my seventh?in other words, I 
am against preventive war now as I have been 
since the end of World War II. 
My seventh and last point is that Vietnam 
makes all of this very difficult indeed and 
we should do our best to come to an adjust-

January 31, 1966 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1511 
ment under which we have an honorable 
peace, under which nobody throws us out but 
so we can get back to the really important 
matters of foreign policy which is our rela-
tions with Russia and China. 
Senator MORSE. Eric, may I say I com-
pletely agree with the seven points that JOE 
CLARK has just enunciated, but I want to 
make a comment on KARL'S and Jonres talk 
about aggression. It sounds like Dean Rusk. 
Somebody ought to ask the question who is 
aggressing? 
Now, there isn't any doubt that the North 
? Vietnamese have violated the Geneva accords. 
But so has the United States, and from the 
very beginning. And here is Vietnam?the 
North Vietnamese say, "We are going to put 
out of South Vietnam and help our brOthers, 
the Vietcong, put out the United States, 
which is in violation of the accord, and that 
is the reality that Dean Rusk doesn't want 
to face up to and I am afraid most of the 
administration. 
Well, wait until we get a judge on it. If 
you ever get before the United Nations you 
are going to get it judged on, but I want to 
get that behind me, and I want to say that 
a group of us had a meeting not so long ago 
with the Russian Ambassador. I was invited 
to it. And there is a lot of talk, you know, 
in this country about bombing Hanoi and 
we asked him, "What would be the position 
of your government," and he said, of course, 
if we bomb Hanoi we couldn't bomb Hanoi 
without killing Russians and they, of course, 
would go to the support of North Vietnam. 
Then we asked him about bombing nuclear 
bases in China, and he said, "What is the 
date for that? Can you tell us when you 
plan to do that?" 
Then he made very clear, as I found 
wherever I went in Asia, that if you move 
into China, you are going to get involved 
in a land war with China because you can 
bomb her out as far as her cities and nuclear 
installations are concerned, but you are go-
ing to have to meet her on the ground and 
you are going to have to meet her with hun-
dreds of thousands of men, and that causes 
me to say, Eric, what I said in the begin-
ning?that we are keeping from the American 
people facts as were kept from the German 
people, and we are. 
Let the administration open the safe of 
the Foreign Relations Committee, bring out 
and let the American people see it before 
they start dying by the hundreds of thou-
sands what the top military advisers of this 
Government said about a land war in Asia, 
and I want to say there is nothing that has 
changed the situation. 
You are not going to produce peace by a 
land war in Asia. You are going to produce 
peace by doing what JOHN STENNIS, I think, 
clearly implied, getting some other nations 
to line up with us to keep the peace, not 
make war but keep the peace. And that is 
why I supported for example, the United 
Nations action on the Gaza strip, in the 
Congo, and Cyprus, in Pakistan, and India. 
It was all right for Arthur Goldberg to urge 
the Security Council to take action on the 
war between India and Pakistan. Why 
doesn't my President say to Goldberg, "Get 
up there and offer the same resolution for 
United Nations take-over in South Vietnam." 
Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. BOGGS. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Moderator, Senator Morisn 
has reiterated some statements that he made 
earlier which I addressed myself to at that 
time. 
I would like to elaborate a bit, if I may, 
on some of the very thought-provoking state-
ments made by Senator CLARK a moment ago. 
One I think is a split between the two 
types of communism, the Soviet brand and 
the Chinese brand. 
I think this is indeed a very real thing. 
In every Communist Party on earth this 
struggle is going on between the Chinese 
No. 15-6 
Communist and the Russian Communist. 
The significant thing, I believe, JOE, IS what 
the impact might be if we did withdraw from 
Vietnam without, to use ,your very fine 
phrase, "an honorable peace," because that 
is what I want, too. 
Senator CLARK. I think all six of us want 
that. 
Mr. BOGGS. Right. 
Senator CLARK. Five of us. 
Mr. BOGGS. In my judgment, unless we 
achieve that, the Chinese type of communism 
would become dominant on the earth and it 
is a militant, aggressive type, and I think, 
as I said earlier, that this would indeed lead 
to world war III. 
There is much evidence of this, Eric. Japan 
is a good example. Japan has labored dili-
gently since the conclusion of World War II 
to establish a viable democratic society and 
has done remarkably well. Now, the impact 
on Japan if the Chinese Communists be-
came dominant in the world in my judgment 
would be very severe indeed. 
So in our consideration, the consideration 
of our Government, this clash between these 
two branches in the Communist world is just 
as important as anything else under 
consideration. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. BOGGS, the Chinese at-
tempts to influence other countries, Latin 
America, Africa, Indonesia, apparently have 
been going backwards?
Mr. BOGGS. Yes. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Not forward. 
Mr. BOGGS. I think that is because we have 
made our presence felt. I believe that had 
we not had the presence that we now have 
in Vietnam, that the movement would have 
been forward rather than backward. And 
if our presence fails there, believe me, you 
will see it move forward in Latin America. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Do you look at Asiatic com-
munism as a kind of monolithic force that 
can be controlled from one headquarters, 
be effective in many continents? 
Mr. BOGGS. I look at the Chinese Commu-
nist leadership today very much like the 
Russian Communist leadership under Stalin 
and his group of people. I think it is old, 
that it is doctrinaire, that it is inflexible. 
I think?and I use the word "think" because 
I don't know any more than anyone else 
does?that as the young leadership comes 
forward and the need for the development 
of the country increases?industry, educa-
tion, public works, and so forth?that there 
might very well be something similar happen-
ing in China that happened in Russia. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. MUNDT. 
Senator MUNDT. Let me say in that regard 
that I do hope that we don't bet too much 
of America's future and too much of the 
peace of the world on the assumption that 
you have a great big cleavage between Rus-
sian and Chinese communism that is going 
to break apart and serve us. There would 
be a lot more persuasion on what Congress-
man Boass is saying if the Russians were 
not putting SAM missiles in around Hanoi 
killing American boys right now. Let us 
hope the split develops but let's not develop?
and I am sure you don't intend to let it 
develop?
Mr. BOGGS. No. 
Senator MUNDT. On the assumption?this 
is_ 
Mr. BOGGS. Of course not. 
Senator MUNDT. Assumption, and it is so 
rare that I agree with Senator WAYNE MORSE 
in public, let me say I agree when he says 
that he thinks we should try to get the allies 
of the United States and all other free coun-
tries, whether allies or not, interested in 
helping us find a solution to this Vietnamese 
situation which avoids defeat and avoids re-
warding aggression, and there are specific 
steps this administration should take, and 
here is where I depart from the administra-
tion. 
I had supported its program in Vietnam 
except its weak diplomatic leadership, its 
weak political leadership in international 
capitals. I don't condemn it for not being 
able to carry peace around like somebody 
selling Fuller brushes from capital to capi-
tal, looking for a buyer. It was a noble ef-
fort. I still hope It succeeds. But I condemn 
it because It fails to do anything about in-
ducing our allies, Britain and Norway and 
Greece, to stop shipping supplies into the 
Communists. 
It is a horrible thing to think about Eng-
land, using British bottoms to carry British 
supplies to North Vietnam to help the North 
Vietnamese kill Australians, Canadian 
wheat through Hong Kong. The same thing 
holds true?we've got a club. We provide aid 
to over a hundred countries in the world. 
WAYNE MORSE and I have been trying to re-
duce it down to at least 70, I think we had 
in our amendment, as a starting point. But 
we are providing AID money, American tax-
payer money, if you please, to foreign coun-
tries who are helping the Communists in 
Hanoi. And in China and in Russia. And 
that is what I condemn, a failure to exert 
important American leadership to try to con-
solidate some free world support behind our 
effort in Vietnam. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Moderator?
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator STENNIS. 
Senator STENNIS. May I make two points. 
The time is about up. One is that this has 
been a congressional debate, nationwide tele-
vision coverage. Doubtless some quotes 
from it will be in the papers, even in Viet-
name, in Stars and Stripes. 
I want to make this clear. In spite of a 
sharp division in thought here around this 
table, I have no doubt myself once the Presi-
dent considers all the alternatives and an-
nounces what his next move and step is go-
ing to be as Commander in Chief in this war, 
that it will have very solid support here in 
the Congress and throughout the Nation, I 
really believe, and we will move forward as 
one, almost. And I want the boys that are 
in Vietnam and on their way there to clearly 
understand that. 
Now, No. 2, with reference to the future 
in Asia. I have no solution there but I say 
again if we back up and our present position 
in this unfortunate situation now we are in, 
I don't think we need to worry about our 
- leadership in Asia after that. We won't have 
any leadership. We will be relegated our-
selves to a secondary position and we will be 
a follower. And I say this, that I wish that 
the President could be more effective with 
Our NATO allies and with our Asiatic allies, 
and I don't know that he is to blame on that. 
Perhaps this pause has been trying to rally 
some support for that cause. 
I am terribly disappointed. I think they 
ought to be told that we absolutely cannot 
further keep 250,000 men, for instance, in 
Western Europe unless they can give us ac-
tive support now?if not in manpower?man-
power, certainly, with diplomatic support of 
the very strongest kind. The same thing in 
Asia. Japan, with all deference, has been 
under our umbrella and I am glad she has, 
but she could help. 
Senator MORSE. I want to very quickly say 
that I disagree with certain things that JOHN 
has just said and Congressman Booss said 
in his last comment. You will lose your 
support in Asia if we continue to make war 
in Asia and don't get others in to help us 
keep the peace. 
Congressman BOGGS thinks that you have 
got to see this thing throughor we are going 
to be in an impossible position in Asia. Well, 
where are our Asian supports?Cambodia, 
Burma, Indonesia, India, Pakistan? The 
great nations of Asia are not with us in re-
gard to this matter?
Senator MUNDT. Korea is in it in a big way. 
Senator MORSE. What?

1512 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 
Senator MUNDT. Korea is in it in a big way. 
Senator MORSE. Korea is our military de-
pendency. So is Thailand, Thailand is our 
sanctuary. Talk about secrecy. Some of you 
didn't like to hear me mention it. Let this 
administration tell what we have been doing 
in Thailand, time and time again, setting up 
our military base from which we are bombing 
into North Vietnam. 
Bat the point I want to make here is I 
think you are overlooking what is going to 
happen to Chinese communism, too. We 
talk about 10 years from now on the assump-
tion that you are going to have the same kind 
of monolithic communism In China 10 years 
from now. Any of us think that we would 
have the kind of changes in Russia that 
happened the last 10 years? Ever think the 
incentive motive would start getting into 
Russian communism? 
Now, these despicable Chinese Communist 
leaders are old and are going to die soon, 
and you watch out as the Chinese people 
become more and more enlightened for a 
change, not away from what we will call 
communism, but away from the kind of com-
munism that these desperate men are ruling 
in China at the present time. 
And I think we make a mistake if we 
build up a situation here where we take 
the position that we are going to try to 
dominate and control Asia because you will 
turn the Asians against us. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Chairman?Mr. Moder-
ator--first let me say that I thought the 
statement made by Senator STENNIS was 
most appropriate about supporting our 
forces there. There is one thing that was 
very gratifying to me when I was in Viet-
nam and that is that we have as fine an 
Army, Navy, and Marine Corps as you will 
lind anywhere. They are well motivated. 
They are wonderful Americans in every 
sense of the word. 
There is one matter that I don't think has 
been touched on adequately in this whole 
hour and a half and that in my judgment 
has been the impact of what the President 
has attempted to do in the last 38 days. 
Now, the reason we are having this dis-
cussion is because there is debate now as to 
whether or not bombing should be resumed. 
Brat it is well to understand that for 38 days 
not a bomb has been dropped, and during 
that period of time our Ambassadors?may-
be sonic of them have not been terribly ef-
fective, but I think men like Harriman and 
Goldberg are very able men indeed?they 
have made it crystal clear in my opinion 
that the United States wants peace, that it 
will negotiate unconditionally, and that we 
have taken away this propaganda device 
that the Communists have used, and they 
can no longer say that we won't negotiate. 
As a matter of fact, I quoted in the begin-
ning the editorial from the Washington Post 
this morning entitled "Unconditional Sur-
render," and I think that has been a tre-
mendous gain on the part of this Govern-
ment in the capitals of the other nations on 
earth. 
Mr. SEVAREID. I wonder if we could go 
back to what we started with here, which is 
the question of resuming bombings. For 
what it is worth, I would like to see if I 
can get a yes or no answer from each of you 
as to whether you think we ought again 
now to bomb North Vietnam. 
Senator STENNIS. Unquestionably, yes. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator MUNDT? 
Senator MIT/qDT. I think that is strictly a 
military decision to be decided by the Com-
mander in Chief and the commanders iii the 
held. I don't think Congressmen should 
try to decide military strategy. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator CLARK? 
Senator Gamut. I think it is a political de-
cision which has to be made by the Presi-
dent of the United States only secondarily 
d rnrizt 
acting in his capacity as Commander in 
Chief. I hope he will decide for political 
reasons not to resume the bombilig at least 
for the time being. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Mr. BOGGS? 
Mr. Bones. I agree substantially with what 
Senator MUNDT has said, although my per-
sonal opinion is that bombing must be re-
sumed very soon. 
Senator MORSE. It would be fatal for peace 
in Asia, and may I say in regard to these 
comments about who is supporting our boys 
in South Vietnam, in my judgment the esca-
lation of this war is going to kill thousands 
and thousands additional of those boys that 
shouldn't be killed. 
We ought to stop the escalation of the war, 
and as I said, get other nations in there 
quickly, or at least, try to, and that will?
Mr. lBoacs. How are you going to get them 
in Senator? 
Senator Mose. I have told you, by letting 
Goldberg go to the United Nations tomorrow 
and file a resolution and put it squarely up 
to them. 
Mr. SEVAREID. The pot is beginning to boil 
again just as we have to shut off the boiler, 
I am sorry to say. It has been a long period. 
You have been articulate, decisive We are 
very grateful you all could come. 
I have very little to add except one or two 
thoughts. I think perhaps this has been a 
sample of the state of mind of the American 
Congress aS a whole, a foretaste of what is 
likely to come up there in the way of debate 
for months ahead. 
Congress is divided, in some measure, on 
the justification of the war, by a large meas-
ure on how it should be conducted:: I am 
sure about the size of the risk involved in 
setting off world war III, and now 18 months 
after our first engagement with the enemy in 
the Tonkin Gulf, after nearly a year of 
bombing in North Vietnam, serious and sus-
tained congressional discussion of the war 
seems to be really just beginning. 
Perhaps that is quite comprehensible. We 
have arrived at our present condition in 
Vietnam only step by unanticipated step. 
There was no Pearl Harbor, no declaration of 
war by them or by us. 
Perhaps it is fair to say that Americans 
as a whole have rather little collective mem-
ory of' this war.. They have trouble pro-
nouncing the names of the enemy. They 
are not quite sure whom they are eupposed 
to hate. And they are not at all clear what 
the ultimate stakes might be. 
So, sustained debate or events or both 
could crystallize all this and bring it into 
some focus. Many people here hope that 
it will. The t will be hard to do, perhaps, un-
less the Congress is clear in its own mind as 
to the war, its cause, conduct, identity of 
the real enemy, the nature of the final goal 
we seek, and we hope that the debate has 
been part of that process. 
This is Eric Sevareid in Waehington. 
Good afternoon. 
Mr. FELL. Mr. President, I congratu-
late the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. 
GoaE] for the words articulated prob-
ably better than I could express my 
thoughts on this matter. 
I applaud the President's excellent de-
cision to take the Vietnam problem to 
the United Nations and I am glad that 
his decision to renew the bombing of 
North Vietnam is combined with this 
effort to achieve a diplomatic resolution 
of our strife. 
At this point, I request unanimous con-
sent to insert in the REcoao, at the end 
of my remarks, a copy of a speech I made 
on November 8, 1965, to the St. Charles 
Parent-Teacher Club of Providence, RI., 
in the course of which I advanced seven 
e DP67 
January 31, 1966 
points or recommendations with regard 
to Vietnam, the fifth of which was: 
Let us make an even stronger effort to 
turn this problem over to the United Na' 
tions, as was Korea. To do so effectively, we 
would have to agree, whether we liked it or 
not, to abide by the results of the United 
Nations collective judgment. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD 
as follows: 
REMARKS BY SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL RE-
GARDING VIETNAM, DELIVERED IN PROVIDENCE. 
R.I., NOVEMBER 8, 1965 
The problem of Vietnam continues to 
exacerbate our national mood with more per-
sistance than any other foreign policy mat-
ter for a decade. As the draft calls mount, 
our involvement, which in many ways seems 
so distant, comes closer and closer to the 
families of each of us. And as the draft 
cards burn, the Nation is swept into an 
ideological debate which becomes less and 
less relevant with each irrational act. 
My own concern with Vietnam is tied inti-
mately to my day-to-day work as a Senator, 
and particularly as a member of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. It was Just 
under 3 years ago that I accompanied 
Senator MANSFIELD on a 40-day Presidential 
fact-finding mission to Vietnam and other 
countries on the periphery of Communist 
China. The analysis which we made of the 
basic weaknesses and problems confronting 
South Vietnam have unfortunately held up 
very well indeed. 
It is against this background that I would 
like to venture a few thoughts on Vietnam 
today; in particular, to voice any hope that 
the administration will continue on its course 
of firmness and restraint, and to offer my 
idea of a long-range resolution of our com-
mitment in that unhappy land. 
At the outset, I wish to express my com-
plete support for President Johnson and my 
general endorsement of the excellent way he 
is conducting the affairs of his office. Few 
Chief Executives in history have been faced 
with such a rapidly shifting panorama of 
events?both domestic and foreign?and even 
fewer have had the good fortune to be able 
to deal with history with such success as he 
already has. 
I have supported the bulk of the hard 
and unpleasant decisions he has made in 
Vietnam so far because I have been con-
vinced that he has had no clear alternative 
to the course we have followed. Now, par-
ticularly, I support him in his restraint and 
his opposition to those who wish an inordi-
nate escalation of our involvement in Viet-
nam. I hope the administration will sus-
tain an attitude of patience that can come 
only from a true sense of history. 
I believe before we can peer into the fu-
ture and sensibly plot our course in Vietnam, 
we must first look at the past. One of our 
most fatal weaknesses is to think of a par-
ticular moment as a time all by itself rather 
than as simply a fleeting pause in the con-
tinuous stream of history. But, we must use 
the moments given to us as moments not just 
to act or, worse, to react, but to think ahead. 
While we cannot change the course of his-
tory that has already run, our actions today 
can alter the course of the stream of history 
to come. 
In southeast Asia we find an area whose 
most conspicuous unifying force since the 
days of the Khmer Empire and the Le dynas-
ty was the rather loose administration of 
France over Indochina. The people in the 
area are of assorted religions and philoso-
phies, and varied ethnic strains and educa-
tion. The great power center in the area 
is?and has been for 2,000 years?China, a 
people with the oldest continuous civiliza-
tion in the world, but also a nation that has

January 31, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
continuously sought to dominate the coun-
tries on its periphery and which has always 
been attracted by the rich Rice Bowl of 'In-
dochina. The history of southeast Asia is 
replete with efforts of the Chinese to take 
over those people and, often, they have suc-
ceeded for a period of time. 
But the Chinese expansionist drives have 
been limited in the past by their own tech-
nological 
At this juncture in history we are faced 
by a new China with new technology that 
poses a virulent threat to the peace of the 
world. Given a free rein, she might serve as 
a powerful magnet to the still hungry masses 
of the Far East. 
Now, let us examine our present position. 
It seems to me that we have at least tacitly 
weighed and rejected two extreme alterna-
tives in recent months. 
The first, which we wisely resisted, was 
unilateral withdrawal. If we had pulled out, 
the Communist North Vietnamese and their 
Vietcong cohorts surely would have simply 
rushed in to fill the ideological and military 
vacuum which we left behind. Or worse, 
the Communist Chinese might have been 
tempted to score, at no cost, the great victory 
they were denied in Korea. 
The other extreme alternative was to esca-
late to full scale war and an American oc-
cupation of South Vietnam, committing if 
need be all of our ultimate, weapons at 
whatever risk of involving other big powers, 
notably Communist China, and at whatever 
risk of a nuclear confrontation with the 
Soviet Union. 
Happily, each of these harsh alternatives 
was rejected. Between them, the Johnson 
administration has fashioned a rather skill-
ful middle course, involving a very substan-
tial U.S. military commitment which has 
decidedly stopped far short of indefinite 
escalation. 
It is a commitment which has been exer-
cised with wisdom and restraint and which, 
by and large, has been directed at limited 
objectives. There has not been a nuclear 
escalation and the Chinese so far have not 
seen fit to enter the fray. While victory in 
the usual sense is by no means assured to 
us, there have been a few signs that the tide 
of battle may be swinging slowly in our 
favor. I emphasize the word "may." We 
have, at the least, established before the 
world our credibility as an ally and our will-
ingness to stand by our commitments. 
There is of course, the distinct possibility 
that our involvement will drag on to a pro-
tracted war of 3, 5, or 10 or snore years, and 
with that protraction could come risks of 
further and further escalation of the con-
flict. We have only to remind ourselves of . 
the terrible war we had to wage against a 
similar foe in Korea where the tactical situ-
ation was much more to our favor because 
the conflict was confined to a narrow penin-
sula surrounded by sea that was under our 
control. There the land boundary separat-
ing South Korea from the Communists is 
but 135 miles while the sea boundary is 712 
nautical miles. In 'South Vietnam, unfor-
tunately, the land boundary to be defended 
is 875 miles and the sea boundary 865 nauti-
cal miles. Thus the vulnerable land fron-
tier in South Vietnam is more than six times 
longer than the Korean front. Another 
measure of difficulty is the fact that last 
year alone the South Vietnamese Army suf-
fered 25 percent more battle casualties pro-
portionately that we incurred during the 
entire 3 years of the Korean conflict. 
So, we continue to face extremely difficult 
odds in Vietnam and we may at times be 
sorely tempted to use means that will not 
be appropriate to our objectives. 
For example, I must say that I have already 
at times wished we would use more restraint 
with regard to the bombing of targets in 
North Vietnam. I say this because I believe 
that while our bombing may seem to be sue-
cessful in its immediate tactical objectives, 
I believe it is counterproductive in its polit-
ical effects, in that it tends to strengthen 
Communist unity and morale. And let us 
remember that this is a political, not a tac-
tical war. 
Also, when it comes to honoring commit-
ments to South Vietnam, we must remem-
ber that this is a two-way street. By this I 
mean that just as we are in South Vietnam 
because the government of those unhappy 
people asked us to be there?so, if their 
government asks us to depart, we should be 
willing to depart. 
But, if we are asked to stay?and I see no 
sign that we won't be?we must accept the 
fact that it could turn out to be a very long-
term commitment and that we may have 
to stand fast and hard in South Vietnam over 
an extended period of time. 
This is especially apt to be the case be-
cause the Communists and particularly the 
oriental Communists, have added a new 
dimension to warfare, and that is time. Just 
as Einstein added time as a fourth physical 
dimension, so must time be added as a factor 
to the total political warfare of today, par-
ticularly when such wars are masked under 
the term "wars of liberation." And time 
stretched out is a dimension with which we 
Americans hate to work, just as it is a 
dimension that the Communists like to use 
freely. 
We like neat, quick, clear answers. A 
20-year war makes us shudder, but not our 
enemies. They accept and seem to revel in 
muddy answers and lifelong struggles. 
As was once said of Mao Tse-tung in the 
conduct of his successful revolution in 
China, Hanoi and the Vietcong have been 
trading time for space and cities for men. 
But we must also recognize that the great-
est power in Asia, whether we like it or not, 
is Communist mainland China, a position 
that is emphasized by its acquisition of nu-
clear capability. If we peer into the future, 
I think we must accept the premise that 
China will play the dominant role there. 
Our problem over the long haul is to make 
sure that, while China may dominate its 
immediate neighbors there?just as do we in 
the Americas and as has every great nation 
in history?she won't devour them. And, 
this means holding the line at this stage of 
Communist Chinese virulence and expansion 
with all its emphasis upon atheism, material-
ism and hatred of the United States. 
It seems to me that once the Communists 
accept the fact that we are not leaving, that 
we will not be impatient for quick victories 
and that we have adopted their viewpoint 
toward time?they will be deprived of the 
keystone of their own strategy. And we, for 
our part, will find that time works in our 
favor, both from the short term and long 
term viewpoints. 
From the short-term viewpoint, our pa-
tience and implacibility may convince the 
Communists to call off their troops and save 
their energies for another day. They cer-
tainly should be eager to see us depart, for 
our continued presence in southeast Asia 
must be as galling to them as a Chinese 
presence in Latin America would be to us. 
From the long term viewpoint, I believe, 
the passage of time itself contributes to the 
internal distress and progressive dissolution 
of the Communist system. This results from 
the fact that communism as a system goes 
against the basic natures of human beings; 
there is thus constant internal pressure to 
erode the system and with the passage of 
time the erosion in fact changes the nature 
of the system. We have already seen the 
beginnings of the process demonstrated in 
the European Communist nations, where the 
achievement of material well-being has 
sharpened the taste for more freedom and 
dictated a relaxation of the controls on 
which the system depends. 
Our present problem in Asia, therefore, is 
1513 
to persist and stand fast, whatever the diffi-
culty, and confront the Communists on their 
own terms. The world should heed Presi-
dent Johnson's pledge that we have a long-
term objective to restore peace and that we, 
for our own part, do not intend to withdraw 
until peace is restored. 
We must also I believe be thinking beyond 
military strategy. We should, in fact, for-
mulate and follow a systematic, step-by-step 
plan not only for concluding the military 
engagement but for securing the peace 
which should follow. We must anticipate 
the knotty problems of negotiating a viable 
peace with ample provision for political sta-
bility and economic reconstruction. We 
must especially see to the needs of the Viet-
namese people and make stringent guaran-
tees that no reprisals will be taken against 
any of the South Vietnamese, who have 
fought the Communists so bravely. 
I submit we can do this by taking the 
following seven steps: 
First, in order to properly support all our 
efforts, we must continue our military pres-
sure in South Vietnam on the Communists. 
We can do this with the least expense to our 
side by digging in at the coastal cities where 
we command the air and the sea. At the 
same time, we can militarily probe and ex-
pand the area under our control when we 
wish and on our own terms in order to make 
life miserable for the Vietcong. We should 
do this in full acceptance of the possibility 
of a long stay in Vietnam and hence take 
such positions that our casualties and losses 
will be held to the minimum possible. 
While doing our best in the border areas to 
interdict help coming from North Vietnam, I 
believe in general that we should not esca-
late but rather should descalate our bomb-
ing of North Vietnam. And, when there is a 
pause in our bombing there, it should be for 
a matter of weeks, not days, if we are serious 
in our hopes that such a pause might be pro-
ductive of any steps toward the conference 
table or any reduction of Communist pres-
sures. 
Secondly, and most important from both 
tactical and political standpoints, I believe 
our fighting load should be far more greatly 
shared there with our Asian allies. By doing 
this we could dispel the impression held by 
so many Vietnamese that this is a white 
man's colonial war. It would also help us to 
get away from the present pattern where we 
react violently if American soldiers are killed, 
but gloss over the killing of 10, or even a 
hundred times that number, of Vietnamese. 
Let us make as our goal at least the match-
ing in numbers of American troops there by 
our non-Vietnamese Asian allies. We are 
presently a long way from such a goal since 
the total number of allied Asian troops there 
is a couple of thousand. This is only 3 per-
cent of our land forces alone in South Viet-
nam. Actually, there are probably several 
times more American troops in South Viet-
nam than there are members of the Vietcong 
born in North Vietnam. And there have 
been no traces of Chinese in South Vietnam 
and only a trace of the Chinese in North 
Vietnam. 
Third, let us engage, as President Johnson 
has suggested, in a greater economic and 
educational development program. In doing 
this we should avoid a unilateral approach. 
We should make far greater use of the United 
Nations' technical asistance program in the 
area, even though neither North nor South 
Vietnam is a member of the United Nations. 
We would again, be sharing the burden with 
other nations. President Johnson's proposal 
at Baltimore for a lower Mekong River devel-
opment project to be engaged in by all the 
countries interested in the area is a fine one. 
The Economic Commission on Asia and the 
Far East (ECAFE) should be utilized to the 
fullest in this connection as this would be 
further effort in internationalizing our eco-
nomic efforts in southeast Asia. We should

move vigorously ahead with the proposed 
Asian Development Bank. 
At present, the number of American civil-
ians employed by AID and other agencies in 
South Vietnam is '791. Yet, by contrast, the 
present number of U.N. technical assistance 
people in Vietnam is 23. I would like to see 
these figures reversed and have '791 U.N. tech-
t heal assistance people there, preferably front 
aiiiittic nations, and 23 of our Am people 
merged amongst them. 
Also, I believe our Peace Corps volunteers 
,thould be in this area where they are so 
acutely needed, and I hope that the Peace 
slurps will be ready to send in a substantial 
ilingent as soon as possible. 
Hi, as Senator iVinsiSk start has sug-
gested, we should urge Great Britain and the 
Soviet Union to reconvene the Geneva Con-
rerence and seek a neutralization of both 
Vietnam. Cambodia, and Laos, a neutraliza-
tion that would be 'fortified with ironclad 
Lees. 
relith. let ue make an even stronger effort 
to turn this problem over to the United Na-
tions, as was Korea. teo do so effectively we 
would have to agree, whether we liked it or 
itot, to abide by the results of the United 
Nations collective Judgment. in this connee-
don, Secretary General U Thant has been 
:pressing for negotiations: it would be inter-
esting to see it he could come up with some 
;ort of U.N. peacekeeping formula or force. 
Sixth, we mutt accept the fact that no 
imitter whether under Geneva Conference or 
he United Nations auspices, we would have 
talk and negotiate with whomever was at 
the conference table, no matter whether that 
table was convened by the cochairman of the 
aitieva powers or the Secretary General. 
This would inevitably mean we would have 
at negotiate with the Vietcong. 
'The question of dealing with the Vietcong 
ei one that we will have to accept before we 
itcsive at any final settlement. To make an 
eetreme an in connection w/ Ha our own 
.nevolation, no matter whether General 
Washington's forces had woo or lost, the 
British would have had to deal with Wash-
nigton and not with the Government of 
fomace. This would have been true even 
Lbough it was French gold that sustained our 
troops in our [[evolution and there were more 
Wrench troops than American at Yorktown. 
the modern parallel, it seems quite clear 
that we will have to deal eventually with 
the Vietcong, even though they have been 
eupported and decided by the Govern-
ment of North Vietnam?just as our own 
American revolutionaries were supported by 
France. 
Dinned, the reattionship between the Viet-
mug and the North Vietnamese Government 
so close that it is the northern government 
which so far has stated the terms of settle-
ment. These terms were set [(wilt in a four-
part statement by the Premier of North Viet-
nam last Amii in response to President 
Johnson's four-noint proposal made in his 
:ipeech at johns Hopkins. 
While there are considerable differences 
iii the formal language used in each case, it 
seems to me quite apparent that the two sets 
iff proposals are by no means incompatible. 
Both sides, for example, agree to the prin-
ciple of withdrawal of foreign military forces 
and bases, although. the United States, of 
course, stipulates that peace-must come first. 
Both sides agree to the principle that all 
of Vietnam. shall have independence, 
sovereignty and self-rule, although the 
United States makes it clear that South Viet-
naus shall have the clear right to remain 
eriparated from North Vietnam. 
Both sides appear to agree on the need to 
let the people ot Vietnam resolve their prob-
lems without fear of retribution or inter-
[license, although we have made it clear that 
lids must not preclude international 
inspections. 
UM* 11 
drOVR 
And finally, both sides appeax agreed an the 
principle that the people of South Vietnam 
should elect their own government and run 
their own affairs, although I hasten to point 
out that the Communists in this instance 
have attached a crucial, and so :Ear us- accept-
able, condition. 
'The crucial reservation is that self -rule in 
South Vietnam shall be in accordance with 
the problem laid down by the National 
Liberation Front, which in effect is tilt' politi-
cal arm of the Vietcong. This politied pro-
gram, when analyzed combines a meui mix-
ture of double edged slogans and appeals to 
motherhood with insulting expressions about 
the United States. If the insults are re-
moved, the remaining points revolve around 
questions of :semantics. "Progressive democ-
racy' means one thing to a Westerner and 
another to a Communist. 
My seventh and final point is that reinindless 
of the obvious ambiguities and uncertainties, 
we on our side must resolve to implement 
President Johnson's suggestion of List July 
and continuously emphasize our wieingness 
to abide by the Geneva agreement al 1954, 
accepting the results of fairly conducted 
electiors as long as there was specifi: 'ally set 
forth provisions for amnesty and se rety for 
all in Vietnam, North and South. Setee the 
government that might emerge as she end 
result of such elections could devceop into 
a nationalist Communist regime, 1:fi.e that 
of Yugoslavia, there would have to be in-
cluded a plan for expatriation as political 
refugees of any who wished to do so. Borneo 
would, I believe, be the best site for such a 
haven as it is Ooze, climatically sine lar and 
would strenethen the anti-Communist com-
plexion and Government of Malaysia 
Tile national government that would 
emerge being composed of Vielinamsee, that 
government would probably be as h stile as 
it safely could towards the dread Chi raise oc-
topus, its historical enemy to the nor Lb . Be-
cause of this and also because of our :mai na-
tional interest, some sort of ironclad i;uaran-
tees for the safety and independenee of an 
eventually rmnined Vietnam would have to 
be undertaken by other nations, particularly 
by the United States and the Soviet Union. 
We must also face up to the fact that, from 
the viewpollit of the flow of history, our mis-
sion in southeast Asia will prove MiDcult if 
we conceive it as being to create South Viet-
nam in our image or to have it remar I forever 
separated from North Vietnam. Jut as the 
two Germanies will some day be ur Sled, so 
will the two Vietnams. In toto, then, I be-
lieve our mission is to make sure Us tl; when 
this happens, such a unified Vietnam will not 
prove a threat to the peace of the world and 
that our own South Vietnamese allies will not 
Lie maltreated as the result of unifice don. If 
these two steps are achieved, our American 
national security will be adequally pro-
te-cted. 
President Johnson's speeches at Jana Hop-
kins, San Francisco, and in Washir gton on 
July 28, 1965, all open the way for such a 
course. 
But we must, I believe, a imo atwar keep in 
our minds--and our opponents' minds?the 
fact that eur long-range oblectite is to 
.ichieve peace in the area and to avoli indefi-
nite maseive escalation of military operations 
in southeast Asia. 
Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this propo-
sal is very similar to that advanced by 
Pope Paul calling for arbitration by the 
United Nations. 
I congratulate the President on this 
move and pray that they will reward 
his efforts to achieve peace in southeast 
Asia. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, in view 
of the developments over the weekend 
and this morning with respect to the sit-
" AL Dr137' 4 
January 31, 1966 
uation in Vietnam, I should like to sug-
gest to the Senate seven points for peace. 
First. The most important, indeed the 
vital, aspect of our foreign policy for the 
foreseeable future will be our relations 
with Russia and China. The Vietnam 
war is really only an incident in the over-
all relationship?an unfortunate incident 
which I hope we can terminate promptly 
with honor. 
I do not propose to accept defeat in 
Vietnam; neither do I believe we can 
tight a successful war against commu-
nism :to total victory in that area, on that 
terrain, so far away from home in this 
day and age, without accepting unrea-
sonable risk of a worldwide nuclear 
holocaust. Most wars end short of un - 
conditional surrender. I hope this one 
will, with an honorable negotiated settle-
ment. 
Second. A detente with the Soviet Un-
ion on the various matters with respect 
to which we are now in disagreement 
would solve most of the difficulties of 
bringing a just and lasting peace to the 
world. If we could agree with the Rus-
sians on a policy of peaceful coexistends. 
an end to wars of national liberation, a 
solution to the Germany problem, a 
treaty against the further proliferation 
of nuclear weapons, a comprehensive test 
ban treaty, a stay on the deployment of 
anti-missile missiles and meaningful 
progress on disarmament, we would have 
gone a long way toward peace. 
This should be the major objective of 
our foreign policy: To get started as 
quickly as possible on the complex and 
difficult job of collective bargaining with 
the rough, tough negotiators for the 
Soviet Union, to achieve a result which 
is to their economic and social self - 
interest. as well as ours. 
I do not believe this task is impossible; 
but I also do not think our State Depart-
ment is doing nearly enough on our side 
to arrive at that result. 
Third. The Russian-Chinese quarrel is 
serious. We should do nothing to drive 
these Communist giants together. If we 
start bombing Hanoi, if we start bomb-
ing Peiping, not only are we likely to lose 
Saigon but we will throw Russia back 
into the arms of Communist China and 
be confronted again with a monolithic 
and powerful adversary. 
Fourth. China is still in the belliger-
ent stage of its revolution. The Rus-
sians have already learned that military 
solutions to matters in disagreement 
with the West cannot be successful; now 
the Russians can help us get that me:3.-
sage across to China. And that means 
China must learn that its attempt to 
finance and support wars of national 
liberation, as well as its encouragement 
of Hanoi and the Vietcong to press for 
total victory in South Vietnam, work 
against China's long-range interests. 
Fifth. Our diplomacy should turn 
away from the matters which now pre-
occupy it to an overall effort to achieve 
the support of the Soviet Union and the 
Eastern European Communist nations 
in an effort to persuade China that mu-
tual and peaceful coexistence is as es-
sential to her well being as to ours.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1515 
Sixth. World war III is unthinkable. 
Under no circumstances should we even 
contemplate a nuclear war. The bomb-
ing of Peiping, the use of tactical nu-
clear weapons in Vietnam or China, a 
landing on the coast of North Vietnam or 
of China involve an unacceptable risk 
of a holocaust which would destroy 
civilization. I am as strongly against 
preventive war against China now as I 
have been against preventive war against 
the Soviet Union ever since the end of 
World War II. 
Seventh. Resumption of the bombing 
of North Vietnam and escalation of the 
war in South Vietnam through a policy 
of search and destroy make the achieve-
ment of these major objectives of our 
foreign policy difficult if not impossible. 
I commend the President for his deter-
mination to continue to seek negotiations 
under which we may obtain an honor-
able peace. I am delighted that he has 
Instructed Ambassador Goldberg to pre-
sent a new initiative for peace to the 
United Nations Security Council. I am 
pleased that he is cooperating with Pope 
Paul in his efforts to bring about arbi-
tration of the controversy. We must 
terminate the war in Vietnam as promp-
ty as possible to get back to the first 
priority of our foreign policy, which is 
to improve our relations with Russia 
and, with the cooperation of the Soviet 
Union, present a united front against 
the belligerence of the Chinese Com-
munists. 
In this regard, with deep regret, I find 
myself in some disagreement with the 
able and much beloved Senator from 
Vermont [Mr. AIKEN], whom I see in the 
Chamber. 
I would hope that he was unduly pessi-
mistic when he told the Senate this 
morning that we are going to have a long, 
hard war which will be difficult to termi-
nate short of an all-out war in southeast 
Asia. 
I know why he thinks that. I read 
the report to which he was a party with 
five Senators who went to Vietnam. The 
report was prepared by the group of 
which the majority leader was the chair-
man. 
Nobody can tell what the future will 
hold. The Senator from Vermont may 
turn out to be right, but I would hope 
there was enough initiative in our di-
plomacy, with the President at its head. 
and that there will be more and more 
initiative by the State Department than 
we had in the last few years, so we can 
find a solution to this matter before all 
of those American boys will be killed, 
who inevitably will get killed in an effort 
to achieve total victory in southeast Asia. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, I 
commend the Senator from Vermont for 
having opened this discussion on the 
floor of the Senate today. I was one of 
the 15 Senators who signed the letter to 
the President, urging him to delay the 
resumption of bombing of North Viet-
nam. 
The President has chosen to resume 
bombing. I am of the same opinion that 
I was at the time we sent the letter; 
namely, that the military case for bomb-
ing had not been made nor had the dip-
lomatic case for bombing been made. 
In any case, the decision on the part of 
the President has been announced and, 
as other Members of the Senate have in-
dicated, there will be full support by way 
of authorizations and appropriations, I 
am sure, so the method which has been 
decided upon can be pursued as effec-
tively as possible. 
I was pleased that at the same time 
this announcement was made, the matter 
of referring the conflict to the Security 
Council was included. I think it would 
have been more effective from the diplo-
matic viewpoint if the announcement 
about referring it to the Security Coun-
cil had been made separately from the 
announcement about resumption of 
bombing; but, in any event, this is a 
great step forward. 
We have moved, with reference to the 
United Nations, in recent years, as if it 
had no real concern in the Western 
World; as if it were an agency which 
could deal with problems in Europe or 
Asia: but that when it came to prob-
lems involving the United States or the 
Western Hemisphere, somehow or other, 
they should be settled outside the United 
Nations. 
Here we have indicated our confidence 
in the United Nations by preparing to 
take this most serious matter before the 
United Nations itself. 
I think the debate which has been 
carried on on the floor of the Senate and 
the interrogation of administration wit-
nesses before the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee last week have been most helpful 
by way of preparing, at least, for deci-
sions in this most critical area. 
There has been a movement toward a 
more realistic and objective judgment. 
We have come to the knowledge that the 
United States is directly involved in the 
negotiations. Hanoi has publicly an-
nounced that it is one of the principals 
in this dispute. I think we are on the 
verge of acknowledging, too, that the 
Vietcong are a real force in the war in 
South Vietnam. 
. I was interested in noting in the debate 
that there was little or no reference to 
the Tonkin Bay resolution. It is my 
judgment that this resolution has less 
bearing on this matter or discussion than 
any other document. The President re-
ceived no additional grant of authority 
when the resolution was adopted than 
he had before it was adopted. He had 
no more authority after it was passed 
than he had before it was passed. I 
think it does somewhat of a disservice 
to the functions of the Senate to bring 
that matter into the debate. I think it 
tends to discount the power of the Presi-
dent in the resumption of the bombing. 
I am hopeful that, as a result of the 
experience we have had with that resolu-
tion, in the future when similar problems 
may arise and similar dispositions may be 
made, the Senate will be more prone to 
adhere more closely to its traditions 
under the Constitution and may move 
away from a kind of foreign policy by 
way of resolution. I hope it will go back 
to the traditional practices and processes 
under which the Senate has proceeded on 
foreign policy matters, and take only 
formal action, and that we will depend 
more on the Constitution itself. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. McCARTHY. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I am very much inter-
ested in the comments of the Senator 
from Minnesota, particularly toward the 
last of his comments, dealing with the 
resolution of August 1964. 
Last Saturday I introduced a resolu-
tion to rescind that resolution. Accord-
ing to its provisions, it would be subject 
to rescision at any time Congress saw 
fit to rescind the prior resolution. 
I also introduced another resolution 
calling for public?and I stress the word 
"public"?hearings on the whole situa-
tion involving the U.S. war in Vietnam. 
I quite agree with the observation of 
the Senator from Minnesota that Con-
gress ought to take another look at at-
tempts to transfer to the President cer-
tain powers that, in my judgment, under 
the Constitution cannot be transferred 
to him. That is why the Senator from 
Alaska [Mr. GRIYENING], and I have been 
rather lonely voices in the Senate, pro-
testing the resolution of August 1964. 
But that is water over the dam. 
Now we have to decide whether we are 
going to take the American people fur-
ther down the road by Executive order. 
Once again, from the floor of the Senate, 
I warn the American people that we are 
being led down the road away from a 
constitutional 'form of government based 
upon three coordinate and equal 
branches of government and being made 
to travel down the road of Executive 
power. 
History is replete with examples that 
when the power of self-government is in 
fact turned over to the Executive?I 
care not under what form of govern-
ment?the loss of freedom develops. 
I have introduced this resolution in the 
interest of my country. The preservation 
of our constitutional system of three 
equal and coordinate branches of gov-
ernment is more important than the 
powers which the President may seek to 
add to Executive power. 
Under this administration we have 
traveled far down the road toward gov-
ernment by Executive power. That is 
why I think the previous resolution ought 
to be rescinded and the President ought 
to come down before Congress and ask 
for a declaration of war. When he does 
come here it is my prediction that the 
American people will repudiate him. 
Mr. McCARTHY. As the Senator 
knows, I too am concerned about our 
constitutional responsibility in the Sen-
ate in the field of foreign policy and 
about the need that there be a sharing 
of that responsibility between the Senate 
and the President. 
The Constitution as drafted by the 
Founders did not really set one branch 
against the other, the executive against 
the legislative, particularly the Senate; 
but provided for a sharing of decisions. 
At the time the Constitution was 
drafted, it was assumed that there would 
be a declaration of war and a treaty 
which would settle that dispute. It was 
assumed that there then would be a 
period of stability of 10 or 20 or 30 years. 
This is no longer the case. The fact 
that history is different now does not pre-

1516 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE 
elude the Senate from following those 
procedures or establishing procedures so 
it can, with the Executive, share its part 
of the burden. 
I am concerned over statements by 
some Members of the Senate who say we 
must trust the military with this prob-
lem, that this problem is one of military 
action, and that we should not question 
the generals, but trust them. 
If we were to accept that philosophy as 
a part of our foreign policy, we could 
then proceed to a programing in the 
State Department and eventually a 
methodology by which the President 
would determine the principles, and then 
the principles would then determine the 
kind of action we might take. We cannot 
run such a risk. 
In the past the Western nations have 
been protected because of the lag that 
has obtained between the time of the new 
engagement and the invention of new 
weapons. Weapons of the previous con 
Wet were used. We have been saved be-
cause of the fact that we were fighting 
with weapons of a previous war. 
The danger in 1966 is that we will 
tight with modern weapons, with result-
ing disaster. 
'10 ask the Senate to trust the military, 
as some have asked us to do, is to ask the 
Senate to repudiate its duties under the 
Constitution and its responsibilities un-
der the Consituion. I and many other 
Senators do not intend to give up those 
responsibilities. 
Mr. FELL. Mr. President--
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the 
Senator wilt permit the Chair to ask. Is 
there further morning business? Do 
Senators wish to speak in the morning 
hour? 
Mr. MANSFIELD, Mr. President, be-
[ore the distinguished Senator from 
Rhode Island I Mr. PELL] begins his dis-
cussion on H.R. 77, I would like to make 
a comment relative to the tenor of the 
debate in the Senate Chamber today. 
I am delighted that the Senator from 
Vermont I Mr. AIKEN], the ranking Re-
publican in this body, and one of our 
most senior Members, saw fit to launch 
the debate on southeast Asia. He did so 
with his usual calm and understanding, 
with his full awareness of the potentiali-
ties of the situation that confronts us. 
fie did so in his usual, wise, and con-
siderate manner. I am delighted that 
the "owl" undertook to launch the de-
bate. I am delighted with the debate 
that has taken place today, because there 
were no personalities involved. It was 
carried on in the traditions of the Senate. 
I think this discussion was long over--
due, and it is to be hoped that we will 
have more of such debate in the future. 
Mr. HAR.T. Mr. President, the RECORD 
earlier today will show I was present. 
Having read my mail, if I did not say a 
word as this debate closed I would be 
ecolded by those at home who do know 
the answers?and not all of these knowl-
edgeable persons are at home; some are 
here. 
Very frankly, I doubt I can contribute 
anything that has not already been said. 
I do wish that in this Congress as well 
as in this country there would be a little 
more willingness to be tentative. tenta,-
-,1*,,,001,4101011.1M10.. 
edfarRel 
tive in our judgments of what the history 
of the moment requires, tentative in our 
judgment of the motives of others, both 
those who speak and those who sit and 
listen and think. 
It is unfortunate that a Member of 
1;h:is body feels he must rise and say some-
thing lest he be clobbered as forfeiting 
responsibility. It takes no courage to get 
up and speak for peace. I can think of 
no shorter cut to popularity. 
I think all of us hoped that the Presi-
dent would be able to arrive at a de-
cision that would avoid resumotion of 
aerial bombing. Some have publicly 
voiced that hope; others of us have ad-
vised him privately that we woald hope 
that on all the facts?some of which we 
cannot know?relevant to such judg-
ment, this course could be followed. 
If I thought resumption of bombing 
was merely the frustrated response of a 
giant power like the United States which 
says to a smaller country, ?Forward 
march," and the country does n4:t march, 
then I would rise in protest. 
But I am convinced ? that there is no 
man in this country or in this we rid more 
anxious to see us get to a confer( ace table 
under circumstances which will establish 
conditions for a peace that is real, one 
that will not come back to haunt our 
children. 
We could obtain a peace easily. We 
could leave Vietnam?that would give us 
peace?and in the lifetimes of most of 
the Members of this body, it probably 
would not make any difference, except 
to reduce our taxes. But if it was mis-
read by others in the world it might have 
enormous implications for our children. 
Mr. President, I suppose that what 1 
am really saying is that?as other Sena-
tors have voiced this morning? I am de-
lighted that the President has referred 
this issue to the United Nations. Read 
Ambassador Goldberg's message to the 
Security Council President, please. But, 
as others have cautioned, this is no short-
cut, either. The harshest note on which 
this debate could close would be to sug-
gest that there are some problems in this 
world that are never solved. But it is a 
hard truth. We know it to be true in our 
family life, and history tells us that it is 
true with respect to the family i.e nations 
and their problems. 
There are some Ph. D.'s in listory in 
the Senate. I am not one, but I have the 
impression that we will find th is lesson 
throughout history, especially in our re-
lations with the rest of the world, or the 
nations' relations with other nations?
the lesson that for some problems no 
answer really is at hand, no matter how 
decently disposed are all parties. 
For most of 300 years, the underlying 
problem in European history was the 
conflict between Christianity and the 
Moslem world. It was a problem that 
was never solved. This did not excuse 
those living in a particular generation 
from seeking to resolve, to compromise 
or to modify it. But notwithstanding all 
such efforts no one solved it, and it was 
sort of absorbed by other problems?the 
Renaissance, the age of discovery, the 
machine age. 
The relationship between thi . free so-
cieties and the less free societies is the 
January 3 I , 19f.i6 
problem which confronts us today, the 
beginning point of which usually is 
marked by the attitude that developed 
in Russia about 1920. Conceivably this 
relationship is one of of those problems 
which never really is solved. I sus-
pect it is. And it is for this reason, I 
suspect, also, that my children will find 
Vietnams around the world in their life-
times, too; and finding them, I hope that 
they will not say that their fathers could 
have solved the problem merely by get-
ting up and making a speech. In our 
search for intermediate solutions we 
must not wonder whether someone else's 
devotion to his country is any less than 
our own just because he has trouble being 
as convinced of the wisdom of our own 
suggestion as we are; we must acknowl-
edge the necessarily tentative nature of 
our own judgments. 
As human beings, we are fallible, and 
we will remain fallible, even if we talk 
here for a month. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Michigan yield at 
that point? 
Mr. HART. I am glad to yield to the 
Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I 
should like very much to associate my-
self with the remarks and observations 
just made by the distinguished Senator 
from Michigan [Mr. HART]. 
There is another part to this story 
that should be told, for the benefit of the 
American people. 
As a member of the Subcommittee on 
Appropriations for the Defense Depart-
ment, it has been my responsibility and 
my opportunity to sit in at the recent 
hearings that we have held with relation 
to the $12 billion and some. $348 million 
which is being asked to conduct whatever 
needs to be done in the next fiscal year in 
Vietnam. 
I have been quite impressed with what 
has been stated by the Senator from 
Michigan this afternoon. I regret very 
much that I was not in the Chamber 
when other Senators spoke on this sub-
ject, but I was encouraged and very 
much impressed by the attitude and the 
statements made by Mr. McNamara, 
Secretary of Defense, before that hear-
ing. 
Many people do not know this, but, 
here is a man who has been bandied 
about around this country, who has been 
accused of conducting what has been. 
characterized as "McNamara's war. 
Yet, at that very meeting there were 
many responsible and sincere Members 
of this body who were badgering the 
Secretary of Defense?when I use the 
word "badgering," I use it in the kind-
liest sense--to go the full limit and do 
everything that was absolutely necessary' 
in order to win the conflict in Vietnam. 
And of course, that is appealing. That 
sounds very fine. Who does not wish to 
win? Yet this man sat there with the 
calmness and the patience of Job, ex-
plaining that what we were trying to do 
was to achieve a limited political goal 
in Vietnam, and that in order to do it 
we had to conduct a restrained offensive. 
That is the policy of our Government--
a restrained offensive. 
In other words, Mr. President.. what we 
are trying to do is to avert that one net

January 31, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 1517 
which will set off the trigger of an atomic 
or a thermonuclear war that might burn 
this entire world. 
I would hope that in our anxiety to see 
results, we are not going to commit that 
one act of indiscretion, of injudicious-
ness, which might compel other nations 
to possibly live up to their commit-
ments?whatever they may be?and in-
ject themselves into the fray, where they 
do not belong, and touch off a nuclear or 
thermonuclear holocaust. That is the 
one thing that the administration is try-
ing to avert. 
Now the question may be asked: If that 
is the case, why did we resume bombing? 
I have heard evidence on that ques-
tion, too. Since the cessation of the 
bombing, there has been a terrific build-
up in South Vietnam, so much so that the 
President of the United States, who is 
responsible for the safety and security of 
195,000 American soldiers who are com-
mitted there must now make a decision 
on bombing. We will continue, as we did 
in the past, not to try to overturn the 
Hanoi government, not to commit that 
one act which might compel Red China 
and Russia to come into this conflict, but 
at the same time make them understand 
that they cannot win by violence, that 
they cannot subject other peoples to their 
will through violence, and that America 
will open wide and keep open wide the 
door to bring this issue from the battle-
field to the negotiating table. 
That is all that the President of the 
United States is trying to do, the one man 
who has the power, the one man who has 
the responsibility of making this decision. 
Senators can sit here. They can de-
bate. They can say what they believe. 
I daresay that if we are wrong on this 
31st day of January 1966, we can come 
into the Chamber tomorrow, the 1st day 
of February 1966, and take another 
guess. 
But, the President of the United States 
cannot have that second guess. He has 
to be right. He has to do what is right 
in the eyes of the world, and what is right 
for the safety of those 195,000 American 
soldiers now in Vietnam. 
It is debatable whether we should have 
gone into Vietnam when we did, in the 
first place. But, the fact is that we are 
there now, and that we are holding a bull 
by the tail. We have such a divergence 
of opinion in this body as to emphasize 
the task of the man at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, and I wish to join my colleagues 
In saying here, on the afternoon of Jan-
uary 31, 1966, that I pray to God that 
Lyndon Johnson is right. I pray to God 
that he will do the things that must be 
done to bring this issue from the battle-
field to the negotiating table. 
I thank the President, and I thank my 
colleagues. 
Mr. HART. I am very grateful for the 
comments of the Senator from Rhode 
Island. There is one aspect which this 
debate should not belabor, and which 
the Senator from Rhode Island wisely 
mentioned at the end of his remarks: 
Should we have been in Vietnam in the 
first place? 
Argument on this point can be raised 
in a number of ways. But the over-
whelming fact of life is that we are now 
there. It is like telling the pedestrian in 
the middle of a 10-lane highway that he 
should not be there. "Fine," he will say, 
"but how do I get out?" 
It is like a social worker telling the 
troubled, abandoned mother of 13 chil-
dren, "You should not have had so large 
a family; you should have seen me 13 
years ago." 
Let us not spin our wheels on what 
might or should have been. The Presi-
dent cannot indulge in such luxury and 
I think we should not. Much of value 
has been spoken this morning and from 
both sides of the aisle. Certainly no 
comment will be of greater value than 
the brief but eloquent observation by the 
thoughtful majority leader, Mr. MANS-
FIELD. As we close this debate I want to 
thank him and the distinguished Sen-
ator from Vermont [Mr. AIKEN] for set-
ting a theme which has encouraged 
thoughtful comment. 
DISTRICT OFFICIAL CRITICIZES 
PROPOSED ABOLITION OF 
SCHOOL MILK 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I 
have been inviting the attention of Sen-
ators to the sad effect of the cut by the 
Budget Bureau in school milk funds ap-
propriated by Congress and to the pro-
posed elimination of most of the school 
milk program. 
No justification has been given for this 
slash. It would not save a penny for 
the taxpayer. It would simply deprive 
schoolchildren of milk and increase the 
excess stocks of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation. 
Without leaving Washington, any 
Member of Congress can see the stupid-
ity of this action. 
Here in the District of Columbia, of-
ficials have followed an excellent and 
unique policy?alone of American major 
cities?by providing totally free milk 
daily to all elementary public schoolchil-
dren and to children in participating 
private schools regardless of economic 
need. 
Mrs. Aleta Swingle, District schools 
food service director, has called this ac-
tion a "tremendous loss to the District." 
I ask unanimous consent that an arti-
cle in the Washington Star, reporting 
Mrs. Swingle's reaction, be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
SCHOOL AID RAPS PLAN To ABOLISH U.S. 
MILK SUBSIDY 
A cut in the Federal milk subsidy for 
school children proposed in President John-
son's Department of Agriculture budget 
would be a tremendous loss to the District," 
the District of Columbia school food service_ 
director said today.' 
The President's budget proposes eliminat-
ing an average 3.19 cents per half-pint sub-
sidy on milk provided to all children regard-
less of need, and concentrating instead on 
making totally free milk available to needy 
children. 
Mrs. Aleta E. Swingle, District schools food 
service director, said if the elimination of 
the subsidy is accepted by Congress, elemen-
tary school children in the District who do 
not qualify because of need would probably 
have to buy their milk at 5 cents a half pint. 
The District has been unique among ma-
jor cities in providing totally free milk daily 
to all elementary public school children and 
to children in participating private schools, 
regardless of economic need. 
A free half pint has been provided for 
about 20 years and this school year a sec-
ond half pint was provided, financed mainly 
by Federal impact aid funds. 
The District gets about 61 million from 
the Federal subsidy, 6275,000 from District 
funds and $200,000 from impact aid funds 
for the milk program. At the junior and 
senior high school level milk is also sub-
sidized, but children pay 2 cents a half pint. 
111L1 
BALL GIVES FIRST HISTORIC AND 
GLOBAL JUSTIFICATION FOR 
UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, in 
the view of foreign policy experts, the 
speech by Under Secretary of State 
George Ball yesterday on Vietnam is of 
first-rank importance. 
It is said that this speech by Under 
Secretary Ball marks the first time the 
Johnson administration has explained in 
full detail its world view of why we are 
in Vietnam. 
The President has been an eloquent 
and frequent defender of our policies in 
Vietnam for many months. 
But the Ball speech now puts the U.S. 
involvement into full historic perspec-
tive. 
In the administration's view as ex-
pressed by Ball, we are not simply in 
Vietnam to repel local aggression, or to 
stop a militant Communist regime. We 
are in Vietnam "to prevent the Commu-
nists from upsetting the fragile balance 
of power through force or the use of 
force." 
Ball sees the closest historic analogy 
to our position in Vietnam in the 1947--
48 war in Greece, when the clear aggres-
sion of the Communists was decisively 
and successfully met by the Truman ad-
ministration. 
Secretary Ball documents the conten-
tion that Vietnam is not a civil war, but 
clear aggression by North Vietnam. 
Ball also emphasizes that if Commu-
nist China is allowed to move into Viet-
nam, it "would mean according to China 
a status it had never been able to achieve 
by its own efforts throughout the ages." 
The Under Secretary also calls our at-
tention to the fact that Communist Rus-
sia has changed since the United States 
and Europe "built a dam" to contain 
Communist ambitions. Ball argues that,

holding back Chinese ambitions may 
similarly bring "a peaceful relation with

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

1518 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE January 31, 1966 
alumnus of Northwestern University. I took 
my degree from the undergraduate school 
in 1930. More than a third of a century has 
passed since that time. 
'Mat period of more than one-third of a 
century has been a fortunate time in which 
to live, an exciting time of change and fer-
ment?particularly for an American. For 
during that third of a century our country 
ceased to be a voice offstage and moved to 
the center of world affairs. 
When I received my first degree from 
Northwestern University many Americans 
pretended that the rest of the world did not 
exist. We were still bemused by isolationism 
as we had been ever since we rejected the 
League of Nations in the early twenties. We 
were self-centered and self-deluding--so 
much so that when we faced the spectacle 
of the Western World in flames from Hitler's 
lunatic ambitions, many Americans quite 
solemnly contended that this was none of 
our affair. 
But history has forced us to grow up. We 
have faced the harsh realities of danger and 
responsibility?and acquitted ourselves 
with honor and courage, as befits a great 
Power. 
For we are indubitably a great power to-
day--a very different country from what we 
were in 1930?a wiser, more mature, and more 
responsible country. Our economy is four 
times as large?our role in world affairs many 
times as great. 
Most of the western European nations--
which in the thirties controlled vast areas 
of the globe?are today largely preoccupied 
with their own affairs. Today we garrison 
the distant outposts of the world, not in sup-
port of colonial interests, but in fulfillment 
of world responsibilities. Six hundred thou-
sand of our countrymen are in uniform over-
seas. We are providing some form of eco-
nomic assistance to more than 95 countries. 
And an America once determined to keep out 
of entangling alliances now has more than 
40 allies on five continents. 
Today also we are lighting a shooting war 
in a country that until recently for most 
Americans was only an exotic place-name on 
the map of a distant continent. 
Our engagement in Vietnam is but one 
aspect of the world role we are playing. But 
because we arc spending both lives and re-
sources in that faraway land because the is-
sue being decided profoundly affects our for-
tunes and our future, I should like to talk 
with you today about how we got there and 
why we must stay. 
'ffile beginning of wisdom with regard to 
Vietnam is to recognize that what Americans 
are fighting for in the jungles and rice 
paddies of that unhappy land is not a local 
conflict, an isolated war that has meaning 
only for one part of the world. 
We can properly understand the struggle 
in Vietnam only if we recognize it for what 
ii; is, part of a vast and continuing struggle 
in which we have been engaged for more 
than two decades. 
like most of the conflicts that have plagued 
the world in recent years, the conflict in Viet-
nam is a product of the great shifts and 
changes triggered by the Second World War. 
Out of the war, two continentwide powers 
emerged, the United States and the Soviet 
Union. The colonial systems through which 
the nations of Western Europe had governed 
more than a third of the people of the world 
were, one by one, dismantled. The Soviet 
Union under Stalin embarked on a reckless 
coarse of seeking to extend Communist 
power. An Iron Curtain was erected to en-
close large areas of the globe. At the same 
time, man was learning to harness the power 
of the exploding sun, and technology made 
mockery of time and distance. 
The result of these vast changes?com-
pressed within the breathless span of two 
decades?was to bring about a drastic rear-
rangement of the power structure of the 
world. 
This rearrangement of power has resulted 
in a very uneasy equilibrium of forces. 
For even while the new national boundaries 
Were still being marked on the map, the 
Soviet Union under Stalin exploited the con-
fusion to push out the perimeter of its 
power and influence in an effort to extend 
the outer limits of Communist domination 
by force or the threat of force. 
This process threatened the freedom of the 
world. It had to be checked and checked 
quickly. By launching the Marshell plan to 
restore economic vitality to the nations of 
Western Europe and by forming NATO?a 
powerful Western alliance reinforced by U.S. 
resources and military power?America and 
the free nations of Europe built a dam to 
hold back the further encroachment of Com-
munist ambitions. 
This decisive action succeeded brilliantly. 
NATO, created in 1949, stopped tile spread 
of communism over Western Europe and 
the northern Mediterranean. But the world 
was given no time to relax. The victory of 
the Chinese Communists in that same year 
posed a new threat of Communist expan-
sion against an Asia in ferment. Just as 
the Western World had mobilized its resist-
ance against Communist force in Europe, 
WO had to create an effective counterforce 
in the Far East if Communist domination 
were not to spread like a lava flow over the 
whole area. 
Tile first test came quickly in Korea. 
There the United Nations forces?predomi-
nantly American?stopped the drive of 
Communist North Korea, supported by ma-
teriel front the Soviet Union. It stopped a 
vast Chinese Army that followed. It brought 
to a halt the Communist drive to push out 
the line that had been drawn and to estab-
lish Communist control over the whole 
Korean peninsula. 
The Korean war was fought from a central 
conviction?that the best hope for freedom 
and security in the world depended on 
maintaining the Integrity of the postwar 
arrangements. Stability could be achieved 
only by making sure that the Communist 
world did not expand by destroying those 
arrangements by force and threat?and 
thus upsetting the precarious power balance 
between the two sides of the Iron Curtain. 
It was this conviction that led to our firm 
stand in Korea. It was this conviction that 
led America, in the years immedLltely after 
Korea, to build a barrier around the whole 
periphery of the Communist world by en-
couraging in the creation of a series of alli-
ances and commitments from the eastern 
edge of the NATO area to the Pe cific. 
The SEATO treaty that was signed in 
1954 was part of that barrier, that structure 
of alliances. It was ratified by the Senate 
by a vote of 82 to 1. 
Under that treaty and its protocol, the 
United States and other treaty partners gave 
their joint and several pledges to guarantee 
existing boundaries--including the line of 
demarcation between North and South Viet-
nam established when the French relin-
quished their control over Indochina. 
Since then three Presidents have reinforced 
that guarantee by further commitments 
given directly to the Republic of Vietnam. 
And on August 10, 1964, the Senate by a vote 
of 88 to 2 and the House by a vote of 416 to 0 
adopted a joint resolution declaring their 
support for these commitments. 
Today we are living up to those commit-
ments by helping South Vietnam, defend 
itself from the onslaught of Communist 
force?just as we helped Iran in 1946, Greece 
and Turkey in 1947, Formosa and Korea in 
1950, and Berlin since 1948. 
The bloody encounters in the highlands 
around Pleiku and the rice paddies of the 
Mekong Delta are thus in a real sense battles 
2 
and skirmishes in a continuing war to pre-
vent one Communist power after another 
from violating internationally recognized 
boundary lines fixing the outer limits of 
Communist dominion. 
When we think of Vietnam, we think of 
Korea. In Vietnam, as in Korea, the Com-
munists in one part of a divided country 
lying on the periphery of China have sought. 
by force to gain dominion over the whole. 
But in terms; of tactics on the ground Greece' 
Is a closer analogy. For there, 20 years ago. 
as in South Vietnam today, the Communists 
sought to achieve their purpose by what is 
known in their lexicon as a war of national 
liberation. 
They chose this method of aggression botl-, 
in Greece and Vietnam because tactics of ter--
ror and sabotage, of stealth and subversion 
give a great advantage to a disciplined ann 
ruthless minority, particularly where, as in 
those two countries, the physical terrain 
made concealment easy and impeded the use 
of heavy weapons. 
But the Communists also have a more 
subtle reason for favoring this type of ag-
gression. It creates in any situation an ele-
ment of confusion, a sense of ambiguity that 
can, they hope, so disturb and divide free 
men as to prevent them from making com-
mon cause against it. 
This ambiguity is the central point of de-
bate in the discussions that have surrounded 
the South Vietnam problem. Is the war in 
South Vietnam an external aggression from 
the North, or is it an indigenous revolt? 
This is a question that Americans quite 
properly ask?and one to which they deserve 
a satisfactory answer. It is a question which 
we who have official responsibilities have 
necessarily probed in great depth. For if the 
Vietnam war were merely what the Commu-
nists say it is, an indigenous rebellion, then 
the United States would have no business 
taking sides in the conflict and helping one 
side to defeat the other by force of arms. 
The evidence on the character of the Viet-
nam war is voluminous. Its rneaning se-ems 
clear enough: The North Vietnamese re-
gime in Hanoi systemically created the Viet-
cong forces; it provides their equipment; it 
mounted the guerrilla war?and it controls 
that war from Hanoi on a day-to-day basis. 
The evidence shows clearly enough that--
at the time of French withdrawal?when 
Vietnam was divided in the settlement of 
1954, the Communist regime in Hanoi never 
Intended that South Vietnam should de-
velop in freedom. Many Communists fight-
ing with the Viet Minh army were directed 
to stay in the south, to cache away their 
arms, and ter do everything possible to under-
mine the South Vietnamese Government. 
Others-80,000 in all?were ordered to the 
north for training in the North Vie Lnaincse 
Army. 
The evidence is clear enough also that the 
Communist rulers of the north resorted t3 
guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam only 
when the success of the South Vietnam Gov-
ernment persuaded them that they could net 
achieve their designs by subversion alone. 
In September 1960, the Lao Donn Party- - 
the Communist Party in North Vietnam---
held its third party congress in Hanoi. That 
congress called for the creation of a front 
organization to undertake the subversion 
of South Vietnam. Within 2 or 3 months 
thereafter, the National Liberation Frost 
was established to provide a political facade 
for the conduct of an active guerrilla war. 
Beginning early that year the Hanoi regime 
began to infiltrate across the demarcation 
line the disciplined Communists whom the 
party had ordered north at the time of the 
settlement. In the intervening period since 
1954 those men had been trained in the arts 
of proselytizing, sabotage and subversion. 
Now they were ordered to conscript young 
men from the villages by force or persuasion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
and to form cadres around which guerrilla 
units could be built. 
Beginning over a year ago, the Communists 
apparently exhausted their reservoir of 
southerners who had gone north. Since then 
the greater number of men infiltrated into 
the south have been native-born North 
Vietnamese. Most recently, Hanoi has be-
gun to infiltrate elements of the North Viet-
namese Army in increasing larger numbers. 
Today, there is evidence that nine regiments 
of regular North Vietnamese forces are fight-
ing in organized units in the south. 
I mention these facts?which are familiar 
enough to most of you?because they are 
fundamental to our policy with regard to 
Vietnam. These facts, it seems to us, make 
it clear beyond question that the war in 
South Vietnam has few of the attributes of 
an indigenous revolt. It is a cynical and 
systematic aggression by the North Viet-
namese regime against the people of South 
Vietnam. It is one further chapter in the 
long and brutal chronicle of Communist ef-
forts to extend the periphery of Communist 
power by force and terror. 
This point is at the heart of our determi-
nation to stay the course in the bloody con-
test now underway in South Vietnam. It 
also necessarily shapes our position with re-
gard to negotiations. 
The President, Secretary Rusk, and all 
spokesmen for the administration have stated 
again and again that the United States is 
prepared to join in unconditional discus-
sions of the Vietnamese problem in an effort 
to bring about a satisfactory political solu-
tion. But so far the regime in Hanoi has 
refused to come to the bargaining table 
except on the basis of quite unacceptable 
conditions. One among several such condi-
tions, but one that has been widely de-
bated in the United States, is that we must 
recognize the National Liberation Front as 
the representative, indeed, as the sole repre-
sentative, of the South Vietnamese people. 
Yet to recognize the National Liberation 
Front in such a capacity would do violence 
to the truth and betray the very people 
whose liberty we are fighting to secure. The 
National Liberation Front is not a political 
entity expressing the will of the people of 
South Vietnam?or any substantial element 
of the South Vietnamese population. It is a 
facade fabricated by the Hanoi regime to 
confuse the issue and elaborate the myth 
of an indigenous revolt. 
History is not obscure on this matter. As 
I noted earlier, the creation of the front was 
announced by the North Vietnam Commu-
nist Party?the Lao Dong Party?in 1960, 
soon after the North Vietnam military leader, 
General Giap announced that: "The north 
is the revoluntionary base for the whole 
country." But the Hanoi regime, while ap-
plauding its creation, has taken little pains 
to give the ?front even the appearance of 
authenticity. 
The individuals proclaimed as the leaders 
of the front are not personalities widely 
known to the South Vietnamese people?
or, indeed, to many members of the Vietcong. 
They are not revolutionary heroes or na-
tional figures. They have little meaning to 
the ordinary Vietcong soldier who fights 
and dies in the jungles and rice paddies. 
Instead, the names he carries into battle 
are those of "Uncle Ho," Ho Chi Minh, the 
President of the North Vietnamese regime, 
and General Giap, its military hero. When 
Vietcong prisoners are asked during interro-
gation whether they are members of the 
National Liberation Front, they customarily 
reply that they owe allegiance to the Lao 
Dong?the Communist Party of North Viet-
nam?which is the equivalent of the Hanoi 
Communist regime. 
The front, then, is unmistakably what its 
name implies, a Communist front organiza-
No. 15-.---7 
tion created to Mask the activities of Hanoi 
and to further the illusion of an indigenous 
revolt. 
The name of the organization was care-
fully chosen. It bears the same name as the 
National Liberation Front of Algeria. But 
there the resemblance ends, for the Algerian 
front did, in fact, represent a substantial part 
of the Algerian population. It played a 
major role in an insurgency that was clearly 
an indigenous movement and not an aggres-
sion imposed from outside. 
The Algerian Front, moreover, commanded 
the respect and, indeed, the obedience of 
the people. When It called a strike, the 
city of Algiers virtually closed down. By 
contrast, the front in Vietnam has shown its 
fictional character by revealing its own im-
potence. On two occasions, it has called for 
a general strike. These calls have been to-
tally ignored by the people of South Viet-
nam. 
The Algerian front was a vital force in the 
Algerian community. It secured the overt 
allegiance of the old, established Moslem 
groups and leaders. As the revolt progressed, 
Moslems serving in the Algerian Assembly 
and even in the French Parliament an-
nounced their support for the front. 
But the front in Vietnam has utterly failed 
in its efforts to attract the adherence of any 
established group within the society?wheth-
er Buddhist, Christian, or any of the sects 
that form substantial elements in Viet-
namese life. 
Quite clearly, the people of South Vietnam, 
if they are aware of the front at all, know 
it for what it is: the political cover for a 
North Vietnamese effort to take over the 
south?in practical effect, the southern arm 
of the North Vietnamese Communist Party. 
To be sure, the Vietcong military forces in-
clude a number of indigenous southerners 
under northern control. Neither the United 
States nor the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment has ever questioned that fact. But the 
composition of the Vietcong military forces 
is not the issue when one discusses the role 
of the front. The issue is whether the front 
has any color of claim as a political entity 
to represent these indigenous elements. 
The evidence makes clear that it does not. 
It is purely and simply a factitious organiza-
tion created by Hanoi to reinforce a fiction. 
To recognize it as the representative of the 
South Vietnamese population would be to 
give legitimacy to that fiction. 
The true party in interest on the enemy 
side?the entity that has launched the attack 
on the South Vietnamese Government for its 
own purposes, the entity that has created, 
controlled, and supplied the fighting forces 
of the Vietcong from the beginning?is the 
North Vietnamese regime in Hanoi. And 
it is failure of that regime to come to the 
bargaining table that has so far frustrated 
every effort to move the problem of South 
Vietnam from a military to a political 
solution. 
In spite of these clear realities, we have 
not taken, nor de we take, an obdurate or 
unreasoning attitude with regard to the 
front. The President said in his state of the 
Union message, "We will meet at any con-
ference table, we will discuss any proposals-
4 points, or 14, or 40?and we will consider 
the views of any group" and that, of course, 
includes the front along with other groups. 
As the President has also said, this false 
issue of the front would never prove an insur-
mountable problem if Hanoi were prepared 
for serious negotiations. But we cannot, to 
advance the political objectives of the Com-
munist regime in Hanoi, give legitimacy to a 
spurious organization as though it spoke for 
the people of South Vietnam. 
A European friend once critically observed 
that Americans have "a sense of mission but 
1519 
no sense of history." That accusation is, I 
think, without warrant. 
We do have a sense of history and it is that 
which enables us to view the war in South 
Vietnam for what it is. We Americans know 
that it is not, as I have said earlier, a local 
conflict; it is part of a continuing struggle 
to prevent the Communists from upsetting 
the fragile balance of power through force or 
the threat of force. 
To succeed in that struggle we must resist 
every Communist effort to destroy by aggres-
sion the boundaries and demarcation lines 
established by the postwar arrangements. 
We cannot pick and choose among these 
boundaries. We cannot defend Berlin and 
yield Korea. We cannot recognize one com-
mitment and repudiate another without tear-
ing and weakening the entire structure on 
which the world's security depends. 
Some thoughtful critics of our Vietnamese 
policy both in Europe and America challenge 
this. They maintain that the West should 
not undertake to defend the integrity of all 
lines of demarcation even though they may 
be underwritten in formal treaties. They 
contend that many of these lines are unna-
tural since they do not conform to the geo-
political realities as they see them. They 
contend in particular that?since the passing 
of colonialism?the Western powers have no 
business mixing in the affairs of the Asian 
mainland. They imply that, regardless of our 
commitments, we should not try to prevent 
Red China from establishing its hegemony 
over the east Asian landmass south of the 
Soviet Union. 
Proponents of this view advance two prin-
cipal arguments to support their thesis. 
They contend that the very weight of Chinese 
power, its vast population, and its consequent 
ability to mobilize immense mass armise en-
titles it to recognition as the controlling force 
of southeast Asia. 
As a second reason for acknowledging the 
Chinese hegemony, they contend that for 
centuries China has maintained a dominant 
cultural and political influence throughout 
the area. 
They claim, therefore, that southeast Asia 
lies within the Chinese sphere of influence 
and that we should let the Chinese redraw 
the lines of demarcation to suit themselves 
without regard to the wishes of the southeast 
Asian people. 
This argument, it seems to me, does not 
provide an acceptable basis for U.S. policy. 
The assertion that China through hun-
dreds of years of history has held sway over 
southeast Asia is simply not accurate. Suc-
cessive Chinese Empires sought by force to 
establish such sway, but they never succeeded 
in doing so, except in certain sectors for lim-
ited periods. For the people of southeast 
Asia have, over the centuries, shown an ob-
stinat e insistence on shaping their own 
destiny which the Chinese have not been able 
to overcome. 
To adopt the sphere of influence approach 
now advocated would, therefore, not mean 
allowing history to repeat itself. It would 
mean acoording to China a status it had 
never been able to achieve by its own efforts 
throughout the ages. It would mean sen-
tencing the people of southeast Asia against 
their will to indefinite servitude behind the 
Bamboo Curtain. And it would mean turn-
ing our back on the principles that have 
formed the basis of Western policy in the 
whole postwar era. 
Nor can one seriously insist that geograph-
ical propinquity establishes the Chinese 
right to dominate. At a time when man can 
circle the earth in 90 minutes, there is little 
to support such a literal commitment to 19th-
century geopolitics. It is a dubious policy 
that would permit the accidents of geography 
to deprive peoples of their right to determine

1520 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
their own future free from external force., 
The logic of that policy has dark implica-
tions. It would rationalize the greed of great 
powers. It would imperil the prospects for 
developing and maintaining an equilibrium 
of power in the world. 
The principles of the United Nations Char-
ter are doctrinally more in tune with the 
aspirations of 20th-century man. 
This does not mean, however, that the 
political shape of the world should be re-
garded as frozen in an intractable pattern; 
that the boundaries established by the post-
war arrangements are necessarily sacrosanct 
and immutable. Indeed, some of the lines of 
demarcation drawn after the Second World 
War were explicitly provisional and were to 
be finally determined in political settlements 
yet to come. This was true in Germany, in 
Korea and In South Vietnam as well. 
But those settlements have not yet been 
achieved, and we cannot permit their resolu-
tion to be pre-empted by force. This is the 
1.3.Slle in Vietnam. This is what we are fight-
ing for. This is why we are there. 
We have no ambition to stay there any 
longer than is necessary. We have made 
repeatedly clear that the United States seeks 
no territory in southeast Asia. We wish no 
military bases. We do not desire to destroy 
the regime in Hanoi or to remake it in a 
Western pattern. The United States will not 
retain American forces in South Vietnam 
once peace is assured. The countries of 
southeast Asia can be nonalined or neu-
tral, depending on the will of the people. 
We support free elections in South Vietnam 
as soon as violence has been eliminated and 
the South Vietnamese people can vote with-
out intimidation. We look forward to free 
elections? and we will accept the result as a 
democratic people are accustomed to do. Yet 
we have little doubt about the outcome, for 
we are confident that the South ,Vietnamese 
who have fought hard for their freedom will 
not be the first people to give up that free-
dom to communism in a free exercise of 
self-determination. 
Whether the peoples of the two parts of 
Vietnam will wish to unite is again for them 
to decide as soon as they are in a position to 
do so freely. Like other options, that of re-
unification must be preserved. 
In the long run our hopes for the people 
of South Vietnam reflect our hopes for peo-
ple everywhere. What we seek is a world 
living in peace and freedom, a world in 
which the cold war, with its tensions and 
conflicts, can recede into history. We are 
seeking to build a world in which men and 
nations will recognize and act upon a 
strongly shared interest in peace and in in-
ternational cooperation for the common 
good. 
We should not despair of these objectives 
even though at the moment they seem rather 
unreal and Idealistic. For we would make a 
mistake to regard the cold war as a perma-
nent phenomenon. After all, it was less 
than two decades ago that Winston Church-
ill first announced in Fulton, Mo., that "From 
Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adri-
atic an Iron Curtain has descended across 
the continent." And two decades are only 
a moment in the long sweep of history. 
leering the intervening years major 
changes have taken place on both sides of 
the Iron Curtain. A schism has developed 
within the Communist world. The Soviet 
Union has become the second greatest in-
dustrial power. The Soviet people have be-
gun to acquire a stake in the status quo, 
and after the missile crisis of 1962 the So-
viet Union has come face to face with the 
realities of power and destruction in the 
nuclear age and has recognized the awesome 
fact that in the 20th century a war between 
great powers is a war without victory for 
anyone. 
,10.41.011.101111111.01111...111.1M 
The changes taking place within the So-
viet Union and among the nations of Eastern 
Europe are at once a reality and a promise. 
Over time?and in a world of rapid and 
pervasive change the measurement of time 
is difficult indeed?we may look forward to a 
comparable development within Com:munist 
China, a maturing process that will deflect 
the policies of Peiping from bellicose actions 
to a peaceful relation with the rest of the 
world. 
After all, it is not the American purpose 
simply to preserve the status quo. That was 
not our history and that is not our destiny. 
What we want to preserve is the freedom of 
choice for the peoples of the world. We will 
take our chances on that.

WAR ON FAMINE 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, to-
day's issue of the Washington Daily News 
carries a fine editorial "The War on 
:Famine" discussing my proposal to use 
America's productive capacity to alle-
viate hunger in the world. 
I am especially pleased that the News 
studied the proposal carefully and com-
ments on my suggestion of a Farmers' 
Corps to help food-deficit countries in-
crease their own production by using 
the varied tools and methods we have de-
veloped in this country. 
The editor is right when he concludes 
that all our agricultural pro du.ctivity 
could not stave off the world famine 
ahead?that we also must combine food 
assistance with know-how to stimulate 
production by the hungry nations them-
selves. 
Our food can also be used to encourage 
population control measures and speed 
this second method of averting a food 
and population crisis. 
I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
dent, to have the Daily News editorial 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Daily News, 
Jan. 31, 19661 
THE WAR ON FAMINE 
Vietnam overshadows other issues at this 
time but Congress later in the session must 
come to grips with the combined problem of 
mounting hunger in the underdeveloped 
world plus a costly and wasteful agricultural 
policy here at home. 
Our food-for-peace program in the words 
of Senator GEORGE MoGovEmsr, of south Da-
kota, is "an ingenious combination of self-
interest arid idealism." Self-intereat because 
It avoids storage charges on vast surpluses, 
Idealism because it promotes the comfort-
ing feeling that we are relieving hunger 
abroad. 
But our surpluses are diminishing. The 
wheat stockpile has been reduced [Tom 1,245 
million bushels in the 1957-61 period to 
something more than BOO million bushels as 
of today. A reserve of sonaething over a half-
billion bushels--a year's domestic consump-
tion--is considered essential to national 
security. 
Senator McGovziol has legislation before 
Congress completely changing the shape of 
the farm-subsidy program. In brief he 
would take the wraps off production, have 
the Government buy the increased surpluses 
over national needs and give the food away 
abroad. He figures this wouldn't cost any 
more than present subsidies which are 
designed to hold down production. 
/ CM-
January 31, 1966 
But even Senator MCGOVERN would admit, 
we think, that even top U.S. agricultural 
production could not feed the hungry 
world--couldn't even stave off the coming 
world famine which soon is to be caused by 
the overproduction of human beings plus 
the underproduction of food. And even, if 
we could produce the food, there aren't 
enough ships to carry it. 
Then there is the book by two American 
agronomists, William and Paul Paddock, 
urging that foreign aid concentrate on in-
creasing food production?instead of steel 
mills?in the "Hungry Nations." They hold 
that our gifts of food do a disservice to the 
recipient nations by encouraging population 
growth which cannot be sustained. 
We think there is a lot to this argument, 
though there is not even a remote chance 
that the United States will withhold f ood 
from famine areas in any effort to regulate 
populations. And even if birth control pro-
grams succeed beyond the wildest dreams, 
they cannot work fast enough to stave off 
disaster. 
There may be at least a partial solution, it 
seems to us, in one of Senator McGovEriN's 
propositions. He would set up an American 
organization along the lines of the Peace 
Corps, composed of retired farmers and 
other experts in modern agricultural meth-
ods who would be willing to serve abroad for 
limited periods, teaching agricultural 
science. 
Senator MCGOVERN is from a farm State. 
He was President Kennedy's food for peace 
administrator. He sees, as the hope for the 
world's hungry peoples, fertilizers, pesticides. 
;better tools, improved irrigation methods. 
hybrid seeds, farm-to-market roads, rural 
education. His arguments make a great 
deal of sense, as they concern both foreign 
aid and the domestic economy. They 
should get serious study before the end of 
this sec, of Congress. 
E PRESIDENT'S DECISION ON 
T'HE TRAGIC WAR IN VIETNAM 
Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. 
President, the President has made his 
decision. In this time of crisis, he will 
have the support of Americans as he 
seeks an end to the tragic war in Viet-. 
nam. I welcome especially his announce-
merit of new initiatives in the United 
Nations. 
But obviously the resumption of bomb-
ing in the North is not a policy. And we 
should not delude ourselves that it offefs 
a painless method of winning the war. 
Our objectives in Vietnam can be 
gained only by what we do in the South?
by what we do to show the people of that; 
unhappy land that there is a difference?
that this is their war?that the defeat of 
the Vietcong will lead to a better life for 
themselves and for their children. 
And there are many indications that 
we have not yet even begun to develop it 
program to make these objectives a re-
ality. Just as an example, the Washing--
ton Star reported, on January 24: 
In Long An, one of Vietnam's most fertile 
provinces, more than 85 percent of the peas. 
ant population are tenants. This land-
ownership pattern may help explain why, 
despite a tremendous cost in lives and ma-
terial, the war in Long An is no closer to 
being won that it was several years ago. 
* 
(Yet) the rice-rich heartland of the Saigon 
region and the upper Mekong Delta, linked 
together by Long An, remains the prize for 
which the war is being fought. Here, in less 
Approved For Release 2006/11/06: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010002-4

than 14 provinces, live almost two-thirds of 
the 15 million South Vietnamese * * 
American military and civilian advisers agree 
there are more Vietcong than a year ago. 
Most Important in Long An, however, gov-
ernment and the mass of peasantry still seem 
to be on opposing sides. 
? ? ? ? ? 
.Land is of such paramount importance 
here that the Vietcong allow only the land-
less or very poor farmers to command guer-
rilla units or qualify as party members. The 
provincial government's social order is the 
exact reverse. Most of the military officers, 
civil servants, and community leaders come 
from the landowning gentry. 
In the delta, out of 1.2 million farms, only 
260,000 are owner-operated * * *. Some 
3,000 rich Saigon families still are the big 
landowners. 
And the day before, the Washington 
Post told us: 
The village chief, a 35-year-old former 
Army officer named Do Hun Minh * * * ex-
plained through an interpreter that only 
four village youngsters since the year 1950 
have been in high school. No youngster in 
the village has ever attended college. "The 
Vietnamese Government continues to sup-
port an exclusive educational system in a 
revolutionary war," says (Richard) Burn-
ham (the U.S. aid mission province repre-
sentative). "All this is the preservation of 
privilege. It is madness and until it Is 
changed most of our efforts will be mar-
ginal." Those other efforts * * * are con-
siderable. USOM pumps about half a mil-
lion dollars a year into Bienhoa (province), 
arranging for medical teams and technical 
assistance, and building dams, schoolrooms, 
a potable water system, an orphanage, three 
fish markets, two electricity systems. 
But knowledgable Americans here say that 
the Vietcong still offer the only outlet for a 
bright boy, from the villages. The static 
nature of Sondong assures that there is no 
legitimate route out of the rice paddy. The 
rural children cannot be officers, administra-
tors, or district chiefs. 
To such conditions, military action in 
the South or in the North is no answer. 
? Military action is needed to allow social 
reform to take place. But if American 
soldiers are to fight and die to buy time 
for the Government of South Vietnam, 
that time must be used. 
It is absolutely urgent that we now act 
to institute new programs of education, 
land reform, public health, political par-
ticipation?and that we act to insure 
honest administration. In my judgment 
the development and implementation of 
such a program would offer far more 
promise of achieving our aims in Viet-
nam than any other steps we could 
take?including the bombing of the 
North. 
As I have emphasized repeatedly, and 
I state again, our military effort will 
mean nothing if it is not followed by a 
successful pacification effort which in-
spires the people of South Vietnam. 
But we have not yet made the effort 
necessary. 
We are spending far more on military 
efforts than on all the education, land 
reform, and welfare programs which 
might convince a young South Vietna-
mese that his future is not best served by 
the Communists. 
And the best talent and brains in our 
Government are focussed far more on 
military action than they are on pro-
grams which might help the people of 
South Vietnam?and in the long run, 
help our effort as well. 
This imbalance must change. 
For if we regard bombing as the answer 
in Vietnam?we are headed straight for 
disaster. In the past, bombing has not 
proved a decisive weapon against a rural 
economy?or against a guerrilla army. 
And the temptation will now be to 
argue that if limited bombing does not 
produce a solution, that further bombing, 
more extended military action, is the 
answer. The danger is that the decision 
to resume may become the first in a series 
of steps on a road from which there is 
no turning back?a road which leads to 
catastrophe for all mankind. That can-
not be permitted to happen. 
As we move into this new phase of the 
war, the President will need the support 
and encouragement of the American peo-
ple. To be effective, however, both the 
Congress and the citizens of this country 
will have to be kept fully informed about 
the actions of the United States and the 
developments in Vietnam. 
I believe he will have this support even 
where there might be some differences 
of emphasis or policy. This should be 
clearly understood in both Hanoi and 
Peiping. 
MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT 
Messages in writing from the President 
of the United States were communicated 
to the Senate by Mr. Ratchford, one of 
his secretaries. 
REPORT OF NATIONAL SCIENCE 
FOUNDATION?MESSAGE FROM 
THE PRESIDENT (H. DOC. NO. 372) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before 
the Senate the following message from 
the President of the United States, 
which, with the accompanying report, 
was referred to the Committee on Labor 
and Public Welfare: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I said in my state of the Union message 
this year that, "We must change to mas-
ter change." 
Failing that, this Nation will surely 
become a casualty to the relentless tide 
of history. For in assessing our pros-
pects, we must remember that mankind 
faces not one but many possible futures. 
Which future our children's children en-
joy?or endure?depends in large meas-
ure on our ability to adjust to the needs 
of the times. 
But change comes not of itself. Nei-
ther the requirement for change nor the 
desire for change will see us through. In 
a complex world?growing more complex 
every year?only knowledge can keep us 
apace. 
We must achieve a better understand-
ing of our environment and our place in 
that environment. 
We must continue to unlock the secrets 
of the earth below us, the sea around us, 
and the heavens above us. 
And we must intensify our search into 
the very meaning of life itself. 
It is not too much to say that every 
aspect of our lives will be affected by the 
success of this effort. The military and 
1521 
economic strength of our Nation, and the 
health, the happiness, and the welfare 
of our citizens all are profoundly influ-
enced by the limits?and potentialities?. 
of our scientific program. 
In the furtherance of this program, no 
organization, agency, or institution has 
had a more profound or lasting influence 
than the National Science Foundation. 
The establishment of this Foundation by 
the Congress, 15 years ago, was one of the 
soundest investments this Nation ever 
made. 
In the field of basic research, many of 
the major scientific breakthroughs of our 
time would have been impossible?or at 
the very least, much longer in coming?
had it not been for National Science 
Foundation grants in the basic sciences. 
In the field of education, it is enough 
to say that more than half of all our high 
school teachers have now received vital 
refresher training through the Founda-
tion's education program. 
In the classrooms, the Foundation has 
played a major role in modernizing sci-
entific curricula to make them responsive 
to our age. 
And in a more recent activity, the 
Foundation has launched a program to 
strengthen the science departments of 
many of our smaller universities 
throughout the Nation by providing new 
laboratories, modern equipment, and fel-
lowships to promising graduate students. 
It should be emphasized that the role 
of the National Science Foundation is 
to aid, not to arbitrate. But through its 
aid?skillfully administered and intelli-
gently applied?it has brought American 
science to a new level of excellence. 
This, the 15th Annual Report of the 
National Science Foundation, reflects 
another year of scientific growth and 
progress, and I am pleased to commend 
it to the attention of the Congress. It 
mirrorsdihe past and illuminates the 
future. 
It is the story of change?to master 
change.

REPORT ON AERONAUTICS AND 
SPACE ACTIVITIES ? MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT (H. DOC.

The PRESIDING OroviCER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, 
which, with the accompanying report, 
was referred to the Committee on Aero-
nautical and Space Sciences: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
The record of American accomplish-
ments in aeronautics and space during 
1965 shows it to have been the most suc-
cessful year in our history. 
More spacecraft were orbited than in 
any previous year. Five manned Gemini 
flights were successfully launched. 
Our astronauts spent more hours in 
space than were flown by all of our 
manned spacecraft until 1965. Ten as-
tronauts logged a total of 1,297 hours 42 
minutes in space. 
The five manned flights successfully 
achieved included a walk in space, and

the first rendezvous between two manned 
spacecrafts. 
A scientific spacecraft completed a 325-
million-mile, 228-day trip to Mars. 
Mariner 4 thereby gave mankind its first 
closeup view of another planet. 
The Ranger series, begun in 1961, 
reached its zenith with two trips to the 
moon that yielded 13,000 closeup pic-
tures of that planet. The entire Ranger 
aeries produced 17,000 photographs of 
the moon's surface which are being 
studied now be experts throughout the 
world. 
Equally important were the contribu-
tions of our space program to life here on 
earth. Launching of Early Bird, the first 
commercial communication satellite 
brought us measurably closer to the goal 
of instantaneous communication between 
all points on the globe. Research and de-
velopment in our space program con-
tinued to speed progress in medicine, in 
weather prediction, in electronics--and, 
indeed, in virtually every aspect of Amer-
ican science and technology. 
As our space program continues, the 
impact of its developments on everyday 
life becomes daily more evident. It con-
tholes Lo stimulate our education, irn-
prove our material well-being, and 
broaden the horizons of knowledge. It is 
also a powerful force for peace. 
The space program of the United 
States today is the largest effort ever 
undertaken by any nation to advance the 
frontiers of human knowledge. What we 
are discovering and building today will 
help solve many of the great problems 
which an increasingly complex and 
heavily populated world will face tomor-
row. 
'the year 1965?the year of Gemini, 
Ranger, and Mariner?is a brilliant pref-
ace to the coming years of Apollo, sta-
tions in space and voyages to the planets. 
I have great pride and pleasure in trans-
mitting this remarkable record to the 
Congress that, through its enthusiastic 
support, has made possible.

PROPOSED REPEAL OF SECTION 
14(b) OF THE NATIONAL LABOR 
RELATIONS ACT, AS AMENDED 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the motion of the Senator from Mon-
tana [Mr. MANSFIELD I that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of the bill 
(HR. 77) to repeal section 141b) of the 
National Labor Relations Act, as amend-
ed, and section 703(b) of the Labor-
Management Reporting Act of 1959 and 
to amend the first proviso of section 8 
(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations 
Act, as amended. 
Mr. FELL. Mr. President, the ques-
tion presently before the Senate is 
whether it will proceed to the considera-
tion of FIR. 77, a bill which would repeal 
section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Let us look at the record. 
The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 laid 
down ceratin standards for a national 
policy toward union security clauses in 
collective bargaining agreements. It 
prohibits the closed shop in all industries 
in or affecting interstate commerce. It 
allows labor and management to nego-
tiate agreements for what is known as 
the union shop--anyone may be hired, 
but all must join the union and remain 
in good standing after 30 days 1.4 employ-
ment, at least until the termination of 
the contract. It allows another lesser 
form of union security agreement, the 
agency shop which does not require any-
one to join a union, but does require as 
a condition of employment, that employ-
ees pay to the union amounts equivalent 
to the initiation fee and duos paid by 
union members. 
The union shop, then, or eome lesser 
.form of it negotiated by labor and man-
agement, was adopted as national policy 
because of its consistency with the gen-
eral policy toward labor originally estab-
lished by the Wagner Act. This policy 
was to grant recognition to a rngle union 
only, in each plant, company, or other 
unit, for the purposes of collective bar-
gaining. Basically, Congress wished to 
avoid the disruptions of dual unionism, 
and establish single jurisdictaons in dis-
tinct crafts or separate shops. 
In return, the union was Inquired by 
law to 'bargain collectively, without dis-
crimination, for all employees in the 
unit. Every employee, whether a mem-
ber of the union, or not, was entitled to 
the gains obtained by collective bargain-
ing 
These are fine sounding words?logi-
cal, orderly, consistent?words express-
ing national policy, single unionism, ex-
clusive jurisdictions, collective bargain-
ing for the benefit of all. 
Section 14(b) is the not-too-well hid-
den joker in the deck.. 
National policy was nicely reaffirmed, 
and then someone left the barn door 
open, to allow State policy to supersede 
that of the Federal Government. 
Section 14(b) states: 
.Nothing in this Act shall be construed as 
authorizing the execution or application of 
agreements requiring memberrAnp in a la-
bor organization as a condition of employ-
ment in any State or Territory io which such 
execution or application is prohibited by 
State el' Territorial law, 
stos200011.11t 
January 31, 1966 
Section 14(b) allows the States and 
territories to modify our national labor 
policy if they choose to do so, in the di-
rection of further limiting negotiated 
agreements requiring union membership. 
Basically, 14(b) is the opening wedpe 
to denigrate organized labor. It has 
become a symbol; to organized labor it 'is 
the first true "gut" issue in years which, 
if not resolved favorably, could bring 
about a national right-to-work law; and 
to the fanatics of the right wing, it is 
the shining symbol of a false freedom. 
On the surface, there is the Natil,mal 
Right To Work Committee, founded in 
1955 by E. S. Dillard and Fred Hartley, 
a coauthor of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Under the surface are the disrupthig 
whiapers of the ignorant and ill-in-
formed, the bigots and hatemongers. 
Tne battlelines are clearly' drawn. 
With this blight, 14(b) off the statute 
Infolss, we can direct our efforts toward 
progressive causes. The repeal of 14(h) 
will not bring back the closed shop, as 
some darkly hint, for that is specifically 
declared illegal in Taft-Hartley. The 
repeal of :14(b) will bring us back to our 
established national policy with respect 
to union security contracts, a policy we 
witlessly departed from in 1947. 
Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz 
in his excellent book entitled "Labor and 
Public Interest," stated with regard to 
right-to-work laws that he "used to ask 
my labor law classes a series of questions 
at the opening session of the course." 
One question was: 
Are you in favor of or opposed to he t-
to-work laws? 
Two out of three said they favored 
such laws. Then a later question was 
worded this way: 
If an employer and a majority of his em-
ployees agree with respect to whether all 
employees should or should not become 
members of the union, should the govern-
ment interfere, by law, with that decision? 
Two-thirds of the class said they 
would oppose such a law. 
Education apparently is the key to 
understanding. 
I believe that the Senate should have 
the opportunity to vote on this issue. I 
believe that we should put an end to 
the delaying tactics of those who oppose 
repeal. If declare myself firmly in su...p-
port of repeal, and will support every 
effort to gain that objective. 
RECESS UNTIL 10 O'CLOCK A M. 
TOMORROW 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, if there is 
no further business to come before the 
Senate at this time, I move, pursuant 
to the order previously entered, that the 
Senate stand in recess until 10 o'clock 
a.m. tomorrow. 
The motion was agreed to; and nit 1 
o'clock and 6 minutes p.m.) the Senate 
took a recess, under the order previously 
entered, until tomorrow, Tuesday, Fab-
ruary 1, 1966, at 10 o'clock a.m.
