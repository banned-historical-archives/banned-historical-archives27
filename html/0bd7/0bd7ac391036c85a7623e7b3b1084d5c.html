 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.   CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  United States may be implicated in Slansky trial:  The
 American Ambassador in Prague is certain that the Slans1Qr trial will be used
 for an attack on the United States and warns that it may also be used as an
 excuse to restrict further or perhaps even to close the Embassy.  The Ambassa-
 dor thinks the trial will have the dual object of eliminating Slansky and his
 colleagues and of paving the way for an anti-American move which might include
 presentation of dramatic "proof" of an American attempt to implement the
 Mutual Security Act.  (TS, S/S Prague 584, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  Slansky is accused of conspiring with a Western power and of
 implication in American "subversive and conspiratorial activities in the
 Peoples' Democracies."  Recently the retiring Afghan Minister in Praha told
 American officials that the Polish Ambassador claimed to have seen proof
 implicating Slansky with the US.
 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)

 2.     EGYPT.  E vptian Prime Minister favors "Quick action" on dispute with Britain:
 Egyptian Prime Minister Ali Maher has told the American Ambassador in Cairo
 that he is very much interested in "quick action" on the Anglo-Egyptian con-
 troversy and is hopeful that a settlement can be reached "very soon."  He em-
 phasized, however, that no agreement is possible unless Farouk is recognized
 as King of the. Sudan.  He further stated that the British "base" must be moved
 out of Egypt and that a solution of the dispute with Britain must precede any
 attention to domestic social reforms.
 has discounted the British contention that
 recognition of the Sudan title would result in riots and civil disorders in the
 Sudan.  He added that if the opportunity now existing for negotiating a settle-
 ment is not seized, it will not come again.  (S, S/S Cairo 1199 and 1211, 30 Jan;
 S. Cairo 1226, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The American Ambassadors in Cairo and London also agree that
 negotiations should be opened quickly.
 While both Britain and Egypt have made conciliatory gestures, neither has
 yet given any indication that it is prepared to make genuine concessions.
 CHINA/INDIA.  Indian Charge reports Korean talks stalled by US "insincerity":
 has learned of a report from the Indian Charge in -
 Peiping that the "basic cause" of the stalemate in the Korean truce talks is
 Peiping's conviction that the US is "insincere... and has no real desire for

 peace."                                                            Peiping whether
 "any good would come" of having the Indian Ambassador instructed to inform
 Peiping of the Government of India+s view that the US genuinely desires peace
 and an early armistice,  (S, S/S London 3341, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The Indian Charge last week publicly praised the Peiping regime
 at an Indian reception in Peiping, and in this instance apparently has accepted
 uncritically the Communist line.  There is no reason to believe that the Indian
 Ambassador's representations would have any effect on Peiping's policies.
 JAPAN.  Japan's reparations policy discussed:  The Japanese Government, in its
 current reparations talks in Manila, will not accept the Philippine proposal
 that a definite sum to be paid be agreed upon, according to the US Political
 Adviser in Tokyo.  Japan contends that its reparations obligation is based
 solely on its ability to pay, without relation to the amount of war damage
 suffered by the claimant, and that talks must be held with all the claimants
 before a total obligation can be accepted.  The Japanese seemed receptive, how-
 ever, to the US suggestion that Japan agree to an interim arrangement which
 would provide for a list of specific services to be undertaken by the Japanese
 after the peace treaty is ratified, with a salvage survey to commence immediately.
 (S, S/S Tokyo 1613, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  American officials have pointed out to the Japanese that-some
 specific commitments must be made during the Manila talks in order to insure
 ratification of the peace treaty by the Philippine Congress.
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 5.   GERMANY.  Saar issuethreatens Adenauer Government:  The French appointment of
 an ambassador to the Saar has seriously undermined Chancellor Adenauer's
 political position.  Top German Foreign Office spokesmen state that pressure on
 Adenauer from all parliamentary factions compelled him to schedule for
 7 February the Bundestag debate on rearmament which he had previously postponed.
 Unless Adenauer can obtain some prior French action to calm the "embittered"
 parliamentary atmosphere, the government will be defeated on the European Defense
 Community.  This would force either abandonment of German integration into
 Western defense or resignation of the government.
 German diplomats feel that a crisis might be averted if France were to
 announce "free" elections in the Saar and were also to declare that the status
 quo in the Saar had not been altered by recent French action.
 The US High Commissioner comments, "I am for the first time really worried."

 TOP SECRET
 Comment:  The statements of the German spokesmen probably represent a move
 of Adenauer to force the Allies to intervene in the French-German controversy.
 Under the present circumstances it is doubtful that Adenauer will go through
 with the debate as scheduled since he risks sure defeat if he does so, whereas
 he would meet only continued pressure if he delayed the discussion.
 6.   UNITED KINGDOM.  Foreign Office developing new proposals for early Anglo-
 Egyptian negotiations:  The US Embassy in London reports that the British For-
 eign Office appears.eager to start negotiations with Egypt as soon as the new
 government is ready. The Embassy believes the Foreign Off-ice will be "reasonable
 and realistic"  about its demand that terroristic activity in the Canal zone must
 first be suppressed, since it seeks primarily an assurance of the new goyernment's
 willingness to cooperate to that end.
 The Foreign Office favors preliminary negotiations with Egypt on the varied
 problems of Anglo-Egyptian relations, to be followed by British-French-American-
 Turkish-Egyptian discussion of the NEC proposal.  Britain is aware that a flex-
 ible agenda for the preliminary talks will be necessary and that it will probably
 not be possible to exclude the question of the Sudan.
 The Foreign Office realizes that concessions on the Sudan would greatly aid
 the defense negotiations, but believes "it is no good solving a trouble spot in
 one area by creating a trouble spot in another area."  Officials still deny that
 recognition of Faroukts title as King of the Sudan is necessary to obtain a
 defense agreement.  They are suggesting that the Governor General of the Sudan
 consult  with Sudanese leaders in order to discover some concessions that
 Britain could make.  (S, S/S London 3294, 3320, and 3324, 30 and 31 Jan 52)

 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.  USSR/INDONESIA.  Prominent Indonesian Socialist believes. Chinese Communists
 will not intervene in Indochina:  Sudjatmoko told an American official in
 Rome that during his visit to Poland in the course of his recent six
 months' tour of Europe, he had been an official guest of the Polish Foreign
 Office.  As a result of conversations with officials of that office, he be-
 lieves that the Chinese Communists will not intervene in Indochina with,
 either forces or "volunteers."  He bases this belief on several remarks
 made to him that the North Korean attack on the Republic of Korea was a
 "mistake?"  He said, however, that the Chinese Communists might give
 assistance and equipment to the Viet Minh forces.
 While in Yugoslavia, he was informed by Yugoslavs that they believe
 any frictions between Communist China and Russia would tend to remain
 concealed for a long period within a framework of "general cordiality,"
 but that in the long run the Chinese would attempt to follow a policy de-
 signed to promote their own interests.  (C Rome 3367, 29 Jan 52)
 2.   USSR.  Austria will send delegation to Moscow:  The Austrian Government has
 accepted the Soviet invitation to send a delegation to Moscow to discuss
 Austrian payment for the repatriation of its prisoners of war from the
 USSR and for Austrian civilians liberated from German concentration camps.
 The delegation will be headed by the Austrian Minister to Moscow and will
 include the chief of the POW section of the Minister of Interior.  (S
 Vienna 2510, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  Austrian payment for Soviet expenses incurred during re-
 patriation has already been settled under one of the agreed articles of
 the Austrian Treaty, but a bill had never been presented.  Austria had
 offered to send a delegation to Moscow for the same purpose in the fall
 of 1949.
 Results of 1951 state plan announced:  The Central Statistical Admin-
 istration of the USSR, Council of Ministers, has announced that the value
 of gross industrial production in the USSR was 16 percent higher in 1951-
 than in 1950.  Industrial production, measured in rubles, exceeded the
 1951 plan by 3  percent, although three branches admittedly fell short of
 their goals - timber, cotton growing, and railways.

 Approved For Ase 2001/09/06 : CIA-RDP79T011461700240001-9
 The announcement further stressed that the USSR had successfully in-
 creased production of such basic materials as steel, coal, oil, and rubber,
 as well as vital machinery and finished goods, and that output of consumer
 goods and sales of foodstuffs to the population had increased by a "sig-
 nificant" margin.  Wholesale price-reductions effective 1 January 1952 for
 petroleum and paper products may be followed by price cuts for consumer
 goods.
 Capital investment during 1951 was placed at 112 percent as compared
 with 1950.  The number of non-agricultural workers and employees in the
 USSR in 1951 was estimated at 40.8 million, 1.6 million higher than at
 the end of 1950.  The gross national income had increased 12 percent over
 the preceding year.  (R-FBIS, 29 Jan 52)
 Comment:  While the overall 1951 plan was successful if measured in
 terms of value of production, targets of production of specific quanti-
 ties of basic industrial commodities were not uniformly realized.  Items
 of secondary importance were. in some cases overproduced, while those of
 high priority did not meet planned goals.  For example, the strategic
 Ministry of Heavy Engineering failed to meet planned quotas for steam
 engines and turbines.
 Comparisons of this official report with quarterly reports for 1951
 and Beriya's November speech indicate a pronounced shift to armament pro-
 duction.  Tractor production for 1951 is significantly omitted, a factor
 perhaps not unrelated to Beriya's estimate that 1951 tractor production
 (measured in 30 h.p. units) would be considerably lower than output in
 1950.
 4.    RUMANIA. Rumania increases pressure on Zionists:  The American Legation
 in Bucharest reports that the recent arrest of three Rumanian employees
 of the Israeli Legation there may lead to a trial involving the Israeli
 Legation and also numerous Zionist leaders in Rumania, most of whom have
 been under arrest for some time.
 It is also reported that the Rumanian Government has increased curbs
 on Jewish emigration, allowing only about 800 to leave each month in com-
 parison with the 5,000 to $,000 of several months ago.  (C Bucharest 289,
 25 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The Rumanian Government, in a'sudden and unexplained move,
 appointed a new Minister to Israel in December 1951, after the former en-
 voy had been recalled in protest some two years ago.  The arrest of the
 Legation employees and a possible trial of Rumanian Zionists will cer-
 tainly mean further deterioration of relations between the two countries.

 ,Approved For 14ease 2001/09/06 : CIA-RDP79T01146A000700240001-9
 ?
 The sorest point continues to be the curbing of Jewish emigration by
 Rumanian authorities.  The S.S. Transylvania is now making only three
 trips a month to Haifa instead of the former weekly voyages, and Rumania
 seems to be adopting a more stringent policy regarding documentation of
 emigrants, particularly for young men.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.  INDIA/CHINA.  Indian Ambassador to Peiping instructed to urge an early
 truce in Korea:  According to a reliable US source, Prime Minister Nehru
 has instructed the Indian Ambassador to Peiping to urge the Chinese Commu-
 nists to agree to a reasonable truce in Korea and not to intervene in Indo-
 china..  Nehru is said to feel that the Ambassador's representations will
 have some effect in Peiping.  (C Hong Kong 2323, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  Ambassador Panikkar has just returned to China after attend-
 ing the United Nations meetings in Paris.  With Chinese Communists already..
 probing for political and military weaknesses in India's Himalayan frontier,
 Prime Minister Nehru has good cause to wish the Chinese to adopt a peaceful
 attitude.  There is no indication, however, that the Chinese will be in-
 fluenced in any way either by Nehru or by his Ambassador.
 2.  INDONESIA.  Government faces severe press criticism over acceptance of MSA
 aids  Press speculation and criticism over the Indonesian Government's agree-
 ment with the Mutual Security Agency is steadily increasing.  Although press
 reports are confused and conflicting, they generally agree that American aid
 to Indonesia. will continue and that the continuance of such aid probably im-
 plies Indonesia's acceptance of certain terms.  Opinion is overwhelmingly
 against any commitment to the "American bloc."
 The government has made no statement of its position.  When Ambassador
 Cochran asked Foreign Minister Subardjo whether the cabinet was "sitting
 tight" on MSA in the face of press questioning, he replied affirmatively,
 indicating that he-would make an effort to have MSA considered simply as_a
 continuation of ECA,  (C Djakarta 1096, 31 Jan; C Djakarta 1105, 1 Feb; C
 Djakarta 1106, 2 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The Indonesian Government agreed on 4 January to continue to
 accept US aid under the provisions of MSA pending consideration of the matter
 by parliament.  The government's position apparently has not been publicized.
 3.  BURMA.  Burmese waver on Dian to evacuate the Chinese Nationalists:  The
 Permanent Secretary of the Burmese Foreign Office has told American and
 British diplomats that the movement of Chinese Nationalist troops through
 Rangoon to Formosa would be a breach of neutrality, and that the proper
 course would be to intern them.
 The US Charge comments that Burma apparently will not help to evacuate
 the Nationalists, but will leave the responsibility for any such task to
 the United States and Thailand.  (S Rangoon 753, 31 Jan 52)

 Comments  Burma recently asked the United States to persuade the
 Chinese Nationalist Government to order Li BM's troops either to leave
 Burma or to surrender.  Burma's cooperation in such a plan was strongly
 implied.  Fear of Communist China's reaction may have caused a change of
 attitude.

 decided to postpone action, in order to take advantage of the struggle for

 Comment:  Most Thai politicians who are out of the government con-
 stantly engage in planning the overthrow of the regime.  There is no evi-
 dence from any other source that there is any group outside of the ruling
 clique which currently has the force or following caYpable of seizing and
 retaining control of the Thai Government.
 5.              Communist Part  re orte l  ineffectual:  The Thai Communist
 Party is described                         as a disorganized and ineffectual

 to make its own way financially.                                               25X1A
 Comment:  Most intelligence-sources indicate that Communism has made
 little headway among the Thai, in contrast to its progress among the Chinese
 in Thailand, who have a separate Communist organization.
 6.     INDOCHINA.  Bao Dal suggests he succeed De L attre:  In an interview with
 American Minister Heath, Bao D ai said that a "dangerous stalemate of in-
 compatibility" had been reached with the French and that France must cease
 its "annoying interventions" in internal political matters.  He also as-
 serted that it was time the French declared their true aims in Vietnam:
 he hoped that they did not contemplate a return to colonialism.
 Bao Dai further stated that General de Lattre had wanted him to suc-
 ceedto the positions of Commander in Chief and High Commissioner.  Bao
 Dai declared himself ready to assume the responsibilities of these positions.
 Heath believes that such a step might break the political impasse. (S Saigon
 1505, 30 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The French have repeatedly rejected far less drastic pro-
 posals for increased Vietnamese authority than the one proposed by Bao D ai.

 7.   CHINA.  Indian Charge receives cool response to praise of Peiping regimes.
 The Peiping press quotes Indian Charge Kaul, at the Indian National Day
 reception in Peiping on 26 January, as. praising the "mighty achievements"
 of Communist China and as lauding Mao Tse-tung.as "one of the greatest
 leaders of Asia and the world and a great friend of India."  In contrast,
 Chinese Communist. Commander in Chief Chu Teh's response conveyed merely the
 conventional. "warm greetings" to the Government of India.  (C Hong Kong 2304,
 31 Jan 52)
 Comments  Peiping's cool response on this occasion is in contrast to
 last year's reception, when Mao Tse-tung was present and spoke more warmly
 of Sino-Indian friendship.  The Peiping regime has since then appeared in-
 different to, or even contemptuous of, Indian gestures of friendship.  The
 Chinese Communist press never praises Nehru as the Indian Charge praised Mao.
 8.          Communist China may get oil from India:  The US Consul General in
 Calcutta reports that the Indian Government issued an export license on 14
 January for the shipment of over a thousand tons of American surplus.lubri-
 eating oil to Macao.  The Consul General discovered that this oil, although
 contaminated by water, would be usable after cleaning or special treatment.
 (C Calcutta 342, 1 Feb 52)
 Comments  This oil is probably destined for Communist China, as Macao
 has often been a way point for strategic goods shipped from non-Communist
 countries to the mainland.  This would be one of the largest single ship-
 ments of oil to reach Communist China from Western sources since the United
 Nations embargo of July 1950.                               J
 9.           Highway workers "mobilized" in East and South Chinas  Authorities
 in the:East China District and Kwangtung Province last fall planned to
 mobilize laborers for highway repair projects, according to the Communist
 press. In Kwangtung province alone, 1,734 miles of road are to be repaired
 this winter. (U Nan Fang Jih Pao, Canton, 6 Dec; Chieh Fang Jih Pao,
 Shanghai, 22 Nov 51)
 en s  A year ago the Communist press reported that 150,000 ci-
 vilians had been conscripted to repair highways in Kwangtung.  The Commu-
 nists stress public works projects during the winter because it is the
 slack agricultural season.  In addition to farmers, unemployed workers in
 Canton have reportedly been registered for highway construction work.

 10.         Rate of attrition low in Nationalist Amy for 1951:  The rate of  .
 attrition was 1  percent in 30  hinese Nationalist divisions under study
 in 1951, according toa Chinese Government study ' A. large part of   loss
 was due to deaths, desertion, and discharges for age and disability. A
 lesser part was attributed to.transfer and desertions to other Nationalist
 units -- not affecting overallrNationalist strength.
 Th_Q::US Naval Attache comments that the attrition rate was probably

 for the troops; plus heightene"d,morale due to American aid.  (S ALUSNA

 of 31 January noted the arrival  in Moscow of    im Hey'.' the new Ambassador
 from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  (U FBIS Ticker, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment: "Lim He" is probably Yim Hae, ?a North Korean political
 major , general..... He replaces Chu*Yong Ha, who has been the North Korean
 Ambassador in Moscow since 1949.                                                    '
 Yim Hae.'is a member of the "Yenan faction" of the North Korean
 Government; he has spent most of his life'in China and has served with
 the Chinese Communist Army.  While Yim's appointment to Moscowi:may
 rid Kim I1 Sung of yet,another pro-Chinese North Korean leader, there
 is no reliable evidence of divergence between the Soviet-trained and
 Chinese-trained Korean leaders.
 12.        US'Government protests Rhee proclamations  The Department of State
 has instructed AithQgsador Muccio in Pusan rto make an.ttoral representation"
 to.Syngman Rhee protesting the latter's proclamation of Korean sovereignty
 over the high seas adjacent-to the-Korean peninsula.  A formal note will
 also be submitted by h`uccio,.the?contents of which are ?used on US protests
 msde`to other c-untries which have issued similar  roolamations contrary
 to international law.  (C to Pusan A-156, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  'Rhee's'proclam-at on was undoubtedly inspired by the fact
 that  he MacArthur line, which circumscribes Japanese fishing, will be
 abolished when the Japanese Peace Treaty goes into effect.  The Koreans:
 feel that with no line of demarcation the Japanese will seriously
 encroach on Korean fishing grounds.

 Comment: A new general election is reportedly scheduled for early
 November.  While the Yoshida government appears to have lost some support
 since the signing of the Peace Treaty, the return of the conservative pirgees
 to political life will undoubtedly more than offset this loss.  At the
 present time none of the opposition parties appears strong enough to
 threaten seriously the Liberal Party's dominant position.

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.  GENERAL.  French desire for NATO commitments in Tunisia and Morocco viewed
 as untimely:  US NATO Deputy Spofford expects that since Greece and Turkey
 are about to become NATO members, France will make representations to
 have Tunisia and Morocco also covered by NATO.  A similar proposal during
 the 1948 NATO negotiations was rejected on military and political grounds,
 and Spofford points out that the strategic situation is unchanged and
 that the political atmosphere is now even more unfavorable than in 1948-1949.'
 Spofford suspects the French Government may maneuver to have inter-
 national action through NATO settle a matter which might otherwise be a
 point of contention in the National Assembly.  (S London DEPTO 905, 30 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The three Algerian departments were covered by the original
 NATO agreement as a concession to France, and rightist groups in parliament
 may use the extension of the pact to non-Atlantic areas as an excuse to
 press for the inclusion of the rest of French North Africa.  The Moroccans
 and Tunisians would object strenuously to being included in an agreement
 without their consent.
 2.   EAST GERMANY.  New Soviet station drowns out American broadcasts in Berlin:
 A powerful new Soviet radio station, constructed in secrecy under the
 code name "Zwilling," began test transmissions at reduced power from
 Berlin-Koepenick on 23 January.  The new transmitter, reportedly designed
 for an output of 300 kilowatts, is already making it impossible for
 some listeners in the Berlin area to receive Radio in the American Sector
 (RIAS) and other stations.  (S Frankfort 4770, 26 Jan 52; S/Control
 30 78184, The Hague, F-3, 10 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The operation of this new transmitter will interfere
 consider ably with RIAS coverage of Berlin.  Communist capabilities for
 broadcasting to Western Germany and Western Europe will be greatly
 increased during 1952 by the construction of new stations and the increase
 in power of existing stations.
 FRANCE.  French demand limit on German armament production:  France will
 accept a German military contribution to Western defense only if it can
 be sure that the US will not permit Germany to regain its position as
 a "great military arsenal," according to the French High Commissioner
 in Bonn.  The Commissioner points out that France continues to be dis-
 quieted because it believes that the US is pressing for German arms
 manufacture, and he feels that there can be no sense. of security in France
 or Europe unless the US guarantees that Germany will not exceed its
 armament production quota.

 Chancellor Adenauer has recently hinted to the US High Commissioner
 that the Germans may accept some restrictions under NATO, but the
 Commissioner warns that this may be just a7 other attempt by Adenauer to
 obtain NATO membership for Germany.  (S HICOG Bonn 1323, 1 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The question of security controls over German armament
 production is still the basic obstacle to agreement on the EDC and on
 German participation in Western defense.  The French refuse to write into
 the EDC treaty controls which will be unenforceable without US support.
 A compromise on this issue may involve French acquiescence to German
 participation in NATO.
 4.            French Communists propagandize for East-West trade:  The US
 Embassy in Paris believes that a Communist motion.in the National Assembly
 for the establishment of normal East=West commercial relations "necessary
 for the prosperity of France" is obviously designed. to whip up enthusiasm
 for the Moscow Trade Conference in April, as well as to build up sentiment
 favorable to the current French-Soviet trade negotiations.  This "cleverly
 keyed" campaign is having some effect, as indicated by the passage of
 East-West trade resolutions in several non-Communist municipal councils.
 (C Paris 4601, 30 Jan 52)
 Comment:  This phase of the Communist propaganda campaign is well
 timed to exploit the growing opposition in Western Europe to US demands
 for tighter East-West trade controls.  The Italian Communists have also
 opened a press campaign supporting the Economic Conference, seeking to
 show that US pressure against trade with the Satellites hurts the
 economies of Western European countries.
 French manufacturers are particularly vulnerable to the temptations
 of trade with the Soviet Orbit at this time when certain French exports
 are deteriorating drastically, and the spectre of currency devaluation
 looms large.
 5.  ITALY.  Communists plan to exploit rightist opposition to NATO:  The
 Italian Communist Party, in preparation for local elections in the spring,
 intends to concentrate on opposition to NATO and defense of "national
 independence."  The Communists will exploit the differences not only
 among Premier de Gasperi's Christian Democrats but also within the
 neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, where a considerable group is
 strongly opposed to NATO.  To this end, Communist agents are working
 within the Italian Social Movement under the supervision of a member of
 the Italian Communist Politburo.
 Competent observers consider that the Italian Communist Party may
 become the strongest political party because of the differences among
 the non-Communists.  (S Rome 3384, 30 Jan 52)

 Comment:  Italy's support of NATO is largely confined to political
 leaders.  The people as a whole are apathetic.
 The anti-NATO sentiment within the Italian Social Movement is
 particularly important since the weakened Christian Democrats are reportedly
 turning to the extreme right for political support.  Vatican leaders and
 others are increasingly apprehensive over the diminishing popular support
 for Christian Democratic policies, including the alliance with the West.
 6.  DENMARK.  Government desires to maintain traditional trade connection
 with Poland:  Danish officials have indicated their belief that the
 Danish Government will not refuse Poland's demand for a tanker in return
 for resumption of coal shipments, even if assured that the US will provide
 and finance Denmark's coal deficit.  In their statements on the inadvisa-
 bility of disturbing Denmark's traditional trade pattern two main
 considerations were apparent:  the varied practical difficulties of
 transatlantic coal shipments, and the uncertainty as to the continuity
 and consistency of future US aid.
 The US Embassy holds that the Danish official position is not yet
 ascertained, but that Denmark's need for coal is immediate, and that the
 US must therefore be prepared either to make a firm and prompt offer of
 aid or to agree to a COCOM exception on the tanker deal.  (S Copenhagen
 556, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  In December Denmark indicated its desire to obtain COCOM
 approval for the sale of a tanker to Poland because the Poles had sus-
 pended all coal shipments to Denmark.(see OOI Daily Digest, 3, 18, and
 21 Dec 51).  It would seem that only a resumption of large-scale coal
 exports'by=Germany and Britain would fully meet Danish Government desires.
 7.   TUNISIA.  French note is unacceptable to Tunisians:  The Tunisian
 nationalists consider France's note delivered to the Bey last Wednesday
 completely unsatisfactory.  Although the source stated that the general
 strike on 1 February would be conducted peaceably, he predicted that
 further Tunisian troubles are inevitable unless "world conscience" pre-
 vails upon France to change its policy.  (C Tunis 98, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  Although the French no longer demand that the Bey dismiss
 his cabinet, their insistence that the Tunisian petition be withdrawn,
 even though the UN has not accepted it, has further antagonized Arab
 and Asian nations as well as the Tunisians.  Fifteen Arab, Asian, and
 African nations have now notified the UN General Assembly and Security
 Council that"grave consequences are likely to follow a continuation
 of the present state of affairs" in Tunisia.  Meanwhile, Algerian and
 Moroccan nationalist and Communist organizations indicated their cohesion
 with the Tunisians by a 24-hour sympathy strike, which in Morocco as
 well as in Tunisia broke out in isolated incidents of violence.

 8.  BOLIVIA. New plans to oust government:  The Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement plans to oust the Bolivian junta between 5 and 10 February,
 according to a reliable source.       The plan calls for seizure of tin mines
 and of hostages, and for coordinated uprisings.  President Peron of
 Argentina is repcrtedly cooperating and providing ten planes.
 The Minister of Government, who knows of the plans, claims "every-
 thing is under control."  (C La Paz 279, 31 Jan 52J
 Comment:  Pressure for a change in the governing junta has been
 increasing.  The Commanding General of the Army and various military
 commanders are sympathetic to the Nationalist Revolutionary Ivlovement,
 and various leaders of the movement have been maneuvering to gain power
 peaceably.
 It is unlikely that Peron would offer planes for a coup, although
 he might provide undercover support.
 9.              Government ma  formally Protest delay in tin negotiations:
 The Subsecretary of the Bolivian Foreign Office has expressed extreme
 disappointment over the continuing delay in the resumption of US-Bolivian
 tin negotiations, especially since the US has concluded an arrangement
 to obtain Malayan tin.  The Foreign Office has sent the Bolivian Ambassada?
 an 18-page memorandum which he :rill deliver to the State Department when
 the Foreign Office deems it advisable.  The memorandum presents a full
 history of Bolivia's position, cites various inter-American commitments,
 and states that the raising of the price for Malayan tin to 1.215 dollars
 a pound is clear acknowledgment that the US was guilty of "ec onomic
 aggression" when the Reconstruction Finance Corporation fixed a lower
 price for Bolivian tin.  (C La Paz 278, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  The RFC set a temporary price of 1.12 dollars a pound for
 Bolivian tin.  The speed with which the US and the UK negotiated for
 Malayan tin contrasts sharply with the US-Bolivian negotiations, which
 have been drawn out over the past year.
 The State Department has advised the Bolivian Ambassador that because
 of the delay in confirming the new director of the RFC, the Defense
 Materials Procurement Administrator has been chosen to represent the US
 in new tin negotiations, which can begin as soon as the ambassador receives
 instructions from his government.

 Communism in labor unions be indefinitely postponed if possible.  The US

 snowballing and the visit is being ascribed to "orders" from the US
 military negotiating team with a view toward controlling labor and
 disrupting the presidential campaign of the Socialist-Communist candidate.
 (s Santiago 404, 31 Jan 52)
 Comment:  Earlier the US Ambassador had commented that a visit by
 labor leaders from the US or from GRIT, the hemisphere section of the
 non-Communist ICFTU,would be inopportune at this time (see OCI Daily
 Digest, 30 Jan and 1 Feb 52).
