DAILY I;ORLD 
7 DEC 1972 
1Dear 
Editor, 
? PERLO REPLIES 
Mrs. Seigel appeals for a change in Soviet policies and propaganda. Her 
' points, it seems to me, are based partly on misinformation and partly on false 
analogies. ? 
1. The million Jews rescued by the USSR from death in Nazi-occupied 
lands returned to their homelands after the war. They are not involved in the 
present emigration to Israel from the USSR. 
2. Mrs. Seigel calls on the Soviet government to say it doesn't want 
Jews to leave, to reiterate the laws against anti-Semisitm, to discuss ideologi-
cal problems in relation to Jews. 
- _ The Soviet government has been doing exactly that and much, moreAt 
has been widely publicizing the tremendous contributions of the Jewish people . 
- to the USSR, in military, economic and cultural fields, paying them high honor. 
An example is the pamphlet by the Soviet Jewish writer, Solomon Rabinowitz, 
which has been translated into English. Criticism should be directed at the 
United States media and commercial publishing houses, which in effect cen-
sor all material telling the truth about Soviet Jews so that it becomes acces-
sible only to the handful that know about left-wing bookstores or read the 
Daily World and Peoples World. 
3. Under socialism, the two trends ? a flowering of national cultures 
and a merging of peoples ? go on simultaneously. Because the Jewish people 
are spread out all over the country, because so many of them are in advanced 
professional and political positions, the tendency towards blending into a.mul-
tinational Soviet cultural pattern is particularly strong. It is for that reason, 
rather than the absence of a daily Yiddish newspaper, etc., apt only one-sixth 
of the Soviet Jews consider Yiddish their mother tongue. The same blending 
into a common United States cultural pattern goes on in this country, marred 
by the vicious racism being stirred up by our reactionaries.' 
4. 'Comparison with Bulgarian postwar emigration policy is not valid. 
It is true, by the way, that the Bulgarian state, Mone among those wholly 
occupied by the Nazis, protected the Jews from the invaders and saved them 
from the Nazi death camps. However, in the immediate postwar period, the 
Bulgarian Jews did not constitute a group with special qualifications for build-
ing the country, they had not lived most of their lives under socialism, they 
were relatively few in numbers, and they were going to a country which, at the 
time, was not engaged in acting as spearhead for the imperialist offensive 
against the national liberation movement. 
It seems to be true, as Mrs. Seigel points out, that assiduous efforts 
Of the United States Information Agency, the CIA and Zionist organizations 
have succeeded in creating among a minority of Soviet Jews ? amounting to 
thousands, even ? a fever to emigrate to Israel. But, according. to recent 
press reports, many of the Soviet Jews going to Israel are settled in occupied 
lands, for use in fighting against neighboring peoples who are struggling to 
regain the lands seized from them by Israeli aggressors. It's too bad that some 
Soviet Jews are lured by the pied piper of bourgeois nationalism. But the So-
viet government has a right, in relation to the national liberation struggles in 
the Middle East ? which it rightfully supports ? to restrain emigration which 
would aid the aggressor. 
6. I gather Mrs. Seigel is criticizing me for "badgering and blaming" 
those who slander the USSR in connection with the so-called Jewish question 
and for showing the basic correctness of the Soviet position. The trouble in this 
country is that there aren't many more writers, with access to much wider 
circulating media, to tell the truth. I would hope that Mrs. Seigel, who herself 
understands much on this issue, will help the cause of combating anti-Soviet-
ism by using letters to the editor or other means to get some of the truth to, 
people in tier own community. "

The Washington Merry-Go-Round 
Columnists 
By Jack Anderson 
The Greek dictatorship has 
sponsored a luxury tour for 
some of America's best-read 
conservative columnists. In 
some cases, their wives also 
made the trip. 
Not surprisingly, the red-
carpet trip produced a gush of 
pro-junta columns in the na-
tion's press. Readers, however, 
didn't know that the tour was 
financed, at $2,000 .a head, by 
t h e government-controlled 
Hellenic Industrial Develop-
ment Bank, whose urbane gov-
ernor, P a u 1 Totomis, once 
rounded up thousands of inno-
cent Greeks in concentration 
camps. 
Totomis was the Junta's 
Minister of Public Order for 
six months after the 1967 
coup. This charming Athenian 
man-about-town put up the 
columnists at the plush King 
George Hotel, arranged lot-
their first class travel and 
picked up their bills for fine 
wines and Greek foods. 
The suave Totomis and his 
bosses would have gotten their 
money's worth out of the jun-
ket if the only man on it had 
been Ralph de Toledano, who 
distributes his conservative 
views to 100 papers. "For the. 
first time in its 150 years of hi-
dependence," wrote de 
Toledano, "Greece is prosper-
ing and the people satisfied." 
But de Toledano had another 
gift for the Greeks. When To-
tomis' bank sponsored a pavil-
_lion at the Greek-American _ 
STATINTL 
ore Gifts to Greeks 
AHEPA conference in Atlanta, 
deToledano wrote Vice Presi-
dent Spiro Agnew on Totomis' 
behalf. The Vice President did 
not know Totomis, but took 
de Toledano's word for the 
Greek's good works. 
In a personal letter, Agnew 
? without ever seeing ' the 
bank's pavillion ? lauded To-
tomis' contribution to Greek-
American amity. The letter 
has been proudly publicized 
by Totomis. 
The dictatorship reaped fur-
? 
ther benefits from columnist 
James J. Kilpatrick, who 
praised the way things are 
going under the military re-
gime. The capable. sometimes 
caustic Kilpatrick lailed to tO1 
his millions of readers that 
the bank had picked up his 
tab when he singled out-the 
bank for praise. 
The more the present gov-
ernment succeeds in promot-
ing industrial growth around. 
the country, the more secure 
that government becomes. 
Through . . . such energetic 
outfits as the Hellenic In-
dustrial Development Bank, 
the government is doing just 
that," wrote Kilpatrick. 
Other kind words were writ-
ten by junketeering column-
ists Anthony Harrigan, who 
doubles as executive vice pres-
ident of the Southern States 
Industrial Council; former Na-
tional Press Club President 
Allan Cromley; Daily Oklaho-
man bureau chief in Washing-
ton; Robert Baskin, Dallas 
Morning News political writer, 
and Oscar Naumann, Journal 
of Commerce economic writer. 
While most of the copy writ-
ten by the subsidized tourists 
is favorable to the junta, 
Cromley and Naumann did 
take a few honest bites at the i 
dictatorship. Cromley wrote 
candidly: 'The fact is that the, 
present government is a form ; 
of dictatorship which exer-
cises sporadic censorship of 
the press and exists without 
periodic consent of the gov-
ernment." Naumann criticized 
the Greek steel industry. 
When we questioned the col- i 
umnists about their week of I 
junketing, the reaction was 
mixed. De Toieclano said: "I'll 
stick by my i:riendship with I 
Paul Totomis. I think he's! 
doing a helluva job there." 
The facile de Toledano said he 
had even helped out Totomis 
with a little unpaid public re-
lations work. 
Kilpatrick called it a "rou-
tine industrial tour," and said 
he had been led to believe the 
Greek government had not 
picked up the tab. Baskin, 
Cromley and Naumann also 
spoke frankly with us. 
Only Harrigan, who finds 
even President Nixon's poli-
tics too far left for him from 
time to time, refused to dis-
cuss the junket. 
We reached Totomis by 
overseas telephone at his bank 
in Athens. For 45 minutes he 
vigorously defended himself. 
There was nothing wrong with 
the tour, he said. As for his 
roundup of Greeks in 1967, he 
said there had been no corn-
plaints from the detainees. In 
any case, he said he . was 
merely carrying out orders 
from higher up. "I have lived 
my entire life in honor," he 
said. 
Footnote: Among other jun-
keteers were travel writer 
Theo McCormick and U.S. 
Steel public relations man 
Tom Geoghegan. One of those 
invited by Totomis, AP eco-
nomic writer Sterling Green, 
turned down the junket be-
cause free trips are against 
AP policy. 
Intelligence Reports - 
Anti-CIA Campaign ? The 
Soviets, apparently, have 
launched a world-wide cam-
paign to discredit the Central 
Intelligence Agency. Particu-
larly in Asia, Soviet propa-
ganda blames the CIA for 
everything from conspiring 
against President Ferdinand 
Marcos in the Philippines to 
stirring up ill will between 
India and Bangladesh. 
Mao's Successor ? Intelli-
gence reports say Chipa's 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung and 
Premier Chou En-lai have dis-
cussed how to prepare the 
Chinese public for the inevita-
ble demise of the revered 
Mao. The attempt to build up 
Lin Palo as a successor led 
to an abortive coup when he 
got in too big a hurry to take 
over. Mao is said to recognize, 
however, that he cannot :live 
much longer and that a suc-
cessor must be groomed who 
can 'hold China together.

Sputnik briefly in '58 
Washington 14)--The Central 
Intelligence Agency stole the 
Soviet Sputnik to examine it 
minutely while it was on a 
world tour in 1953. says a new 
book by a former intelligence 
agent. . 
Patrick J. McGarvey. in 
"CIA?The Myth & the M;-. d-
ness," a book critical of the 
agency, relates: 
"The Sputnik display was 
stolen for three hours by a CIAt 
team which completely dis, 
mantled it, took samples of it 
structure, photographed IL 
reassembled it and returned i 
to its original place unde-
tected.? . 
? . CIA review required 
The country where this oc-
curred, Mr. McGarvey said, 
was among the things in about 
100 lines the CIA cut out when 
he submitted his manuscript to 
the CIA. Review by the CIA 
was required under his secrecy 
agreement signed when he 
joined the agency, he said. 
Other things Mr. McGarvey 
says he is revealing for the 
first time include: 
I. ,Intelligence . bickering 
nearly provoked Chinese Com-
munist entry into the Vietnam 
war in 1966. 
2. Richard Helms, director 
of central intelligence, taps 
the phones of his subordinates. 
3. The FBI tried to enlist the 
CIA in an attempt to "scandal-
ize" Stokely Carmichael, the 
black civil rights activist, in 
Hong Kong during his travels 
in 1967. 
4. The ill-fated Pueblo mis-
sion and capture by North 
Korea was unnecessary since 
all the targets it was working 
against were already ade-
quately covered by other intel-
ligence sources. 
The CIA had no comment on 
Mr. McGarvey's book. And in 
giving him the go-ahead, the 
agency wrote Mr. McGarvey if 
any claim is made that the 
CIA "in any ?way approves 
your book or confirms the ac-
curacy of any information con-
tained therein, it will be offi-
cially denied and we will con-
sider what other action may be 
appropriate under the circum-
stances." 
Mr. McGarvey is a 14-year 
veteran in intelligence, three 
lyears with the CIA, the rest 
I with the Army's National Secu-
!rity Agency and the Defense 
;Intelligence Agency between ; 
1955 and 1969. 
He served in intelligence as- ! 
signments in Korea, Japan, I 
Taiwan and Vietnam. 
Battling with 2 authors 
Mr. McGarvey's book is one 
of three new books on the CIA 
but the agency is battling with 
authors of the other two who 
did not present theirs for clear-
ance. 
The CIA tried to block the 
publication several months ago 
of "The Politics of Heroin in 
Southeast Asia" by Alfred 
McCoy, which accused the CIA 
of heavy involvement in drug 
traffic in that area. The book 
was published over CIA pro-
test. 
Last spring, the CIA won a 
federal court injunction to 
block publication and speeches / 
by a former high-ranking intel-
ligence official, Victor Mar-
chetti. He is now appealing to 
the Supreme Court.

_Bx-Aide of C.I.A. Says U.S. Bombed Leper Colony 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special ta 'The New York Z:mes 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19?A 
former Central Intelligence 
Agency official said in a new? 
book publish:NA today that the 
Air Force bombed a North Viet-
namese leper colony in 1966 
after Air Force photo analysts 
mistakenly concluded that the 
tuildings?surrounded by two 
rows of barbed-wire fence?
were a North Vietnamese divi-
sion headouartees. 
The former agent, Patrick J. 
McGarvey, spent 14 years with 
the C.I.A.. the Defense Intelli-
gence Agency and Air Force 
intelligence before resigning in 
1969. 
In his book, "C.I.A.. the 
Myth.& Madness," published 
by the Saturday Acvw Press, 
Mr. McGarvey charges that de-
fense agency and C.I.A. special-
Lts were overwhehninely con-
cerned with providing what he, 
called "intelligence to please"; 
and would often distort facts1 
tu do so. 
In some cases, he contended, 
vital information was withheld It 
from the White House by bu-
reaucrats anxious to avoid crit-
icism. . 
The leper-colony incident be-
gan, Mr. McGarvey wrote, afterld 
the Air Force reported that iti 
had spotted a division head-la 
quarters in reconnaissance phols 
tographs. At the time, the scrv- 1 
ice was eager to destroy the n 
fighting capability of the North 
Vietnamese Army, then largely 
still in the north. 
"They spot:co' a huge, heavily 
guarded compound at a village 
called Quynh Loc," Mr. Mc_ 
official said. "No public men.. 
tion was ever made of the in-
cident." 
"An honest portrayal of what 
intelligence is all about must 
conclude that the C.I.A. is a 
insuffera'ele bureaucratie mc-
rass with little or no central 
direction sorely needing drastic 
change," Mr. Mcfarney wrote. 
A spokesman for the C.I.A. 
confirmed that Mr. McGarvey 
had worked there, but refused 
comment on the book. The book 
was sent to the agency for re-
oiew before publication, Mr. Mc 
Garvey said, and only a few 
minor segments. were deleted. 
In a letter to Mr. N1cGareey 
clearing the book for publica-
tion, an agency official noted 
that if any claim- is made that 
the C.I.A.. "in any way ap-
proves your book or confirms 
the accuracy of any informa-
ion contained here therein, it 
will be officiallyd 
Sputnik Reported Stolen 
Although the book's title 
cats with the C.I.A., the bulk 
of Mr. McGarvey's criticisms an 
necdotes are drawn from his 
ervice with the Defense Intel-
igcnce Agency during the Viet-
a m War. 
Associated Press 
Patrick J. McGarvey 
Joint . Chiefs "insisted that 
D.I.A. label the facility a pos. 
sible military . headquarters 
site." His account went on: 
"D.1.A, acceded to this demand. 
On May C, 1966, a heavy bomb-
ing raid was mounted against 
the facilily." 
'No Pub:ic Mention Made' 
"A few days 1'ter," Mr. Mc-
Gravey wrote, "the North Viet-

"They proved to be the pos-

In the book, Mr. McGarvey 
also reports that C.I.A. agents 
successfully stole the Soviet 
  Sputnik for three hours while 
the missle was on a world tour 
Garvey said.. "The compound shortly after its successful 
was isolated and ringed with launch. The C.I.A. team "I mm.

WASHINGTON POST 
SEP 1972 
The Washington Merry-Go-Round 
Nixpn, Expects Ste 
? By Jack Anderson 
? President Nixon was opti-
mistic until a few weeks ago 
about achieving a cease-fire in 
.Vielnim before the Nov. 7 
-'election. Now he expects 
Hanoi to Step up the fighting 
as the election gets closer: 
Intelligence reports suggest 
that fighting on all fronts will 
be combined with guerrilla ac-
tivity in the rear to create tun. Mr. Nixon figured, the North 
moil in South Vietnam and to Vietnamese would be com-
pelled to come -to terms. He 
was willing to offer terms, in-
deed, that he thought Hanoi 
would find hard to turn down. 
Reaching Moscow and Pe-
king took longer and the di-
plomacy was more sophisti-
cated than the President had 
anticipated. But a month ago, 
it looked as if the scenario 
would turn out largely as he 
had foreseen. 
He pressed for a cease-fire 
and the release of American 
prisoners. In return, he prom-
ised that the United States 
would cease all military activ-
ity, withdraw from Vietnam 
and leave it to the Vietnamese 
ultimately to settle their own 
affairs. He also made the 
point that he would be easier 
to deal with before his re-elec-
tion than afterward. 
Subsequently, the White 
House learned that both Mos-
cow and Peking had advised 
Hanoi that Mr. Nixon would 
;to appeal over Hanoi's head to be re-elected and, therefore, 
Moscow and Peking. He hoped 
to sit down separately with 
Russian and Chinese leaders 
for some straight talk. He 
thought he could persuade 
them that U.S. friendship 
could be more valuable to 
them than Hanoi's favor. 
Without the support of their 
two great Communist allies, 
undermine confidence in the 
Saigon government. But the 
real Communist aim, in Mr. 
Nixon's Opinion, is to give the 
American voters the impres-
sion he can't end the war. 
From sources close to the 
President, we have been told 
of his bitter disappointment 
over Hanoi's refusal to accept 
a. cease-fire. He has responded 
with Cold War rhetoric, which 
he feels is the best political 
defense against the expected 
North Vietnamese offensive. 
But he .would prefer to cam-
paign as a peacemaker. 
The story of his diplomatic-
military maneuvering to settle 
the war began four years ago 
with his. campaign promise of 
a "secret plan" to end the war. 
This was greeted with derision 
by Democrats and skepticism 
by others. But those privy to 
the President's strategy assure 
us that he not only had .a "se-
cret plan" but that it has come 
close to succeeding. 
Nixon's Secret Plan 
His "secret plan" simply was 
? 
STATI NTL 
. Vie  17-1 
et 41,1 
? ? 
that serious negotiations 
should be resumed. This led to 
the secret talks between 
Henry Kissinger and Le Due 
Tho. 
The word from Moscow and 
Peking was so optimistic that 
the President felt sure he 
would get a cease-fire. Presi-
dent Thieu, for his part, even 
agreed to step down and per-
mit an internationally super-
vised election in South Viet-
nam. But the negotiations 
broke down over the question 
of who would control the in-
terim government. ? 
President Nixon had ex-
pected to be able to tell the 
.Republican convention last 
month how he had kept his? 
end-the-war pledge. Instead, 
he 'returned 'to Cold War rhet-
oric in his acceptance speech, 
promising not to "betray our 
ailies" nor to "stain the honor 
of the United States." 
Washington Whirl 
Secret Rays?CIA officials 
were intrigued over the Soviet 
charge that the Americans 
used mysterious rays and 
chemicals to defeat Russia's 
Boris Spassky, the defending 
world chess champion. A thor-
ough examination of the chess 
area, of course, producedino 
trace of hidden rays or chemi-
cals. But- the CIA men suspect 
that the Soviets were holler-
, ? 
ing about a technique that 
they, in fact, use. Back in the 
1960s, U.S. security. men dis-
covered that strange micro-
wave impulses, some steady, 
some pulsating, were 'directed 
into our Moscow embassy 
from a neighboring building. 
A CIA investigation turned up 
Russian medical literature, 
suggesting that microwaves 
can cause nervous tension, ir-
ritability, even disorders. A se-
cret study produced no conclu-
sive evidence, however, that 
the mysterious microwaves 
had any serious effect uPen 
our embassy people. 
Curious Coincidence?State 
highway officials arc required 
by law to submit reports to 
the federal government 'ex-
plaining how their road proj-
ects will affect the environ-
ment. Two Washington, D.C. 
scientists have discovered, 
however, that the highway of-
ficials care so little about 
their reports that they copy 
whole sections word-for-word 
from their colleagues across 
the 'country. Drs. James Sulli-
van and Paul Montgomery of 
the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest found identical 
sentences being used by high-

Neither the N.S.A. nor the

Senior Government intelli-
gence officials who were shown

view discounted parts of it but 
corroborated others. 
David Kahn, author of "The 
Codebreakers," (published by 
Macmillan in 1967) and a lead-
ing authority on cryptoanalysis, 
said in a telephone interview, 
that the Ramparts article "rep-
resents much new informationi 
that rings true to me and seerns1

lenged some points, specifically 
Mr. Peck's assertion that the 
agency's experts are able to. 
"break every Soviet code with 
remarkable success." 
Top-grade Soviet Foreign 
Ministry code systeths "have 
been unbreakable since the 
nineteen thirties" Mr. Kahn, 
said. He added that it was) 
"highly unlikely that they have 
switched to breakable codes." 
Mr. Peck's contention that 
"information gathered by N.S.A. 
is complete" implies a false 
importance, Mr. Kahn said. The 
N.S.A. does, he said, "solve" 
many nations' diplomatic Codes; 
but -these are countries of the 
third rank and provide only 
"indirect clues to Communist 
intentions." 
Mr. Kahn noted that "what 
we are doing in this field thei 
Russians are doing and, eon-, 
trary tot he Ramparts state-)

He pointed out finally that 
the "thrust of the article, that

incorrect." ' 
"I believe that in the existing

Mr. Kahn said, "N.S.A. can pro-

"One of the most extraordinary 
developments in recent years 
within the Soviet Union has been 
'he emergence within of samiz-
dat, that is, the private publica-
tion and circulation of one's own 
works," the Library of Congress' 
study of Radio Liberty says. 
"Samizdat" has been lauded as 
a cry for freedom from out the 
Russian wasteland by the New 
York Times, by "kremlinologists" 
and by other exponents of free-
dom: 
The reality is somewhat dif-
ferent, as the Library of Congress 
study shows. 
Radio Liberty?the Central In-
'telligence Agency broadcast di-
rected at the Soviet Union?has 
become a main depository for 
samizdat. 
. Foreign correspondents are 
"one of the majoi? channels of 
the flow" of samizdat, according 
to Peter Reddaway, a "Soviet 
specialist" at the London School 
of Economics. This has been evi-
dent in the dispatches of the 
New York Times and other news-
paper correspondents. 
In fact, "normally, samizdat... 
documents are not sent specifi-
cally to RL from the Soviet 
Union. Most documents have been 
publicized elsewhere before RL 
gets them." 
The Library of Congress study 
emphasizes by repetition how 
important samizdat has become 
in RL's anti-Soviet barrage and 
how important RI, has become 
for the dissemination of samiz-
dat. - . . 
The study says:, 
, 
Samizdat is "presently the main 
staple of RL's programming." 
"RL has become a prime source 
for uniting the disparate elements 
of Soviet samizdat producers . . . 
a disseminator of all forms of 
samizdat from both the Russians 
and the (Soviet) nationalities. . ." 
It is a "prime transmitter of 
samizdat." 
Radio Liberty is a "prime bene-
ficiary of samizdat." ' 
In the past two years, the Lib-
rary of Congress study says, "the

In fact, the CIA's Radio Liberty

The Washington Merry-Go-Round 
raintvash' Attempt by Russia. iris. 
By Jack Anderson 
, -Hidden in the Central Intel-
ti ligen_ce Agency's/ most secret 
files is an account of a possi-
ble Soviet attempt to "brain-
wash" our embassy personnel 
in Moscow with mysterious 
microwaves. 
The fantastic details are 
contained in a file marked 
"Operation Pandora," which 
describes how the Russians 
bombarded our embassy with 
eerie, low-radiation impulses. 
Their secret intent, it was sus-
pected, may have been to alter 
the personalities . of our diplo-
mats. 
'The bizarre story began in 
1945 when a Russian pres-
ented Averell Harriman, then 
our ambassador, with a hand-
some carved' Great Seal of the 
'United States. Harriman 
proudly hung it in the em-
bassy. 
?. The seal contained a tiny 
electronic eavesdropping de-
vice, which monitored conver-
sations inside the embassy 
until 1952, when, it was de-
tected. From this shocking dis-
covery came urgent orders 
that all embassies must be pe-
riodically checked for elec-
tronic signals. 
In the '60, U.S. security men 
discovered the strange micro-
wave impulses, . some steady, 
some pulsating, directed into 
our Moscow embassy from a 
neighboring building. 
The CIA quickly learned 
that Russian medical litera-
ture suggested microwaves 
can cause nervous tension, ir- own laboratory. 
ritablility, even disorders. 
They speculated that the Rus-
sians were trying to drive 
American diplomats stir crazy 
with the waves. 
Neither the Cia nor the 
State Department had the f a-
dlities to test the effects of 
the silent rays on human 
beings. At the Pentagon, how-
ever, the super-secret Ad-
vanced Research Project had 
worked on electronic sensors 
and other weird projects. 
The agency quietly began a 
study, under the direction of 
Richard Cesaro, into the ef-
fects of microwaves on people. 
Cesaro gave the project the 
code name, "Operation Pan-
dora," and called in a physi-
cian, Dr. Herb Pollack, and 
two crack military scientists, 
Dr. Joseph Sharp of Walter 
Reed Army hospital, and engi-
neer-microwave expert Mark 
Grove of the Air Force. 
Sharp and Grove, supplied 
with the microwave data moni-
tored in the embassy, dupli-
cated the embassy environ-
ment, using monkeys for dip-
lomats. ? 
The monkeys actually were 
trained to perform tasks and 
then were rewarded with food, 
much as embassy employees 
might be rewarded with a dry 
martini at the end of the day. 
The monkeys were studied 
night and day for months at 
Walter Reed, while a collat-
eral experiment was con-
ducted on rabbits by consult-
ant Dr. Milton Zaret in his 
? : 
In the embassy in Moscow, 
meanwhile, no one except the 
highest diplomats and security 
men were aware of the secret 
microwave drama. 
By 1967, the scientists felt 
they had watcned the monkeys 
long enough for a tentative 
reading. Some felt there were 
signs of "aberrant behavior" 
caused by the microwaves, but 
the msajority ,d1sagreed. Only 
the rabbits showed clear 
changes?in their heart rate?
which Zaret attributed to heat 
from the rays. 
The disagreement on psy-
chological changes were sent 
to a top secret reviewing 
board, which also could reach 
no absolute .conclusion that 
the rays affected the monkeys' 
minds. 
Nevertheless, the suspicion 
lingered, and the White House 
decided that even if the micro-
waves were not "brainwash-
ing" embassy people, they 
should be halted. It was also 
suspected that the waves 
might be part of some radical 
new surveillance technique. . 
? At the June 1967 Glassboro 
meeting between president 
Lyndon Johnson and Soviet 
Primier Aleksei Kosygin, the 
question of the microwave 
rays came up. One informant 
insists Johnson personally 
asked Kosygin to end the ray 
bombardment, although other 
sources say the request was 
made at a lower level. 
By 1968, most of Cesaro's 
scientists were convinced that 
the microwaves were not psy-
chologically harmful and the 
embassy experiments ended In 
early. 1969. , 
The brilliant work done by 
the team, however, has now 
led to important research on 
the effects of microwaves. So 
far, tests show high radiation 
can injure eyes, genital organs 
and perhaps .other parts of the 
body. But, as yet, there is no: 
conclusive proof that low-level 
radiation is harmful.

with Cesaro, Pollack, Sharp, 
Zaret and Grove. All acknowl-
edged they worked on "Opera-
tion Pandora," but all refuse 
to go into details. As Sharp 
put it: "Pandora was classified 
in those days and still is."

COUNTERFEIT NEWS 
Howard Hughes, Nikita Khrushchev, and the perils of secret journalism 
AsI_D SO CLIFFORD IRVING, a name 
hardly known a year ago, has 
now established himself as one of the 
great confidence tricksters of the cen-
tury. In the nature of the case, such 
success is failure?or is it? 
As the glorious brass of the Howard 
Hughes hoax began to glimmer 
through the steam that swirls in the 
corridors of the Time-Life Building 
these days, somebody of unusual de-
tachment compared Irving's Hughes 
to Han Van Meegeren's Vermeers. 
The comparison bit deeper than in-
tended, a broadax that sank the sap-
ling and then the logger's foot. The 
money? Meegeren sold his eight fake 
Vermeers, one to Hermann Goering, 
for millions; Irving got McGraw-Hill, 
Life, Dell, and Book-of-the-Month to 
commit something like $2 million 
(estimates yary ) of which about 
$750,000 was actually paid over. Our 
fashionable confusion about defini-
tions is titillated: does a picture, when 
proved a fake, remain art? Is a forged 
biography literature? 
In the dark interior of every con 
game is the ambiguous tender rela-
tion between swindler and victim, 
where the victim so desperately wants 
to keep on believing, while the swin-
dler must ever struggle against the 
mutinous impulse to be honest, par-
ticularly since honesty would so 
gratify the dwarfed creative ego that 
wants its talent and daring recognized 
at last. Meegeren forged his first Ver-
meer to prove himself more than a 
mediocre painter; after the war, self-
exposure became a necessity when he 
painted a ninth fake in a Dutch court-
room to prove himself innocent of col-
laborating with the enemy by selling 
the one that went to Goering. Can a 
con be aid and comfort? Does a 
pirated manuscript remain a commer-
cial enterprise? Should creative fak-
ery be discouraged at all?for is there 
not about such an objet non retrouve 
the same curious aspect John Kenneth 
Galbraith once perceived in the un-
discovered em 
net increase 
That must have been true for the 
Belgian museum expert who still in-
sisted, years after Meegeren's confes-
sion, that two of the disputed Ver-
meers were genuine. And weeks after 
Irving was exposed, there was a wist-
ful touch of the same reluctance to. 
grow psychically poorer, in the way 
Harold McGraw, while saying that his 
company was fully insured against 
losses through fraud, still acknowl-
edged a lingering hope that something 
of the manuscript was salvageable. 
Vermeer being dead suggests only 
that hell may not, after all, be other 
people but counterfeits of oneself. 
Hughes, though, was widely thought 
to be alive, so what Irving could have 
dreamed he would gain remains a 
mystery, despite Time's devoting half 
a rueful cover story to his childhood. 
In the nature of the case, such spec-
tacular failure is success. 
McGraw-Hill's lust to believe was 
as pathetic as the little old lady's who 
sells all her AT&T to invest in the 
Ponce de Leon Water Resources De-
velopment Corp. The motives around 
Life were more complex. Time Inc. 
is evidently establishing a new cate-
gory of news, to be called secret 
journalism. Of course, once Hughes 
staged his conference phone call to 
six reporters in Los Angeles, secret 
journalism began to shed cloaks and 
veils and ostrich plumes; Time and 
Life managed to stay a day or so 
ahead of the New York Times in 
chronicling their own inside story. 
The fevered mood of the weeks and 
months before, though, has hardly 
been conveyed. 
Secret journalism evidently sup-
presses taste. Irving's Hughes was 
pastiche so thick it had lumps, some 
of it apparently lifted right out of the 
Time Inc. morgue. Yet Life's manag-
ing editor, Ralph Graves, could write 
after the fact that "It was marvelous 
stuff.. .. Even the boring parts were 
persuasive." The seeming appetite to 
be swindled could gulp down Irving's 
insistence that Hughes, though he had 
authorized the autobiography, was 
yet so publicity-shy he could not be 
approached independently. Then Irv-
ing suddenly claimed Hughes would 
switch publishers if his fee were not 
boosted to S650,000;. far from scaring 
off the fish, that twitch set the hook?
and proved Irving. a master of the au-
thentic psychology of the bogus. 
"Senor de Leon is not really sure he 
wants to sell, he's feeling younger 
every day." 
Secret journalism certainly sup-
presses ordinary caution. "That a big 
news organization with the resources 
of Life should fall for it surprises me," 
the New York Times quoted the presi-
dent of Random House as saying, 
again after the fact. "They should 
have checked it out." When on 
December 7, Life and McGraw-Hill at 
last announced their publishing coup, 
it was news to almost everyone at 
Time Inc., news to the one man best 
qualified to check it out?Frank Mc-
Culloch, chief of Time's New York 
bureau, a brilliant hard-news investi-
gator, a friend of Hughes, the last 
journalist known to have interviewed 
him. McCulloch himself had once 
drawn back at the brink of signing a 
contract to write a book about 
Hughes. On December 14, McCulloch 
received an invitation that has since 
become famous: would he take a 
phone call from Howard Hughes. 
What journalist wouldn't? McCulloch 
checked upstairs, in the high-ceil-
inged, wood-paneled hush of fft..

he Samovar Papers 
By RUSSELL BAKER 
WASHINGTON, March 27?Profes-
sor Kissinger, who has been arrang-
ing President Nixon's visit to the 
Soviet Union, has run into a samovar 
problem with the Kremlin leaders. 
The difficulty arises from the Presi? 
dent's desire to make his televised ap-
pearances in Russia just as diverting 
as his recent appearances from China. 
In Peking, one of the great moments 
occurred at a state banquet when the 
President surprised the television audi-
ence by eating his dinner with chop-
sticks. 
The President does not want the So.-
viet leaders to feel that he has 
slighted them. He wants to assure 
them of equal banqueting surprise 
time on television. For this reason he 
has been practicing hard on the sam-
ovar for the past month. 
His plan, which Professor Kissinger 
put to the Russians, was to preside at 
a big samovar during a great banquet 
in the Kremlin and produce the tea 
for the entire assemblage. 
The President has, in fact, become 
so proficient on the samovar that 
among the press releases already com-
posed for release during his May visit 
to Moscow is one which begins, "Pres-
ident Nixon last night became the first 
American President to make tea from 
a samovar in the Kremlin. . . ." ? 
That press release will probay 
have to be scrapped. The Russians, 
though insisting that they are willing 
to go to great lengths to make the trip 
a success, say they have polled the 
members of the Central Committee 
and found that 82 per cent want cof-
fee instead of tea after dinner. 
They say it would be a gross provo-
cation for the President to ignore the 
preference of the majority and concen-
trate his attention upon the out-of-step 
few who want tea.

singer, they will not object, 
OBSERVER 
Professor Kissinger hag inquired 
whether the coffee could be made in 
a samovar. The Soviet central ban-
queting collective has replied that it 
takes years to learn to make a good 
cup of coffee in a samovar. It would 
be more practical, the White House 
has been advised, for the President to, 
leave the banqueting hall, go into the 
kitchen and make the coffee in five 
ten-gallon vats similar to those used 
in American drugstores. 
Excellent TV camera positions can 
be arranged by the vats to provide 
good angles of the, President turning 
knobs and releasing steaming coffee. 
Professor Kissinger has told the So-
viet leaders that this is not what the 
President had in mind. He has ex-
plained that the President wants to 
show that he is sufficiently interested 
in Russian culture to master some as-
pect of it. The coffee vat, with its 
poisonous brew, was purely American, 
he protested. 
The Kremlin said, in that case, may-
be the President would like to tend 
bar during the cocktail hour. They 
say the cocktail hour is an old Rus-
sian cultural tradition invented soon 
after the discovery of vodka. The 
President could master it very rapidly, 
they said, with just a few hours prac-
tice, on some vodka and dry vermouth. 
Naturally, Professor Kissinger said 
no, and the samovar issue was left 
unsettled while the Russians and the 
professor argued about how small the 
President's airport reception crowd 
should be. 
The Russians, who do not want to 
be outdone by the Chinese, want the 
welcoming crowd limited to seven 
people. Professor Kissinger is asking 
for billions, naturally; he is accus-
Re4efited2091,0131trafe.ntl*-R. 
STATI NTL 
The Russians say this is impossible 
because their economy is booming so 
magnificently that no more than 
seven people can be spared from the 
factories. Professor Kissinger has re-
plied that the United States will sup-
ply its own crowd, composed of 
C.I.A. agents assigned to the Soviet 
Union, if the Russians will promise not 
to take their pictures. He awaits a So-
viet reply. 
Leonid Brezhnev, the head Com-
munist, has personally intervened in 
the samovar issue. If the President 
wants to do something on television to 
illustrate his mastery of some phase 
of Russian culture; Mr. BrZzhnev has 
suggested to Professor Kissinger, he 
might learn to dance while in the 
deep-knee-bend position. Mr. Brezhnev 
says this would make for a smashing 
TV finale to a Kremlin state banquet. 
i Or, he has Su'ggesteci, the President 
might like to wrestle a bear. It is not 
known what President Nixon has de-
cided, but over the weekend bear 
tracks were seen in the White House 
Red Room.

Pogromist propaganda 
For years, now, the New York Times, second only to 
the Central Intelligence Agency, has incited Zionist senti-
ments among a section of Jews in the Soviet Union. 
The main ideological plank of its program has been 
the falsehood that in the Soviet Union Jews are discrimin-
ated against. It has sought to incite Soviet Jews to anti-
Soviet actions, to induce Jews to emigrate from the Soviet 
Union to Israel, 
. Nov it complains in a recent editorial ? commenting 
on a speech by Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow ? that Brezh-
nev "takes no account of the general Arab suspicions about 
what may be hidden behind the increased flow of Soviet 
Jews allowed to migrate to Israel." 
These are not "general Arab suspicions." They did 
not flower in the Arab lands. 
They have been manufactured in the New York Times 
editorial offices on West 43 Street, in New York City. 
Their purpose is to arouse chauvinist, anti-Semitic 
elements among the Arabs in order to use them against the 
Soviet Union. 
The very Jews whom the New York Times and the CIA 
have induced to quit their socialist homeland, and go to 
Israel, are now- pointed to by the New York Times as the 
most dangerous enemies of the Arabs ? because they are, 
allegedly, Soviet agents. 
At the end of its anti-Soviet road, we find the Times 
inciting anti-Semitism against former Soviet Jews, finger-
ing them for whatever anti-Semites it can move into action.

Samizdat, Meany and the 
During the past couple of years the capitalist press, 
especially the New York Times, has reported how Soviet 
poets, writers, and scientists have resorted to "samizdat" 
to get their words to the world. 
Via "samizdat" ? self-publishing ? the beleaguered 
intellectuals, through typewritten carbon copies, mimeo-
?graph, hectograph or other primitive publishing- means, 
have bared their tortured souls, and have appealed to the 
conscience of the world for support, or so the Times 
claimed. 
We now have the Library of Congress to thank for re-
moving the?v-eil from "samizdat." 
Dr. Joseph G. Whelan, head of the Library of Con-
gress' anti-Soviet operations, revealed last week that the 
"samizdat" business is a CIA operation. 
The Library of Congress has been an 'unlikely source 
for truth about The socialist world, devoted as it is to anti-
Sovietism. 
However, when Senator William Fulbright, chairman 
, of the Foreign Relations Committee, demanded that the 
:U.S. quit funding Radio Liberty, a CIA operation in 
Munich, West Germany, Whelan complained that this 
would end the means of distributing "samizdat" in the 
Soviet Union. This ;`movement will unquestionably re-
ceive a serious setback,' Whelan said. 
The alleged cry for freedom from "SOviet intel-
lectuals" is thus revealed to be, as long suspected, just a 
fink CIA operation. ? 
It shares this distinction with Radio Free -Europe, 
Radio Liberty, and the Assembly for Captive European 
Nations. . . 
? All have been fed out of the U.S. Treasury to incite? 
subversion and rebellion against.socialism. 
George Meany's complaint last weekend that the 
ACEN's $250,000 a year payoff has been ended is one 
more token of the fact that his heart belongs to the CIA, as 
does his"foreign secretary," Jay Lovestone. 
Meany's spiritual and other relations to the CIA are 
of long standing. His opposition to the Soviet Union and-
socialism reflects his devotion to U.S. imperialism. That 
devotion accounts for his unconscionable support of the 
ravaging of Indochina by the U.S. 
Meany's devotion to U.S. imperialism is betrayal of 
the most elementary interests of the U.S. workers, is 
enmity to the national liberation movement throughout 
the world.

STAT I NTL 
The Government of loctor Caligari 
BERTRAM D. WOLFE 
The following is based upon an address delivered on De-, 
cember 3, 1971 to a Conference on Literature and Politics 
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, held at Stanford 
University, December 2-4, 1971, with the participation of 
experts on East European Literature and Politics from many 
countries. 
AT THE SAME MOMENT that the address was being 
-delivered, the same theme was being considered at a World 
Psychiatric Association Congress being held in Mexico City. 
The Congress was in receipt of appeals from such distin-
guished Soviet scientists as nuclear physicist Andrei Sak-
harov and such literary figures as Dmitri von Mohrenschildt, 
editor of the Russian Review, as well as appeals from the 
World Federation of Mental Health (which concluded its 
congress in Hong Kong on November 25), the British Co-
lumbia Medical Association which, asked for a resolution 
condemning the "unethical and anti-humanitarian activity" 
of police-dominated psychiatrists in the USSR, the Van-
couver and the All-Canadian Psychiatric Associations, the 
British Psychiatric Journal, and a group of archbishops of the 
Russian Orthodox Church meeting outside the Soviet Union 
to adopt their appeal against "the corrupt use of psychiatric 
hospitals." Despite this pressure from the members of their 
own profession, and shocked editorials in the Washington 
Post, the New York Times, the London Times, L'Express, 
the Swedish press and radio, and many other public and 
scientific bodies, a secret conference of the World Psychi-
atric Association leaders on December 2, from which the 
press was excluded, decided to refuse to show solidarity with 
the police-pressed Russian psychiatrists compelled to violate 
their Hippocratic Oath, and to leave the victims of the police 
psychiatric methods without support from the psychiatrists 
of the world?on the legalistic grounds that they might 
alienate the Russian delegation (which contained more than 
the usual quota of police psychiatrists) and on the further 
ground that their constitution did not "provide the mecha-
nism" whereby attempts might be made to raise the stand-
ards of psychiatry among their sixty thousand members. 
They even prohibited debate or discussion of the practice 
complained against. How much cowardice, and how much 
knavery was involved one cannot know, but it is significant 
that around the conference in Mexico City, there were not 
lacking men to approach the reporters with the explanation 
that the suflerings of the KGB victims in insane asylums in 
Russia was nothing but a sinister myth of the American CIA. 
Indeed, Professor Andrei V. Snezhevsky, Chief Psychiatrist 
of. the Soviet Ministry of Health and a reporter to the Con-
gress, did not hesitate to call 5 press conference in defiance 
of the "no discussion" decision, in which he too charged 
that painfully detailed stories of such men as Inures A. 
Medvediev in his book, A Question of Madness, were noth-
ing but "a maneuver of the cold war carried out by the 
hands of experts." 
?BDW 
IN 1955, with that remarkable nose 
of his for sniffing every slightest change 
in the breeze, Ilya Ehrenburg published 
in this country his novel The Thaw. 
Thereby he started a new trend among 
those of our Soviet experts who belong 
to the Candide school of Sovietology. 
But I who have seen the great iceflows 
crashing and breaking up in the spring 
011 the Moscow River could see no re-
semblance between the freeing of the 
frozen river and Ehrenburg's Thaw. 
Hence, reviewing his book in the late 
lamented New York Herald Tribune, I 
commented that it looked like a thaw 
on a ground of permafrost. The re-
cently published paper of Vera Dunham 
on the "Stalinist Debris" that .still clut-
ters up the Moscow popular literary 
scene painfully confirms my gloomy 
view of the traWknik, 
against the wishful UN& 
burg and of the Candide school of So-
vietology. The Dunham paper, as now 
made available to us, does not paint a 
pleasant picture of the Moscow literary 
scene at the close of 1971, but there is 
no point in blaming a conscientious 
messenger for bad tidings. Any com-
plaints should be addressed to the 
proper party?and I mean party?and 
to its grim yet faceless spokesman, Il-
yich II, who can properly be distin-
guished from Ilyich I Bolshoi [the great] 
by granting him his proper title of 
Ilyich Malenkii [the little]. 
When Stalin died, no one, ?I thought, 
would ever be able to improve upon. 
or add anything to his terrifying dis-
coveries in the art and science of con-
fession and torture. ? But now I must 
recognize that though his lieutenants 
have borrowed from his arsenal of tor-
octim9RelgeMfitngf" 
very moderation they have invented a 
new torment that in important respects 
out-Stalins Stalin and out-Hitlers Hitler. 
It is not part of the Stalinist debris 
which Vera Dunham has examined, 
and, in a sense, it even overshadows the 
oft-asked question: "Are they restoring 
Stalinism?" 
SINCE IN the Soviet Union power is 
knowledge and power over everything 
is knowledge of everything, we must 
trace this new invention back to Nikita 
Sergeevich Khrushchev who, until Oc-
tober 16, 1964, knew everything fr9m 
how a painter should paint, a milkmaid 
milk, or a psychiatrist diagnose to how 
an astronaut should find proof of athe-
ism among the stars. On March 10, 
1963, we find him telling the readers

The. alleged assassin of President Kennedy was si-

walled up in prison as is the assassin of Senator Robert 
Kennedy. In all three cases there is widespread convic-

their sponsors: 
? Furthermore, a conscious effort has been made ? in 
the Warren report, in the various court proceedings ? to 
obscure the fact that, whosoever's finger pulled the trig-
ger, behind the assassin was the figure of fascism. 
Political assassination marked the rise of fascism in 
Italy and Germany; it is a trademark of fascistic develop-
ment in the U.S. 
? The aim of fascism is to resolve, the critical situation 
in which U.S. capitalism finds itself by resort to totalitar-
ian rule; and by eliminating anyone who stands in the way. 
The attempted assassination of personnel at the Sov-
iet United Nations Mission Wednesday night is part of 
that program. ,.i , 
The attempted _ assassination has been preceded by

into the act, delivering to the Belgian government the

- It is a transparent effort to counteract, by anti-Soviet 
hysteria, the uncompromising drive for peace on the part

- For half a century, the Americans and. the 
Rutsians have been at one another's throats or, 
occasionally, in one?another's arms. But one factor 
In the relationship has remained constant ---. 
? . 
spymg. ? 
. . 
The espionage game never falters, and it is a. 
contest that has yet to Produce a clear winner. The 
U.S. spends mere money and has more scientific 
equipment. But no one puts more agents in the 
field than the reammotli ? Soviet espionage 
establishment. ? 
? Though 105 Soviet officials were recently 
ejected from Britain because of spying activities, 
the chief target of the Russian apparatus remains 
the U.S. 
There ate 214 Soviet ? citizens professionally 
employed in Washington,' mostly at the Soviet 
Embassy, and 419 in New York where they Ivork 
at the UN and for commercial organizaticnis such 
as Amterg, Intoueist and Aeroflot.-
, ? 
U.S. OFFICIALS consider that about 50 per cent 
of these Russians are engaged to greater or lesser 
extent in espionage. Adding iii the non-working 
dePendents Of these individuals, the total of Soviet 
? citizens legally in the U.S. comes to about 1,250. 
? ell is taken for granted that some of the wives 
among these .dependents are also involved in 'es-
pionage. . 
There are also short-term travelers, members of 
commercial, cultural and even sports delegations. 
These, too, are considered to have their. share of 
pies.- ? ? '? ? e. ? 
."We. do as a matter. of common 'sense make 
certain assemptions-that Soviet officials who come 
to the U.S. will attempt to take advantage of their 
assigned responsibilities' to undertake extracur-
ricular activities," says State Department spokes-
man Robert McCloskey. ? ..?. . ? 
-"That being so,. we will exercise-- care and at-
tempt to keep ourselves as well informed as we 
possibly- can about any of these activities." 
, 
SPYING PAYS considerably more dividends' for. 
a Soviet citizen than for, his counterpart In the 
West. - . ? 
? 
On salary alone, the espiOnage agent starts his 
career With an advantage: he is paid twice the 
.wages of an engineer or a teacher and his Fay is 
customarily doubled ? and his standard of living 
notably improved -- when he is assigned overseas.? 
?- "In the old days," says an Ameeican expert in 
the field, "Soviet agents were rattler forbidding 
characters, chosen for ideological purity as much 
as 'for anything else. But that's been changing.

"Now they're .getting a young- -recruit who's an-
xious to live ?abroad and enjoy the amenities of the 
service life. They're probably less dedicated to the., 
Soviet ideology, more sophisticated, more aware 
of what's going on in the world: In A sense, this 
makes theni more challenging adversaries." 
These adversaries are also considerably more 
uprdly mobile than Western spies.' ' 
TII14. SOVIET espionage establishment Is a 
direct; route to power in Russian life. It has huge 
influence ? and sometimes dominance ? not only 
in the political tile of the country but in the army 
and even in important iihases of industry. 
And the intelligence apparatus has first priority. 
Any source, any person Can be approached for '

OTTAWA, Ont., Oct 2?The 
Russian embassy was condem-
ned as ugly when it was built 
but will be. as attractive as 
money can make it when Sovi-
et Premier Alexei. Kosygin ar-
rives here on Oct. 18 for a vis-
it. 
A Contractor stimated that 
the Russians are spending $20,-
000 or more on new furnish-
ings, fresh paint .and new 
grass to transform their for-
b i d dl n g looking diplomatic 
base into a thing of beauty. 
- Foors Polished 
oors are being sanded and 
polished, walls painted, trees 
pruned, shrubbery planted and 
new sod is replacing old be-
hind the high iron fence that 
encloses the grounds. A brick 
wall aim shuts in a greenhouse 
and garden where the Rus-
sians grow their own vegeta-
bles, including sweet corn. 
Kosygin, the first Soviet pre-
mier to visit Canada, will tour 
the country for a week after a 
round of receptions in Ottawa 
as the guest. of Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau. 
Soviet Ambassador Boris P. 
Miroshnichenko, who lives in" 
the embassy, has 31 officers on 
his diplomatic staff. The Unit-
ed States as 34 officers at its 
embassy of Renaissance style 
architecture on Wellington 
Street facing Parliament Hill. 
The 'Russian Embassy was 
built in 1956 at a cost of 
$340,000 after fire destroyed 
the former embassy, an old 
mansion in the Sandy Hill dis-
Arid which the Soviet Union 
bad purchased in 1942 from the 
estate of an Ottawa lumber 
baron. ? ? 
A city. council building com-
mittee criticized plans for te 
new embassy; a squarish, 
three-storey structure,, as "dis-
appointing and dull." The Fed-
eral District Commission also 
attacked the design, especially 
2.0"0.19wagra 
that the Russian building cre-
ated a monotonous and unhap-
py effect in its neighborhood. 
. Both the old and new embas-
sies ave hbeen publicized as 
spy centers, starting with the 
exposure of the first Russian 
spy ring in Canada in 1946 by 
Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk 
who defecled from the embas-
sy with a quantity 'of evidence. 
On 1965, after Canada had ex-
pelled two Russian diplomats 
because of espionage activities, 
he Russian nespaper Ozvestia 
said that tile new embassy had 
been bugged by the U. S. Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency during 
? its construction. 
Tells U. S. Role 
The paper said that an 
American adviser had guided 
Canadian intelligence opera-
tives in placing Abierican 
in-
crophones in the walls of the 
enibassy as it was built. 
Various small anti-Commu-
nist demonstrations have taken 
place outside the fence of the 
embassy and abortive attempts 
have been mad to bomb or 
burn it. ? 
The burning of the old em-
bassy, however, was consid-
ered accidental, originating 
during a New Year's Eve par-

soon joined by a second 'man, 
who took the reporter's pic-

Great Spy Roundup 
NOT - EVEN IN SPY MOVIES at which the 
British excel, can we recall a roundup of agents of 
a foreign power to compare in numbers with last 
"Week's denunciation by Britain of 105 Soviet espio-
nage agents. There is certainly no ground for ac-
cusing the British government of being half-
hearted about this; it is breathtaking in scale and 
'will be the envy ad the Deuxieme 
Bureaux of many another country, ao will be say-
ing, "I wish we'd done that." ' ? 
The episode ha S much style, and it makes 
Scotland .Yard look very knowledgeable and in:. 
scrutable, as its men always- do in motion pictures 
of this genre. We are happy, also, to learn that the 
plot, as so far laid bare, brings in not merely a. 
highly placed KGB defector, but also the inevitable 
"big -Daimler limousine." In filling out the picture 
of. Soviet villainy; the Associated Press has in-
formed us that this automobile, which is of course 
the status symbol of royalty and supercapitalism, 
was regularly used to drive one N. V. Nikitkin 
from "fashionable Highgate," where he lives; to 
the Narodny Bank in the city, where, it appears, he 
worked at harboring spies as well as financing 
East-West trade.' 
IT: MAY BE OUT OF KEEPING for "us to

England no fewer than 90 of the 550 Soviet per-
sons who are attached to their London Embassy: 
Relations between London and Moscow have be-.

Still, a network of this size and character irre-

WASHINGTON ? The Central 
Intelligence Agency, has ? long 
Seared the type of 'lass exposure 
:that befell Soviet irdelligence in 
Britain last week, a confidential 
report disclosed Monday. ?-
The report shows Mat the CIA

offices to "unofficial cover" --

It acknowledges that tough 
Russian security has forced the 
CIA to collect intelligence on the 
Sov!et Union through "third-
country" operations ? just as the 
Russians apparently were seeking 
intelligence on the United States 
through its spy apparatus in 
Britain.. .

,has been, obtained by The Chicago

STATINTL 
Sun-limes, is based on a dis-
cuksion among several former 
high-ranking intelligence officials 
onducted by :the Council on 
oreign Relations in New York on 
Jan. S, 19.68. 
Richard M. Bissell, forme). 
deputy director of the CIA and 
moderator'ot: the discussion, has 
confirmed the authenticity of the 
report, which is headed: "Con-
fidential: Not for 'publication. 
Restricted to. group membees 
only. Not to be quoted'or cited:" 
? 
THE PARTICIPANTS included 
Allen Duties, the late director of 
the CIA; Robert Amory Jr., a 
former deputy director of the CIA; 
Eugene Fubini, former assistant 
cretary of defense in the area of STATI 
electronic intelligence; Thomas I.. 
Hughes, former director of the 
State Department's Bureau of In-
telligence and Research, and 
Theodore Sorensen, special assis-
tant to president Kennedy. 
Although the report does' not 
identify the source of various opin-
ions ? and comments, Bissell' ap-
pears to have been the main con-
tributor. ' 
"If the agency is to . be effec-
tive," the repart deelarei at one 
point, "it will have to make use of 
privat4 institutions on an mond-
ing scale . . CIA's interface with; 
the rest of the world needs to be 
. better protected." 
? ' 
THE REPORT calls for. Weeper 
cover" and "increased attention to 
.the use. of 'cut-cuts' " defin6d in a 
footnote As '"projects backed by 
the CIA wh'ch cannot' be traced 
back to the CIA." 
The report concedes that iliere 
are "powerful reasons" for con-
cealing CIA agents within U. S. 
embassies, principally to provide 
safe means of communication to 
Washington. 
"Nonetheless," it goes on, "It is 
ossible and desirable,' although. 
iffieult and tinie-coauming, to 
uild overseas in apparatus of 
nofficia! cover. This would re-
uire the use or creation- of 
rivate organizations, many of the 
ersonnel of which would be non-
S. nationals, with freer entry 
nto the local society and less im-
lieation for the official U. S. pos-
? . . ? . 
THE REPORT suggested links* 
,with U. S. corporations which. 
could make tiler own lines' of 
. communication available to CIA 
agents. ' ' 
All 105 'of the Russian officials 
. expelled by Britain last Friday 
were under "official cover," 
'operating' out of the Soviet em-

they were much more susceptible

Agency of the U.S. Philby also asserts 
thatthe CIA was behind the Penkovsky ,

? 
By Jack Anderson 
. . 
t The Central Intelligence 
Adency has been eavesdrop-
?ping, incredibly, on the most 
private conversations of 
.Kremlin and other world lead-
era. 
For obvious sectirity Tea-
' sons, we can't give *clue as to 
bow it's done. But we can 
State categorically that, for 
V 'years, the CIA has been able 
;to listen to the kingpins of the 
'Kremlin banter, bicker and 
,backbite among themselves. 
A competent soiree, 'with 
access to the transcripts of the 
;private Kremlin converse-
',lions, tells us thet the Soviet 
;leaders gossip about one an-
{other and complain about their 
aliments like old maids. 
It Is evident from the con-
versations that Leonid Brezh-
fnev, the party chief, some-
times drinits too much vodka 
, and suffers from hangovers. 
Premier Kosygin, however, is 
in poor health,- and his corn-
;plaints are more authentic. 
I One of their favorite pas-
I-times is visiting a private 
;clinic to get tlwir aches 
'soothed. Like fat caPitalists at 
the end of a bard day in their 
plush suites, the Kremlin 
chiefs stop by for steam baths, 
.rubdowns and other physical 
-therapy.

President Nikolai Podgorny 
might chortle, as if he is quite 
familiar with the masseuse. 
Mao Close .T.Jp 
Like the Kremlin crowd, the 
Red Chinese leaders are far 
less forbidding in private than 
they appear to the world. The 
'nightly Mao Tse-tung, hrs en-
nointed successor Lin Piao 
and Premier Chou En-lat are 
tired, old revolutionaries 
slowed down by the ravages of 
age. 
Mao shares Brezhenev's 
taste for good food, strong 
drink and a woman's .touch. 
But he is less grumpy and. 
grim than the Soviet leader. 
Thees.'s an avuncular affabil-
ity about Mao, and he has an 
infectious laugh. 
But at '17, he walks slowly, 
though erectly, with his left 
arm dangling strangely. The 
CIA concluded from a careful 
study of film shots that Mao's 
eyes are ? dim from age.. He 
seems unable to recognize old 
comrades until they are face 
to face. ? 
The CIA has also caught the 
old fox using a ringer to stand 
in for him at long, dreary pub-
lic parades. But it was the real 
Mao who made that publi-
cized plunge in the Yangtze a 
couple years ago. The picture 
above the waves was carefully 
scrutinized by the CIA, which 
concluded after measuring his 
ears and other facial features 
that the swimmer was no dou-
ble. 
Pictures of world leaders 
routinely are blown up and 
studied by CIA doctors for 
clues to their health. Their be-
havior is also analyzed by CIA 
psychiatrists ? and psycholo-
gists. 
Footnote: One of the -CIA's 
greatest triumphs, heretofore 
untold, was fishing out'some 
of the late Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev's excrement be-
fore it was flushed down the 
toilet. The great bathroom 
caper was pulled clurin,g his 
1959 state visit to the U.S. The 
filched feces was eagerly ana-
lyzed by CIA medics who con, 
eluded that Khrushchev then 
was in excellent health for a 
man of his age and rotundity..

One of the most notorious 
regimes in the American labor 
movement may be near its 
end. 
Pete Weber, the strongman, 
$136,000 a-year boss of the Op-
erating Engineers in New Jer-
sey, has 'gone to jail for extor-
tion. His brother Ed, who ran 
for his job, has been beaten by 
Larry Cahill, an honest, vet-
eran union man. . ? 
But there is life in the old 
Weber -machine yet. Cahill's 
supporters were subjected to 
bullyboy tactics to coerce 
them going along -with Ed 
Weber. ? . 
Cars 'with Cahill bumper 
stickers had their tires slashed 
and windows broken. Three 
Cahill men were beaten up.. 
Others were laid off work by. 
pro-Weber union foremen.

izens a r e again being 
warned to beware of stran-
gers bearing flight bags 
and guidebooks.. . - 
The operative word for 
Soviet citizens who come 
In contact with foreigners 
is: "vigilance." 
As Kommunist, a bi-
monthly magazine pub-
lished by the Communkt 
Party's Central Commit-
tee, put it. in its latest 
Issue: 
"Espionage and icieologs 
fealty subversive activity 
against our country is con-
ducted . . . with the assis-
tance of (U.S.) agents who 
arrive in our country as 
tourists, members of dele-
gations or specialists. 
Special centers in the 
United States find suitable 
candidates for trips to the ' 
Soviet Union and train 
them for intelligence acti-
.vities." 
It added: 
"One must not forget 
that the class struggle is 
-being waged in all fp heres 
?politica!, economic and 
ideological -a- within the 
conditions Of 'p e -a ceful 
Coexistence' of states with 
differing social .s'ystems.".. 
- .The warning represents 
a .conflict between ideolo-
gy ? and the praetical, re-
:quirements of ?the .Soviet 
- ? 
As always, the Kremlin 
is ? suspicious of visitors 
.from countries of 'differ-
ing social syste.ms." After 
more than 52 years since 
;the advent of Soviet pow-
er, the ?government still 
hasn't shaken off the. polit-
And in that half centorya 
the government .still does-
n't trust its Own people, 
despite all the "evidence" 
of "socialist supariority.". 
On the other hand, the 
Kremlin is. eager for for-
eigners to visit the Soviet 
Union. They bring in 
needed hard currency for 
the nation's foreign - ex-. 
chap ge program. The 
Yankee dollarz?dcspite of-
ficial gloating over RS' 
troubles in Western Eur-
ope---is still as desirable as 
ever in the Soviet Union. 
The Krei-1.11in does n' t 
disclose how Much it earns 
in foreign exchange from. 
tourists. who last year -to-
taled slightly more than 2 . 
million. . 
The government . also 
welcomes delegations " of. 
professional or o c u p a-
tional groups, and profes-
ses ardent support for cul-
tural-exchange programs. 
Here, too, its interest is . 
basically practical, at. least 
as far as cultural-exChange 
visits to the Soviet Union 
are concerned. It is eager 
to tap the knowledge. of vi-
siting- specialists, especial-
ly at this time when it is

As part of the effort to 
boost tour is m, - Viktor 
Boichenko, chairman of 
Intourist, the Soviet travel 
agency, recently declared: 
"The country irresistab- ? 
ly draws foreign visitors 
who desire to see for 
themselves what has been 
achieved under Soviet 
power, to study the life of 
the Soviet peoples, as well 
as their culture and arts."

As though the present 
isolation of the foreign

government recently an-

special "club" in an old

sively for _tourists this 
summer to provide them 
with a "flavor" -of Russian

Of course, Soviet suspic-

are not all due to political 
paranoia. Some Wester-

Union for the purpose of 
causing trouble for the

Spies by the thousands: report from Germany 
TT' % sproslcz CAN HAnDLY be described 
4;444 as the ideal form of contact be-
tween peoples, but it has become so 
much a part of life in Germany today 
that its citizens have come almost to 
take it for graated. Dr. Horst Wors-
ner, a lawyer specializing in spies, said 
recently, "a divided postwar Germany 
continues to be in the center of the tug-
of-war between the victorious powers 
and furnishes the soil for an intelli-
gence jungle that sometimes confuses 
even those in the know." Who works 
for whom, or for what reasons, may be 
as difficult to determine as a clear defi-
-nition of what constitutes treason. 
When the fatherland is split, which 
fatherland is a German betraying? The-
.oretically, if not politically, he has a 
right to serve either. It is common 
knowledge that for years the East Ger-
man regime has used the refugee chan-
nel to smuggle agents with long-term 
assignments to the other side. Under the 
circumstances, even the most legitimate 
political refugee has to appear suspect. 
The so-called "atom spy" Harald Gott-
fried; who came across in '55 at the age 
of twenty, told his interrogators in the 
refugee camp that he had wanted to 
escape the East German draft, "because 
I would never have worn the uniform of 
those who put my father into prison."? 
His father, a former Nail, had been con-
victed for minor shenanigans to eight ? 
years hard labor. His mother lied to the 
West before he did. But Gottfried was 
already such a convinced Communist 
that East Germany's Stoatssicherheits-
diens: (Secret State Se:vice) selected 
him as a Perspektiv-Spion, a spy for the 
future. On orders from his superiors at 
Karlshorst, East Berlia, hz studied en-

gineering in the West and suhsetraently 
joined the staff of 'lest Gemla.ny,s most 
advanced nuclear-reactor 'project in 
Karlsruhe. It took West Ger:aan coun-
terintelligence fourteen ye...:s to catch 
up with him. He was certainly not re-
pentant in court; he told the judge that 
assignments like his were not only hon-
orable, but "evidence of a special trust." 
Dieter Joachim Haase, thirty-three, 
another lonn?-terrn agent, was caught in 
Wiirzburg rast year. .1.1e had just com-
pleted a doctoral thesis on the &saes-
weld. with Professor Friedrich August 
von der Heydte who, as a former para-
troop general in the old Vehrmacht, 
had many close associates in the upper 
echelons of the Bluadeswehr staff. The 
court which tried Haase found that he, 
too, "had been selected by the Secret 
Service of the GDR (German Democrat-
ic Republic, or East Germany] in 1960 
to prepare himself for a high govern-
ment post in West Germany through the 
completion of legal studies." 
Men like Haase and Gottfried run 
little risk. Through their activities in 
the espionage services in the West, they 
advance their eventual careers in the 
East. If they are caught, they are quickly 
exchanged for an undetermined number 
of West German agents or political pris-
oners, depending on the importance 
either of the regimes attaches to such 
people. Sometimes the exchange is one 
man for three, or more. Many agents 
who are caught do not even get to trial; 
they are exchanged before the public 
ever hears of their existence. West Ger-
many's Interior Minister, Hans-Dieter 
Genscher, remarked, "spying is in 
danger of becoming- a cavalier crime 
with little risk attached," but he is pow-
u/ar political debt to either side, who 
wants to join his family in the West, is 
about $12,000. Sufficient numbers of 
people are purchased in this manner 
every year to make the take a respect-
able item in East Germany's balance of 
.yrnents with the West, I Was told. 
Meanwhile, West German counterin-
telligence officials admit that there is 
simply no way for them to stop the con-
tinuous infiltration of East German 
agents. According to their estimates, 
anywhere between 13,000 and 15,000 
East German spies are active at all levels 
of West Germany's administration, in 
private industry, at universities, and in 
the armed forces. Every year about 
2,000 of them are unmasked, but, as a 
confidential report noted recently, "the 
total remains constant through the arri-
val of new elements." The main reason 
for the facility with which East Ger- . 
many can replenish its intelligence serv-
ices in the West is to be found, of 
course, in the language and cultural 
background that they share. Western 
authorities have not put great obstacles 
in their way, either. An East German 
can still travel to the West simply by 
getting on the elevated S-Bahn in Berlin 
and leaving it at an unguarded station 
in one of the Allied sectors. Armed with 
a false West German passport, he can 
then emplane at Tempelhof airport for 
any city in West Germany. 
N VIEW OF THE POLITICALLY heteroge-
iineous backgrounds that are the norm 
rather than the exception for officials, 
it is practically impossible to establish 
firm criteria by which to judge them as 
security risks. Few Western officials are 
erless against the practice. West Ger- without some sort of family link in the

NEW YORK, May I3?Radio reporter 
Sam Jaffe last night told the world how ./ 
the Central Intelligence Agency tried to 17 
;recruit him as a spy on two separate occa-
sions. ? 
The former ABC and CBS newsman re- J' 
ported this information on a videotaped 
.WNYC-TV program "All About Television." 
WNYC is a municipal station whose exist-
ence is threatened by city budget cut-backs. 
, Jaffe said his initial encounter with the 
CIA occurred in California while waiting 
- to hear from CBS News where he had fil-
ed a job application. A young man, whom 
Jaffe believed to be called Jerry Rubins, , 
-told Jaffe that if he was willing to work 
at a spy, he would get a paid trip to Mos-
I cow. 
Jaffe quoted the CIA as saying we "are 
willing to release certain top secret infor-
mation to you in order that you try to ob-
tain information, for us." Jaffe cordially 
refused the offer. 
The correspondent had formerly worked 
at the United Nations when he returned 
from Korea and had contact at the U.N. ? 
with Soviet citizens. 
Wanted ched on spy pilot. 
The second encounter with the CIA or-
cured around the time of the U-2 incident 
in IS30 when Jaffe was assigned to CBS to 
go to Moscow to cover the downed spy Dila 
trial, Francis Gary Powers. Jaffe said that 
the CIA wanted him to discover whether 
'Powers was brainwashed. 
_ . - 
"What they really wanted," says Jaffe, 
"I don't know to this day." 
? He has not seen the CIA since that time. 
News of the Jaffe telecast was front-
paged in Variety, newspaper of the enter-
tainment world, in its May 12 issue. 
Jeff Erdel, Director of Public Relations 
at WNYC to the Daily World today that the 
program "All About Television," is another 
"first" for the radio and T.V. station. 
. ? 
"We have always been en open micro-
phone to those who were denied time on 
other stations," he said. Proposed city cut-
backs which threaten the existence of 
WNYC "can only be interpreted as a with-
drawal of that right to free speech," he i. 
added.

From RussfaVith 
StaThrL.. 
the pull-gum of a revved 
? 
ideology 
A student of Middle Eastern affairs 
who has read the Soviet press in 
February and March 1971 is left with 
one overwhelming impression. .The 
impression created by the spate of 
articles, commentaries and news re-
ports both in the Moscow press and 
in the newspapers published in the 
capitals of the union republics is that 
the Soviet Union is engatted in a 
world-wide defensive struggle against 
"World Zionism- and that Israel 
itself. the Arab world and the Middle 
Eastern peace talks being pursued 
under Dr Jarring's direction, are 
secondary to this struggle. 
To a student of Soviet affairs, on 
the other hand, what is significant 
about the "anti-Zionist" campaign is 
that its fundamental arguments belong 
to the Stalinist era. For the fact is that 
. the basic ingredients of the current 
"anti-Zionist" campaign were first 
blended in the charges levelled against 
Mikhoels and the other executed 
Jewish writers and poets and refined 
in the "Crimean Affair". whose chief 
victim wasThe Old Bolshevik Solomon 
Lozovsky. 
They were all accused of having 
.betrayed their Soviet homeland in 
order to serve the interests of "Jewish 
bourgeois nationalism" and Zionism. 
which. in turn, were described as 
serving .American imperialism. in its 
Approvea i-or Keiease 
1 
wor ar ice ?y o s a av n 
"Anti-Sovietism?the tionists' Pro-
fession". "The' logic of the socio-
economic developments of the two 
world-wide systems?the capitalist 
and the socialist?determines the 
sharpening of the ideological struggle 
between them," Bolshakov began his 
article. "Into this.strusle imperialism 
is launching ever new forces, from its 
decreasing reserves of 'brain washers' 
and ideological diversipnists. An in-
creasingly active role in these imper-
ialist activities directed against 
socialism and the forces of progress 
is played by the. Zionist circles." 
Bolshakov then went on: 
preparations for a nuclear war against 
the Soviet Union and its allies. The 
accusations were elaborated during 
the Slansky trial and would have 
achieved the perfection of a "Marxist-
Leninist" dogma at the trial of the 
doctors but for Stalin's death. 
That the paranoiac concoctions of 
Stalin's closing years should now be 
served up to the Soviet public as an 
explanation and justification of Soviet 
policies in the Middle East docs 
suggest a surprising degree of ideo-
logical sterility or rack of originality. 
among the men who rule the Soviet 
Union today. It is all the more striking 
because on March 5 every Soviet 
paper carried an article on Rosa 
Luxemburg. who was born on that 
day a hundred years earlier. Not one 
of the articles mentioned the fact that 
she was a Jewess: nor did any of them 
point out that it was Jewish cosmo-
politanism that made it possible for 
Rosa Luxemburg and her Jewish 
husband. Leo Joeiches. to become the 
leaders of the Marxist movement in. 
Poland. Russia and Germany. and so 
achieve the ideals of socialist inter-
nationalism as conceived by Karl 
Marx and Lenin. ? 
Instead. the Soviet public could 
read in the February 18 and 19 issues 
of Pravda the mouthpiece of the 
Wt Communist Parts'. a 3.000- 
1/03/04: CIA-RDP80-01601 
? . 
-The actions of Zionism are directed 
not only in siiPport of the State of 
Israel. The intaiiiiitional Zionist corpora-
tion, in the shape of the World Zionist 
Organisation and-its fronts, the World 
Jewish Congress and other numerous 
branches and Agencies. represents at the 
same time one of the greatest concentra-
tions of financial capital and one ape 
greatest internAtionail centres of espion-
age, as well aisjsil.misinformation and 
slander.... 
-There is nothing fortuitous about 
the fact that the political and ideological 
offensive launched by Zionism against 
the Soviet U.Lion: ..and other socialist - 
states hassoincided with the acceptance 
by the planners of America's foreign 
policy of the sq:eatled theory orbuilding 
bridges' between :the capitalist and 
socialist camps. The first practical test 
of this theory and the policies built on it 
... was the evqs in Czechoslovakia in 
1968. 
"In the scenagioof the 'quiet counter-
revolution' worked out in the United 
States. and at the Hudson Institute in 
particular. a special role in the 1968 
events was assigned to the international 
Zionist corporation. Its tasks included, 
in particular. the Capture of the press and 
other information media in Czecho-
slovakia. The Zionist centre directed 
this operation: 
-The collapse of the plot hatched by 
the international reaction against 
Czechoslovakia shattered the fur-reach-
ing plans of American imperialism and 
its Zionist henchmen. In Washington 
the partisans of the 'bridge-building' 
school gave way to the partisans of a 
'tough line' towards the Soviet Union 
and other socialist states. 
-The cold-war winds blowing from 
Washington billowed the sails of Zionist 
propaganda,. Not averse to exporting 
'the quiet co'unterrevolution' into the 
socialist states. the International. Zionist 
Corporation also set out to prepare plans 
for a widespread anti-Soviet campaign.

By John Kenneth Galbraith 
At lunch in Iowa about fifteen years ago Roswell 
Garst, the great corn man, fold me of a meeting that he 
had just had With Nikita Khrushchev. Having saturated 
the United States market with Pioneer Hybrid Corn, 
: Garst had been looking around for new customers and 
the Soviet Union had come strongly into .his thoughts. 
.The Garsts relate thought very closely to action. He had 
gone to Moscow several nionths,earlier, made a sales call 
on the Kremlin and left samples, but had not been sue-
cessfuls-a highly atypical result. But then a few weeks

John Kenneth Golbraith:s most recetzt book is Ambassa-

Years. His -Economics, Peace and Laughter will be pub-
? liShed this. :spring. .  ? ' 
* later the Soviet Enibassy in 'Washington had asked him 
? :Urgently to come back. He went to see Khrushchev, 
whose interest in corn had greatly deepened in the in-
: terval. The huge ear.encased in clear plastic which Garst 
had left on his earlier visit was prominent on his desk. 
For a long afternoon he questioned Garst about U.S. 
methods of corn culture?techniques of hybridization, 
? land preparation, -Cultivation, fertilization, harvesting, 
storag,e and more. The telephone did not ring; there 
were no interruptions, Garst said he began to wonder 
who was running the country. Finally he begged to ask 
a quegtion himself. 
"I assume, Mr. Chairman, that you have methods of 
' getting information from the United States?that if we 
have some new atomic secret you get it in a couple of 
weeks." 
Khrushchev interrupted, angrily shaking his finger at 
Garst. "No! No!, we insist! One week only!" 
"One week or two weeks, it doesn't matter," said 
Garst. "I still must ask why you question me about mat-
ters which are in our experiment station bulletins, which 
our Extension Service-4 pound into the heads of our 
_ _ 
farmers, which are completely available and in "Iowa 
hard to avoid?"

When the aristocracy _first learned that potatoes were 
the cheapest way of feeding the peasants the peasants 
?'This story was On my mind last autumn when I began. 
to read the Khrushchevanemoiis, as they are commonly STATINTL 
called, in the London papers. I imagined that they owed 
their interest to the murky process by which they were 
acquired and that, for literary and narrative power, 
Khrushchev probably ranked somewhere between 
Kwame Nkrurnah and John J. Rooney of New York. I 
was wrong. After reading the book and a fair number of 
the American and English reviews I've concluded that a 
word should be said for a fellow-author. I think, with 
- - 
exceptions, he's had a bum rap from the critics. 
? There was first the question of authenticity?a greater 
:.question witlanglish than American critics, quite a fei 
of whom have attributed it to the CIA. The CIA can be 
excluded on very simple grounds. No one with that kind 
of imagination could be had for government pay. AS a 
novelist with Hollywood possibilities he mould be worth 
up to ten times as much. Even Lyndon Johnson could 
have doubled his pay as ghost Wel come out ahead. It 
may be that the KGB, which also gets po'isible credit, 
has less competition and thus can'hire this kind of talent, 
but even those who think it responsible agree that it must 
have marked very closely with original Khrushchev 
material. ? 
The critics have also complained that there isn't ranch 
that is new, but this is tilso true of the memoirs of Dwight 
D. Eisenhower and Harold Macmillan and, unlike these 
worthy books, the Khrushchev production is full of per-
fectly fascinating stories. Unlike most other writers of 
memoirs, he has readers other than himself in mind, 
which is not a bad thing. Ain] however jaded the experts 
may be, I was delighted to read about high level in
as it is conducted in the Kremlin, how Britain, Chits 
idge's and George Brown looked to a visiting Russian, 
and what a terrible indignity it is to arrive at an inter-
national conference in a teeny two-motor airplane, 
which was what happened to the Soviets in Geneva in 
1955. (All the others had four-motor jobs.) Payton 
Fritchey believes the best thing is the account of his ex-
change with, President Eisenhower at the latter's 
"dacha" at Camp David. Each tells how he is pressed by 
his ,generals for new and expensive weapons, how be 
Irani); resists, how ha explains that money is Short, how 
, the generals persist, how. eventually he gives in. 
I thought the accounts of home life with J. Stalin even 
better 1'o person is so little to be envied as the man who 
must keep company with the panjandruins 61 state. He 
has a good address but terrible working -conditions and 
there is something in, the juxtaposition to power that 
wouldn't eat them. But whatever you can say for Our: ? 
aristocrats, they knew their Russians. They put high; 
? 
fences around the potato patches, the peasants iminedi-
Ately started stealing the potatoes. In no time at all they 
had developed a taste for them. You should have kept 
your corn a secret."

ConfPci: Over Khrus 
The controversy over the claimed 
memoirs of Khrushchev published In 
' the United States has not died down, 
and the claims as to both authorship 
and intent are far apart. . 
george Kennan, who is well ac-
quainted with the Soviet Union, re-
cently wrote in The New York Re-
. View, "It is . . . not impossible that 
' the appearance of the book in the 
West will lend itself to exploitation 
In Russia precisely for the purpose of 
? discrediting, along with the person 
sifs Khrushchev, the concepts with 
which his name has been associated; 
one cannot even exclude the possibil-
ity that the operation was encouraged 
- in certain quarters with just this in 
mind . ? . One is left . . . only with the 
%. strong impression that certain per-
.. sons interested in ideas often attrib-
uted to Khrushchev have taken ad-
? vantage of his age and l Infirmity and 
?- 'helpless situation to prepare for pub-
?' lication in the form we know, this 
?' body of material based on things he 
Is known to have said, or has been 
heard to say." 
i In Kennan's view then, perhaps 
even the current leaders of Russia 
; were not 'unhappy with the publita-
flan or the anti-Sielleist memoirs be-
cause they discredited Mrushchev 
Is well as Stalin. 
In a completely opposite view, 
Victor Zorza wrote in the Manchester 
Guardian Weekly that "the anti-Stal-
inist emphasis of the memoirs. is so 
-obvious That it has been stressed by 
virtually every reviewer . . . But if 
anti-Stalinism was the 'chief concern' 
of the people responsible for the 
memoirs, it could not have been of 
the KGB (the Soviet secret police). 
\"AntieStalinism is, on the other 
t

CL eamgaira-Insofar as anti-Stalin-
ism in the Soviet Union is ultimately 
a factor for the maintenance of peace, 
the CIA would see it as one of its 
functions to foster this ,by every 
means available to it . . . and some- : 
times, to create the means, when 
these are not available. . 
"I do not regard myself as a CIA V: 
baiter. But just as you don't shoot 
at your own side in war, so intelli-
gence agencies should confine their 
'Via' work' to the territory of the ad; 
Versary. To foist on the Western 
world a book like the Khrushchev 
memoirs is to interfere with the free 
flow of accurate information which 
the people of the Weateni countries 
must have to form their political opin-
ions. Intelligence operations of this 
kind can damage the 'democratic 
process," wrote 7.017.a. 
Both Kerman and Zorza obvious-
ly; do not believe that the Memoirs 
are the untampered-with remem-
brances of Khrushchev. Of even more 
importance. is that both appear to be- ' 
lieve that there were political motiva-

A top official of the Soviet 
State Security Committee 
..(KGB) has accused .the West 
and primarily the .? United 
.States of encouraging political 
;dissent in the Soviet Union to 
"unclevninc" Soviet society. 
.I Senior State Department of-

. of an -artiele by .Semen K. 
. Tsvigun,' first deputy chair: 
man of the KGB; as unusually 
interesting since it is. very 
rare for a secret police official 
?of his rank to publicly address 
-
himself ? to delicate internal, 
? ? problems and do so in such a 
frank manner. 
? Tsvigun said that the United 
-States, "without .giving up 
methods of military pressure 
? and armed adventures, is-now 
forced More and min-e to re-
sort to ideological forms of 
battle" which it is trying to 
tcarry on clirittly on the terri-
tory of the U.S.S.R." 
? These officials saw Tsvi-
gun's article as ari effort to 
alert party workers around 
the country to. clamp down on 
all manifestation of dissent be-
fare the forthcoming 24th 
Communist Party Congress.. 
Dissent Admitted ? 7 
U.S, analysts pointed out 
that the article in effect ad-
mitted to a large party.'audi-
ence that may have been una-
ware of it the existence of po-
litical -dissent as well as. of a. 
-specific Jewish dissent in the 
Soviet Union. ? 
it ? The. dissident movement is

February issue of the , journal 
Politicheskoe? SaMoobrazova-
niye, which has a circulation 
' of 1,7 Million and is designed 
for political guidance of party 
members. ? 
,,? The thrust of Tsvigun's arti-
Cle is that the United States 
through . its various intelli-
gence agencies is trying to cre-
ate and encourage dissent in-
side the Soviet Union "as a 
means of changing the current 
balance of power" in Washing-
tdn's favor. 
Directed at Youth 
1 
Efforts to "morally weaken'' 
Soviet, citizens are directed 
primarily at the Soviet youth 
and "creative intelligentsia." 
In this, the United States is 
using various Zionist organizn-; 
lions which, in turn, are trying 
to turn "Israel into an instru-
ment of political control over; 
citizens of Jewish extraction." 
U.S. tourists, businessmen, 
diplomats, union .leaders, 
journalists, students, memticrs 
of various delegations visitin.,; 
the Soviet Union, according n) 
Tsvigun, all try to convut: 
1 "some persons of Jewish na-. 
tionality into pro-Israeli ele-
ments, spark their emigration 
intentions (to Israel) and .ot-
lect tredentious information." 
Western propaganda, pattic-
? ularly broadcasts by R:tcli0 
Liberty, the Voice of America 
and similar stations base ,7 in 
Western Europe, has occa?;ion-, 
ally been effective, Tsvigun, 
said. . 
"There are cases when indi-
vidual Soviet citizens fall for 
the bait' of enemy propa-
ganda," he said. "Once under 
the influence of ideology that 
is alien to 'socialism, such citi, 
rens turn into supporters of 
our ideological adversaries. 
Regretfully, some of them 
turn into collaborators ' of 
Western intelligence services." 
Bourgeois Attitudes 
He acknowledged that 
'bourgeois attitudes still exist 
in the Soviet Union and that 
"In the conscience of individ-
ual. Soviet citizens some rem-
nants of the past have been 
preserved." 
' "It is known that the main 
effort of. imperialist intelli-
gence .services is directed to-
wdrd our creative intelligent-
sia and the youth," he said. He

Pity The Experts  
i WHEN the experts can't, agree, how is the 
nonexpert public to make up its mind? 
In the controversy over the Khrushchev mem-
oirs, for instance, the most widely varying opin-
ions are expressed by persons with intimate 
knowledge of the Soviet Union. This not only 
adds to the confusion of the ordinary reader, 
but may lead him to suspect that so-called ex-
pert opinion is not all that it's cracked up to be. 
, In England a Russian specialist and profes-
sor on the faculty of the London School ?of 
-Economics called the memoirs "totally worth-
less for the serious student of contemporary 
history." He suggests that the KGB, the Soviet 
secret police, put the book together to confuse 
.the West about Russian policy. Two other En-
glish experts agreed that the memoirs are 
spurious, but one of them believes they were 
written by agents of the U.S. ELntra,1Izt.,relli: 
Agency. 
?air& other side, 30 experts on the Soviet 
Union who met at Washington earlier this 
month concluded that the memoirs are genu-
? ine, and that they were published in the West 
with the permission of the leaders of the Rus-
sian government. And although he found what 
he called "odd and sometimes inexplicable mis-
takes" in the memoirs, Sir William Hayter, ' 
-British ambassador to Russia in the 1950s, ? 
agrees that they are the real thing. 
? Since the supposed author is still living, it 
might be thought that the argument could be 
easily settled. Last November Nikita Khrush-
chev denounced the memoirs as a fabrication, 
and it is in some ways symptomatic of the 
times that the denial by the former Soviet 
leader has carried so little weight in the' dis-
pute. ? 
It is not difficult, of course, to poke fun at 
the experts, with their exotic theories of plots 
by the KGB or the CIA. But it would all be a 
lot funnier if it were not for the nagging sus-
picion that there might be some truth in even 
the wildest explanation. Perhaps instead of 
ridicule, the Kremlin ? expert really deserves 
, sympathy in his attempt to function in an area 
where virtually nothing is what it appears to 
be.

Why? Shapiro Wrote that Petrov was 
said to have been deeply resentful of 
the way' the current Kremlin leader

had some misgivings about the cessa-
tion of the de-Stalinization process 
that Khrushchev had originated and 
hat he wanted to correct the historic 
Injustice to Khrushehey; 
? Thus some experts conclude that Pe-
trov was the key man, having seen the 
opportunity indicated by the 1967 NB 
interview, and that much, if not all, o 
the material in the book got to the 
West by his doing. 
There IS, perhaps, some substantia 
lion- to this thesis in the story of Dr. A. 
McGehee Harvey of the Johns Hopkin 
Hospital in Baltimore. Along with th 
Khrushchev excerpts, Life publishe 
Harvey's account of a meeting wit! 
Kluaishcitev at his retirement dacha 
outside Moscow in late 1969. 
What Life did not report, howeve.r, is 
that when Harvey was about to leave 
the soviet Union, he was subjected to 
most intensive search of his parson 
and hi S baggage. This has led some to 
conclude that by then ? the KGB had 
discovered'. that Petrov had gotten 
tapes out of the country and the offi-

BULGANIN SPEAKS 
The Story of Marshal Bulganin 
3 gns. February 
This massive new work, which is sure to cause a 
publishing sensation, is not so much Bulganin's 
authenticated biography as personal memories dictated 
by the Marshal into a hidden mike in his salt cellar. It is 
preceded by an authentic introduction by Victor Zorza, 
much of which has appeared in corrupt form in first 
editions of the Guardian, and accompanied by copious 
notes by Tibor Szamuely smuggled out of the Spectator, 
but the meat of the work is Bulganin's own version of 
what happened to him before he started investigating the 
funny contraption on the bottom of his salt cellar. 
Here at last is the truth about his split with Khruschev, in 
not one but five equally valid versions. Here at last is the 
true picture of those dark days under Stalin, when no 
man knew what innocent speech delivered to miners 
might not be used twenty years later to pad out an 
autobiography. But here, above all, are the words and 
reminiscences of a man who, for all we know, might have 
been dead for years.

THE WIT AND THE WISDOM 
OF THE KGB 
45/- April 
It is now general knowledge that much of the Russian 
writing printed recently in the West has been partly 
authored by the KGB, and critics have felt that this 
reflects on the quality of the material. We feel, on the 
contrary, that some of their interpolations are of a very 
high quality, and we are proud to present this anthology 
from works they have failed to flog in the West. 
Outstanding are some satirical verses by Mikoyan, of a 
standard that he himself could never have reached, some 
short stories written for a young writer who died before 
he could be brought to trial, and some anecdotes 
omitted from Kruschev Remembers by mistake. There are 
also some telling epigrams, probably written by the 
KGB between books, and some incriminating doodles 
done by Kuznetsov in Moscow after he had fled to 
England. There is a long preface signed by Tibor 
Szamuely on which Edward Crankshaw casts doubt in a 
short foreword signed by Victor Zorza.

THE 
TRUTH 
ABOUT 
VICTOR 
ZORZA 
Edward Crankshaw 
?2 March 
For many years Edward Crankshaw, the famous 
Kremlinologist, has been studying all the writings, 
however obscure and trivial, of Victor Zorza. Most people 
believe that this Russian expert, who rules over Gray's 
Inn Road with a fist of iron, is a man called Victor Zorza, 
but Crankshaw's evidence throws doubt on this. 
"Much of his work appears in the Guardian," he 
comments, "a journal which has always been noted for 
revising original copy with so-called 'misprints.' At first 
I believed that his real name might be Korka, or even 
Sorsa." 
Now, however, he thinks it likely that Zorza is not one 
man at all, but two Russians, an American and a telex 
machine. 
***Edward Crankshaw, the well-known Sovietologist, is a 
team of five embittered Poles. 
DEAR SIR... 
Edward Crankshaw 
15/6 January 
This is in fact a short letter from Kremlinologist 
Crankshaw to his tailor complaining about a suit, which 
was sent to us by mistake and automatically published.

foreword by Tibor Szamuely, as well as some hitherto 
unknown footnotes by Victor Zorza, and the letter itself

VICTOR ZOE ZA has deduced that the Khrushchev memoirs nov 
published in the West are not genuine and that the American

his reasons for thinning they are not by Khrushchev: next week 
he explains how he thinks the CIA was involved.

vinced beyond any doubt; - and ? 
has taken pains ,t.o confirm, that 
this is an authentic record of 
Nikita Khruslichev's words." 
These are not memoirs, the 
publisher insists, but "reminis-
cences." However, for the sake of 
convenience, I will follow the 
usage which has been generally 
adopted and will refer to them as 
memoirs. 
? Spokesmen for "Life," and the 
shall group of men directly con-
cerned in arranging the 'publica-
tion, refuse to state on record any 
fact concerning the provenance of 
the material. However, they have ? 
spoken off the record both to offi-
dals and to journalists of repute 
in the United States, which makes 
it possible to build up a compo-
site picture of the claims they 
make for the book's origins. 
It is claimed that the material 
came in the first place from mem-
bers of the Khrushchev family?
Ns daughter Rada, her husband 
Alexey Adzhpbey, the former edi-
tor of "Izvestia" who, after the fall 
of Khrushchev, was given an in-
significant journalistic post with a 
picture magazine, and another 
son-in-law, Lev- Petrov, also a 
journalist, who died some months 
ago. ? 
The stOry is difficult .to credit, 
because these members of the 
Khrushchev family ? w.ctuld have 
enough experience of international 
affairs to realise that their role 
. ? ? - 
? The Khrushchev memoirs, which have been 
.described l as the publishing. sensation of the decade 
are more than. that: There is a great deal of 
evidence to suggest that they are the publishing 
-hoax of the century. They do not come from: 
Khrushchev. nor, as has often. been asserted, from 
the ,"disinformation department" of the KGB in 
. 
Moscow? although both Khrushchev and the KGB 
had something to do with them. On this occasion, 
however, the Kremlin's "Department D," as it is 
familiarly known in the trade, seems to have had 
the cooperation of its American counterpart, the 
"department of dirty. tricks" in the 'Central Intelli-
gence Agency, which loolS?like being responsible

The evidence for this view which it has taken 
me more than a month to collect, will certainly 
7 be disputed. The reader will have to make up his 
own mind on the facts presented in this series.' I 
./ spoke to Svetlana Stalin (now Mrs Wesley Peters) 
in Arizona, and to Milovan Djilas, the former 
Yugoslav leader, in Belgrade. I have questioned 
the Russian pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy, who has 
.now made his home in Iceland, about the refer-
ences to his activities which appear .in the book. 
But above all else, I have been checking the facts 
: In every accessibie source ? trOm the war archives 
captured by the German, to old copies of "Pravda." 
, - There are literally hundreds of errors of fact, of 
time, and of place in-the book?but the publishers

the managing editor of "Life" 'magazine, which 
Obtained .the material .and then syndicated it

Whatever motives they might

"Life." And, as the disclosure of 
their names in the American

British Experts. Doubt Authenticity g 
or Khrushchev 
P  
?  
? 
By ANTHONY LEWIS 
Seelat to The Ness' Titres *, 
LONDON, Jan. 24?British 
experts on the Soviet Union, 
reviewing "Khrushchev Remem-
bers," have been much more 
skeptical than some American 
reviewers about the authentic-
ity ? of the purported memoirs 
of the former Soviet leader. 
"Totally worthless for the 
serious student of contempo-
rary history"? that was. the 
judgment of Leonard Schapiro, 
professor at the London School 
V Economics, in The Sunday 
Times of London today. 
Professor Schapiro suggested 
that the Soviet secret police 
had concocted the book of pur-
ported memoirs and had got it 
out to the West to cause con-
fusion and to advance the 
Communist cause. 
David Floyd, Communist Af-
fairs expert for The Daily Tele-
graph, concluded that the book 
was "not genuine." He believes 
that somebody in the West pre-
paedd the book. 
Victor -orza, in The Guard-
ian, devoted a series of five 
long articles to arguing that the 
United States Central Intelli-
gence Agency was the source. 
' Book Termed Hoax - 
He termed the book a hoax 
and a scissors and paste job of 
the C.I.A., which, he said, 
hoped to repeat its "most suc-
cessful operation' of all time" 
-;-the. publication of Mr. Khru-
shchev's anti-Stalinist secret 
speech to the Soviet party con-
gress in 1956. 
A group of 30 experts on the 
Soviet Union, meeting in Wash-
ington earlier this month, con-
cluded that the memoirs were 
authentic and had been released 
to the West with the approval 
of the present Soviet leader-
ship. The panel believed that 
,most,..if not all the published 
material, was in Mr. Khru-
slichev's words. 
Sir William Hayter, who was 
British Ambassador in Moscow 
from 1953 to '1957, believes 
that the hook is "basically 
genuine" despite "odd and 
sometimes inexplicable mis-
takes." 
In a review IA The Observer 
today, Sir William says: "I 
knewL Khrushcliev fairly well. 
emerged from obscurity and 
I was in,;Moscow when he 
cameti 
-i'suptne -power. I met 
him frequently on social occa-
sions, Having just emerged 
from reading- the book I have 
the strong impression of hay-
ing resumed my personal inter-
course with him.' . 
- Sir William found that a 
disturbing feature of the book 
was "Khrushchev's extraordin-
ary incomprehension of the 
realities of other countries:" 
For Professor Shaphe the ; - 
book also fails on the test of errieriabbrs9. 
novelty, Ho argues that to his 
own knowledge it contains. 
"only a very few facts or state-
Dents which are new." 
Mr. Floyd; in The Daily Tele-
graph, concluded: 
"My impression is that com-
pilation of the 'memoirs'. could 
well have been done in the West 
where all the material for such 
an operation was available, I 
would not care to guess who or. 
what institution Was. respon-
sible. 1 will only venture the 
opinion that, with a little mpre 
knowledge and more trouble( 
they could have done a much 
better job." ? 
The Sunday Times, in addi-
tion to Professor Schapiro's re-
view, ran in full the review in 
The New York Times on Jan. 
3 by Harrison E. Salisbury say-
ing that the book was auth-
entic. The book was published

by Little, Drown Se Co. 
Professor Schapiro, who is 
Professor of Economics With 
SpecialReference to Russian 
Studies, specifically rejected 
one theory that had been dis-
cussed in the United 'States 
about the possibility of prepar-
ation by, the K.G.B.., the Soviet 
Secret Police. This was that 
elements in the Soviet police 
agency had slipped the book 
out to the West as part of a_ 
campaign in the Soviet to stop: 
a return to Stalinism. 
"Moonshine" was Professor' 
Scha.piro's word for that idea. 
The K.G.B., he said, would be 
the first to promote a return to 
Stalin's methods,

? In the light of differing opinions by ex-
perts, the authenticity of the recently pub-

uncertain. 
British 'Communist-affairs expert Victor 
.Zorza claims the "memoirs" are a forgery. 
.He-asserts that the li:GB (the Soviet Secret 
Service) had a large hand in producing the 
writings' and then planted them with a Life 
magazine source. According to Mr. Zorza, 
the CIA attempted to thwart theoperation. 
Meanwhile,- a meeting in Washington of 
U.S. experts on Soviet affairs has concluded 
_ 
The v;ritings were authentic because of their 
repeated atthcks on the -Stalin regime. For 
this very reason the experts concluded that 
the "memoirs" never Could have been re-
leased with the approval or the Soviet lead-
ership; and this, they felt, precluded a d.e-
liberate trick on the part of the Soviet Gov-
ernment. The conference, however, could

The British Communist Party, for its 
part, has blamed the Soviets for withhold-

rule, documents that, it says, could deter-

The party also claims that Soviet secrecy is,

. Whig goes on in the upper reaches of 
?the Moscow . Communist hierarchy, 
here everything is supposed to be 
tightly controlled but apparently is not?, : 
,The latest evidence of cross-purposes ' 
is the release of former Premier Nikita 
'Khrushchev's Supposed memoirs to Life : 
magazine. As might have been expected, - 
the Khrushchev view of Joseph Stalin, as 
presented in the memoirs, is as dour as - 
ever: Stalin was a madman who had poi-
seined the good milk of Leninist doctrine 
and practically drowned Russia in blood. 
Since the official Moscow policy of the 
moment calls for the partial rehabilita-
tion of Stalin, Why should the memoirs 
have been:peddled? ? - 
- - . The Moscow mystery journalist, Vic-
tor Louis, who writes for London's Eve-
ning _Nev.'s, .was the broker in the deal. 
. .  
What is Victor . Louis' relation to the 
Communist hierarchs? lie is supposed to 
be in the good -graces of the KGB, the 
Soviet secret police. 
The deal worked out with Life at the 
Hotel WAngleterre in Copenhagen was 
not the first of its kind in Louis' career. 
In 1966, at the time of the Sinyavsky-
Daniel trial in Russia, when Soviet in-
tellectuals were being put under the gun 
for allowing their manuscripts to go to 
the West, Victor Louis was a go-between 
in the strange "exile" tour of Valcry 
_Taris, a disaffected Russian writer, 
through Britain and the U.S. _ ? 
:... The only logical explanation of 
.the Tarsis "exile" whieli had been 
_ . permitted was Ant the Kremlin ? 
.2 . counted on Tersis to discregt him- * 
_ self, the theory being that his ex-
pected 'eccentricities might cause 
- 
Westerners to think Sinyavsky and 
Daniel were dubious characters also. 
? Whatever is behind Victor Loo is' activ-
ities, they add up to a confusion. Check-
ing with. Sovietologistse one finds there 
are severairadically opposed theories of 
the motives behind the leak of the:,mern-
oirs whose authenticity Khrushchev him-
self has repudiated. 
? One theory is that there is a dissident 
group in the KGB, end in the Politburo 
'itself, that is anti-BrezhneV and dbesn't 
. . 
want to see Stalin rehabilitated. 
Another theory is that the Krem-
lin is looking for an excuse to ee-
clare.KhruGhch.er an caeray of the 
state for allowing his memoirs to be 
sold outsif.le Russia. A third theory. 
is that the CIA has had a hand in-the 
whole business. This- would have to 
mean there are &AIM& agents 'Inside 
the KGB itself. 
The confusion indicated in Moscow 
over the Khruslichev memoirs .comes at a 
welcome time for the West, for Christian 
Duevel's annual analysht of the Soviet 
Central Committee's 'October Slogans. 
for Radio Liberty is not very encourag-
ing. ? 
Ever since 196.7 the Kremlin had called 
every October for the "consolidation of 
all anti-imperalist peace-loving- forces" 
to struggle against "reaction and,war." 
But now the phrase "peace-loving" has 
been dropped from the slogan. This, as 
Duevel surmises, means that the Soviets. 
arc willing to accept help feom anybody 
in their machinations against the \Vest.. 
Any Palestinian guerrilla organization, 
whether Miloist or not, is to be. accepted 
in the "anti-imperialist struggle." 
s There are other subtle changes in the 
slogans that indicate a more intransigent 
Soviet foreign policy all down the ripe: 
What this portends for the SALT talks 
about a mutual limitation of armaments 
is not exactly encouraging. The main 
hope of the West is that a struggle for 
power in Moscow itself is Making it 
difli-
cult for the tougher ?varmongers in the 
Kremlin.? 
Sometime later Louis offered an alter-
native version Of the memoirs of Stalin's 
daughter Svetlana to the West. Since 
Svetlana was -on American soil and 
hence pi-..-rfeetly capable-of marketing her 
own wares, which the Kremlin wanted 
suppresed, could the intention of the 
Victor Louis diversion have been to mess 
up the copyright situation? And possibly 
the Kremlin counted on the pictures that

crecy has long made Moscow a 
city of mysteries, but few of 
them have stirred as much spec-
ulation in embassy chanceries 
and ordinary households as the 
Khrushchev memoirs being pub-
fished in Life magazine. 
Ever since Time, Inc., an-
nounced earlier this month that 
it would publish the reminis-
cences of former Premier Nikita 
S. Khrushchev, a long series of 
unanswered questions has been 
raised. 
Are the papers authentic, as 
Life asserts? Art they a fabrica-
tion, possibly produced by the 
U.S. Central Intelligence Agen-
cy, as the Soviet government 
newspaper Izvestia claims? If 
they were really produced by 
Khrushchev, how did they get to 
the West? And whose interest is 
being served by their publica-
tion? 
Kremlin Blessing Seen 
One of the latest theories, said 
to be true by a Soviet informant 
Who has furnished reliable infor-
mation in the past, is that the 
reminiscences are authentic and 
were published with the blessing 
of high Kremlin officials. 
tary Leonid I. Brezhnev. - 
The first installment, pub-
lished in the Nov. 27 issue of 
Life, contains numerous factual 
errors. The. infrothint said this 
is because Khrushchev did them 
from memory. 
The Kremlin believed that by 
getting the memoirs 'published 
with the errors intant, ? the in-
formant said, the project might 
be discredited. 
Khrushchev would then get so 
upset this line of reasoning 
The informant said Khrush-
chev started dictating the remi-
niscences on a tape recorder as 
a documentation of his years as 
premier and chief of the Com-
munist party. 
High officials learned of the 
project, the informant said, and 
hoped to discredit and stop it by 
making the early portion availa-
ble for publication abroad before 
revision and editing. 
The memoirs have not been 
published before. Time, Inc., 
says they go only up to 1962. The 
informant .said the Kremlin did 
not want to see them carried 
through* to 1934, the year 
? ? Khrushchev was ousted by the 
collective leadership headed by was an international diversion 
. . 
Theories abound that the Sovi-
et secret police had a hand in 
the matter for unclear reasons. 
Other speculation suggests that 
some internal Soviet political 
split or fractional rivalry was 
involved. 
-Another version is that the 
publication would somehow 
serve the purposes of the Com-
munist party and its 24th Con-
gress next March. 
No solid basis for any of these 
versions has been established. 
goes, that he would abandon the Until one is, the speculation is 
project. likely to go on and on. 
Those who question this theory 
point out that the Kremlin has 
many ways of stopping Khrush-
chev without all the fuss and 
publicity that is accompanying 
publication in the West. 
The controversy has brought 
Khrushchev back into the spot-
light after years of obscuriV. 
For the first time since shortly 
after his ouster, his name ap-
peared in the Soviet press ? as 
a signature on his denial that he 
sent any memoirs to any pub-
lisher, in the East or the West. 
No Firm Denial 
The vague wording or his 
statement and its failure to deny 
that he had prepared any mem-
oirs only added to the mystery, 
however. 
An early theory was that the 
memoirs were taken abroad by 
Victor Louis, an enigmatic Sovi-
et citizen who frequently seems 
to serve as an East-West go-
between. A Scandinavian report 
that Louis stayed in a Copenhag-
en hotel at the same time as two 
Time-Life editors last summer 
seemed to back up this theory. 
Louis denied any connection 
with the project, however, and 
there are many who feel he is 
being truthful. They reason that 
he is too obvious a channel and 
that his presence in Copenhagen

? purported to be a former Soviet premier 
like Nikita S: Khrushchev. His alleged 
memoirs are being published by Life mag-

Time Inc., which publishes flfe, has 
refused t say where it ? obtained the

publication, Khrushchev denounced them 
as a "falsification." So did Svethma, the 
emigre daughter of Khrushchev's old

installment. ? 
In the absence of any convincing proof

Kremlin psychology have advanced an 
involved theory that the memoirs really 
Were produced by KGB, the Soviet secret 
' police. The idea is that their publication 
in the West would discredit Khrushchev 
.and those of his men still in positions of 
power. It would also, so runs this theory, 
help destroy the reputations of all other 
Russian writers whose works are pub-
lished clandestinely in the West. 
As if possibly stung by an arrow that 
'struck too close to home, Izvestia, the

manner in which former Soviet Premier. 
:Nikita Khruslichev's book is being-1 
published in the West, the mystery has 
.:become almost as. intriguing as any-
thing the book might contain.. 
Khrushchev has been a nonperson . 
in the Soviet Union Since he was. re- ? 
MVO from power. His name never. 
...appears in the propaganda organs, and 
the former premier has made only one 
or two personal appearances since his 
mister. ? ? 
Soviet citizens, officially at least, ? 
,! did not know the former premier had 
? prepared his memoirs until a notice was 
circulated by Tass in which Khrush-
chev _supposedly claimed the forth-
coming publication of his :%vork was a, 
"fabrication." 
"I have never passed On inernoirS of 
this kind to foreign publications," 
Khrushchev said in his statement. "1 
? ,did not turn over such materials to 
? Soviet publishers, either," he added. 
The London Times, which is pub-
lishing the memoirs, says it believes 
the entire .400,006-word text is in the 
hands of the KGB, the secret police, 
which the paper says, "for reasons of 
7 its Own sold excerpts to the West." 
Adding interest to this ebnjecture. 
is the fact Khrushchev was one of those 
responsible. for having Deria, former 
'KGB chief, executed. Thus, the mystery. 
? about Khrushchev's writings ? or tape:-
. recordings, as some believe them to be 
? is surrounded by fascinating 
possibly including another 
- power struggle between the secret:

-%effigrgri'tO l'ilgervllew Mr. Khrushchav 
An open letter to the Krem-
lin: ? - ? ? 
There is absolutely nothinl 
you can dO to prevent the 
Khrushchev memoirs from be-
- coming the publishing sensa-
tion of the decade, quite re-
gardless of whether they are 
? . genuine or a fake. The more 
denials are issued from Mos-
cow,the more publicity you 
?. will build up for the book and 
its serialization in the press: 
And if you threaten to throw 
out of Moscow the correspon-
dents of the papers which in-
tend to serialize the book? as 
you threw some out over the 
publication of the "Penkov-
sky Papers" ? you will only 
alienate much' of western 
opinion. 
It is obvious from the con-
?- cern you have displayed that 
? you too regard the publication 
. -of the Khrushchev "Mem-
virs" as a most important 
- matter. But, if you accept that 
there is nothing you can do to 
prevent publication or signifi-
cantly reduce its extent, you 
can still accomplish a great 
' deal if it could be firmly estab-
lished in Pie public mind that 
it is, as the Khrushchev denial 
. describes it, "a fabrication." 
It has already been said, 
? 
however, that the Khrushchev 
denial settles nothing, because 
= it might_ have been forced 
from him. It has also been 
argued, as is-so often the case 
with denials, that the words he 
had used fall short of a com-
plete repudiation of the mate-
rial said to have come from 
him. There is only one way to 
establish the truth of this ? to 
make Khrushchev available 
for questioning at a press con-
ference. If his state of health 
prevents this, then he should 
be made available for an. 
interview. If tne Interview is 
given to a Soviet journalist, the 
result would be greeted in the 
West with the same skepticism 
as Khrushchev's earlier deni-
al. He should therefore be in-
terviewed by a western jourl 
nalist, and one known for his 
critical attitude to the Soviet 
Union, one who could not be 
lightly accused by the publish-
ers of the memoirs of having 
fallen for "Kremlin propagan-
da." 
Obviously, an interview of 
this kind would be a considera-
ble journalistic coup. If I were 
the journalist interviewing Mr.. 
Khrushchev, what I would be 
after would be the truth. This 
Indeed is one of the reasons' 
why I have long specialized in 
the study of forgeries used in 
East-West psychological war-
fare. Far too many of these 
have been planted in the world 
press. Your own psychologital 
warfare departments have 
. . 
been kis active as those of 
, some western countries. Over 
the years, my personal con-
cern in this has been to pre-
serve the integrity of the 
press, to show both to newspa-
per readers and to newspaper 
writers that they are constant-
ly being got at by psychologi-
cal warriors who do not shrink 
Leib the use of forgery. 
Although my own writing 
.has often been described in the 
Soviet press as hostile, I have 
spent much time nailing down 
anti-Communist forgeries. 
Many of these, as in the early 
days of the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute, were designed to exploit 
and to deepen the disarray in 
the ' world Communist move-
ment. Your own propaganda 
agencies were often able to. 
use my articles to show up 
such forgeries for what they 
were, where their own word 
would not have been accepted. 
As recently as last year, a 
western intelligence operation 
succeeded, by the use of 
forged documents, in causing 
a diplomatic rift between the 
Ivory Coast and the Soviet Un-
ion, The Soviet Novosti press 
agency used my study of this 
incident to show that the docu-
ment which it was accused of 
circulating ? %which caused 
all the trouble ?.had in fact 
been a forgery. 
, But perhaps the most nota-
ble case concerned the "Pzea; 
kovsky Papers" in 1965. On 
that occasion I produced 'a de-
tailed analysis which showed 
that the memoirs attributed to 
Oleg Penkovsky, the top west-
ern spy executed a few ye.:...r.s 
before . that in the Soviet Un-: 
ion, could not have been OW 
..ly authentic. I also traced the / 
parentage' of the "Penkoysky 
-Papers" to the CIA. The East-
West propaganda battle which 
raged around the papers at the 
time ensured,. of course, that 
the book became a best-seller. 
The diplomatic protests by 
? viet ambassadors in the West, 
the scathing articles in the So-
viet press, the outraged deni-
als of the nook's authenticity, 
only served to arouse greater 
public Interest In it. 
There is only one good way 
to fight lies ? with truth. if 
the Khrushchev book is a fake, 
there are a number of ways in 
which the truth can be made 
to prevail, as I indicated in the 
message which I sent to the 
foreign ministry's press de-
partment in Moscow. However 
. far apart you and I may be 
politically, we Could work to-
gether in this matter to estab-
lish the truth because we have 
a common interest in it ? pro-
vided, of course, that it is the 
truth that you are concerned 
? about. ?

- EAST MEETS  WEST 
With West Germany busily strengthening ties 
with the East, the Communists in East Germany 
are turning their eyes to the West. The Ulbricht 
government now is lining up embassy-size quar-
ters for its trade mission in London (which doesn't 
recognize East Germany). And it is "merely a 
coincidence," say the East Germans in London, 
that the new West End digs they are eying in 
Belgrave Square are within hailing distance of 
Bonn's embassy. 
NEW JOB, NEW FACES  
Washington handicappers are busy picking the 
man for the Capital's hottest new job, head of 
the soon-to-be-created Environmental Protection 
Agency. Two front runners to head the new $1.4 
billion agency are GOP Gov. Raymond Shafer of 
Pennsylvania and Assistant Attorney General 
William Ruckelshaus, chief of Justice's. Civil 
Division. The favorite for dark-horse bettors: 
.John Whitaker, President Nixon's chief environ-
mental aide. 
A SPY PLANE IS BORN 
The JFK "oral history" tapes have added. a note 
.to the history of the U-2 spy plane. An interview 
with a former CIA deputy director dates its ori-
gin back to 1952. When the U.S. Air Force said it 
couldn't photograph a Soviet missile base on the 
Volga, the CIA persuaded the British to do it, 
flying from Germany to Iran. London then said 
it was its first and last such mission. The Air 
Force still refused to build the plane the CIA ? 
wanted, so the agency went to Lockheed on its 
own and got the U-2. 
MOSCOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST  
Moscow isn't confining its Middle East "pres-
ence" to Egypt. After appeals from the Sudan, 
just to the south, Soviet arms and technicians 
have been shipped in to help the Khartoum gov-
ernment in its war on non-Moslem tribesmen. 
,And Russia's powerful presence in Yemen, across 
? the Red Sea from the horn of Africa, is giving 
Ethiopia's Haile Selassie cause to worry that So-
viet aid may become available to his rebellious 
subjects in Eritrea-25 miles from Yemen.

chewing while showing with their 
chomping jaws what they think of 
Red dictators (the especially daring 
could blow bubbles). And if secret 
police approached, gum chewers 
could hide the evidence under 
tables or chairs or, in extreme

would be worth. it to have every-

ILET RUSSIA HAVE IT 
Not so long ago youthful Soviet audi-
'ohms sat in rapt attention at performances 
of the great Russian classics. But no 
more. At a recent performance of Cluck-
hov's "Cherry Orchard" in Moscow, the 
young Russians drank wine from bottles, 
yelled obscenities, smooched their girl 
friends, and raised such a racket that the 
actors quit. 
Trud, the labor newspaper, called this 
display a "devlish disregard and immu-
nity to beauty," an ominous sign of moral 
decay among Soviet youth. They would 
rather tune in their transistor radios to 
non-Russian broadcasts of Western hard 
rock or buy Beetle records from tourists. 
Their rapt attention now goes to a Czecho-
slovakian pop singer who can belt out 
"The Age of Aquarius" and other songs 
from the American hard rock musical 
If the effort ' to instill "Soviet soul" 
among the kids is losing out to this tough 
competition from the West, as the Associ-
ated Press reported from Moscow, perhaps 1 
the Central Intelligence Agency is over-
looking a splendid opportunity. 
If the haphazard exposure of America's 
decadent youth culture thru pirated re-
cordings and black market buys from the 
occasional tourist has such a devastating 
effect on Soviet youth, what could a 
really professional CIA operation accom-
plish? 
Imagine the effect on the Kremlin if the 
CIA arranged to dump the whole rock 
musical culture bit, complete with drugs, 
electronic guitar and long hair, on the 
Soviet Union. Russia would never be the 
same. And neither would we. Peace might 
even return to the United States. Or is 
oF generation gap showing?

'CIA director. wins 
?liberal applause 
By Henry Brandon 
Washington, Saturday 
,RICHARD HELMS, the CIA's 
/director, has a personal tern-
/ perament. and public position 
that naturally leads him to avoid 
publicity. But this week he 
just couldn't avoid it. 
First the C I A felt it had 
to clear its name of some of 
the accusations made against its 
involvement in the Green 
Berets murder of a Vietnamese 
double-agent. Then Helms 
roused the anger of Secretary 
of State William Rogers for 
having inspired the report that 
Soviet officers have asked East 
European Communist leaders 
fcir their reactions .should Russia 
launch a preventive nuclear 
strike against China's nuclear 
installations. 
Mr Helms' " cover's was 
blown by the reporter of a 
Washington evening paper who 
did not partake in this unusual 
intelligence " feast" offered by 
helms to a handful of reporters. 
Roger reportedly was angered 
because he thought this story 
played into the hands of Soviet 
propagandists and could be used 
as proof by Peking that the US 
is ganging up with Russia 
against China. But no one 
denied the story. , attributed 
Helms. It was a classic case of 
how intelligence and':diplomacy. 
can collide. 
As to the American public's 
confusion about all this, it may 
well find itself in agreement 
with something Mr Rogers 
recently said admonishingly to 
the Senate'Foreign Relations 
Committee: "It would be very. 
. helpful if You will ask yourself 
what it is that you would do 
differently than we are now 
,doing, keeping in mind that you 
may not know what we are 
doi ng." 
But despite these setbacks, 
Helms, a modern, shrewd man 
who has retained a sense of 
humour, has managed to give 
his agency the kind, of face?
without being . faceless?that 
becomes his organisation. 
Helms has sought to present 
the secret intelligence estimates 
factually without getting in-
volved in policy-making con-
troversies. And at a time in 
world history .when some of the 
most important policy decisions 
depend on the estimates of the 
enemy's nuclear strategic ar-
senal, which is perhaps today 
CI A's most vital task, this is 
not easy. ? 
Moreover, until the Green 
Berets affair brought the 
agency's "cloak and dagger 
operations back into the head-
lines, it was enjoying what 
must have looked to some 
a kind of perverse -popular 
sympathy among Congressional 
liberals because of the restraint 
of Helms' assessments of the 
Soviet missile threat when 
compared to the Pentagon's 
assessments. 
Never before ' have potential 
enemies been better informed 
about each other's current state 
of military power than today. 
The great intelligence contro-

Proposa.1 Splits 
FBI - Katzenbach 
By ROURT S. ALLEN 
and PAUL SCOTT 
Undersecretary of State NIC11.3-
las Katzenbach is apparently a 
glutton for punishment. 
The former Attorney General' 
has, at his own request, tackled 
? the exttemely thorny job of try-
ing to persuade the Senate to 
approve the long-stalled agree-
ment between the U. S. and Rus-
sia to set up consular offices in 
their countries. 
A leading opponent of this ' 
treaty is FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover. The out-spoken disap-
proval of the militant anti-Com-
munist has been largely respon-
ible for the Senate' failure to 
. consider this pact, negotiated by 
' the State Department with 
'President Johnson's warm sup-
' part. 
State Department insiders 
say Katzenbach requested per-
? mission to lead a drive for Sen-
ate ratification of the consular 
agreement in order to force a 
showdown with Hoover over 
whether internal security or for-
eign policy should determine re-
lations with the Soviet. 
Katzenbach, who singled out 
' Yuri Tchernjakov, counselor at 
the Russian embassy, as one of 
the first to be informed of this, 
argues that now is the thne to 
expand U.S.-Soviet cooperation, 
and ratification of the treaty 
would be a tangible and effec-
tive step in that direction. 
Since taking over the No. 2 
' position in the State Depart-
? ment, Katzenbach has consis-
tently sided with Llewellyn 
?Thompson, newly - appointed 
Ambassador to Moscow and a 
leading exponent of developing 
closer ties with Russia for the 
purpose of mutually countering 
Red China. 
Hoover, who denounced the 
consulate treaty from the forum 
of a House Appropriations Sub-
committee, is credited as wel-
coming a direct confrontation 
over this issue with his former 
Justice Department boss. 
Aides of Senator Thomas 
Dodd, D-Conn., leader of the 
Senate foes of the pact, say 
Hoover is eager to appear be-
fore the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee to present a detailed ac-
count of how Soviet consulates 
will be used to increase espio-
nage in the U.S. 
It. is claimed by Hoover this 
is unprecedented in U.S. consul-
ar agreements. Such pacts with. 
other countries grant immunity 
only on misdemeanors, and not 
felonies. 
If this article remains in the: 
treaty, an FBI estimate gtven 
Senator Dodd hOlds that "more 
than 400 Soviet espionage and 
Intelligence agents assigned to, 
proposed consulates in New. 
York, Chicago, Detroit and Los 
Angeles would be guaranteed 
immunity from prosecution." 
Moscow has indicated that if. 
the pact is approved, it will 
seek to open consulates in these 
four cities. In contrast to these 
plans, the State Department in-. 
tends to open only one in Lenin-. 
grad. 
When the Kremlin initially 
proposed the immunity provi-
sion, Hoover vigorously dis-
sented on the ground it would 
open the way for Russia to set. 
up a virtual "fifth -column" 
witheut fear of prosecution. 
Under the agreement, the only 
recourse the U.S. would have in 
the event a Russian spy was op- . 
prehended would be. to deport 
him. Hoover contended this 
would greatly work to the ad-
vantage of the Soviet as the 
U.S. meticulously bars its con-
sulates from Intelligence activ-
ities. 
Katzenbach, then Attorney 
General, overruled Hotiver. At 
the State Department's request,, 
Katzenbach participated in the 
negotiations on the consular 
treaty, and repor.edly assisted 
in drafting Articie 19. 
Senator Dodd has strong hi-' 
partisan support in the Foreign 
Relations Committee in oppose : 
ing the pact. 
Senators Bourke Iliekenloop-
er, Iowa, senior Republican on 
the Committee, Frank Lauselie, 
D - O., John Williams, R Del.,. 
and Karl Mundt, R-S.D., joined. 
with Dodd in writing a letter to 
Senator J. William Fulbright,. 
1)-Ark., chairman, asking that 
both Katzenbach and Hoover, , 
be summoned to testify when 
the Committee holds hearings 
?. 
on the treaty in January.

FOREIGN RELATIONS \ 
A Matter of Mutual Advantage 
I' Chairman William Fulbright sent 
down encouraging notes. Senator 
Wayne Morse amicably asked just the 
' right leading questions and agreed en-
thusiastically with nearly everything the 
star witness said. To Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk, appearing before the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee, it 
must have seemed like a remembrance 
of days past?those halcyon, pre-Viot 
Nam days when he could be sure that 
he had a solid majority of the com-
mittee behind him. The matter under 
? discussion, a consular treaty with the 
r Soviet Union, might itself have been 
the cause of some nostalgia, for it has 
? been waiting a long time for ratification 
by the Senate. 
Not that the treaty is so remarkable 
. or so very different from similar pacts 
the U.S. has with 28 other countries. 
In its most important provisions, it 
? would simply permit diplomats of both 
nations to assist their citizens who 
have run afoul of the law ar.d have 
been arrested in trieir travels. What 
s: bothered some Senators?and kept the 
f. pact in limbo for more than 2+ years 
t ?was the fear, amply supported by 
statements from FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover, that Soviet officials would 
use their U.S. consulates as espionage 
centers. 
The Hoover Letters. Hoover's testi-
mony, offered to a House committee in 
1965, has been the principal roadblock-
, to ratification. Last week Rusk sought 
to minimize its impact by citing a let-
ter from the director agreeing that the 
FBI could handle any increased secu-
rity problems resulting from the treaty: 
But Rusk's intent was at least partly 
vitiated by the grudging tone of Hoo-
ver's letter and by a later Hoover letter 
, that South Dakota's Karl Mundt, the 
treaty's most vocal opponent, brought 
forth. Though the FBI could take on the 
increased burden, Hoover conceded to 
Mundt, its work under the treaty would 
be "more difficult." 
Rusk, for his part, never denied that 
the Russians might use consulates for 
spying?in the past decade, 28 Russian . 
officials have either been expelled or 
arrested for espionage?but noted sim-
ply that ten to 15 Soviet consular of-
ficials, added to the 452 who already' 
enjoy diplomatic immunity in the Wash-
ington embassy and the U.N. mission,? 
? would not "add significantly to the risk." 
Spying, of course, has never been 
claimed as a Russian monopoly, and 
Morse asked if the CIA  might not enjoy, 
snooping from the proposed U.S. con-, 
sulate, tentatively slated for Leningrad. 
i Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katz-
'enbach replied somewhat uncomfortably' 
that, indeed, "the treaty is reciprocal." 
? 
A Big Name in Moscow. the consti--; 
lar treaty is the keystone of President 
Johnson's policy of "building bridges" to 
'the East. Ratification would not only 
'reduce the likelihood of international 
incidents over infractions by unlucky 
. or unwise tourists (which have increased. 
,as larger numbers of American travelers 
?18,000,. last year?visit the Soviet 
Union); it would also serve as an im-
portant spur to other East-West agree-
ments. Though the Russians have, said, 
repeatedly that no major breakthrough 
, can come while the U.S. is fighting in 
North Viet Nam, lesser agreements, no-
-tably the treaty banning weapons of. 
mass destruction from outer space, 
signed in ceremonies in Moscow, Lon-
don, and Washington last week, can 
I still be reached. Such contacts, said 
! Rusk, "can reduce misunderstand-
ings between our two countries and 
lead, in time, to international coopera-
tion in areas where we are able 
to find common interests and mutual 
advantage." 
? In the end, whether the treaty passes 
or fails depends not so much on Rusk, 
Hoover or President Johnson .but, as in 
all other measures requiring the ap-
proval of two-thirds of the Senate, on 
Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, who 
controls a pivotal number of Republi-
can votes. At week's end, Dirksen was 
inclined to be against the treaty, but 
was clearly open to?and vastly en-
joyed?attempts to change his mind. 
One of the suppliants, he said, was a 
"young man" from the Soviet embassy.' 
"His come-oh. as 'Yours is a big name 
in Moscow,'" Dirksen recounted glee-
, fully, "but I told him I only wanted to 
? be a big name here and preferably in 
the state of Illinois." !
