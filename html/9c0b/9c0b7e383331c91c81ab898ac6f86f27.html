 April 15, 1965          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 ger lies in the imports of. foreign produce
 mainly from South America and Mexico.
 So having agreed to this principle, that it
 is most desirable to raise the wages of all
 Americans to a decent level, California agri-
 culture  suggests  that  the  U.S.  Gov-
 ernment look into its sordid record in the
 pay of its servicemen.  It pays an ensign at
 sea less than a baby sitter. A Navy lieuten-
 ant makes less in 60 hours a week than a
 New York City policeman or fireman makes
 in 40 hours.  A Navy petty officer on a Po-
 laris submarine earns less, per month than
 a man on the public uneployment rolls in
 New York State.  A recruit in the Army
 earns $78.00 per month which figures out to
 the princely sum of 441/2 cents per hour for a
 44-hour week.
 Five thousand families of Air Force per-
 sonnel are forced to accept relief checks, and
 55,000 more are technically eligible for relief
 but are too proud to accept it.  One hun-
 dred sixty-nine thousand Air Force person-
 nel receive basic pay below  the  poverty
 standard set by President Johnson. An un-
 derprivileged  school  dropout         will receive
 $105 a month in a Job Corps camp, but a
 skilled seaman with 2 years naval service
 receives only $99.
 Having accepted this principle of decent
 wages for all, how can our Government re-
 main silent on the question of better pay
 for our  servicemen?   Or is  it that taxes
 would have to be increased, and increased
 taxes is not politically popular?   As men-
 tioried above, agriculture can find no quar-
 rel with the principle of decent wages for
 all.
 The Secretary of Labor has also told agri-
 culture that if it paid decent wages, they
 would not have the turnover problem and
 that workers would be more willing to stay.
 For the Secretary's information, the military
 has been complaining about this very same
 problem, and I would suggest that he con-
 tact the military and advise them of his so-
 lution to the problem.
 California agriculture cannot pay $1.40 per
 hour when Texas and Florida are at 90 cents
 or less.  We would be most happy to pay in-
 dustrial. wages as long as our competing
 States pay the same.  It is they with whom
 we 'must compete.
 With respect to service pay, with whom
 does Uncle Sam compete that it can't pay
 Our boys a decent wage?
 Sincerely yours,
 STEPHEN D'ARRIGO, Jr.
 How Niles, Ill., Earned Its New Title of
 All America City
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DONALD RUMSFELD
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  Mr. Speaker, every
 year the National Municipal League and
 Look magazine honor 11 communities
 whose citizens have put forth extraor-
 dinary effort to solve their problems,
 designating. each as an All America City.
 It is .a distinct pleasure to me and, I am
 sure, to all residents of the State of Illi-
 nois, to learn that the village of Niles,
 located in the 13th Congressional Dis-
 trict which I have the honor of repre-
 senting in the Congress of the United
 States, has been selected as one of the 11
 outstanding communities in the Nation
 in 1964.  I extend my congratulations to
 the citizens of Niles and to their civic
 and business leaders on their public
 spirit and interest which has brought
 them this well-deserved recognition.
 The towns selected for this coveted
 honor may win because their citizens
 survived a natural disaster, ousted a cor-
 rupt  government,  improved  economic
 conditions, or undertook to solve other
 problems that beset American communi-
 ties at some time during their history.
 The outstanding effort of the citizens of
 Niles, Ill., in meeting their problem of
 rapid growth during the period from
 1950 to 1964 and in replacing their local
 government officials who did little or
 nothing to provide the necessary com-
 munity services to keep pace with this
 growth brought the distinguished award
 of All America City.
 How the village of Niles earned this
 distinction is described in the following
 article by Richard Hoffman, writing in
 the Chicago's American:
 How NILES, ILL., EARNED ITS NEW TITLE OF
 ALL AME$ICA CITY
 (By Richard Hoffmann)
 How does a community become an All
 America City?
 First, you throw the rascals out, especially
 if they're part of a political machine in power
 for 20 years.
 Then you inject helpings of spirit, pride,
 youth, dedication, integrity, and efficiency,
 all of which mobilize the community in the
 pursuit of higher accomplishments.
 This, at least, is the formula for success
 described by officials in the northwest sub-
 urb of Niles, one of 11 communities just
 honored by Look magazine and the National
 Municipal League as an All America City.
 Mayor Nicholas Blase, 36, whose New Era
 party swept to victory in the 1961 elections,
 feels the crackdown on gambling which had
 flourished on. an unincorporated strip of
 Milwaukee avenue between Niles and Chi-
 cago gave the people confidence in his ad-
 ministration.
 "Everything seemed to spring from that,"
 he said, "and other new projects that fol-
 lowed enjoyed public support."
 Blase and Police Chief Clarence "Whitey"
 Emrikson were both subjected to telephone
 threats for their campaign against the strip,
 whose gaudy establishments  were  finally
 shuttered when Chicago annexed the area.
 Emrikson, also 36, said through 1961 and
 1962 he was harassed by anonymous callers
 who would utter such threats as, "Leave the
 pinballs alone or your kids will never reach
 school tomorrow."
 "This will be a constant problem," Emrik-
 son says.  "There are still people who want
 the pinballs and  the  jar  games  back."
 Emrikson is the type of police chief who
 turns down annual gifts of liquor with a
 polite but firm "no," associates say.
 Although to the passerby there is nothing
 to distinguish Niles from any of the other
 towns which border commercial strips like
 Milwaukee Avenue, the community is really
 in full throttle now.
 Citizens for Better Parks pushed through
 a $705,000 bond issue in 1962 which resulted
 in two park sites and a new community cen-
 ter and swimming pool.
 A $575,000 library will open soon because
 of the efforts of the Women's Club of Niles,
 which started a part-time, volunteer book
 lending program.
 A new $198,000 village hall will be dedi-
 cated Sunday; a second $375,000 fire station
 opened in 1982; an $825,000 reservoir opened
 2 years ago to increase water capacity by
 3 million gallons.
 A1885
 A $3,840,000 "leaning tower" YMCA is un-
 der construction next to a replica of the
 famed tower in Pisa, Italy.
 The Tower was originally constructed in
 1932 by Robert A. Ilg, inventor and electrical
 manufacturer, to store water for his private
 park and swimming.pools, which he later
 donated to the YMCA:
 Niles also has changed because of the dedi-
 cation of men like Trustee Robert Wente.  He
 jumped into the swollen waters of the Chi-
 cago River to pull out old bikes and bed
 springs to speed the river's flow when base-
 ments began flooding.
 Mrs. Margaret B. Lieske, village clerk, said
 when she took office she had to sort out 20
 years of records filed in cartons.
 While Niles has been able to build, it has
 also cut taxes from 0.370 cents per $100 as-
 sessed valuation to 0.362.
 Village Manager James F. Pryde says one
 of the reasons is top personnel.
 Blase says the big problem now will be to
 live up to the All America image.
 With village elections coming up April 20,
 Blase's party has also changed its image.  It's
 now called the Forward Era Party.
 The 75th Anniversary of the Inter.
 American System
 SPEECH
 HON. EDNA F. KELLY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, April 14, 1965
 -Mrs. KELLY.  Mr. Speaker, April 14,
 1965, marked the 75th anniversary of for-
 mal regional cooperation in the Amer-
 icas, but the interest of the United States
 in creating an inter-American system
 dates far earlier than 1890.  In fact,
 from the very beginnings of our Republic,
 leading political figures urged hemi-
 spheric cooperation  to                                                                                                        preserve  the
 independence of the New World from
 European domination and to resolve
 beacefully tensions among the American
 nations.
 The desire among North Americans
 and Latin Americans alike for hemi-
 spheric cooperation finally came to frui-
 tion at the end of-the 19th century. In
 1889 and 1890 the First International
 Conference of American States met in
 Washington.  From  this  conference
 emerged the first hemispheric machinery
 for peaceful arbitration of disputes and
 the  first  permanent inter-American
 agency, the Commercial Bureau of the
 American Republics, later renamed the
 Pan American Union.
 Cooperative efforts in the Americas
 slowly and gradually grew until the Sec-
 ond  World  War  tested  hemispheric
 solidarity:  all the American nations
 joined forces against the Axis powers.
 The basis had been laid; solidarity had
 been tested and proven. In a sense the
 war was a watershed in inter-American
 relations,   for  it sparked  intensified
 efforts' at cooperation.
 Thus, in the years since World War II
 inter-American cooperation has been
 consolidated and inter-American insti-
 tutions have proliferated into our pres-
 ent-day  inter-American  system.  The,

 CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD -APPENDIX          April 15, 1965
 Rio  Treaty  of  1947 formalized our
 hemispheric  defense structure. The
 Bogota Charter of 1948 creating the Or-
 ganization of American States organized
 the hemisphere Into an actively func-
 tioning regional political system.
 In the years since World War II the
 inter-American system has developed
 into a dynamic instrument of hemi-
 sphere solidarity, successfully preserving
 the collective security of the hemisphere
 against  the  No.  1  danger  today:
 Communist aggression.  Recently the
 American nations have turned more and
 more to a set of problems virtually ne-
 glected in the early years of inter-Ameri-
 can cooperation: the pressing economic
 and social problems of the hemisphere.
 The Inter-American Development Bank
 and the Punta del Este Charter are cor-
 nerstones of a vast cooperative effort to
 improve living conditions throughout the
 hemisphere.
 The first 75 years of the inter-Ameri-
 can system have witnessed a remarkable
 growth in solidarity, particularly during
 the last 20.  The focus of cooperation
 has changed with the times: from collec-
 tive defense against European domina-
 tion to collective defense against Com-
 munist  aggression.  Political coopera-
 tion has expanded into economic and
 social cooperation. But the goals have
 not changed: a better life in freedom for
 everyone throughout the hemisphere.
 May the next 75 years bear witness to
 even greater progress through hemi-
 sphere cooperation.
 Only Man Who Can Arrest a President
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MORRIS K. UDALL
 OF ARIZONA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15,. 1965
 no task too large or too small for them to
 tackle and follow through to a successful
 conclusion.
 The U.S. Senate is blessed with one of these
 rare  individuals  in  the  person  of  their
 Sergeant at Arms, Joseph C. Duke, of Ari-
 zona.  Vice  President  HuBERT  HUMPHREY
 calls him the Houdini of Washington be-
 cause he can produce the almost Impossible
 on short notice.
 He is affectionately called "Joe" by all of
 the U.S. Senators, his friends, and six Presi-
 dents dating from Herbert Hoover through
 President Lyndon B. Johnson.  He proudly
 wears a wrist watch engraved L.B.J., which
 the President took off his own wrist and pre-
 sented to Joe in appreciation of their long
 and pleasant friendship.
 Joe's career started in Phoenix where he
 attended PUNS and was active in the Young
 Democrats  of Arizona.  He  was  extremely
 bright and was offered a job as teller with
 the Gila Valley Bank in Globe, this bank was
 the grandpa of the present Valley National
 Bank of Arizona).  He accepted the job and
 was doing quite well when he had a better
 offer from Tom O'Brien of the mine.  He
 accepted this offer and did well.
 At this time, in 1930, the depression had
 hit and everyone was trying to cut expenses,
 even Joe.  A good friend asked him if he
 would join the volunteer fire department in
 Miami where he could get his room free by
 sleeping  upstairs  over  the  firehouse.   He
 made his application to join and was ac-
 cepted.                                                                              He moved in but spent most of
 his spare time at the police station next door
 just visiting and learning the ropes.
 One night one of the officers was killed.
 This left an opening which was offered to
 Joe.  The police job paid $188 per month
 and he could still live in the fire house.
 It was considerably more than he could
 make at the mine so he accepted the new
 challenge.  He might still be an officer or
 possibly chief of the Miami Police Depart-
 ment if he hadn't tried to keep peace and
 order among a bunch of drunk Mexicans.  In
 trying to do his duty, he was shot through
 the stomach.  Dr.  Nelson Brayton arrived
 just in time, and Joe gives the doctor full
 credit for saving his life.
 While  convalescing,   he  wrote  his good
 friend, Senator Henry Ashurst"'in Washing-
 ton, making an application for a more peace-
 ful job on the Senator's staff.  The Senator
 had just lost one of his most valued assist-
 ants by death and this left the perfect open-
 ing for Joe.  He arrived in Washington in
 1931 and worked as clerk and administrative
 assistant to Ashurst as long as he was in
 office.
 He then moved over to Senator CARL HAY-
 DEN's office, and later to become the Senate's
 bill clerk, a job so important that the Re-
 publican Senators requested that he stay on
 the job even through the 80th Congress
 which was Republican controlled.
 Joe  decided that  he  would like  to  be
 Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate when
 the Democrats gained control with Harry
 Truman in 1949.  He started lining up his
 votes among the Senators, but it was nec-
 essary that he be nominated by his own Sen-
 ators, .CARL HAYDEN and Ernest McFarland.
 CARr,  didn't want to. lose Joe, consented if
 McFarland would nominate him.
 Mac made a slip of the tongue and nomi-
 nated Joe Doaks.  He was elected January
 3, 1949, and served until the Republicans took
 over under Eisenhower.  He was out 2 years,
 but was reelected January 5, 1955, and is still
 there.
 His job gives him control of 14 depart-
 ments and 900 people.                                                                            He is the only man
 in the world who has the power to arrest a
 President, and this must be done on instruc-
 tions from the U.S. Senate.
 Watch your TV screen, the next time you
 see the President going in or coming out of
 a joint session of Congress, the dapper,
 youngish-looking man with horn-rimmed
 glasses immediately in front of the President
 is our Joe who has done so much for Arizona
 and the c untry as a whole.
 President Johnson Looks Beyond the
 War
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DONALD M. FRASER
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, April 14, 1965
 Mr. FRASER. Mr. Speaker, President
 Johnson's speech on Vietnam last week
 clearly pointed out the divergent aims of
 the United States and Communist China
 in regard to southeast Asia.
 President Johnson forcefully stated
 this country's commitment to peaceful
 change and economic progress.  On the
 other hand, Communist China has given
 no indication that It is willing to aban-
 don its policy of aggression In southeast
 Asia. The President's offer of extensive
 development aid for Asia stands in
 marked contrast to China's continuing
 role of encouraging and supporting in-
 surgency wars in southeast Asia.
 A column by Max Freedman, in the
 Chicago Daily News of April 10, elo-
 quently emphasizes this long-range com-
 mitment of the United States.  I have
 unanimous consent to place Mr. Freed-
 man's article in the RECORD:
 JOHNSON LOOKS BEYOND THE WAR
 (By Max Freedman)
 WASHINGTON.--President  Johnson, in his
 address at Johns Hopkins University, has
 done much more than open up a new and
 constructive phase to American policy in
 Vietnam.  He also has proclaimed an Ameri-
 can commitment to resist Chinese expansion
 anywhere in southeast Asia.
 Until now, for what has appeared to be
 weighty and sufficient reasons, the adminis-
 tration, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Mr.
 Johnson, has steadily identified North Viet-
 nam as the aggressor, as she certainly is and
 as this administration would  never deny.
 China's appetite for aggression, however, has
 been given far less emphasis.
 This technique died at Johns  Hopkins.
 After weighing all the risks, the President
 decided to look beyond the war in Vietnam
 and to concentrate attention on China's
 threat to southeast Asia.
 In this wider context he gave a pledge, an
 unlimited and unconditional pledge, to resist
 Chinese military aggression, alone if neces-
 sary, and as long as may be necessary.
 Any country in southeast Asia attacked
 by China's power, either directly or through
 puppets and guerrillas, and willing to fight
 for its freedom and independence, can be as-

 in response to an appeal for assistance.
 That is the stark and far-reaching implica-
 tion of the principles asserted in the Presi-
 dent's address.   Washington is ranged di-
 rectly against Peiping in a more blunt and
 deliberate manner than many of us would
 have believed possible before Johns Hopkins.
 This firm stand has been taken by the
 administration, after long and careful delib-
 eration, because it has decided that China
 can be deterred from a continued career of
 aggression only if she realizes that she must
 overcome prompt and massive resistance by
 the United States.
 Perhaps this warning will fail.  In a situa-

 public health and safety by amending the
 Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act to
 establish special controls for depressant and

 Mr. PHILBIN.         Mr. Chairman, I am a

 committee for its fine work in bringing
 this very desirable, constructive legisla-

 I am also very anxious to compliment
 and congratulate the very distinguished
 Senator from Connecticut, our former
 great and esteemed colleague, the Hon-

 and pressing for this necessary, vital leg-

 nearly 20 years of frustrating and often
 angry  debate on  similar   measures-went
 rocketing through the Senate.  The vote was
 72 to 18.
 Whether it was President Johnson's seem-
 ingly limitless powers of persuasion, or a
 slow process of educational conversation that
 changed his views this year, the public at
 present does not know.
 He modified his views to the extent that
 he became willing to accept a social security-
 style system of prepayment.  Then he hur-
 ried hearings through his committee.
 A final touch in the legislation was to add
 a package of voluntary provisions which the
 aged may sign up for if they wish.
 The final package includes, essentially, a
 hospital care plan under a social security
 style system of prepayment, plus a voluntary
 health insurance system to cover doctor bills.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 8, 1965
 Mr. SKUBITZ.  Mr. Speaker, under
 unanimous consent, I include in the Ap-,
 pendix of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD my'
 report to the people of Kansas on H.R.,
 6675:
 REPORT TO KANSAS
 The House of Representatives, on April 8,
 passed  the                               administration's  hospital  and
 medical services bill.   Although                           President
 Johnson has recommended that Congress en-
 act a  limited  hospital                                                                                                                                care                               program-the
 Ways and Means Committee, apparently with
 the President's blessing came forth with one
 of the most far-reaching medicare programs
 ever to reach the floor of the House.
 Let's not kid ourselves. When this bill be-
 comes law, the soundness of the social secu-
 rity pension program will be in real jeopardy.
 It has always been my feeling that we have
 a  responsibility  to  provide  hospital  and
 medical care for all our people, young, and
 old, who are in need of such assistance.  We
 have a responsibility to assist our senior
 citizens who are able to care for their ordi-
 nary expenses of living, but who live in con-
 stant fear of a major illness, which might
 wipe out their savings, and force them to
 become public charges-and such assistance
 should be given without- embarrassment or
 humiliation to those who need help.
 Hence, the real issue before the Congress
 during the debate on H.R. 6675, insofar as I
 was concerned, was not whether we should
 provide assistance but how we should provide
 assistance.
 The administration bill was brought to the
 floor under a closed rule which permitted
 10 hours of discussion but denied to House
 Members the right to offer amendments, to
 remove objectional provisos, clarify ambigui-
 ties or improve it.   Hence, a Member was
 required to vote "yes" or "no" on the whole
 package.  With a single exception, the mi-
 nority was permitted to offer one amendment
 in the form of a motion to recommit.  Under
 these circumstances, the minority offered the
 Byrnes bill as an alternative proposal.
 The  administration  program  and       the
 Byrnes alternative both included the pro-
 visions of H.R. 11865 which passed the House
 last year (and I supported it) providing for

 proposal was far more liberal since it pro-
 vided for catastrophic illnesses and medic-
 inals-these were not included in the ad-
 ministration's bill H.R. 6675.
 The major difference in the two programs,
 was not so niuch in the benefits provided, but
 in the method of financing.  The adminis-
 tration bill provided that hospital care for
 those over 65 should be paid through an ad-
 ditional payroll tax attached to social se-
 curity by those who now pay social security
 but who would not be entitled to any bene-
 fits until they reach 65.  The Byrnes proposal
 which I supported provided that those over
 65 should pay one-third of the hospital and
 medical care insurance premium (average
 $6.50 per month) and the Government would
 pay two-thirds of the cost out of the general
 fund of the Treasury.  It was the same pro-
 gram provided by the Government today for
 Members of Congress and Federal employees.
 It was agreed by some that if we could give
 aid to the nations all over the world, if we
 could pay benefits to labor, industry, and
 agriculture, if we could assist Federal em-
 ployees, then we could subsidize the medical
 needs of the aged to meet their medical costs.

 tax of $214 and also hospitalization costs for
 a person'on retirement who has an income
 of $3,600, pays no income tax and contributes
 nothing toward the hospital care program.
 I supported the Byrnes proposal.  I could
 not in good conscience support the admin-
 istration proposal which in my opinion un-
 dermines the whole social security structure
 and  places unnecessary additional burden
 on those who now pay social security.
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH HOSPITAL CARE UNDER
 SOCIAL SECURITY?
 Most of us have always considered social
 security as a program under which we would
 receive a pension at age 65-which combined
 with our life savings-would make it pos-
 sible for us to maintain a decent standard
 of living during our years of retirement.
 When the program was first enacted In 1937,
 it held out much promise.  But since then
 what has happened to social security?
 Through the years we have so expanded and
 enlarged upon the original intent that, like
 Government bonds, it is rapidly losing its
 attractiveness.  We now have on the books
 commitments to pay out approximately $625
 billion to those on retirement or covered by
 social security. We have in assets around
 $305 billion.  If all payments into the fund
 were to stop-we would be $300 billion short
 to meet present commitments.
 Instead of building up reserves, as private
 pension programs do, we have actually been
 paying out approximately as much as we
 have been taking in. We have continued not
 only to increase the social security rate, but
 also the earnings base upon which the tax
 is paid. In 1954, when disability payments
 were added, we were told OASI trust funds
 would climb to $28.5 billion by 1965-actually
 the fund is now estimated at around $19
 billion, $7.5 billion short.  And now we are
 enlarging the program by adding hospital
 care, increasing cash benefits and reducing
 the age requirements for widows.
 Have pension payments kept pace with
 the increased social security payments made
 by the worker? The answer is "No."  In 1939,
 an employee who earned $550 per month
 paid $30 per year into the Social Security
 fund.  He could look forward to receiving
 $58 per month on retirement.  Today an em-
 ployee earning the same amount pays $174
 into the social security fund and his maxi-
 mum                                 social security  benefit is  $127  per
 ltonI.  By 1973, an employee earning $550
 per month will pay $358 annually into the
 social security fund, and he will receive a
 maximum pension check of $168.      in other
 words while the cost has gone up 480 per-
 cent-the workers retirement check has in-
 creased only 119 percent.
 What is there about social security that
 is attractive to the young man who is about
 to enter the labor force for the first time?
 One  must remember  that  these  are  the
 workers upon whom we must depend to pay
 into the fund so that those over 65 may
 secure these benefits.  A young man, 21 years
 of age, entering the labor force next year and
 paying the full amount of social security
 until  65,  could  have  deposited  the same
 amount in a building and loan at 41/2  per-
 cent, and he would accumulate by retirement
 time an estimate of $42,000. If we add the
 employer's share, it would be $84,000.  His
 retirement checks under social security would
 total $2,004 per anum.   If he invested $42,-
 000 at 5 percent, he would earn $2,100 an-
 nually and still leave an estate of $42,000 at
 his death.
 Can we keep expanding the social security
 program by adding hospital care, medical
 care, increasing benefits to those over 65,
 and charge it to social security?  Yes, if those
 who pay into the fund are willing to stand
 for an increase in the payroll tax and the
 earning base upon which the tax is paid.  It
 should be remembered, however,  that the
 social security tax by 1971 will be as burden-
 some as the income tax.  For example, take
 a man earning $5,000 per year with a wife
 and two dependents-in 1971 his income tax
 will be approximately $290 and his social
 security tax will be $260. These, of course,
 will be increased when demands are made
 that Congress grant further increases in so-
 cial security benefits to meet living, costs,
 and as hospital and medical services increase
 in cost.
 A hospital care program for those over 65
 financed by a payroll tax attached to social
 security not only does serious damage to the
 social security pension program, but it also
 inflicts the most unfair tax in our whole
 taxing system.  The president of the cor-
 poration pays on the same basis as the plant
 janitor.
 In closing may I repeat what I said in the
 beginning-I believe in providing hospital
 care and medical care for those who are in
 need.  I want to help those who can care for
 themselves, but live in constant dread that
 one serious illness will place them on relief.
 But I want to do it without wrecking the
 social security pension system for those who
 are between the age of 21 and 65 and are
 required to foot the bill.  I do not want to
 kill the goose that lays the golden egg,  That
 is why I favored the financing provided by
 the Byrnes alternative and opposed the ad-
 ministration bill.

 James A. Farley: Truly a Pro's Pro
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EUGENE J. KEOGH
 or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. KEOGH.                                            Mr.  Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I include the following article
 by Frank Conniff which appeared in the
 New York Journal-American on April 5,
 1965:
 JAMES A. FARLEY: TRULY A PRO'S PRO
 (By Frank Conniff)
 One of the nicer tints brightening the
 political spectrum during recent years is the
 universal admiration and affection exhibited
 toward James A. Farley, a pro's pro who has
 been to the wars without losing his integrity
 or his self-respect.
 Although he scrupulously shuns donning
 the toga of an elder statesman, audiences,
 especially those of a Democratic Party tinge,
 seem intent on communicating their vast
 esteem for him at every opportunity.  He Is
 still much too vigorous to hold still for the
 wise man role, but people seem dedicated to
 placing him in a niche removed from the less
 seemly facets of public life.
 Largely  by coincidence,  this writer  has
 many times this winter been at affairs where
 the introduction of Jim Farley brought a
 heartfelt and spontaneous response,    The
 standing ovation bit is the most overdone
 feature of the banquet circuit these nights
 a claque of about three stands up and the
 rest of the room is ashamed not to follow
 suit-but in the case of Big Jim the roaring
 tribute strikes one as emanating from a deep
 desire to convey the audience's high regard
 for the man.
 There is something heartening about all
 this: a feeling of events coming full circle
 to honor the man for his many contributions
 devoid of the sniping that marred the un-
 happy years.  Deep down, we suspect Jim
 Farley believes he has never been given
 proper credit for the role he played in help-
 ing  enact President Roosevelt's  New Deal
 into law.
 Not too many years ago, critics dismissed
 him as a "conservative."  This was in the
 days when one's attitude toward Soviet com-
 munism determined your classification as a
 "liberal" or a "conservative."
 Those who viewed communism tolerantly
 and believed the United States could ac-
 commodate itself to all things Russian auto-
 matically  were  designated  as  "liberals."
 Others who, like Jim Farley, looked at Soviet
 Russia witu suspicion, were branded "con-
 servatives," although their support of liberal
 welfare measures had been a long standing
 commitment.
 But that's raking over a long-gone ideo-
 logical dispute which Josef Stalin settled by
 his unabashed aggressions following World
 War II.  We would do well to bear the old
 feud in mind, however, in the current Viet-
 nam  controversy.   Those  who believe  the
 United States has committed its honor to
 the defense of South Vietnam are not neces-
 sarily trigger-happy reactionaries;  nor are
 those who call for instant negotiations auto-
 matically appeasers       of aggressive commu-
 nism.
 We are not trying to adjust a halo on Big
 Jim's shiny pate, because he operated ac-
 cording  to  the rules  of political warfare,
 which can be pretty rugged at times.  What
 he has proven is that you can survive in this
 rough game and still abide by the canons
 of decency, respect for opponents and trust.
 He managed to do it, and it's a shame not

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 enough of the new breed have pondered his
 example.
 Now he has come into the years of full
 recognition and his story reads very pleas-
 antly over the long haul.  Prestige-wise, we
 would say he is ranked only by President
 Johnson and Harry S. Truman in the Demo-
 cratic Party.  Vice President HVMPHRE-r, Sen-
 ator BOB KENNEDY, and Franklin D. Roose-
 velt, Jr., to mention of a few of the later
 generation, have years to go before the ac-
 cumulate the record of public service, ad-
 herence to ideals and party loyalty built
 up by Jim for more than 40 years.
 As we say, it's one of the nicer -things
 we've seen recently, the spontaneous salute
 of  admiration and  affection  showered  on
 James A. Parley whenever people get the
 chance    demonstrate how they feel about
 him.
 Answer. No.  There was no civil war in
 Cuba.  We sent missiles to Cuba at the re-
 quest of Chairman Castro. We also removed
 them and our men when it looked like they
 could cause an all-out war. We are basically
 a peaceful nation.
 Question. There are signs that Russia is
 going capitalist. Can you explain your latest
 efforts to increase production by employing
 standards  long  used  in  this  (capitalist)
 nation?
 Answer. The Soviet Union will never go
 capitalist. We have embarked on an incen-
 tive program.  This is not a profit motive,
 just a means to increase our production.   It
 may interest you to know that our gross na-
 tional product has increased 8 to 10 percent
 while the United States can boast of only 4
 or 5 percent.
 Question. Can you explain the split be-
 tween your country and Red China?
 Answer. Our differences with the Republic
 of China are purely ideological.  (He never
 used the word "Red" in describing a Commu-
 nist nation; acting bullish, perhaps?)                                                                              We
 are not nearly as estranged as you are led to
 believe.  Furthermore, it's obvious that your
 government and some of its western partners
 don't see eye to eye on many matters either.
 Question from this correspondent.    What
 about the controlled press in your country?
 Is there anything like the type of newspapers
 we   represent--suburban  weeklies,   semi-
 weeklies and small town dailies, who reflect
 the attitudes of America's grass roots?  We
 can and frequently do criticize our govern-
 ments and officials and show our editorial
 independence to a remarkable degree.
 Answer  (Comrade  Zimchuk  bristled               a
 little. A slight tic on the left side of his
 face began a more rapid action).  Our press
 is not controlled.  Yes, we have papers like
 yours in our communities,  But they carry
 mostly social news-something like a com-
 pany house organ.  Our major papers are
 national ones.  Remember, we do not have
 private ownership of the press.
 Question.  Can your  community papers
 criticize?
 Answer. Yes, if there's a-grievance toward
 a factory superintendent, for example, a
 letter to the editor will be accepted to be
 printed.
 Question. What was behind the ouster of
 Khrushchev.
 Answer. Chairman Khrushchev sent his
 resignation to the Presidium, the same body
 which elected him to his high office.  (Be-
 fore this response could draw a followup
 query, the Counsul recognized another out-
 stretched hand.)
 Question. Do you expect that Russo-U.S.
 tensions will ever cease?
 Answer. Yes, but it's hard to predict when.
 At the present time we are negotiating the
 opening of legations in major cities of your
 country.  This may help you to understand
 us better.
 Question (this one on the lighter side).
 Do you have anyone in Russia who com-
 pares with James Bond?
 Consul Zimchuk didn't appear to under-
 stand the question.  He exchanged a few
 words in Russian with an aide and then
 asked to have the query repeated.
 His answer, We're somewhat old fashioned
 in Russia,  we  still believe  in  Sherlock
 Holmes, brought down the house.
 The camaraderie was spreading.  It was
 easy to see that the Russians could parry
 with-the best of them.
 Question. If I went to Russia, my travel
 would be restricted, why?
 Answer. I don't know why, my own travel
 here is plenty restricted.
 Question. How did you react to the U.S.
 orbit conquest of Grissom and Young?
 Answer. It was a great achievement.
 Question. Did you celebrate it in the
 embassy?
 April 15, 1965
 Answer. No, we didn't even celebrate our
 own triumph in space a week earlier.
 The hour went by rapidly.  Most of us
 concluded that, these diplomats could not
 be  embarrassed.  Their  answers slick,  yet
 positive, didn't create fury-only sound,  It
 was the kind of afternoon we would enjoy
 repeating.  Even though the answers weren't
 satisfying, the intellectual vying 1s good
 mental therapy.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. FRANK E. EVANS
 OF COLORADO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. EVANS of Colorado.  Mr. Speak-
 er, One of the major concerns of our
 country today is our position and atti-
 tude regarding the conflict in Vietnam.
 I am therefore pleased to insert an edi-
 torial from the Denver Post of April 8
 on the President's position:
 PRESIDENT EXPANDS CHANCES FOR PEACE
 President Johnson took the firm, positive
 course in his address to the Nation on Amer-
 ican policy in southeast Asia.  It was clearer
 than any previous statement on that diffi-
 cult and frustrating subject,  and it held
 more hope for decent, peaceful settlement in
 South Vietnam.
 The speech was obviously the product of
 thorough analysis and painstaking prepara-
 tion.                                                                                                             It was not merely the response of a
 sensitive political leader angry at his critics,
 as some had suggested it might be, but ra-
 ther a responsible, detailed policy statement,
 framed for world consumption.
 There was in It something for all interested
 parties.  There was, of course, repetition of
 the administration's determination to con-
 tinue in strong support of South Vietnam.
 Military attacks against the North Vietnam-
 ese will continue for now, he said, "because
 they are a necessary part of the surest road
 to peace."
 The enemy and his allies, as well as those
 at  home who  feared this determination
 might falter at a critical juncture, will mark
 this statement well.
 But while saying that the United States
 would not grow tired and withdraw "under
 the cloak of a meaningless agreement," the
 President  announced  his  willingness  to
 enter "unconditional discussions" on a Viet-
 nam settlement.
 If this was not a radical departure from
 previous statements in which he has said
 that the government in Hanoi would have
 to  indicate  readiness  to  cease  aggression
 against its neighbors before we would talk
 about negotiations, at least it was a far more
 direct expression of our willingness to seek
 peace.
 The President for the first time appeared
 to be going at least half way in the quest
 for peaceful  settlement  in Vietnam.   His
 statement was a major effort to gain the
 diplomatic  initiative  in  southeast Asia.
 At the same time, it was clear that the other
 half of the distance would have to be cov-
 ered by Hanoi, or Peiping or Moscow, or by
 all of them together.
 But the willing hand he extended to friend
 and foe on the subject of peace also held
 the promise of dramatic and massive Ameri-
 can aid.
 He called for a large-scale cooperative ef-
 fort "to improve the life of man" in con-
 flict torn southeast Asia while pledging a
 Conference at Soviet Embassy
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. DERWINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, re-
 cently Mr. I. E. "Pappy" Schechter, pub-
 lisher and editor of the Park Forest
 Reporter, Park Forest, Ill., attended the
 National Editors Association Conference
 held in Washington. As part of the pro-
 gram, he and his fellow newsmen had an
 opportunity for a press conference at the
 Soviet Embassy.
 It isn't very often that Communist
 diplomats expose themselves to proper
 scrutiny by the U.S. press.  Mr. Schech-
 ter's report of the interview is so fasci-
 nating that I felt it deserved widespread
 review.
 I place it in the RECORD at this point:
 "Nyet" may be the most popular Russian
 word in the American lexicon, yet in all
 candor we must admit that during our 1-
 hour news conference at the Soviet Embassy
 in Washington recently, Red diplomats were
 affirmative, skillful at responses, suave in
 their mannerisms.  One couldn't help com-
 ing away with a feeling that the confidence
 they exuded  regarding  political  and  eco-
 nomic matters was based on their true feel-
 ings, not on a false sense of security.
 The event was a first in Russo-American
 relations.  The 130 newsmen who attended
 the 4th annual National Editorial Association
 Government Relations Workshop were the
 first news group of this size to be invited to
 the Soviet Embassy to query their diplomats.
 In the absence of Ambassador Dobrynin,
 his chief aide, Consul Alexander Zimchuk,
 undertook to. answer all queries.  His com-
 ments were firm and even though we sensed
 the uselessness of pursuing inquiry, he could
 hardly be classed as equivocal. Obviously,
 he  must  have  answered  similar queries
 before.
 Here  are  some random  questions and
 answers :
 Question. Why is your government Insist-
 ing that the United States get out of South
 Vietnam?
 Answer. You are violating the treaty of
 1955, when Indochina was partitioned.  At
 that time a free election was promised in the
 nation.   Only  a  dictatorship  has existed
 since then.   The United States. has no right
 to arm. South Vietnam and send its troops.
 Question. Didn't you do the same thing in
 Cuba?

 Johnson's "Idea War" Weapon
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DANIEL D. ROSTENKOWSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.  Mr. Speaker,
 under leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I Include the following editorial
 which appeared in the Friday, April 9
 issue of the Chicago Sun-Times:
 JOHNSON,'S "IDEA WAR" WEAPON
 President Johnson has cut through the
 confusion of the Vietnamese war and made
 a point that must be made clear to every
 Communist in southeast Asia, whether he
 be a guerrilla in the rain forest or a high
 official in Hanoi. Continued warfare is futile
 and senseless.  Peace will bring a better life
 for all. The choice is up to the Communists.
 If they choose continued warfare, the United
 States has a total commitment-"we will not
 be defeated" Mr. Johnson Says.
 The United States will stay in South Viet-
 nam and continue to slug it out with the
 Communists, if that's the way they want
 it.  But the United States also is willing
 to engage in "unconditional discussions" to
 stop the bloodshed and to help all of south-
 east Asia to a better life.
 The billion dollars the President says the
 United States is willing to put into the back-
 ward area for economic development was
 quickly termed a carrot-part of the classic
 carrot and stick approach.  It also has been
 labeled a bribe or an attempt to buy friends
 with dollars, to get out of a sticky mess in
 South Vietnam.
 This is a superficial viewpoint.  It ignores
 fundamentals.  Marshall plan aid could have
 been described as a bribe, too.   So can all
 forms of foreign aid.  But they also are
 acknowledgments that it takes more than
 firepower to fight the Communists.
 The battle against communism is also a
 fight against an idea. Ideas cannot be fought
 with guns.  They must be fought with other
 ideas. Americans win this part of the battle
 when they convince the people in under-
 developed countries that capitalism and the
 democratic way can do more for them than
 communism.
 President Johnson once again has put in
 perspective both types of warfare against the
 Communists.
 Communism promises the people a better
 i material life.  But they would lose the right
 to govern themselves.
 The V;uited States and other free nations
 stand ready to help poorer nations build a
 weeks ago and if the Reds had agreed to talk,
 have saved many lives. But a few weeks ago,
 the United States would have made the offer
 from a position of military weakness.  To-
 day, with the North Vietnamese taking pun-
 ishment from the air and the battles in
 South  Vietnam  going  against  them,  the
 United States makes its offer from a posture
 of strength and has given convincing proof
 that it "will not be defeated."
 The Soviet Union still prates about the
 "aggression" of  "American  imperialism"
 against North Vietnam. But no reasonable
 person anywhere could read Mr. Johnson's
 speech and conclude- that America wants to
 dominate the people of southeast Asia. It
 wants to help them govern themselves.
 Secretary General U Thant, of the United
 Nations saw President Johnson's position as a
 favorable response to the recent appeal of 17
 nonalined countries to bring about a political
 settlement of the Vietnam war, It was "posi-
 tive, forward looking, and generous."  This
 seems to be the attitude of most non-Com-
 munist countries.
 Mr. Johnson has challenged not only the
 Communists but the Cgmmunist system to
 show whether they are sincere in their pro-
 testations that they stand for peace and for
 a better life for the common man.  The
 world awaits their answer.
 The Pittsburgh Story
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 1, 1965
 Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, I call
 the attention of the House to another
 chapter In the story of "Pittsburgh Re-
 search: Key to Tomorrow," published by
 the Regional, Industrial Development
 Corp.  of  southwestern  Pennsylvania.
 This chapter is entitled "The Pittsburgh
 Story," and I include it as part of my
 remarks :
 THE PITTSBURGH STORY
 The Pittsburgh area has much to offer-
 in scientific and technical talents, labora-
 tory facilities, and research and development
 effectiveness.
 The contents of this brochure are con-
 vincing evidence of the high level of sci-
 entific and technological activities in the
 nine-county area.  They also point out the
 numerous   opportunities   for   interaction
 among industrial, governmental, and insti-
 tutional organizations in the region.
 ment, and supporting services necessary for
 creative investigation and enterprise.
 Always strong in the materials field, it also
 has become the center for nuclear power
 research-and is making significant contribu-
 tions in a variety of other fields-chemicals,
 machinery,  electronics, medicine, and in-
 struments.
 Most of the research is of an applied or
 developmental  nature,  but a  surprisingly
 large amount of basic research is underway.

 Getting to Work and Back.
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. DONALD J. IRWIN
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, March 31, 1965
 Mr. IRWIN.  Mr. Speaker, I recom-
 mend for the attention of the House the
 third article in Consumer Reports' in-
 formative and thorough series on the
 cost and convenience of metropolitan
 transportation, "Getting to Work and
 Back." Since many of our major urban
 centers are facing key decisions on mass
 transportation, I know my colleagues
 will be interested. The article follows:
 GETTING TO WORK AND BACK
 (By Ruth and Edward Brecher)
 Before a new expressway or transit route
 can be built, it must be planned.  Most of
 the planning has been done by highway en-
 gineers employed in State highway depart-
 ments.   The  plans have been designed to
 get people from place to place in their own
 automobiles-with relatively little concern
 for the areas through which the roads run
 or for other means of transportation.  Since
 most of the money for new urban express-
 ways has come from Washington, and most
 of the planning from the State capitols, local
 communities have had relatively little voice
 in their own transportation futures.
 But  a change  is  underway.   The  1962
 amendment to the Federal-Aid Highway Act
 declares that, beginning in July 1965, plans
 for new urban expressways shall be drawn up
 with "due consideration" of their probable
 effect on the cities through which they run,
 and shall be "properly coordinated with plans
 for improvements in other affected forms of
 transportation."
 There are teeth in this amendment, more-
 over.  For the bulk of the money for new
 urban expressways-90 percent in the case
 of Interstate System routes-is allocated by
 the Secretary of Commerce; and, beginning
 in July, the Secretary is forbidden to give
 approval to new urban freeway routes "unless
 he finds that such projects are based on a
 continuing  comprehensive  transportation
 planning process carried on cooperatively by
 the States and local communities."
 In other words, no more freeway funds will
 be coming from Washington after July un-
 less an areawide. _ planning study is under-
 way.  Federal funds to assist in comprehen-

 sive regional planning are available through
 the Housing and Home Finance Agency.
 The new planning studies are being spon-
 sored   by   the  U.S.       Bureau  of Public
 Roads, and the BPR has established a laud-
 able framework for them.  The Bureau is
 insisting, for example, that planners give
 full consideration to all transportation facil-
 ities, "Including those for mass transporta-
 tion," instead of, just to new highways; the
 factors analyzed are to include "zoning ordi-
 nances,  subdivision  regulations,  building
 codes, etc."; and area planners are instructed
 to consider "social and community-value fac-
 tors, such as preservation of open space, parks
 and recreational facilities;  preservation of
 historical sites and buildings; environmental
 amenities; and aesthetics."
 The boundaries of the new planning areas
 are based on Census Bureau maps; in gen-
 eral, each city or cluster of cities with its
 suburbs is considered a single area.  Each
 local government within the area is expected
 to participate in the planning process. "The
 State highway department," the BPR states,
 "will be expected to show by suitable evi-
 dence that scrupulous efforts have been made
 to carry out the intent of the act with respect
 to cooperative action by all political sub-
 divisions.  If there is an unwillingness on the
 part of a local political unit within the- en-
 tire urban area to participate in the trans-
 portation planning process in such area, a
 determination shall be made as to whether
 the percentage of the urban area affected is
 such as to negate an effective planning
 process for the whole area"-and thus war-
 rant curtailment or withholding of Federal
 highway funds.
 An exciting feature of both the BPR and
 HHFA approaches is that Washington is not
 dictating solutions to local problems, but
 rather  insisting  that  local  machinery  be
 established to solve them.
 WHERE THE CITIZENS GROUPS COME IN
 The     mere  establishment     of  these new
 transportation planning studies, of course,
 is no guarantee that urban transportation
 problems will be more effectively solved in
 the future than in the past.    As CU noted
 in February, the new planning projects could
 prove to be mere facades, behind which the
 same old highway engineers will continue
 to make the same old highway-oriented de-
 cisions from a regional planning office.  Here
 is where a vigilant citizens group comes In.
 It can start by asking questions.
 Is your community, for example, properly
 represented on the body that is preparing a
 comprehensive plan for your urban area? Is
 your spokesman an impartial representative
 concerned primarily with the community-
 or is he a highway contractor, a gasoline
 company executive, or someone else with a
 personal ax to grind?  If your local govern-
 ment office can't answer these questions, you
 cari get the name and address of the body
 making the transportation study for your
 urban area from the State highway depart-
 ment; and you can then check with the
 planning agency itself to learn whether your
 community has an authorized spokesman.
 If it doesn't, urge your local officials to es-
 tablish effective liaison with the agency at
 once.
 Next a citizens group should ask the local
 representative to explain how the planning
 agency is going about its task.  Planning a
 sound transportation network for a metro-
 politan area is so complex a job that planners
 necessarily make use of electronic computers
 to aid them in their work.  What counts is
 how  they  are  used-what   questions  are
 asked and what data is given the machine
 to use in arriving at its answers.
 The first primitive attempts to use com-
 puters in transportation planning were woe-
 fully Inadequate.  The planners divided an
 urban area arbitrarily into 10-block or 20-
 block zones and determined by a survey what
 trips were being made by the residents of
 each zone.  These trip data were fed into
 the computer along with population predic-
 tions, automobile ownership trends, land-
 use trends, travel time figures, and other such
 statistics. The computer then produced a
 set of desire lines showing how many people
 would want to drive from A through B to C
 a decade or two hence, and multilane express-
 ways were bulldozed through to carry the
 anticipated traffic.  Local protests were ig-
 nored, on the theory that the computer knows
 best.  This approach may still survive in a
 few local projects.
 A much better approach, however, is now
 in common use.  The computer no longer
 dictates an expressway plan; instead it is fed
 alternative plans, and their cost and ade-
 quacy are compared.  Thus, planners, elected
 officials, and local voters can make the final
 choice on the basis of the helpful findings
 emerging from the computer.
 Despite this improvement, there remain
 many pitfalls.   One results from the fact
 that computer estimates of future traffic are
 generally based on recent trends toward an
 automobile-dominated  society.   Thus  the
 worst features of our past decade of urban
 chaos are projected into the future on an
 inflated scale.
 Moreover, many of the planners in control
 of the urban planning projects were trained
 in automobile-oriented university engineer-
 ing schools; and many are former employees
 of highway  planning  departments.  Thus
 the alternatives with which they are most
 familiar are expressway alternatives. They
 are less likely to program for the computer
 a thoroughly detailed evaluation of a mod-
 ern, highspeed rapid-transit system like the
 San Francisco BART system, described in the
 February Reports (with its 80-mile-an-hour
 top speeds, scheduled speeds of 50 miles an
 hour including stops, abundant and con-
 venient peripheral parking, average platform
 waits of only a minute or two at rush hour,
 comfortable seats, low noise levels, air con-
 ditioning, and other amenities).
 Finally, the computer Is generally asked
 about getting travelers from neighborhood
 A through neighborhood B to neighborhood
 C.  The rights, wants, and needs of the resi-
 dents of neighborhood B are seldom con-
 sulted in advance, much less reduced to a
 form that the computer can assimilate.  But
 this  lack can  be  remedied.  And citizens
 groups can provide the drive if it is not ini-
 tiated by the regional planning office.                                                                          How
 they can participate is very well illustrated
 by what is now going on in the Boston area.
 HOW BOSTON IS DOING IT
 Under                            the  Boston  Regional Planning
 Project (BRPP), a thorough transportation
 planning study  is  currently underway   in
 the Boston area, comprising the city Itself
 and scores of its suburbs.  This study is sup-
 ported by the Massachusetts Department of
 Public Works and Department of Commerce
 & Development.  Its director is a commu-
 nity-minded  regional  planner,  Donald  M.
 Grams.  And its incomparable virtue is that
 Graham. And its incomparable virtue is that
 community representatives  before rather
 than after the computers are put to work.
 Researchers for this series of reports at-
 tended a meeting called by BRPP, one of a
 series of 10 for representatives of 6 suburbs
 30 miles northwest of Boston. The meetings
 were held in the evening so that ordinary
 citizens could participate. Graham himself
 presided.
 The communities represented learn from
 one- another at these meetings.  "My town
 isn't interested in better rail service to Bos-
 ton," one representative may remark.  "Our
 commuters own at least two cars and drive
 one in."
 A representative from a neighboring town
 disagrees.  "How do you know your commu-
 ters wouldn't be delighted to sell their second
 car and take the train if more comfortable,
 convenient, and speedy service were avail-
 able?"
 "My town's a mess every morning and
 evening when the trains come in," someone
 remarks.  "The cars around the station tie
 our downtown district up in a knot until it
 looks like Boston."
 "My town, too.  Why not tear down both
 miserable old stations and build a new one
 in the country halfway between?"
 "Good Idea.  Then we would have enough
 room to park near the station instead of five
 blocks away."
 Out of such local exchanges, new ideas-
 and new projects-are born.  BRPP is hold-
 ing a similar series of meetings in each of its
 18 districts.  Later these expressions of local
 concern and need can be included among
 the data fed into the BRPP computers.
 The meetings work in the other direction,
 too.  The BRPP men bring news of projects
 that may affect local interests.  A new free-
 way is being planned around Boston, for ex-
 ample-even further out than the famous
 Route 128, once touted as the solution to the
 area's traffic snafus but now itself congested.
 Where should the       interchanges along the
 new beltway be located?  One suburb may
 welcome an interchange because of the boom
 in land values It will generate; another may
 be horrified by the destruction to a settled
 community the interchange will bring.  If
 neither knows of the plans, neither can speak
 up while there is still time.
 Some traditional planners are appalled by
 Graham's    cards-on-the-table  approach.
 They warn that if plans become known in
 advance, land speculators will reap windfall
 profits;  and they predict that if so much
 time is allowed for opposition to mobilize,
 nothing will ever get built.   Graham dis-
 agrees.                                                                                                                                     Windfall profits are only possible,
 he point out, when knowledge of plans is
 limited to a few insiders who can then prey
 upon the ignorance of their neighbors.  And
 he predicts that if the BRPP plan is devised
 from the start with adequate consideration
 for community needs  and wants, support
 rather than opposition will be engendered
 through most of the area.
 "The way to recognize a sound urban-area
 planning program," Graham told CU, "is by
 its approach to your own community.  Do
 the planners come in with a completed plan
 and try to sell you on its merits?  Or do they
 come in with an open ear to learn in ad-
 vance your community's needs and wants-
 and then try, with the help of their comput-
 ers, to reconcile your needs and wants with
 those of the rest of the area?"
 Where official planning projects fail to do
 their work well, a citizens group with suffi-
 cient  determination-and  the  necessary
 talent-can do a great deal of investigating
 and publicizing on its own. A CU subscriber
 Ernest Ratterman,  has  reported one  un-
 usually comprehensive effort of a few years
 ago In Cincinnati.
 Concerned with the traffic jams and com-
 muter delays that were plaguing the city of
 Cincinnati back. in 1957, Ratterman and a
 handful of his friends-most of them pro-
 fessional engineers like himself-asked why
 a high-speed rapid transit system could not
 be built with a modest investment to operate
 along an existing, little-used railroad right-
 of-way into the city. As a contribution to the
 city's progress, this citizens group, headed
 by Alvin L. Spivak, submitted a study of the
 possibility,  including  "data  on  costs for
 rights-of-way, electrification, new trackage,
 purchase price of rolling stock, operating
 costs, and income."      Then, they organized
 themselves as the "Rapid Transit Study Com-
 mittee" and published their full report.  "We
 dug deeply into Cincinnati's transportation
 picture both past and present," Ratterman
 recalls.  "As engineers we were able to pre-
 sent well-thought-out plans  and ideas  to
 generate interest in our goals. * * * At no

 time during our many presentations aid we
 encounter any dispute about our facts or
 questioning of our conclusions about Cin-
 cinnati's  transit needs.  Ordinary citizens
 * .* * showed their eagerness for something
 new and better in urban transportation.
 What they lacked, however, was a strong, co-
 herent leadership which could achieve action
 on their wants."
 Inevitably, the Cincinnati committee came
 into conflict with the local highway lobby.
 One issue that evoked the clash was a con-
 troversial plan to build a four-level under-
 ground parking_ garage in the downtown
 district.
 "Building such an enormously expensive
 facility  struck us as  foolish,"  Ratterman
 writes, "unless it could be planned to accom-
 modate mass transit facilities at some future
 date.     We made proposals to the city council
 on this subject and even developed plans for
 using the first deck of this garage as a cen-
 tral point of a modern downtown subway
 system integrated with surface lines to the
 suburbs.  We studied the downtown park-
 ing facilities and their location, cost, utiliza-
 tion, rate structure, and financing.  These
 studies cast grave doubt on the feasibility of
 the proposed new structure.
 "But we soon learned that politics rather
 than facts would decide the parking-garage
 issue.  Our proposals and recommendations
 were graciously received by the city govern-
 ment-and blissfully ignored.
 "We  were  handicapped  rather  seri-
 ously * * * by being unable to garner the
 support of some business and professional
 groups. Individuals in these groups pri-
 vately lauded our work and expressed envy
 of our freedom of expression; but the groups
 themselves were dominated by many con-
 scious and some unknowing supporters and
 members of the highway lobby. * * * The
 expressway and parking plans which the city
 had developed, and the ease with which Fed-
 eral funds could be secured to finance the
 expressways, blocked serious consideration of
 more effective approaches to the city's trans-
 port problems.  One city councilman told
 us candidly that,  until  the  Government
 passes out transit money as it passes out
 expressway money, there would be no rapid
 transit in Cincinnati."
 The Cincinnati committee broke up in 1961
 when Spivak, 'Ratterman, and several -other
 key members moved to other cities.  Cin-
 cinnati still lacks a rapid transit system.
 But Ratterman does not regret the effort
 expended on the project.  "I am sure other
 members would agree," he writes, "that it was
 a great personal experience."
 Such a committee if launched today, it
 should be added, would have working in its
 favor many factors that the Cincinnati com-
 mittee lacked from 1957 to 1961.  Among
 these factors are:
 San Francisco's successful adoption of the
 BART plan for high speed, comfortable, con-
 venient rapid transit of a quality that should
 exceed  any  now  available  in  the United
 States. When it is in operation, the prece-
 dent  may engender a. demand  for better
 transportation in other areas.
 The likelihood of Federal fuiids for transit
 systems (see last month's article in this se-
 ries) so that cities will no longer be faced
 with a Hobson's, choice between Federtily-
 supported freeways and transit systems that
 must be financed at home.
 The existence of area-wide planning pro-
 grams, which at least provide a forum for
 presenting ideas.
 Finally, even some urban interests that
 would noTma    form a part of the highway
 lobby now reyyalize that mass transportation
 must be Improved and expanded to unclog
 the expressways.  The Jenney gas station
 chain with 600 filling stations in the greater
 Boston area, to cite one example, has taken
 full-page advertisements urging public sup-
 port of transit expansion there.  The Stand-
 and Oil Co. of California and the California
 State Automobile Association both endorsed
 San Francisco's BART transit plan.
 With such new factors affecting the sit-
 uation, committees like the one in Cincin-
 nati should have a considerably better chance
 of success in the future.
 Some are already at work.  Examples are
 the District of Columbia Rapid Rail Citizens
 Committee,  the  Bergen  County   (N.J.)
 Transit  Association, the Intermunicipal
 Group for Better Rail Service (New Jersey),
 the Westchester Commuter Association (New
 York), and the Committee for Better Tran-
 sit of Greater New York. Also important are
 the long-established planning groups such as
 the Regional Plan Association of Greater New
 York.  If there is a sound organization of
 this kind in your community or region, by
 all means join and support it.
 If a city's residents do not value it they
 are of course free to move out.  But much
 of the shift to the suburbs today is not the
 result of an innate dislike of the cities.
 Rather, it is being forced on families and
 business concerns alike by the failure of the
 cities to solve their most pressing problems,
 including the transportation.  Thus, willy-
 nilly, we are drifting toward a future of
 urban sprawl.
 At least four major North American urban
 areas-San  Francisco,  Montreal,  Toronto,
 and Philadelphia-are bucking this trend to-
 ward sprawl by investing in high quality rail
 transportation that will link city to suburbs
 for balanced growth.  The residents of other
 areas may prefer different patterns.  If so,
 they are free to plan differently, but let them
 get what they really want, not merely what
 the requirements of automobile transporta-
 tion dictate..
 The new comprehensive planning projects
 now underway or soon to be launched in
 every urban area make it possible to plan for
 the future of people, rather than just for
 automobiles.  Let us make the most of this
 opportunity.
 THE STAKES ARE HIGH
 Much more is at stake in such local efforts
 than merely an opportunity to get to work
 and back a few minutes faster or for a few
 cents less each day.  The entire future of
 American cities hangs in the balance.
 An increasing number of people today,
 looking at our blighted central cities and
 traffic jams, have concluded that large cities
 are obsolete.  They therefore envision a fu-
 ture in which all of us will both live and work
 in suburbs, surrounded by vast parking lots,
 and linked together by multilane freeways
 along which we can all whizz in uncongested
 private-car luxury.
 One objection to such plans is that they
 leave out of account the many services that
 people want and need but that each sub-
 urb cannot possibly supply for itself-a sym-
 phony orchestra, to cite a striking example.
 Right To Be a Bum
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. WILLIAM S. BROOMFIELD
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 25, 1965
 Mr. BROOMFIELD.  Mr. Speaker, I
 would like to call the attention of my
 colleagues to the remarks of Mr. Paul
 Harvey, made on his news broadcast on
 February 27, 1965. I think the emphasis
 he has correctly placed on freedom is
 one which each of us should consider
 carefully in preparing his legislative pro-
 gram.  There is plenty of security in a
 jail cell but I have never heard of any-
 body beating down the doors to get in.
 [Excerpt from Paul Harvey News,
 Feb. 27,19651
 RIGHT To BE A BUM
 I had meant to confine this next just to
 generalities.                             And embellish it with some fer-
 vent plea for the preservation of the Repub-
 lic.  Then I got to thinking about a parttime
 dishwasher I know, who's a bum the rest of
 the time, and I tried to figure what's his stake
 in all this free enterprise. How about the
 ragpicker,  or even that  good-natured. old
 janitor in the North Western train station,
 what's his percentage?
 If he votes right and puts up a fight for
 freedom, what's his cut?  "The Government
 can't give you anything which it has not first
 taken away from you." He's heard that.  But
 he has nothing anybody can take away from
 him.  So who's he to worry about whether
 the Constitution gets  chopped up or the
 flag hauled down?
 He's got nothing they can tax and nothing
 anybody'd want, so why shouldn't he take a
 bottle of cheap wine from the precinct com-
 mitteeman and just vote the way the man
 says.
 I. had meant to talk about the American
 heritage, and I got to thinking about Joe
 the bootblack. What has he inherited? Well,
 I've been asking around.  And the rest of
 you tune out, now.  And dial in S pages later.
 Because right now I aim to talk just to Joe
 the bootblack.  And to Lennie, the part-time
 bum.
 You know, I think that's what's wrong with
 the fervent flag wavers in this country.  We
 spend too much time talking to one another.
 But Joe and Lennie and Paul Harvey under-
 stand one another, too.  Because they've all
 been flush and they've each been hungry and
 any one of them knows what it's like to work
 a hard 17-hour day for $1 packing or sacking
 or stacking somebody else's groceries.  So
 we can speak the same language, and it's
 that language we're going to use here.  The
 kind that'll be understood by Lennie and Joe
 and the vast mass of unorganized, unterrifled
 human beings whose two-by-four house or
 third-floor walkup is as close to the silk as
 they're ever going to get. The rest of you just
 excuse us for a bit-if you will.
 A while back a chap named Dean Russell
 made a speech out in. Billings, Mont.  Prob-
 ably talking to a gathering of folks who al-
 ready agreed with him.  I'm going to try to
 remember how he compared the American
 Negro slaves and the American Indians.
 For a lot of years now we've been voting
 for the men who promise us Government
 aid-of all kinds.  We figured we wanted
 the Government to guarantee to look after us.
 Well, sir, in the early American slave States
 the law specified that the slaves must be
 taken care of.  The constitutions of the slave
 States generally specified that the slaveown-
 ers must provide their slaves with adequate
 housing,  food, medical  care,  and  old-age
 benefits. And the Mississippi constitution
 contained this additional sentence:     "The
 legislature shall have no power to pass laws
 for the emancipation of slaves (except) where
 the slave shall have. rendered the State some
 distinguished service."
 Now get this-The slave was guaranteed
 food, lodging, medical and old-age care, but
 the highest honor the State of Mississippi
 could offer a man for distinguished service
 was to set him free from this security.  The
 State's highest reward was to give a man
 the personal responsibility of looking after
 his own welfare.  Freedom to find his own
 job or to be a bum if he liked.
 Do you see why that's so important, just
 the right to be a bum?  And so the slaves
 eventually  found freedom to  earn money
 they could keep, to save for their own old age
 and then they weren't slaves any more.

 Let us, on the other hand, take the Amer-
 ican  Indians.  These       we  made  wards  of
 Government. These we gave security. We
 took away their freedom and gave them se-
 curity.  So they have become steadily less
 self-supporting.  I speak of the average, of
 cpurse, not the spectacular exception. In
 1862, most American Negroes were slaves.
 Look at the remarkable progress in just one
 lifetime later.  Today the average American
 Negro is self-supporting, self-respecting, and
 responsible.  Today  the  average American
 Government wears brass knuckles we're not
 trying to get you to fight for any other man's
 mansion.   We're  trying  to  protect  your
 equally important right to be a bum.
 Listen and remember.  The guaranteed
 gifts are just bait, nothing more.  They'll
 offer the rewards of 1864-a free meal, a free
 roof, a guaranteed job, and then-
 We're trapped into being somebody's slaves
 again.
 Indian, it is said, will actually die of starva--y
 tion unless he is fed by the Government.       5?
 So we have to hire 13,000 Federal employees 'Z?
 to take care of 380,000 reservation Indians.
 That's one Federal employee for every 30
 Indians.  This has nothing to do with the
 color of a man's skin or the shape of his
 cheekbones.   The Negro was free to work
 or loaf; to starve or to win a potfull.  The
 Indian was secure.  There was no reason for
 him to educate himself or learn to man-
 age his own affairs or to be productive.                It's
 no fault of his; it's ours.  Just as it's going
 to be our fault, Joe and Lennie, our fault if
 we let them repeat this tragic error on us.
 Simply because some arrogant would-be
 masters are convinced that today's Americans
 are too  ignorant  or  too   worthless  to  be
 trusted with their own destiny.  They actu-
 ally think that we would literally starve in
 the streets unless the Government looked
 after our welfare.   Welfare!   Man, this is
 where we came in.    They're on the way to
 buying and selling us again!
 Now- maybe you see what :l started out to
 say.  You-you're a gaudy dancer, you're a
 hod carrier, a trolley pilot, or you take tickets
 at the ball park.  What have I got to lose,
 you say?  Why shouldn't I take their offer of
 free medicine, money for work I don't do or
 crops I dont' grow?  Why not?
 Here's why not, and don't ever forget this.
 "If' your Government is big enough to give
 you everything you want, it is big enough to
 take away from you everything you have."
 And don't tell me you've nothing to lose.
 That's what they thought In Britain, too.
 But already in Britain, elected leaders can
 force the citizen to work wherever the gov-
 ernment  decrees  they  are  most  needed.
 Force!
 In Russia, where this kind of security got a
 slight head start, they'll make him work-
 If necessary in leg irons.
 You've nothing to lose, you say, because
 you're a bum?  That, sir, Is a priceless privi-
 lege.            In Russia you would be whipped or
 shot for it.  It is your American right to be
 a bum.  That is part of being free.
 So for Heaven's sake don't let then peddle
 this absurd security idea as something new.
 It was written into the Code of Hammurabi
 over 4,000 years ago.  The Romans called it
 "bread and circuses" to keep the crowd paci-
 fied while their sons died.
 Karl Marx called it "socialism."  It's where
 the state makes laws for your own good
 whether you like them or not.  And Russia
 will imprison those who object.
 It can't happen here?
 Wait a minute, mister-it has happened
 here.  Don't tell me you're still 100-percent
 free or I'll tell you about the owner of a
 small battery shop in Pennsylvania.
 They told him he had to kick in money
 for his own social security.  He didn't like
 the idea of being forced to buy insurance,
 and resisted.  The State confiscated his prop-
 erty.
 Still he refused to obey.
 So the State preferred criminal charges
 against him.   And the Government gave him
 the choice of conforming or going to prison.
 An enemy of the State because he had re-
 fused to pay social security.  He paid.  His
 6-month prison sentence was suspended.
 From now on, Lennie and Joe, get this
 straight.  You do have plenty to lose. When-
 ever some of us try to warn you that big
 New Vietnam Blueprint
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GEORGE M. RHODES
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April L. 1965
 Mr. RHODES of Pennsylvania.  Mr.
 Speaker, an interesting editorial on the
 situation in Vietnam and southeast Asia
 was published in the Philadelphia Eve-
 ning Bulletin on April 11.
 Under leave to extend my remarks, I
 include this informative editorial:    -
 NEW VIETNAM BLUEPRINT
 (By Melvin K. Whiteleather)
 What Is your primary interest, to better
 the lot of the people or to make revolution
 for revolution's sake?
 This is the question President Johnson put
 to He Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese Com-
 munist boss, with last Wednesday's proposal
 to end the was in Vietnam and embark on
 an imaginative effort to lift up the whole of
 southeast Asia.
 U.S. effort to bring the struggle in Vietnam
 to a close has centered on Ho Chi Minh, rath--
 er than on Peiping or Moscow.  To bombing
 north of the 17th parallel is now brought
 the additional pressure of the cooperative
 scheme benefitting all of North Vietnam's
 neighbors.
 North Vietnam can be included if it is
 willing to stop attacking  South Vietnam.
 But if it doesn't, President Johnson gave
 emphatic  notification  that Ho  Chi  Minh
 stood to see his territory and people injured
 rather than improved.
 AN ALTERNATIVE TO WAR
 The United States no longer is just bomb-
 ing; it has put its weight behind a construc-
 tive plan and those around the world who
 have been calling for an alternative to de-
 struction, now have one.  There was wisdom
 in choosing the Mekong River development
 skeleton plan already in existence and in
 inviting U.N. Secretary General U Thant to
 take the initiative in getting the plan off the
 ground and expanding it. The 21 countries
 already contributing to  that  development
 plan  and  the  authority of  the  U.N.  are
 brought into a direct relationship to  the
 struggle in Vietnam.  Thus it is not just a
 raw U.S. "imperialist" plot.
 Except for countries with a revolutionary
 bias, this relationship should lean toward a
 settlement suitable to the Saigon govern-
 ment.  The 17 nonalined countries, led by
 Yugoslavia, which made a  plea for peace
 negotiations to all parties concerned, can
 hardly be opposed to a development scheme
 that would touch a whole section of Asia
 and 50 million persons.  The 17 need not ac-
 cept at 100 percent face value the claim that
 the Vietcong is a tool of Hanoi in order to
 press for a settlement of the struggle that
 would leave the Saigon government in con-
 trol of its own territory.
 PRESSURE PUT ON OTHERS
 The Johnson proposal definitely has put
 the pressure on the other side, relieving the
 United States of onus that had been building
 up over the bombing in North Vietnam.  Un-
 important as the whole affair was, there is
 no doubt that the use of nonlethal gas by
 the South Vietnamese army, supplied by us,
 sharpened world opinion against us. British
 Prime Minister Harold Wilson's path in de-
 fending our purposes and practices has now
 been eased and the critical Japanese have
 been given something else to think about.
 The President's proposal hit Red   China
 hard and Peiping is striking back with the
 full force of its propaganda machine. South-
 east Asia blooming under other than Chinese
 influence is the last thing Peiping wants to
 see happen.  The region is regarded as a Chi-
 nese preserve, and beyond that, for such a
 plan to get moving with U.S. dollars and
 moral backing would be a far cry from bring-
 ing U.S. imperialism to its knees, as Peiping
 says it must be brought.  For the United
 States to put the United Nations and a coop-
 erative plan to the forefront cuts straight
 across Communist propaganda.
 MOSCOW'S DILEMMA CONTINUES
 Peiping in its fury is losing sight of its
 only recent adoption of the Russian argu-
 ment that any settlement in Vietnam must
 be between the United States and the Viet-
 cong's political  arm, the National Libera-
 tion Movement.  It seems that after all, Red
 China does have a stake.
 M:r. Johnson has not eased Moscow's dilem-
 ma a bit.  On one hand the Russians might
 be pleased to see southeast Asia developed
 independent from China, and the President
 suggested that the Soviets should contribute
 to the scheme, but on the other hand there
 is the commitment to helping all revolutions.
 Russian irritation over its dilemma has been
 manifested the past few days by the worst
 cold war polemics that have been heard in
 the U.N. in a long time.  These took place in
 an obscure committee where ordinarily noth-
 ing ever happens.
 Peiping will do its utmost to prevent Ho
 Chi Minh from nibbling at the President's
 proposals.  No one expects Ho to run up
 a white flag in broad daylight, but he has
 been given an opportunity to work his way
 out of his box with a certain amount of face
 saving.
 The signals are still warning that a big
 attack on a Dien Bien Phu scale is in the
 making with the expectation that the South
 Vietnamese and Americans can be done in
 with one big swoop.  If this is tried and fails,
 Hanoi may be ready to listen to U Thant.

 Mr. TEAGUE of Texas,  Mr. Speaker,

 In this area, the achievements of whoever
 is first to accomplish a new feat in space
 will continue to attract major public at-
 tention.  But the real significance of this sec-

 much in short chronological gaps between the
 first and second achievements, but rather in
 the broad capability being developed and
 the speed and certainty with which it is ap-
 plied to specific operational tasks.  For ex-
 ample,  it  is  relatively  unimportant  that
 Cosmonaut Leonov did the first extrave-
 hicular, maneuver in space if a Gemini astro-
 naut expands this operational     technique
 within a few months.  Nor will the historic
 first maneuvers-both in changing orbits
 and changing orbital plane-of Gemini 3
 retain much significance if the Soviet Vosk-
 hod accomplishes these same feats later this
 year.  The interval between these two types
 of spacecraft demonstrating rendezvous and
 docking is not likely to be long or particu-
 larly significant.
 Although both  the United  States  and
 U.S.S.R. are committed to an attempt to
 land the first men on the moon, we believe
 that the most important aspect of this sec-
 ond phase of manned space flight, and of the
 third and operational phase that will cer-
 tainly follow, will be in near-earth orbits.
 With the heavy U.S. commitment of re-
 sources to the Apollo lunar landing mis-
 sion, it may appear to be both expedient
 and safe to defer the development-of earth-
 orbital operational capabilities until after
 the financial and technical peak loads of
 Apollo have passed. We think this procedure
 could be a dangerous mistake.
 The Soviets obviously have chosen the
 earth-orbital approach to their lunar land-
 ing  mission.   Therefore,  they  necessarily
 must develop rather fully their hardware
 and operational techniques In this area as a
 vital prelude to  their  lunar  landing at-
 tempts and not as a postlude, in the manner
 of current U.S._ planning. They also have
 t to conceal their primary
 made litt e l  atteni
 grasp.  National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
 ministration can contribute to this goal by
 pushing developmental  testing of  Gemini
 systems as a top priority.   The Air Force
 should be able to develop the required op-
 erational capability by pushing its military
 orbital laboratory program based on Gemini
 hardware as fast as technically feasible. But
 nothing can be achieved without some swift
 decisions in the Pentagon and White House
 on the course of a sound military space pro-
 gram.  The time is growing late.

 Mr. WHITE of Idaho.  Mr. Speaker,
 the farmers, businessmen, and commu-
 nity leaders in the First District of Idaho
 anxiously awaited the announcement of
 the agricultural message and recom-
 mendations of President Johnson. In the
 past years, they have been plunging
 deeper into debt, hoping for better pro-
 grams and prices.  Since the date of
 H.R. 7097's introduction, I have received
 -many letters about the wheat provisions
 of that bill, most of which could be called
 "less than enthusiastic". All are in ac-
 cord with the stated objective of putting
 farm income into balance with that of
 other industries, but many are skeptical

 A good analysis of the present provi-
 sions of the farm bill were made by a very
 highly regarded newspaper editor in my
 district.  Under unanimous consent I
 included it in the RECORD:
 [From the Lewiston (Idaho) Morning Trib-
 une, Apr. 7; 1965]
 MR. JOHNSON'S NEW FARM BILL
 President Johnson's first major farm bill
 presented  to Congress Monday offered no
 sweeping   changes  in  philosophy-simply
 higher support prices for wheat and rice, with
 citizens paying more of the costs in grocery
 bills rather than taxes.
 Despite prompt and vigorous criticism from
 the heads of two major farm organizations,
 the President's proposal is likely to be fairly
 popular with wheat and rice farmers.   It
 probably will be accepted without much com-
 plaint by most consumers-who tend to ob-
 ject more to taxes than to higher prices for
 goods.  And it will help ease the strain on
 the Federal budget, if Congress approves it-
 which seems likely for that reason alone, if
 no other.
 The new bill did not develop an earlier
 hint by the President that farm  legisla-
 tion might be offered which would empha-
 size benefits to small farmers, rather than
 across-the-board subsidies to small and large
 producers alike.
 Such an arrangement is economically feas-
 ible, perhaps under some variation of the
 controversial plan once presented by former
 Secretary of Agriculture Charles Brannan.
 That plan called for direct Federal subsidies
 to farmers proportioned on the basis of
 need, with consumers getting the benefit of
 lower costs of food products sold on an open,
 unsupported market.
 However, this approach probably is not
 politically feasible.  The "family-sized farm,"
 which for many years was the foundation of
 American agriculture, is fast becoming a rar-
 ity.  Farmers who work sections instead of
 acres also have their economic troubles these
 days-and vigorously insist upon their full
 share of any benefits provided by Govern-
 ment through direct subsidies or price sup-
 ports.
 Mr. Johnson's farm bill naturally did not
 satisfy the quarreling leaders of two of the
 Nation's big farm organizations.
 James G. Patton, president of the National
 Farmers Union, which generally represents
 small farmers looking to Government for aid,
 declared that "the major deficiency is the
 failure of the bill to provide the income that
 farm families and rural Americans need if
 they are to survive * * * It is high time
 that the direction of agricultural policies be
 given back to_the Department of Agriculture
 or to people with experience in farming."
 Charles B. Shuman, president of the Amer-
 ican Farm Bureau Federation, which gen-
 erally reflects the big-farmer view that the
 law of supply and demand should be allowed
 to function  in  agriculture,  whatever  the
 results to "submarginal" farmers was even

 A189.6.          Approved LFRV
 The President's bill, he said, was "a hoax
 designed to  trap  both farmers and  con-
 sumers."   The  proposals,  he  said,                 "would
 make farmers more dependent on Govern-
 ment 'subsidies for their livelihood, and at
 the same time raise the price of food to con-
 sumers, especially those with low incomes."
 The  gulf  between  these  spokesmen ob-
 viously is too great for any farm bill to bridge.
 One wants higher price supports or sub-
 sidies to insure the survival of small farmers,
 with taxpayers footing the bill.  The other
 wants an open market in agriculture without
 Federal subsidy and with many small farmers
 liquidated if necessary in a drastic "readjust-
 ment" based on survival of the fittest.
 Neither alternative is politically acceptable
 to most farmers or consumers.  As long as
 the wide gulf exists in farm opinion, any
 administration will be forced to seek some
 middle ground.  Despite his earlier hints, this
 is what the President did.
 Under the proposed bill, wheat grown for
 domestic use would be supported by Govern-
 ment at full parity prices-at about $2.50 a
 bushel instead  of the  present  $2.   Other-
 wheat grown within acreage allotments would
 be supported at about $1.25 per bushel-
 which is about the world price.
 The Government would eliminate present
 export subsidies on wheat to be sold abroad.
 It would require millers to pay $1.25 a bushel
 for domestic-use wheat, or 50 cents more
 than the present price.  Millers and bAkers
 would pass the extra cost on to consumers.
 While the price of wheat has had little
 relation to the price of bread in recent years,
 the change probably would increase bread
 prices about a penny a loaf. A similar pro-
 gram would increase retail prices of rice from
 5 to 7 cents a pound.
 Thus, the wheat and rice growers would
 earn substantially more. Consumers would
 pay more at the supermarkets.  The Federal
 Government would save some $200 million
 per year.
 Wheat and rice farmers might gain more
 than additional Income from the arrange-
 ment.  They might be exempted from some
 of the irate complaints from taxpayers about
 the cost of Federal price support programs-
 even though the taxpayers would be paying
 farmers more as consumers.
 The Federal Government would save sizable
 sums in an arrangement which once again
 illustrates Mr. Johnson's tendency to shift
 Federal expenditures from long-established
 agricultural programs to some of the newer,
 long-neglected problems of the Nation's pop-
 ulation centers and poverty pockets.
 The consumers would pay prices for wheat
 and rice which would be artifically high in
 terms of world markets, but still a bargain
 as compared with other products they buy.
 The new wheat-rice program proposed by
 the President isn't a dramatic new approach
 to the chronic problems of agriculture.  Per-
 haps no such approach is possible unless
 farmers unite behind common objectives or
 until population pressures or wider     world
 trade abolish the problem of crop surpluses.
 The new bill does seem to represent a po-
 litically shrewd innovation to offer some re-
 lief  to  wheat  and  rice  farmer-and                   the
 Federal Treasury-with  consumers       paying
 the bill in pennies instead of tax dollars.-

 A New Look at Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, in the April
 22, 1965, issue of the New York Review
 of Books, the Washington journalist, I. F.
 Stone, has written an incisive review of
 two new books on Vietnam: "The New
 Face of War" by Malcolm W. Browne,
 and "The Making of a Quagmire," by
 David Halberstam.  Mr. Stone's review
 is a welcome addition and insight into
 the complex problems facing this war-
 torn area.  I urge all my colleagues to
 read the following review:
 From the New York Review of Books,
 Apr. 22, 1965 1
 VIETNAM: AN EXERCISE IN SELF-DELUSION
 (By I. F. Stone)
 ("The New Face of War," by Malcolm W.
 Browne, Bobbs-Merrill, 284 pages, $5; "The
 Making of a Quagmire," by David Halber-
 stam, Random House, 312 pages, $4.95.)
 The morning I sat down to write this re-
 view, the Washington Post (March 25) car-
 ried the news that Malcolm W. Browne had
 been arrested and held for 2 hours by South
 Vietnamese Air Force officers at the big U.S.
 air and missile base at Da Nang.  The inci-
 dent is symbol and symptom of the steady
 degeneration in the conduct of the Vietna-
 mese war.  These two books by two newspa-
 permen who won Pulitzer Prizes last year for
 their coverage of the war, Browne for the
 Associated Press, David Halberstam for the
 New York Times, record the agony of trying
 to report the war truthfully against the op-
 position of the higher-ups, military and ci-
 vilian.  The books appear just as the war is
 entering a new stage when honest reporting
 is more essential than ever, but now restric-
 tion and censorship are applied to black it
 out.  Da Nang, the main base from which the
 was is being escalated to the north, was offi-
 cially declared "off limits" the day before
 Browne's arrest and newsmen were told they
 could not enter without a pass obtainable
 only  in  Saigon,  385  miles  to the  south.
 "Newsmen," the dispatch on Browne's arrest
 said, "doubted such a pass existed."   The in-
 cident occurred only a few days after the
 highest information officer at the Pentagon
 claimed that its policy on coverage of the
 war was "complete candor."
 What makes these books so timely, their
 message so urgent, is that they show the
 Vietnamese war in that aspect which Is most
 fundamental for our own people-as a chal-
 lenge to freedom of information and there-
 fore freedom of decision.  They appear at a
 time when all the errors on which they throw
 light are being intensified.  Instead of cor-
 recting policy in the light of the record, the
 light itself is being shut down.  Access to
 news sources in Vietnam and in Washington
 is being limited, censorship in the field is
 becoming more severe.   Diem is dead but
 what might be termed Diemism has become
 the basic policy of the American Government.
 For years our best advisers, military  and
 civilian, tried desperately to make him under-
 stand that the war was a political problem
 which could only be solved in South Viet-
 nam.  Three years ago the head of the U.S.
 mission spoke of the war as a battle for the
 "hearts and minds" of the people, and pri-
 marily the villagers, whose disaffection had
 made the rebellion possible against superior
 forces and equipment.  To win that battle
 it was then proposed to spend $200 million
 to bolster the Vietnamese economy and raise
 living  standards. Though  much  of  this
 money seems to have been frittered away,
 it was at least recognized that the military
 effort was only one aspect of the problem.
 Now we have adopted Diem's simple-minded
 theory that the war is merely a product of
 Communist inspiracy, that it is purely an
 invasion and not a rebellion or a civil war,
 and that all would be well-in Secretary
 Rusk's fatuous phrase-if only the North let
 Its neighbors alone.  This is the theory of the
 white paper and this is the excuse for bomb-
 ing North Vietnam.
 While the war expands, the theory on
 which it proceeds has narrowed.  Washing-
 ton's "party line" on the war has been shrunk
 to rid it of those annoying complexities im-
 posed by contact with reality.  The change
 becomes evident if one compares the white
 paper of 1965 with the blue book of 1961.
 The blue book was issued by the Kennedy
 administration to explain its decision to step
 up the scale of our aid and the number
 of our "military advisers" in South Vietnam.
 The white paper was issued by the John-
 son administration to prepare  the  public
 mind to accept its decision to bomb the
 north and risk a wider war. The change
 of policy required that rewriting of history
 we find so amusing when we watch it being
 done on the other side.
 Four years ago the blue book told us that
 the basic pattern of Vietcong activity was
 "not new, of course."  It said this followed
 the tactics applied and the theories worked
 out by Mao Tse-tung in China.  It said much
 the same methods were used "in Malaya, in
 Greece, in the Philippines, in Cuba, and in
 Laos."  If there  is  "anything  peculiar  to
 the Vietnam situation," the blue book said,
 "it is that the country is divided and one-
 half provides a safe sanctuary from which
 subversion in the other half is supported
 with both personnel and materiel."   This im-
 plied a conflict which was doubly a civil
 war, first between the two halves of a di-
 vided country and then between the Govern-
 ment and Communist-led guerrillas in one-
 half of that country.
 The white paper disagrees.   It abandons
 complexity to make possible simpleminded
 slogans and policy.  It declares the conflict
 "a new kind  of  war * * * a totally  new
 brand   of   aggression * * * not another
 Greece * * * not   another   Malaya * *
 not   another  Philippines * * *    Above
 all * * * not a spontaneous and local re-
 bellion against the established government."
 [Italic in the original.]   The "fundamental
 difference,"  the white paper says,    is that
 in Vietnam "a Communist government has
 set out deliberately to conquer a sovereign
 people in a neighboring state."   This im-
 plies that there is no popular discontent in
 the south to be allayed, no need to negotiate
 with the rebels.  The war is merely a case,
 of international aggression and the aggresor
 is to be punished by bombardment until he
 agrees to call off the invasion.  The rebellion
 can be shut off, all this implies, as if by
 spigot from Hanoi.   The truth about the
 war has been tailored to suit the Air Force
 faith in "victory by airpower."  This was
 Goldwater's  theory  and   this   has  become
 Johnson's policy.
 Browne's book sheds some sharp light on
 the white paper's thesis.  The white paper
 says the war is "inspired, directed, supplied
 and controlled" by Hanoi.  But Browne re-
 ports that "intelligence experts feel less than
 10 percent and probably more like 2 percent
 of the Vietcong's stock of modern weapons
 is Communist made."  He also reports that
 "only a small part of Vietcong increase in
 strength has resulted from infiltration  of
 North Vietnamese  Communist troops into
 South Vietnam."  An astringent examination
 of the white paper and its supporting appen-
 dixes will show that it really proves little
 more than this, despite the sweeping head-
 line impressions it was intended to generate.
 Browne also tells us that "Western intelli-
 gence experts believe the proportion of Com-
 munists (in the National Liberation Front)
 is probably extremely small."  He describes
 It as "a true 'front' organization appealing
 for the support of every social class."  Browne
 declares the front a "creature" of the Viet-
 namese Communist Party and says it has
 "strong but subtle ties" to the Hanoi regime.
 For  many  Vietnamese,  nevertheless       "the
 front is exactly what it purports to be-the
 people's struggle for independence."       This
 is what our best advisers tried to tell Diem.
 This is what our bureaucracy now refuses to
 see rather than admit past error and defeat,
 preferring to gamble on a wider war.

 The really terrible message in these books
 is not that the bureaucrats have tried to de-
 ceive the public but that they have insisted
 on deceiving themselves.  The Vietnamese
 war has been an exercise in self-delusion.
 David Halberstam tells us in "The Making of
 a Quagmire" that when the first Buddhist
 ,burned himself to death, Ngo Dinh Diem was
 convinced that this act had been staged by
 an American television team.  The Buddhist
 crisis, as Halberstam describes it, "was to
 encompass all the problems of the Govern-
 ment: Its inability to rule its own people;
 the failure of the . American mission -to in-
 fluence Diem. * * * Observing the Govern-
 ment during those 4 months was like watch-
 ing a government trying to commit suicide."
 The stubborn insistence of the South Viet-
 namese dictator on.insulating himself from
 reality spread into our own Government. The
 most important revelation these two books
 make is the unwillingness of the higher-ups
 in Saigon and Washington to hear the truth
 from their subordinates in the field.
 South Vietnam swarmed with spies, but
 apparently they were only listened to when
 they reported what their paymasters wanted
 to hear.  Ialberstam says that at one time
 Diem had  13  different secret police or-
 ganizations.                               Browne provides a vivid pic-
 ture of how our own intelligence agencies
 proliferated.  The CIA, Special Forces, the
 AID mission, the Army, the provost marshal,
 the Navy, and the U.S. Embassy each had its
 own operatives.  But they were not, in
 Browne'e words, "one big happy family." On
 the contrary they "very often closely con-
 cealed" their findings from other agencies
 "because of the danger that the competitors
 may pirate the material and report it to
 headquarters first, getting the credit."
 All this fierce application of free enter-
 prise, to the collection of information seems
 to have been of little use because of a top
 level political decision.  "Ever since Viet-
 namese independence" (i.e., 1954), Browne
 reveals, "American intelligence officials had
 relied on the Vietnamese intelligence system
 for, most of their information."  This was
 "because of Diem's touchiness about Ameri-
 can spooks wandering around on their own."
 In  the  interest  of  preserving harmony,
 "somehow the intelligence reports always
 had it that the war was going well." We
 circulated faithfully in orbit around our own
 satellite. Diem's men told him what he
 wanted to hear, and ours passed on what
 he wanted us to believe.  Halberstam eon-
 firms this.   In those final months before
 Diem's overthrow, "CIA agents were telling
 me that their superiors in Vietnam were
 still so optimistic that they were not taking
 the  turmoil  and unrest  very    seriously."
 John Richardson, then CIA chief in Viet-
 nam, displayed a kind of infatuation with
 Diem's brother Nhu and his wife.  Halber-
 stam describes a lunch with Richardson in
 1962, shortly after the New York Times sent
 him  to  Saigon,  in  which  the  CIA chief
 dismissed Nhu's notorious anti-American re-
 marks as simply those of "a proud Asian."
 As for the tigerish Mme. Nhu, Richardson
 thought her "sometimes a little emotional,
 ,but that was typical of women who entered
 politics-look at Mrs. Roosevelt."
 A persistent Panglossianism marked our
 entire bureaucracy up to and including the
 White House.  General Harkins, our military
 commander in South Vietnam, said "I am
 an optimist and I am not going to allow my
 staff to be pessimistic."  Halberstain de-
 scribes a briefing at his command post after
 the battle of Ap Bac in January 1963, the
 kind of set -piece battle for which our mili-
 tary had long hoped and which they first
 described as a victory though it turned out
 to be a disastrous defeat.  With "the gov-
 ernment troops so completely disorganized
 that they would not even carry out their own
 dead," "a province chief shelling his own
 men" and "the enemy long gone," General
 Nb    0?50024-7
 Harkins told the press a trap was about to be
 sprung on the enemy!
 The enemy was the press.  When the facts
 about Ap Bac could no longer be concealed,
 headquarters became angry "not with the
 system"  that  brought  defeat,  Halberstam
 writes, nor with the Vietnamese'commanders
 responsible for it "but with the American
 reporters who wrote about it."   Adm. Harry
 Felt, commander of all U.S. forces in the Pa-
 cific, gave classic expression to the bureau-
 cratic attitude toward the press when he was
 angered by a question from Browne.  "Why
 don't you get on the team?" the Admiral de-
 manded.
 When  Halberstam,  Browne,  and     Neil
 Sheehan; then with the UPI, visited the
 Mekong Delta in the summer of 1963 and
 saw for themselves the deterioration of the
 war, their reward for reporting it was a cam-
 paign of denigration.                                                                              Rusk criticized Hal-
 berstam at a press conference.   President
 Kennedy suggested to the publisher of the
 New York Times that Halberstam be trans-
 ferred to some other assignment, a suggestion
 Mr. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, to his credit,
 rejected.  The bureaucracy counter-attacked
 through Joe  Alsop,  who  insidiously com-
 pared the reporters on the scene to those who
 a generation earlier had called the Chinese
 Communists "agrarian reformers."  The New
 York Journal-American wrote that Halber-
 stam was soft on communism.  A friend in
 the State Department told Halberstam, "It's
 a damn good thing you never belonged to any
 left wing groups or anything like that be-
 cause they were really looking for stuff like
 that."   Victor Krulak, the Pentagon's top
 specialist on  guerrilla warfare,  was vehe-
 ment in his criticism of the press:
 "Richard  Tregaskis  and Maggie Higgins
 had found that the war was being won, but
 a bunch of young cubs who kept writing
 about the political side were defeatists."  The
 official attitude was epitomized by Lyndon
 Johnson, then Vice President, on his way
 back from Saigon in 1961.  He had laid the
 flattery on with a shovel, calling Diem "the
 Churchill of Asia." Halberstam reports that
 when a reporter on the plane tried to tell
 Johnson something of Diem's faults, Johnson
 responded, "Don't tell me about Diem.  He's
 all we've got out there."  A brink is a dan-
 gerous place on which to prefer not to see
 where you're going.
 The hostile attitude toward honest report-
 ing is made the more shocking because re-
 porters like Halberstam and Browne, as their
 conclusions reveal, were critics not of the
 war itself but only of the ineffective way in
 which  it was conducted.   The forces for
 which they spoke, the sources on which they
 depended, were not dissident Vietnamese but
 junior American officers. Their books dis-
 close little contact with the Vietnamese.  The
 battle between the press and the bureaucracy
 arose because the newspapermen refused to
 report that the war was being won, but there
 was not too much reporting of why it was
 being lost.
 For  Halberstam the war was  a  lark,  a
 wonderful assignment for a young reporter;
 his pages reflect his zest and, are full of
 graphic reportage, though also marked by
 some egregious errors, such as locating Dien-
 bienphu in Laos and attributing the origin
 of the agrovilles to the French whereas they
 really sprang from Nhu's mystical authori-
 tarianism.  For Browne the war was less ro-
 mantic.  The life of a wire service reporter on
 call 24 hours a day in so tense a situation is
 no picnic. His book is written in flat agency
 prose. Both men acquitted themselves hon-
 orably,  in the best tradition of American
 journalism, which is always to be skeptical
 of any official statement.  But both books
 are marked by that characteristic intentness
 on the moment; the idea that the past may
 help explain the present appears only rarely.
 There is no time for study, and American
 editors do not encourage that type of jour-
 nalism  in  depth  which  distinguishes  Le
 Monde or the Neue Zuricher Zeitung.
 This defect is most damaging in reporting
 on the origins of the revolt against Diem.
 The average American newspaper reader got
 the impression that this was brought about
 by  esoteric and  long-distance  means,  by
 Communist plotters activated from Hanoi
 to engage in that mysterious process re-
 ferred to in our press as "subversion."                                                                                                                                         This
 is the closest modern equivalent to witch-
 craft.  Halberstam's account of the origins
 is better than Browne's, but the real roots of
 discontent are touched on only peripherally.
 We get a glimpse of them in Halberstam's
 report that General Taylor after his first
 mission in 1960 recommended "broadening
 the base of the Government, taking non-Ngo
 anti-Communist elements into the Govern-
 ment; making the National Assembly more
 than a rubber stamp; easing some of the
 tight restrictions on the local press."  The
 prescription was for a little of that democ-
 racy we were supposed to be defending, but
 Diem would not take the medicine.        The
 accumulation of grievances, the establish-
 ment of concentration camps for political
 opponents of all kinds, the exploitation and
 abuse of the villages, the oppression of the
 intellectuals,   the   appeal   of   the  18
 notables in 1960, and the attempted military
 coup that year, "the longstanding abuses"
 which finally led to the revolt, are not
 spelled out as they should be 2 and would be
 if U.S. reporters had more contact with the
 Vietnamese.  In a flash of insight Halber-
 stam writes:
 "Also, though we knew more about Viet-
 nam and the aspiration's of the Vietnamese
 than most official Americans, we were to some
 degree limited by our nationality.  We were
 there, after all, to cover the war; this was our
 primary  focus  and  inevitably  we  judged
 events through the war's progress or lack
 of it.   We entered the pagodas only after
 the Buddhist crisis had broken out; we wrote
 of Nguyen Tuong Tam, the country's most
 distinguished writer and novelist, only after
 he had committed suicide-and then only
 because his death had political connotations;
 we were aware of the aspirations of the peas-
 ants because they were the barometer of the
 Government's failure and the war's progress,
 not because we were on the side of the popu-
 lation and against their rulers."
 This accounts for how poorly these re-
 porters understood the central problem of
 land reform, how few realized that from the
 standpoint of the peasants, particularly in
 the delta, Diem's land reform policy, like
 his hated "agrovilles" and our equally un-
 popular "strategic hamlets," seemed to be
 mechanisms  for reinstating the rights  of
 the landlords who had fled during the long
 war against the French.   Diem's downfall
 and the rebellion's success were largely due
 to the fact that he tried to. do what even the
 Bourbons in France  after the Revolution
 were too wise to attempt. He tried to turn
 back the clock of the revolutionary land
 seizures.  In the name of land reform, many
 peasants found themselves being asked to
 pay rent or compensation for land they had
 long considered their own.
 This lack of contact with the Vietnamese
 people and this fellow feeling for the junior
 officers who were sure they could win the war
 if only headquarters were different, also ac-
 counts for the weak way both books fizzle out
 when the authors try to supply some con-
 clusions.  Both oppose negotiation and neu-
 tralization.   Halberstam is indignant with
 the indifference to Vietnam he encountered
 I See the vivid account in his preface to           2 The best account is by the French his-
 JulesRoy's agonized and eloquent "The Bat-                                                                                                   torian, Philippe Devillers in "North Vietnam

 on his return home.  He believes Vietnam a
 legitimate part of our global commitment.
 He feels we cannot abandon our efforts to
 help these people no matter how ungrateful
 they may seem.  For the ungrateful major-
 ity, the American presence had only succeed-
 ed in polarizing the politics of the country
 between authoritarian Communists and au-
 thoritarian  anti-Communists;  the  former,
 at least, have the virtue of being supported
 by native forces.  The anti-Communist mi-
 nority was grateful, of course, and feared
 that with American withdrawal they would
 be treated as mercilessly by the National
 Liberation Front as Diem had treated veter-
 ans of Vietminh after 1954, although a spe-
 cific  provision  of  the  Geneva  agreement
 forbade persecution of those who had fought
 against the French.
 The files of the International Control Com-
 mission from 1955 onward were full of com-
 plaints that ex-Vietminh had been thrown
 into concentration camps or executed with-
 out charge or trial.  In any eventual settle-
 ment in Vietnam, the future of minorities
 must certainly be a matter for concern, but
 the notion that we have a mandate from
 Heaven to impose on an unwilling people
 what we think is good for `them will strike
 few Asians or Africans as an object lesson
 in  democracy.  Browne's  feeble ending  is
 even worse.  "Perhaps in the end," he writes,
 echoing the  cliches  of  the counterinsur-
 gency experts at Fort Bragg, "America will
 find it can put Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Giap
 to work for it, without embracing commu-
 nism  itself."                   This  was  the  delusion  of
 French military men like Colonel Lacheroy
 and Colonel Trinquier, who returned from
 Indochina thinking. they could apply Com-
 munist ideas in reverse to the pacification
 of Algeria.  When frustrated, they tried to
 turn  their  borrowed  techniques of  con-
 spiracy and assassination against De Gaulle
 and the French Republic.   To apply Com-
 munist                          methods in  reverse, the favorite
 formula of our counterinsuragency experts
 does not make them any less unpalatable or
 dangerous to a free society. The basic tactic
 confuses the effect with the cause.  To see
 wars of      liberation,  the  Pentagon's domi-
 nant nightmare, simply as a reflection of
 conspiracy, to overlook the social and eco-
 nomic roots which make them possible, to
 prescribe counterconspiracy as the cure, is
 not only likely to insure failure but it tends
 to shut off debate on peaceful alternatives.
 Here the growing tendency of the Johnson
 administration to make it seem disloyal to
 question the omnicompetence of the Pres-
 idency is reinforced by the natural tendency
 of the Pentagon to see doubts about resort
 to force as unpatriotic.  There is the danger
 here of a new McCarthyism as the adminis-
 tration and the military move toward wider
 war rather than admit earlier mistakes.

 in  the  Appendix,"  and  proceed  with  the
 printing of the RECORD.
 7. Thirty-day  limit.-The Public Printer
 shall   not publish  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD any speech or extension of remarks
 which has been withheld for a period ex-

 its printing was authorized: Provided, That
 at the expiration of each session of Congress
 the time limit herein fixed shall be 10 days,
 unless otherwise ordered by the committee.
 8. Corrections.-The permanent RECORD is
 made up for printing and binding 30 days
 after each daily publication is issued; there-
 fore all corrections must be sent to the Pub-
 lic Printer within that time: Provided, That
 upon the final adjournment of each session
 of Congress the time limit shall be 10 days,
 unless otherwise ordered by the committee:
 Provided further, That no Member of Con-
 gress shall be entitled to make more than

 substitutions. for correct material, or addi-
 tions of new subject matter.
 9. The Public Printer shall not publish in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the full report or
 print of any committee or subcommittee
 when said report or print has been previously
 printed.  This rule shall not be construed to
 apply to conference reports.
 10(a). Appendix to daily Record.-When
 either House has granted leave to print (1)
 a speech not delivered in either House, (2) a
 newspaper or magazine article, or  (3)  any
 other matter not germane to the proceed-
 ings, the same shall be published in the Ap-
 pendix. pendix.  This rule shall not apply to quota-
 tions which form part of a speech of a Mem-
 ber, or to an authorized extension of his` own
 remarks: Provided, That no address, speech,
 or article delivered or released subsequently
 to the sine die adjournment of a session of
 Congress may be printed in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.
 - 10(b). Makeup of the Appendix.-The Ap-
 pendix to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD shall be
 made up by successively taking first an ex-
 tension from the  copy  submitted by  the
 Official Reporters of one House and then an
 extension from the copy of the other House,
 so that Senate and House extensions appear
 alternately  as  far as possible throughout
 the Appendix.    The sequence for each House
 shall follow as closely as possible the order or
 arrangement in which the copy comes from
 the  Official  Reporters  of  the respective
 Houses.
 The Official Reporters of each House shall
 designate and distinctly mark the lead item
 among their extensions.   When both Houses
 are in session and submit extensions, the
 lead item shall be changed from one House
 to the other in alternate issues, with the in-
 dicated lead item of the other House appear-
 ing in second place.  When only one House
 is in session, the lead item shall be an ex-
 tension submitted by a Member of the House
 in session.
 This rule shall not apply to extensions
 withheld because of volume or equipment
 limitations, which shall be printed Immedi-
 ately following the lead items as indicated
 by the Official Reporters in the next issue of
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, nor to RECORDS
 printed after the sine die adjournment of the
 Congress.
 11. Estimate of cost.-No extraneous matter
 in excess of two pages in any one instance
 may be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
 by a Member under leave to print or to ex-
 tend his remarks unless the manuscript is
 accompanied by an estimate in writing from
 the Public Printer of the probable cost of
 publishing the same, which estimate of cost
 must be announced by the Member when
 such leave is requested; but this rule shall
 not apply to excerpts from letters, tele-
 grams, or articles presented in connection
 with a speech delivered in the course of de-
 bate or to communications from State legis-
 latures, addresses or articles by the President
 and the members of his Cabinet, the Vice
 President, or a Member of Congress.  For the
 purposes of this regulation, any one article
 printed in two or more parts, with or with-
 out individual headings, shall be considered
 as a single extension and the two-page rule
 shall apply.  The Public Printer or the Official
 Reporters of the House or Senate shall return
 to the Member of the respective House any
 matter  submitted  for  the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD  which is in contravention of this
 paragraph.
 12. Official Reporters-The Official Report-
 ers of each House shall indicate on the manu-
 script and prepare headings for all matter to
 be printed in the Appendix, and shall make

 HON. JONATHAN B. BINGHAM
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. BINGHAM,  Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to revise and-extend my remarks,
 I should like to call to the attention of
 my colleagues and readers of the CON-
 GRESSIONAL  RECORD generally two ex-
 cellent articles that appeared recently
 in the New York Herald Tribune, com-
 menting on President Johnson's great
 speech at Johns Hopkins University.
 The first, an editorial, very properly
 reJects the charge that the President was
 trying to "buy peace" with his advocacy
 of a vast development plan in south-
 east Asia. The second article, by David
 Lawrence, is ' the more remarkable be-
 cause it comes from a writer who has,
 to put it mildly, not always been in agree-
 merit with Democratic Presidents.
 I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the validity
 of the points made in these articles will
 be established by history, and that the
 President's address at Johns Hopkins
 University will go down as one of the
 most statesmanlike of our era.
 The articles follow:
 [From the New York Herald Tribune, Apr. 11,
 1965]
 DAMS-NOT DOLLARS
 The assertion by some Americans, in and
 out of Congress, that President Johnson was
 trying to buy peace with his advocacy of a
 vast development plan in southeast Asia is
 very wide of the mark.  Yet it is the familiar
 charge leveled at the foreign aid program.
 Because the programs are generally stated,
 for simplicity, in dollars, Congressmen and
 the public both tend to forget that what
 foreign aid means to the recipient is not
 dollars but dams-and roads, factories, har-
 bor works and irrigation projects.
 As President Johnson said: "The vast Me-
 kong River can provide food and water and
 power on a scale to dwarf even our own TVA."
 Studies and preparatory work for the plan
 have been underway for years, under the aus-
 pices of the U.N.  To complete so grandiose
 of scheme will, of course, require dollars-
 and, one may'hope, pounds, francs, marks
 and even rubles. It will also require peace,
 and a degree of political stability in an area
 running from Burma to the South China
 Sea.  But above all, it will require coopera-
 tion, among the nations of southeast Asia
 and among the industrialized countries that
 can give reality to the plan.
 It is this complex of needs, rather than
 any simple purchase of peace with dollars,
 that gives real meaning to the Mekong River
 project.  For by bringing many nations to-
 gether for the purpose of raising the living
 standards of millions of underprivileged hu-
 man beings the plan could accomplish much
 for the region and for the world.  It would
 help the Burmese, the Thais, the Laotians,
 Cambodians and Vietnamese in very practi-
 cal ways.  And by setting up an example of
 genuine international collaboration, it would
 reduce tensions and hold up common goals
 for them and for those who would supply
 the aid.  It is a great concept, difficult of
 achievement, certainly, but offering hopes
 far beyond any mere diplomatic horse trade.
 [From the New York Herald Tribune, Apr. 9,
 1965]
 THE PRESIDENT'S VIET SPEECH
 (By David Lawrence)
 WASHINGTON.-President  Johnson's  latest
 speech on the Vietnam situation is one of
 the best exposition of American foreign pol-
 icy that has been presented since the "cold
 war" began.   The advisers who helped to
 compose it also deserve credit because they
 acurately assembled the facts that make up
 the consensus of American thinking today.
 The President avoided the mistake made
 by the United Nations in Korea when consent
 was given to participate in a cease-fire which
 never was followed by the signing of a peace
 treaty.
 This time there is no self-imposed restric-
 tion upon the United States to withhold
 military action while peace talks are pro-
 ceeding.  The Communists cannot with im-
 punity, therefore, string out peace discus-
 sions year after year while at the same time
 conducting clandestine violations of a cease-
 fire agreement.
 So when Mr. Johnson declared that he
 would enter peace talks unconditionally, it
 means that the United States retains its free-
 dom of action and can punish the enemy
 and retaliate whenever there are aggressive
 acts.
 The key words in the President's speech
 are these: "We will not be defeated. We will
 not grow tired.  We will not withdraw, either
 openly or under the cloak of a meaningless
 agreement."
 A1879
 Having said this, however, the President
 made  a  constructive  suggestion along  an
 entirely different line when he called for
 an international program for development
 of southeast Asia, starting with a coopera-
 tive effort by the countries of that area.                                                                                                                                         He
 urged Secretary General Thant of the United
 Nations to use his prestige to initiate such
 a plan and invited "all other industrialized
 countries, including the Soviet Union," to
 become participants.  He added:  "For our
 part, I will ask the Congress to join in a bil-
 lion-dollar  American                                                                                                                                                  investment  in  this
 effort as soon as it is underway."
 This move has been wrongly interpreted
 by some as merely a kind of sop to those who
 have been criticizing the continuing of the
 war.  Its significance is deeper. This is the
 first time that the United States in recent
 years has publicly declared a policy that goes
 beyond governments and into the hearts and
 minds of the peoples themselves.
 Whether because of timidity or indiffer-
 ence, the United States has not carried on a
 campaign  directly  to  the  peoples  of  the
 Communist-dominated countries.    It has not
 endeavored to show them how much better
 off they would be if they had a free govern-
 ment.
 The President's speech doesn't necessarily
 imply that there is any intention to drive
 a  wedge between  the  peoples  and  their
 totalitarian governments.  But the United
 States, in its information programs overseas
 and in its policy speeches broadcast abroad,
 has too long neglected the importance of
 telling the peoples of the Communist and
 "neutralist" countries of the willingness of
 the American people to help them seek a
 life of individual opportunity and improved
 economic conditions.
 In countries where the hand of the op-
 pressor is stern there is no way to attain
 the kind of living conditions which prevail
 in the free countries except by the concerted
 will of a determined populace.,
 Too often the idea of revolution is scoffed
 at in the belief that armies are controlled
 by the dictators.  But, as was evidenced in
 1917 in the revolution against the czar, even
 the army participates in the revolt when pub-
 lic opinion definitely desires it.
 President Johnson rightly discussed the
 need in southeast Asia for homes for millions
 of impoverished people.  He said:
 "Each day these people rise at dawn and
 struggle through until the night to wrestle
 existence  from  the  soil.   They  are  often
 wracked by diseases, plagued by hunger, and
 death comes at the early age of 40.
 "Stability and peace do not come easily in
 such a land.  Neither independence nor hu-
 man dignity will be ever won, though, by
 arms alone.   It also requires the works of
 peace.
 "The American people have helped gener-
 ously in times past in these works, and now
 there must be a much more massive effort
 to improve the life of man in that conflict-
 torn corner of our world."
 This is a welcome note in the outline of
 American foreign policy.   It  needs  to  be
 followed up by radio and every other form
 of communication.  For history has proved
 that, if ideas are conveyed to a few, they
 spread to many by word of mouth, which
 indeed is the most effective form of com-
 munication in ' existence today.  The Com-
 munist governments will, of course, reject
 the proposal for economic aid, but the seed
 will have been planted among the people.
 The President wisely did not discuss de-
 tails.  But he made it clear that the United
 States  wants  peace-not  war.   He  also
 pledged American cooperation to achieve a
 better life not merely for the free peoples but
 for those whose rights have been so elegantly
 abused by their rulers.
 The speech was remarkable because of its
 forthrightness and its scope.  Sooner or later

 A Gratifying Example of Dedication by
 Another Peace Corps Member
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CHARLES S. JOELSON
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. JOELSON.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 pleased to insert in our RECORD the in-
 spiring story of another ambassador of
 good will in shirtsleeves.  The news
 item is from the Paterson Evening News
 of April 13, 1965, and  deals with a
 constituent of whom I am proud, Roy H.
 Elsenbroek, a member of the Peace
 Corps.
 The closing paragraphs of the article
 so ably written by Bert Nawyn were par-
 ticularly pertinent in the week before
 Good Friday and Easter, as they indi-
 cate the fact that religious principles
 can be translated into meaningful ac-
 tions.
 The article follows:
 (By Bert Nawyn)
 HAWTHORNE.-If anybody can change the
 American image abroad it will be Peace
 Corps members such as Roy H. Elsenbroek,
 who  returned  home  last week from  east
 Pakistan.
 Elsenbroek, a handsome young man of
 20 years, tells of his experiences in east
 Pakistan with enthusiasm changing into
 a somber mood as he reflects on the priva-
 tions of the population in that country.
 GRADUATE OF EASTERN CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
 ASSOCIATION
 Young Elsenbroek is the son of Mr. and
 Mrs. Henry Elsenbroek, 122 Westervelt Ave-
 nue, and a graduate of the Eastern Christian
 School Association.  He entered the Peace
 Corps on February 28, 1963, and ended his
 service 2 years later.
 Renewing acquaintances, he plans to be-
 come either a missionary to bring spiritual,
 moral, and physical assistance to deprived
 people or to enter the U.S. Foreign Service.
 Although they have the same government,
 East Pakistan is separated from West Pak-
 istan by over 1,000 miles.  In between them
 is India.
 PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS
 A comparatively small area, east Pakistan
 is about the size of the State of Minnesota.
 But there the similarity ends.  While Min-
 nesota has  a  population  of                  3.5  million
 persons, there are 57 million people crowded
 into east Pakistan, most of whom have no
 modern  conveniences, no telephones,      no
 television or radio, no sanitary conditions,
 people who live in villages and hunt leopards
 with bow and arrow when they prowl too
 close to the thatched huts.
 East Pakistan is on the Bay of Bengal.
 About  90  percent  of  the  population  are
 Moslems.   West Pakistan, where the Gov-
 ernment seat is located, is a modern area
 compared to east Pakistan, where in the
 larger cities the major products are burlap,
 jute, fertilizers, and tea crops.
 Young Elsenbroek had nothing but praise
 for the Peace Corps and what it is attempt-
 ing to accomplish.  He said "We came into
 the country, were welcomed by statesmen
 and high officials, and then took our place
 with the lowest class of people, to help them
 and show them how they could live a better
 life."
 Elsenbroek emphasized, "There are 7,000
 Peace Corps members from 18 years to grand-
 parents.  I met one man who was 76 years
 old, doing a good job.
 "The Peace Corps in such countries  as
 east  Pakistan  is  changing  the American
 image abroad.   We used to send tractors and
 equipment to people who are illiterate. Many
 times they were told that this equipment
 was the gift of a Communist country. Now,
 thesesame people find Americans willing to
 give of themselves to plan a better life. This
 impresses these people."
 Elsenbroek was accepted in the Peace Corps
 shortly after graduating from Eastern Chris-
 tian  High  School,  North  Haledon.                                                                  After
 a 4-day stay In New York City for orienta-
 tion, lectures, and instructions, he left with
 102 other volunteers for Camp Radley, Areci-
 bo, P.R.  Camp Radley was named after the
 first Peace Corps member who died abroad.
 SURVIVAL STUDY
 At Camp Radley, a month was spent in a
 rigid survival course which included rock
 climbing and instruction in survival methods.
 The main objective of the course was to
 strengthen physical, mental, and emotional
 resources upon which the Peace Corps mem-
 ber can draw to achieve the tasks which lie
 ahead.
 From Puerto Rico, Elsenbroek left with 48
 other   volunteers   for   Brattleboro,   Vt.,
 where a -course in "Experment in Interna-
 tional Living" was given.
 It was here that Elsenbroek learned to
 speak Bengali, the east Pakistan language.
 The program for that country was divided
 into nine parts, consisting of the language
 program, area studies, international affairs,
 communism,  American  studies,  technical
 skills, training, the psychology of effective
 functioning overseas, and  Peace    Corps
 orientation.
 At Brattleboro, 20 Peace Corps volunteers
 dropped out. Disqualification of volunteers
 went on during the entire training course,
 which lasted 240 hours.
 Elsenbroek left June 11, 1963, for a new
 life of service to others and adventure, arriv-
 ing at Dacca, in east Pakistan, on June 14.
 "It was like coming into a different world
 which could not be compared with anything
 in this country.  On a corner intersection
 was a man selling meat.  He had just slaugh-
 tered a cow in an open market and was
 slicing the meat as the people came up to
 to purchase a piece.  Millions of flies swarmed
 about.  The temperature was over 100? and
 the stench was sickening."
 SHORT LIFESPAN
 Elsenbroek said that because of the high
 mortality rate of infants the average life is
 from 28 to 35 years.  He remarked, "These
 people live on a daily menu of curry and rice.
 Vegetables are extremely hard to grow be-
 cause of flooded conditions and the extreme
 heat, which almost every day climbs up to
 120?."
 At Chittagong, where he spent most of his
 time, Elsenbroek worked with engineer Grant
 Wells, of Michigan.  While at Chittagong he
 received a citation from the Pakistan Gov-
 ernment for devising and erecting a cy-
 clone shelter.
 East Pakistan each year is devastated by
 cyclones, with thousands losing their lives.
 The two Peace Corps members built a 150
 person cyclone shelter which was approved
 by the government.  More are now being
 built.
 Peace  Corps members  in  east  Pakistan
 helped the natives build roads, schoolhouses,
 and other types of buildings. All these were
 constructed without modern machinery.
 For extracurricular activities, Elsenbroek
 started ball clubs with the children, with
 whom he soon became a favorite.  While in
 Jamalpur, he started a basketball team for
 the natives.
 What struck Elsenbroek as most impres-
 sive is that natives of east Pakistan are con-
 cerned  with  nothing but  eating,  sleeping
 and having children.
 NO TAXES
 He remarked, "People in the villages are
 not concerned over taxes because they don't
 pay any, they have no social life, no PTA's,
 no  television,  no  religious  organizations.
 They lead a very simple life,  one of the
 simplest in the world.    They don't complain,
 because they know of nothing better.     Chil-
 dren have wooden carved toys.                                                                                                                               This truly is
 primitive life."
 Peace Corps members are volunteers who
 are not paid for their tour of duty.   Accord-
 ing to Elsenbroek, some  are                                                                                                                                  disappointed
 when they arrive at their destination.      He
 said, "A few of those coming to east Pakistan
 took the next plane back to the States."
 Peace Corps members do not sign up for
 any specific length of time.  Neither does a
 stint in the Peace Corps exempt anyone for
 service in the Armed Forces.
 Elsenbroek said Saturday that he felt his
 Christian parental, church and school train-
 ing was largely responsible in his decision to
 devote 2 year of his life in the service of
 others.
 He concluded "Throughout the world, the
 American is pictured as being Interested in
 materialism and what he can get for himself.
 The Peace Corps shows the World that the
 American is willing to give himself so that
 persons in underdeveloped nations might
 have a better chance in life.
 When a Christian enters into this phase of
 activity, he has before him the sacrifice of
 one who gave His life on the cross of Calvary.
 This is why I want to continue in a life of
 service to others."
 Johnson Proposal for Peace in Southeast

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CARLTON R. SICKLES
 OF MARYLAND
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. SICKLES.                                        Mr. Speaker, on the
 editorial page of the Baltimore Sun this
 week, there was an interesting and il-
 luminating editorial regarding Commu-
 nist reaction to President Johnson's pro-
 posals for peace in southeast Asia. The
 text of the editorial follows:
 REJECTIONS
 The initial rejection by North Vietnam,
 Communist China, and the Soviet Union of
 President Johnson's proposals for peace in
 southeast Asia were about should have been
 expected.   They should not be allowed to
 rule out the possibility of peace discussions-
 but approached in a more roundabout way
 than a public acceptance of the President's
 proposition-nor should they be allowed to
 obscure the point that the President was
 moving in the right direction.
 Communist doctrine, in the capitals of the
 oddly matched triumvirate of North Vietnam,
 Red China and the Soviet Union, requires
 the  government  officials  to  pretend  that
 there  Is  no  North  Vietnamese   aggression
 against South Vietnam, and to claim that
 aggression is being committed by the United
 States in its effort to help South Vietnam to
 maintain its independence.  There is reason
 to believe that the real policy of each of these
 countries-policy that is affected by old na-

 tionalist concerns as well as by the present
 split between the Chinese and Russian Com-
 munists over the leadership of the Commu-
 nist Parties around the world-may impel
 each of them to a different approach to the
 possibility of ending the war in Vietnam.  It
 is possible that these differences will figure in
 the diplomatic explorations which will con-
 tinue.
 It must be kept in mind, too, that the Com-
 munist side will not give up its effort to over-
 run South Vietnam as long as there is a
 prospect that it will succeed and will not
 cost too much.  To suggest, as some have,
 that Mr. Johnson was trying to buy peace
 by his suggestion for a great economic de-
 velopment scheme,  Including  the Mekong
 River program, is to turn the facts upside
 down.  The President was suggesting that
 an investment in peace is better than an in-
 vestment in war, and that if peace is estab-
 lished all of southeast Asia, including North
 Vietnam, will benefit.  At the same time he
 was insisting that, while the door is open to
 peace discussions without preconditions, the
 United States intends to press its present
 military effort.  Nothing decisive is likely to
 happen  soon.     Patience  and  firmness  are
 essential.
 Pan American Day
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, April 14, 1965
 Mr. MAT$UNAGA.  Mr. Speaker, I
 rise in support of the resolution which
 designates this day, April 14,' 1965, as
 "Pan American Day."
 Today marks the 75th anniversary of
 the first Conference of American States
 which was held here in Washington and
 from which has developed the bulwark of
 democracy and freedom in our own
 hemisphere-the Organization of Amer-
 ican States.
 Throughout the long life of this orga-
 nization, which is the oldest of its kind
 in the field of international relations,
 we have seen the wisdom of its founders
 and the need for, its stated purposes.
 Among  the  essential  purposes  pro-
 claimed by the charter of the Organiza-
 tion of American States are two which
 are most familiar to us. These are, first
 that the Organization is to strengthen
 the peace and security of the continent,
 and, second, that it is to prevent possi-
 ble d'auses of difficulties and to insure
 the pacific settlement of disputes that
 may arise among the member states.
 In the, effective accomplishment of
 these purposes, this Organization of 21
 American Republics has in recent times
 presented a solid front against the en-
 roachment of any subversive political
 philosophy,  particularly  communism,
 which has threatened and continues to
 threaten its member states.
 Threats to our continental security
 and solidarity have taken other forms.
 The Cuban missile crisis and the situa-
 tion at Panama, of course, were epic
 examples.
 As we rededicate ourselves on this Pan
 American Day to the principles which
 affirm the necessity for peaceful, cooper-
 ative action through the Organization
 of American States, let us resolve to
 bring to the attention of each of its
 member states the need for legislation
 such as that which was recently con-
 sidered within these very Halls.  I refer
 to legislation which provides aid to edu-
 cation of children, born to poverty and
 which promotes the health and economic
 welfare of older persons.  It seems to
 me that this would advance in a mean-
 ingful way one of the least known pur-
 poses of the Organization of American
 States, and.that is, the member states
 shall "promote, by cooperative action,
 their economic, social, and cultural de-
 velopment."
 It is within the Pan American frame-
 work of peace, security and an en-
 lightened and healthy citizenry that the
 member states, individually and collec-
 tively, can continue to observe Pan
 American Day with ever-increasing sig-
 nificance.
 A Call to National Conscience
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MORRIS K. UDALL
 OF ARIZONA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, April 15, 1965
 Mr. UDALL.                               Mr. Speaker, on Jan-
 uary 25 and 26 of this year the city of
 Tucson, Ariz., was the scene of a National
 Conference on Poverty in the Southwest.
 Here, for the first time, we saw some of
 the extent of the poverty suffered by
 Mexican-Americans, Indians and other
 minority groups in the States comprising
 the Southwest.
 A number of participants in the. con-

 "A Call to National Conscience."  Be-
 cause  of  its  great  importance                                                                and
 relevance to our country's current anti-
 poverty program I want to call this re-
 port to the attention of my colleagues.
 Mr. Speaker, without objection I shall
 insert the report in the Appendix at this
 point:
 A CALL TO NATIONAL CONSCIENCE
 The undersigned were invited to sit as
 a "jury" while spokesmen for the poor and
 representatives of both private and public
 agencies aired their views on the causes of
 and cures for poverty in the vast area of the
 American Southwest.  The speakers had-as-
 sembled at the recent National Conference
 on Poverty in the Southwest-and their testi-
 mony dramatically underscored the delin-
 quency of leadership in and for this area.
 THE NATURE OF SOUTHWESTERN POVERTY
 We were convinced by the testimony pre-
 sented there that poverty in the Southwest
 has characteristics that are unique in the
 national American  scene.   The great dis-
 tances in the Southwest .and the economic
 expansion attendant on two decades of post-
 war  prosperity and  population  explosion
 mask poverty in the rural areas, in the cities,
 in the mountains, and in the desert. The
 economic expansion of these decades has
 given few benefits to the poor.  In New Mex-
 ico an Indian lives on a reservation on less
 than $400 a year, speaking little English,
 growing up in a culture that never developed
 concepts of competition, baffled by the white
 A1881
 man's world of aggression and materialism.
 In Texas a Mexican-American family of 12
 subsists on a diet consisting principally of
 beans and corn, trying to maintain a mar-
 ginal existence on the fringe of an affluent
 but hostile society.
 We were told of the poverty of hope for the
 white "Anglo" migrant farmworker who, sys-
 tematically and deliberately exploited by the
 big agricultural growers, ekes out a family
 existence on $1,100 a year.  He tries vainly
 to understand why a nation permits-in fact,
 invites-foreign laborers to compete under
 deliberately favored conditions.   California
 growers were described as consistently pre-
 ferring Mexican bracero labor.
 We heard of the poverty of education and
 opportunity haunting the  Arizona       Negro
 who assumed he was escaping discrimina-
 tion and inadequate schooling in the South-
 east, only to encounter them again under
 more hypocritical circumstances in an area
 which exhorts its citizens to "stand on their
 own two feet."
 Poverty in the Southwest is represented
 by   some  of the  Nation's  most  abysmal
 housing, and it is perpetuated by an educa-
 tional system that makes no provision for
 the special needs of its different ethnic
 populations.  For  in  the   Southwest, as
 elsewhere in the country, the most acutely
 impoverished  are  the ethnic  minorities.
 They include 3.5 million Spanish-surnamed
 people whose backgrounds may be a blend
 of  Indian,  Spanish,  Mexican,  and Latin-
 American origins;                                                                                                                                                  seeking  identity among
 the recently arrived "Anglos," these people
 find themselves regarded as aliens.  Of the
 area's 2.2 million Negroes, only those in
 California have found anything of the better
 life  they  sought when  leaving  the  "old
 South,"  and even there this. "better life"
 consists largely of better ghettoes and slowly
 improving education for equal job oppor-
 tunities.                                                                                                                                                    The   Southwest  includes  some
 200,000 Indians of varied tribes, nations, and
 reservations who are shuttled back and forth
 from rural to urban life by a confusing series
 of Federal policies.
 Several Southwestern cities have trebled
 in size in the historic population explosion
 of the past two decades.  But Southwestern
 civic and community leaders have ignored
 the fact that this population growth would
 necessitate  preventive action  against  the
 multiplying economic and social problems
 confronting the region.   And so the same
 civic leaders have neglected the aggressive
 social improvisations which the development
 of a modern, urbanized society makes im-
 perative.
 With the spread of technology and the
 growth of business and industry, the orig-
 inal occupant of the Southwest, still rooted
 in his native and different culture, has been
 completely left behind.  Educationally un-
 prepared for the technical complexity of mod-
 ern America, barred by racial, social, and eco-
 nomic discrimination from participation in
 the very society to which they belong, the
 poor of the Southwest remain overlooked,
 unwanted, and ignored-by the Southwest
 and by the Nation.
 THE ATTITUDES
 The testifiers at the conference in Tucson
 revealed conflicts, distrust, and intense com-
 petition  between  the  relatively  prepared
 "Anglos" on the one hand and the severally
 disadvantaged Indian, Negro, and Spanish-
 surnamed citizens on the other.  This situa-
 tion, aggravated by the widespread apathy
 of the responsible members of the power
 structure toward  the problem of  poverty,
 seems to us to portend serious social disor-
 ders in the future unless extensive social re-
 forms occur.  Here, in a five-State popula-
 tion of 30 million, are over 8 million living on
 annual family incomes of less than $3,000.

 tual distrusts of the minority groups have
 so far prevented the coalescence of thought
 and action necessary to force social reform.
 Apparently a Southwestern power elite of
 mining, oil, cattle, real estate, and agricul-
 tural interests tends to sweep social prob-
 lems  under  the rug.  Testimony indicates
 that the  weight  of  this  elite  is  arrayed
 against the economic and political weakness
 of minority groups and of the poor gen-
 erally.  The press, with certain exceptions,
 reflects the views of the elite and reinforces
 its dominance.   The press   also exhibits a
 persistent suspicion of social causes and the
 people involved in them, thus promoting a
 regional antagonism to coordinated family
 assistance, suspicion of private philanthropy
 for social causes, and resistance to public
 planning.  It proclaims that social planning
 properly resides in the private sector, but it
 supports only minor endeavors by private
 agencies.  These factors may account for the
 apparent indifference of private agency di-
 rectors  toward  much-needed  private  and
 public social reforms. They may also ac-
 count for the  fact that welfare adminis-
 trators seem to thwart the will of the Con-
 gress and of the Nation through welfare pol-
 icies that, even charitably, can only be de-
 scribed as inhuman.
 REGIONAL INFLUENCES
 Poverty         in  the  Southwest  differs from
 poverty in other parts of the Nation because
 the Southwest itself is different.          A major
 factor of this difference is the existence of a
 1,500-mile        border   shared  with  a  nation
 whose, economic standards are 30 years be-
 hind ours--a border far more open than most
 Americans realize.         As many as 3,000 immi-
 grants per month enter to become perma-
 nent residents.  More than 30,000 commuters
 swarm across the border on a regular basis
 to work at wages which, while substandard
 for the United States, make them compara-
 tively well paid residents of Mexico.  Many
 employers, particularly agricultural grow-
 ers,  profit  handsomely  from  this cheap
 source of labor.   This foreign labor force,
 willing to work at 60 to 90 cents an hour,
 depresses the southwestern economy which
 is already suffering from growing automation
 and excess job applicants.
 The relative openness of the border has
 created another  problem-that  of "semi-
 citizens," Mexicans who have lived in the
 Southwestern States, particularly Texas, for
 decades.  For various reasons they have not
 become citizens. Many of them have now
 lost track of the personal papers or witnesses
 who could establish the vital statistics pre-
 requisite for citizenship applications.  Many
 are old and incredibly poor.  Lacking citizen-
 ship, they are ineligible for most public wel-
 fare or any kind of assistance except charity.
 They have no homes to return to In Mexico;
 in this country their lot is a form of aged
 peonage.
 We come then to some suggestions, both
 general and specific, for attacking poverty in
 the Southwest.  National attention to this
 region is obviously overdue.
 SUGGESTIONS
 First, the openness of our international
 border must be reviewed.   Steps must be
 taken to regulate and reduce the flow of
 "border commuters."  Congress must enact
 appropriate legislation and the State Depart-
 ment must effect international wage, agree-
 ments with Mexico.  The Labor Department
 needs its administrative hand strengthened
 so that it can halt commuters when there is
 a  demonstrably  adverse  affect  on   the
 U.S. labor force. State-and, where neces-
 sary, Federal-legislation is needed to apply
 fair  labor  standards  to  the  international
 worker as well as our own citizen. For pov-
 erty in the Southwest cannot be separated
 from poverty  in Mexico while the inter-
 national border reniains no more than an
 inconvenience to commuters.  The problem
 is international in scope and should be ap-
 proached internationally, even to the extent
 of contemplating some kind of specific joint
 Mexico-United States aid to northern Mexico
 and establishing a minimum wage to the
 Mexican  citizens' service  here.          It  is  not
 enough to treat the symptoms.  We must en-
 deavor also to cure or at least ameliorate
 the sickness, which, in this case, Is the per-
 petual depression that exists in the north of
 Mexico  and  spreads  into    our  vulnerable
 Southwest.
 We     urge  that  public  welfare  agencies,
 instead of wasting dollars trying to ferret out
 chiselers,  apply that energy and more     to
 rehabilitating the poor and reducing their
 dependency.   The Federal Government must
 insure that the will of Congress is honored,
 particularly in Texas and Arizona.
 We call upon the Southwestern agricul-
 tural States, notably California, Arizona, and
 Texas, to bring farmworkers under the pro-
 tective canopy of State labor laws.  These
 should include minimum wage laws; laws
 securing workers in their rights to organize;
 laws against discrimination and the like.
 We urge grower participation in conquer-
 ing the age-old problems of seasonal crops
 and wages while laborers have year-round
 family needs.  We advocate total abandon-
 ment of the bracero immigrant labor con-
 cept.  We                                                                     request  an  interstate  study of
 education for those to whom English may
 be the foreign or second language.
 We appeal to the States of the Southwest
 to reduce the varying harsh residence re-
 quirements for old-age assistance eligibility
 and to  achieve some uniformity in their
 welfare and other assistance programs.
 Perhaps most important of all, we plead
 for a new regional attitude toward social
 programing not only for, but subject to the
 ideas of the less fortunate.  Perhaps a pri-
 vately funded regional entity should be cre-
 ated to give voice to the impoverished.  The
 various social agencies of the Southwest both
 public and private-agencies concerned with
 health, family planning, education, prepara-
 tion for  employment,  and               housing-must
 abandon their aloofness and yield a major
 portion of their planning and decisionmaking
 process to the disadvantaged themselves.
 United  funds, community councils,  and
 other similar organizations should concen-
 trate most of their time, funds and attention
 on the problems of the poor and, as they
 do so, involve these same poor at the highest
 levels of policymaking. We believe that a
 show of patience with the neophyte social
 planner from depressed areas will produce
 unheard-of dividends.  It is not now being
 done.
 Finally, there should be national respect
 for the  cultural' differences  of  the  great
 Southwest.  As one of the participants at the
 Tucson   poverty  conference    so  eloquently
 stated: "We have given too little awareness
 to the history of this land which has made
 us so affluent. In our haste we tend to equate
 material poverty with spiritual and cultural
 poverty * * *.  The 'Anglo' must realize that
 many who are poor in the Southwest have
 rich and priceless traditions-a cultural kind
 of affluence which we need badly to share.
 As we undertake to rid the Southwest of
 poverty * * * we'll be working in a land of
 great beauty among peoples of great beauty.
 We must be sure that our efforts in no way
 erode the great gifts of diversity which we
 enjoy here-diversity of language, art, dance,
 ceremony, religion.  And the 'Anglo' perhaps
 must learn better to place himself properly
 in the history of this region-the last to ar-
 rive here-in a sense, the newcomer.  We
 owe to ourselves the obligation not to try
 to overcome differences but to preserve and
 honor diversity. For the 'Anglo' affluence it-
 self badly needs the cultural enrichment of
 the ancient peoples of the Southwest."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. J. J. PICKLE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, April 14, 1965
 Mr. PICKLE.                                        Mr. Speaker, one of the
 most charming institutions of the Great
 Society is the incomparable Liz Car-
 penter.  The wife of newspaper corre-
 spondent Les Carpenter, and a former
 president of the Women's National Press
 Club, Liz Carpenter is a delightful and
 effective press expert for Mrs. Lyndon
 Johnson and for the White House in
 general.
 Few women in America have the
 genuine charm and spark which Liz
 possesses, and an article which appears
 in the New York Times, April 11, 1965,
 and is printed below is an indication of
 the  recognition  this  lady  so  justly
 deserves:
 FIRST LADY'S LADY BOSWELL
 (By Nan Robertson)
 (NOTE.-Nan Robertson is a member of
 the Times Washington bureau who regu-
 largly reports White House News.)
 WASHINGTON.-It was November 22, 1963,
 in  Dallas.    Elizabeth  Carpenter, executive
 assistant to Lyndon Baines  Johnson,  was
 riding in a black limousine from Parkland
 Memorial Hospital to Love Field.      Emerging
 from a daze of horror and shock, she re-
 calls:  "I was aware suddenly I was riding
 along with the Vice President.        I started
 scribbling what he might have to say when
 we got to Washington.  I gave it to him."
 President John Fitzgerald  Kennedy was
 dead. Mr. Johnson was about to take the
 oath of office as 36th President of the United
 States in a hushed, desperately hurried cere-
 mony inside a jet plane parked on a dirty
 runway.
 When  the  plane   reached  Washington,
 President  Johnson  read  the  brief  speech
 Mrs. Carpenter had drafted (This is a sad
 time for all people * * *.  I ask fpr your
 help-and God's"), then turned to her, "Liz,
 go with Lady Bird and be of any help to
 her  you   can,"  he said. He  left for  the
 White House.
 In the car on the way home to the Elms,
 the mansion the Johnsons had bought from
 Perle Mesta, the shaken First Lady asked
 her companion what to expect.  "There will
 be reporters there.  They'll want to know
 your reaction," Mrs. Carpenter said.
 "The way I feel about it?  It has all been
 a dreadful nightmare, but somehow we must
 find the strength to go on," Mrs. Johnson
 blurted out.
 "That is your statement," Mrs. Carpenter
 said.
