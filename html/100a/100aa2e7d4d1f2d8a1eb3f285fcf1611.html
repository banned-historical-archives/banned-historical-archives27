 FAR EAST
 Indochina: Vietnam-And Then There Were Seven
 The Viet Cong's Madame Binh last week
 issued yet another Communist proposal for a
 Vietnam settlement. Her seven-point statement
 softens the Communist position on POW release
 but retains and amplifies a very tough line on US
 disengagement  from the war.  In addition,  it
 clothes Hanoi's political demands in language that
 is both, less precise and more attractive than ear-
 lier formulations. The whole tone of the state-
 ment is conciliatory, and Communist spokesmen
 have carefully left the impression that there is a
 good deal of room in it for negotiation.
 The seven points state that if the US sets a
 "terminal date for the withdrawal from South
 Vietnam in 1971 of the totality of US forces"
 and those of its allies, the Communists and the
 allies will immediately work out arrangements to
 ensure the safety of the withdrawing troops and
 to release the soldiers and civilians "of all parties"
 held in captivity. Prisoner release, the statement
 says, will begin and end on the same dates as the
 US withdrawal.
 The formula on prisoner release is new; up
 to now the Communists have said only that the
 POW issue will be "discussed" when the US sets a
 withdrawal date. By including for the first time
 civilian as well as military prisoners, however, the
 Communists are opening the whole thorny prob-
 lem of the Communist civilian cadre who are now
 held by Saigon. More importantly, despite all the
 conciliatory language, the demand that US mili-
 tary  disengagement  be  total-including  non-
 combatants, equipment, and bases as well as
 combat troops-is as firm as ever.
 On the political side, the Communists have
 reverted to vague generalities reminiscent of their
 ten points of 1969; more recently, in the eight
 points issued  last September, they have been
 more specific in their demands. The eight points
 contained an elaborate scenario  involving the
 ousting of the present Saigon regime, the forma-
 tion of a new non-Communist "'administration,"
 and the establishment of a temporary coalition
 government on the basis of negotiations between
 this "administration" and the Communists.
 The scenario is the same in the new state-
 ment except that the demand for a coalition
 government has been replaced with a fuzzier call
 for a broad "government of national concord."
 Furthermore, only President Thieu is named in
 the seven points as an unacceptable leader in
 Hanoi's eyes; earlier statements had included Vice
 President Ky and Prime Minister Khiem as well.
 The seven points do refer to earlier demands
 that the "government of national concord" have
 "three segments," including what Hanoi considers
 right-thinking individuals from the present Saigon
 government and from the Communists' provi-
 sional government as well as "peace-loving" peo-
 ple who presently belong to neither. Even this
 proposal is less specific than before, however, and
 the Communists seem to be trying to leave the
 impression that the form of government, and per-
 haps its substance as well, is negotiable.
 Poking the Ant Hill, or Something More?
 There are some things that can be said with
 reasonable certainty about the purpose of the
 new proposal. It is fairly clear, for instance, that
 Hanoi thought a more forthcoming position on
 POWs, coupled with a restatement of the standard
 Communist demands for US military disengage-
 ment from Vietnam, would cause a good deal of
 difficulty for the US Government. The broader,
 less polemically phrased reformulation of Hanoi's
 political proposals no doubt was composed in
 hopes of encouraging antiwar sentiment in both
 South Vietnam and the US.

 More specifically, the seven points try to
 make the Communists appear more reasonable
 and conciliatory just at a time when election
 maneuvering in South Vietnam is becoming more
 intense. Although the Communists certainly do
 not intend to participate overtly in the elections,
 they may calculate that by cultivating a less in-
 transigent image they can help antigovernment,
 antiwar candidates in both the legislative and the
 presidential elections.
 But there are signs that Hanoi is looking for
 something more. The renewed vagueness of the
 political proposals, the very comprehensiveness of
 the changes they contain, and perhaps most sig-
 nificantly the fact that Le Duc Tho of the North
 Vietnamese party politburo is back in Paris after
 an absence of over a year, all suggest that the
 seven points were framed so as to interest the US
 in exploring them further.  Hanoi presumably
 would be most eager to ascertain whether Wash-
 ington is any less adamant in its refusal to talk
 with Hanoi about a political settlement in South
 Vietnam.  The Communists may consider this
 something of a long shot, but there do seem to be
 hints that Hanoi has something more in mind
 than simply causing trouble. for the administra-
 tions in Saigon and Washington.  .
 Prompt Peking Endorsement
 Peking quickly took steps to dramatize its
 close support of Hanoi's latest move in Paris. In
 an editorial in the authoritative People's Daily on
 3 July, the Chinese fully endorsed the Vietnamese
 Communist seven-point proposal as the "correct
 way for the peaceful settlement 'of the Vietnam
 question." Peking's prompt reaction to the Viet-
 namese proposal is unprecedented and suggests
 that Hanoi, coordinated its new move with Peking.
 The Chinese waited five months before acknowl-
 edging the ten-point plan advanced by the Viet-
 namese in May 1969 and delayed for three
 months their. endorsement of the. Communists'
 eight-point plan of September 1970.
 Page  2
 Also last weekend, the Chinese signed the
 second supplemental military aid agreement of
 the year with the Vietnamese: under the agree-
 ment Peking will supply unspecified equipment
 and materials                  The normal mili-25xl
 tary aid pact for 1.971 was signed last October,
 and  the first supplementary agreement was
 reached in February. The signing of the latest
 protocol was accompanied by a warm, high-level
 reception in -Peking for the North Vietnamese
 military aid delegation.
 Moving Back from Cambodia?
 Bad weather restricted military activity this
 week in South Vietnam's northern provinces, but
 there were signs that the. Communists may be
 sending some military units back into the south-
 ern  part of South  Vietnam from Cambodia.
 Although there, have been no recent move-
 ments of elements of the Communists' 5th, 7th,
 and 9th divisions back into northern and western
 Military Region (MR) 3, there has been a spate of
 reports of the cross-border movement of small
 groups into the delta provinces of ?MR 4. Despite
 the blocking of many of the enemy's primary
 infiltration corridors by South Vietnamese forces,
 prisoner and defector reports have claimed that
 many company-sized or smaller enemy units have
 managed to slip across the border and into base
 camps within South Vietnam. Official figures
 place the total number of men who have moved
 into the U Minh Forest region in recent months at
 nearly 2,200, and others have undoubtedly
 moved undetected into the northern delta.
 Whether these recent, but fairly small, move-
 ments of men back into South Vietnam will be
 followed by larger numbers of troops remains to
 be seen. They could merely be part of an enemy
 effort to strengthen weakened forces in the south-
 ern part of South Vietnam. But the Communists
 maybe planning to intensify'their'war effort in
 the year ahead, and these moves could be in
 preparation for offensive operations beginning

 Vice President Ky this week became the first
 presidential contender in South Vietnam to an-
 nounce the choice of a running mate; southern
 Catholic politician Truong Vinh Le will join his
 ticket. Le, a chairman of the National Assembly
 under the Diem government in the early 1960s,
 narrowly missed election to the Senate last year
 as head of a government-backed list composed
 largely of Catholic moderates. Le's selection prob-
 ably will gain Ky some support from Catholics
 and splinter groups that otherwise would go to
 President Thieu.
 Ky himself apparently remains optimistic
 that he will be on the
 ballot
 Recent reports indicate the Viet Cong are
 working hard to strengthen their local cadre net-
 work\in South Vietnam's two southern military
 regions',,, perhaps with a view toward supporting a
 more ambitious military effort in the coming
 year. Resolution 10, issued by the Communists'
 southern c9mmand (COSVN) earlier this year,
 concentrated on improving the political arm of
 the Viet Cong in areas that now ar under govern-
 ment control.' The resolution directed that more
 legal cadre-agents with official government docu-
 mentation-must'be moved into these areas to live
 among the people and persupde them to oppose
 the government.
 In addition to.iricrepsing the number of legal
 agents, the Viet Cong Are closing out some of
 their ineffective administrative units and moving
 cadre to areas where th'ey can operate more suc-
 cessfully. A provinc9evel committee in Bien Hoa
 Province northeast Iof Saigon, for example, was
 deactivated in late1April and its cadre reassigned
 to understaffed units in neighboring provinces
 and districts. Inytthe delta, the Communists have
 been shoring up their local structure by forming
 units that caq,,' monitor the activities of several
 village  administrations  instead  of  relying  on
 separate organizations in each.
 The Communists also are attempting to im-
 prove cadre performance by reassi ning high-level
 cadre to lower level positions.
 MRs 3 and 4, district-level cadre
 have been sent down to village committees and
 party chapters to bolster cadre strength and im-
 prove local operations.      25x1
 The enemy's current emphasis on strength-
 enin~ the cadre network may be intended only to
 offset losses suffered at the hands of government
 security authorities and to meet the requirements
 of! carrying on the struggle over the long haul.

 Cambodia: The High Costs of War
 With monsoon rains helping to cool down
 Communist military activity throughout most of
 the country, the Lon Nol government has been
 left relatively free to wrestle with its mounting
 economic problems. The situation has just seemed
 to go from bad to worse, however, as inflation has
 greatly accelerated and confidence in the cur-
 rency has continued to plummet.
 Prices have skyrocketed in Phnom Penh as a
 result of increased military spending, depleted
 stocks of imported items, reduced shipments of
 food into the capital, and early indications of a
 poor rice crop next season. Beef and pork were
 selling at more than twice their normal prices, and
 the open-market price of rice, which had held
 steady since the war began, more than doubled in
 a matter of days and has not fallen appreciably
 despite government rationing at official prices.
 This week the government asked that assistance
 Page  4
 under the PL-480 program be expanded to in-
 clude rice.
 The black-market value of the net has also
 depreciated drastically. The price of a US dollar
 in Phnom Penh, which was 250 riels on 21 June,
 had zoomed to 350 riels in early July. The rea-
 sons for this fluctuation were not entirely clear,
 although the psychological effect of the shortage
 of rice in the city probably contributed to it. It is
 also likely that the further flight of capital from
 the  economically  important Overseas Chinese
 business community influenced the riel's plunge.
 To ease the rice crisis, the government has
 inaugurated daily military-escorted truck convoys
 to move rice from well-stocked granaries in Bat-
 tambang Province to Phnom Penh via Route 5.
 The first such convoy of 62 trucks returned safely
 to the Cambodian capital on 4 July. Tkegov-
 e   eat-official in charge -of-this-agr-iculturaJ
 shuttle-service>ias= indicated. that it will take from
 80 to 100 truckloads per day to meet Phnom
 Penh's estimated daily rice requirements of 600
 tons.  Security  arrangements  call  for  a  full
 company of Cambodian soldiers to accompany
 each convoy, and air cover will be requested. The
 government apparently will have to move more
 than 600 tons of rice per day from Battambang in
 the next few weeks, however, if it hopes to in-
 fluence farmers' decisions about how much rice
 to plant for the 1972 crop.
 Some  recent  developments  appear  to
 brighten Phnom Penh's prospects for eventually
 restoring public confidence in the country's war-
 ravaged  economy.  Cambodia's  leadership                                                                        has
 finally accepted in principle all of the sweeping
 fiscal and monetary reforms recommended by the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March.
 The first shipment of PL-480 agricultural com-
 modities has arrived in Phnom Penh, and after
 extended delays, the US aid program is beginning
 to gather momentum.
 A multilateral exchange support fund pro-
 posed by the IMF-if established-would help

 stabilize the exchange market and give Cambodia
 a powerful instrument against inflation. The Cam-
 bodians made their first pitch for foreign-ex-
 change contributions to the fund to US, Aus-
 tralian,  South  Korean,  British, Japanese, and
 Chinese Nationalist representatives at a meeting in
 Phnom Penh on 5 July. France, which was not
 represented at the meeting, apparently will also
 be asked to participate.
 To help condition the people and the ob-
 streperous National Assembly to its proposed pro-
 gram of "economic mobilization"-which consists
 chiefly of the IMF's suggested reforms-Lon Nol
 addressed the nation and warned of further belt-
 tightening ahead. The assembly responded by
 refusing to pass the highest budget in the coun-
 try's history and sent it instead to a special com-
 mittee for reconsideration.
 The government has retained the military
 initiative  and  continues  to  make  substantial
 progress. On 2 July irregular units seized high-
 ground positions overlooking the northwestern
 portion of the Plaine, and smaller units continue
 search-and-destroy operations over most of the
 Plairle, except in the northeastern area around
 Khang Khay. They have encountered little enemy
 resistance and have located  numerous supply
 caches, while enjoying heavy air support through-
 out.
 Activity has remained relatively light in the

 Japan: Sato's Last Shuffle
 Prime Minister Sato once again demonstrated
 his unusual adroitness in manipulating top-level ap-
 pointments to further his goals. In his postelection
 cabinet reshuffle on 5 July, Sato accommodated
 the major powers in the party while strengthening
 the chances of Takeo Fukuda to succeed him as
 prime minister when his term ends next year.
 Sato installed ex - Finance Minister Fukuda as
 foreign minister, a post that will give him additional
 experience in international affairs prior to his bid
 for the prime ministership. Sato also named a top
 supporter of Fukuda to the key post of Liberal
 Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general, which
 largely controls distribution of party funds and
 appointments.
 At the same time, the prime minister did an
 expert job of accommodating the interests of the
 other major aspirants for the prime ministership.
 Kakuei Tanaka, a major contender who resigned
 last week as secretary general to take responsibility
 for the LDP's poor showing in the Upper House
 elections on 27 June was named to the Interna-
 tional  Trade Ministry. The ambitious Yasuhiro
 Nakasone left his post in the Defense Agency to
 become chairman of the LDP's executive board, a
 move that will enable him to broaden his base of
 party support for a future assault on the prime
 ministership. Nakasone's successor as defense chief,
 KeiKichi Masuhara, is a long-time defense expert
 whose more low-key approach to the job should
 provide less fuel for charges of "reviving Japanese
 militarism."
 In confronting one of the first major tasks
 facing the new cabinet, that of reducing strains in
 US-Japan  relations caused by economic issues,
 Sato's new appointees should be more effective
 than their predecessors. In particular, Fukuda and
 Tanaka, because of their political clout, are better
 equipped to bring reluctant bureaucrats into line on
 economic policy. It is possible, however, that the
 rivalry between these two prime ministerial aspir-
 ants will occasionally result in disagreement on
 major economic issues.
 This is almost certainly the last cabinet re-
 shuffle-before Sato steps down. The skillful cabinet
 shift apparently satisfies demands for "new blood"
 at the top level; these have been heard particularly
 from key business leaders alarmed by Communist
 gains in the recent elections. Sato's careful bal-
 ancing of party factions in this "lame duck" cabinet
 will also help considerably in preventing the suc-
 cession struggle from excessively undercutting his
 ability to make major policy decisions during his
 last year as prime minister.

 More Recrimination Than Rejoicing in Peking
 The  persistence  of deep-seated  divisions
 throughout the nation's leadership hierarchy was
 affirmed by the low-key celebration of the party's
 50th anniversary last week. Peking's major pro-
 nouncement marking the event failed even to hail
 the recent progress in reconstituting most of
 China's  provincial-level  party  committees,  a
 reticence reflecting not only the incompleteness
 of the tortuous process but also the broad dis-
 agreement it has engendered over personnel selec-
 tion and organization. Further, many of the party
 organs that have been established are as yet an
 uneasy amalgam of contrary political tendencies.
 The historic occasion also did not elicit a full
 leadership turnout, an extraordinary omission
 since there were indications that a major meeting
 of key central and provincial officials had been
 convened in Peking shortly in advance of the
 anniversary. The absence of public display further
 attests to the lack of cohesion within China's
 ruling politburo and more particularly to the con-
 tinuing uncertainty surrounding the political fu-
 tures of four of its ranking members.
 The official editorial commemorating the an-
 niversary was largely a panegyric to the correct-
 ness of Mao Tse-tung's "line," together with a
 recounting of the political sins of many of his
 earlier party opponents. The article, however, was
 remarkable for its cursory treatment of the
 achievements of the Cultural  Revolution. Al-
 though it did severely castigate deposed state
 chairman Liu Shao-chi-a must on almost any
 occasion- the editorial, in pointedly ignoring
 other opponents uncovered by Mao and his radi-
 cal lieutenants on the Cultural Revolution Group
 (CRG) during the 1966-68 period, declared flatly
 that "we will not go into detail about this revolu-
 tion."
 This gingerly approach clearly reflects the
 mounting political pressure over the past year on
 the former CRG leaders and on many of their
 ultraleftist proteges in the provinces; the current
 intensity of the factional and personal conflicts
 generated by this pressure, in fact, casts consider-
 able doubt on the ultimate outcome of the Cul-
 tural Revolution, and much of its history may
 even be in the process of being rewritten. The
 editorial's  condemnation  of  counterrevolu-
 tionaries who created chaos and sought personal
 power in the revolution, its call for exposing
 conspirators and renegades still in the party, its
 praise for the army's role in restoring order, and
 its heavy criticism of leftist deviations seem aimed
 at downgrading the radical ideologues who were
 the prime movers in the Cultural Revolution. In
 particular, the editorial's scoring of "sham Marx-
 ists" who pretended to be theoreticians "to bluff
 and hoodwink innocent people" appears to be a
 direct slam at long-absent politburo standing com-
 mittee member Chen Po-ta, the regime's leading
 theoretician and the former head of the CRG.
 The obvious antileftist bias of the anniver-
 sary  editorial,                                                                       an intensifyiing   nationwide
 crackdown on extremists, substantial erosion in
 the positions of revolutionary activists in many
 provincial  party  committees,  and  the  recent
 re-emergence  in  important party    positions of
 some prominent officials believed purged early in
 the Cultural Revolution, all appear to confirm a
 substantial swing  in  the  balance  within  the
 unsettled   politburo  in  favor  of a relatively
 moderate    grouping   of  leaders  that includes
 Premier Chou En-lai and some of the powerful
 central and regional military figures. Nevertheless,
 the questionable political status of two politburo
 members and a major military regional com-
 mander associated with the latter grouping, as
 well as continuing, if tenuous, indications that
 some elements in Peking are disszitisfied with the
 "conservative" cast of the emergent party ap-
 paratus,  suggests  that  important elements of
 China's complex  leadership  equation  remain
 unsolved and that it is still too soon to discount
 entirely the political  influence of the radical
 ideologues.

 Singapore's Economy Booming Despite British Withdrawal
 Singapore's economy  continues  to  grow
 rapidly despite the almost complete withdrawal
 of British defense. forces, which is scheduled for
 completion by the end of the year. Although the
 announcement in 1968 of the UK's withdrawal
 gave rise to dire predictions for Singapore's fu-
 ture, these proved unfounded as the growth rate
 continued to increase, reaching 15 percent last
 year. Fueled by private foreign investment, Singa-
 pore has been transformed in the last decade from
 an entrepot to a leading manufacturing center,
 and its attractiveness to foreign investors seems to
 be increasing. Because it produces for export and
 has become a regional center for marketing and
 other services,  Singapore's  economic  outlook
 appears bright.
 Although other sectors of the economy,
 such as tourism and banking, also experienced
 increases, more than half of the growth last year
 in Singapore's gross national product was due to
 increases in fixed capital formation, primarily in
 manufacturing. The growth in government reve-
 nues, in turn, was sufficient to cover the sharp
 increase in defense spending during the last fiscal
 year. No major tax increases are planned, al-
 though recently released figures show a more than
 50-percent increase in total projected defense
 spending during the current fiscal year.
 Singapore's main attractions to foreign in-
 vestors are its stable government, an efficient and
 honest civil service, tax and other economic
 incentives, a well-trained and disciplined labor
 force, and low wage rates. Unlike many of its
 Asian competitors, Singapore has managed to
 keep wage rates from rising faster than produc-
 tivity. Its success in.attracting foreign investment
 also has allowed the government to be selective in
 choosing  industries employing advanced tech-
 nology and offering training programs to local
 employees. As a result, Singapore's labor force is
 becoming one of the most highly skilled in South-
 east Asia; foreign manufacturers of electronic and
 optical goods, for example, established plants in
 Singapore last year.
 Oil  refining, Singapore's largest  industry,
 continues to grow rapidly. Refining capacity,
 which at almost 400,000 barrels per day is larger
 than that of any other nation- in Asia except for
 Japan, is scheduled to reach 825,000 barrels per
 day by the end of 1974. Foreign investment in
 refining, estimated at $250 million, equals invest-
 ment in all other manufacturing activities com-
 bined. More than two thirds of the foreign invest-
 ment in manufacturing already committed for the
 next four years, moreover, will go to expand oil
 refining facilities.
 Singapore has experienced some economic
 disappointments recently, however, especially the
 failure of a major US investor to participate in the
 aerospace industry, but another US firm and a
 British-Singapore company are proceeding with
 plans to convert the former British bases for aero-
 space purposes. Singapore is using the former
 bases that have already been turned over to build
 and repair ships as well as oil rigs.
 Despite government statements to encourage
 the use of Singapore shipyards by Soviet ships, it
 is unlikely that the USSR will allow its naval ships
 to be repaired and maintained in areas also serv-
 icing British naval vessels. Soviet merchant ships,
 however, have been using Singapore's yards for
 minor repairs for some time.  Moreover, two
 Soviet maritime teams that visited Singapore early
 this year recommended that Soviet merchant
 ships use Singapore's facilities for planned rather
 than for strictly emergency repairs. The expected
 increase in Soviet port calls will reflect the growth
 of commercial Soviet shipping in the area, due in
 part to the fact that Soviet ships charge less than

 Indonesian Government Wins Election
 The government  party,  Sekber Golkar,
 scored a sweeping victory in the parliamentary
 elections on 3 July. Although the final count will
 not be available for some weeks, government
 sources now claim that Golkar will surpass its
 own goal of 50 percent of the popular vote and
 will win close to 200 of the 360 elected parlia-
 mentary seats. These, with the 100 appointed
 members, will enable the army-controlled Suharto
 government to continue its priority program of
 economic improvement.
 Trailing Golkar at some distance is the tradi-
 tionalist Moslem party, Nahdatul Ulama (NU),
 which may win about 60 seats. Even further
 behind are the secular National Party (PNI) with
 perhaps 40 seats and the modernist Indonesian
 Moslem Party (PMI) with 25. Roughly five seats
 each may go to three minor parties-the Islamic
 Unity,  Catholic,  and  Christian  (Protestant)
 parties.
 Perhaps the most startling feature of the
 election returns so far is the stunning reverse
 suffered by the Indonesian National Party (PNI).
 Once the largest party in the country, the PNI has
 traditionally counted on its strength in the bu-
 reaucracy and its mass following in densely popu-
 lated East and Central Java. The bureaucracy,
 however, was pressed to register with Sekber
 Golkar, and the PNI suffered a series of diffi-
 culties, including a lack of funds, in organizing
 and implementing its campaign.
 Predictably, the government is being charged
 with vote manipulation, but the losing parties
 have no effective way to translate their frustra-
 tion into action, and no major protest is likely to
 develop. For the most part, the parties are react-
 ing to the election outcome with what appears to
 be stunned silence. Although it was obvious that
 the government's heavy-handed pressure tactics in
 favor of Golkar influenced many voters, the large
 vote total for Golkar indicates that the Indo-
 nesian people  have accepted Sul-iarto's policies
 and style.
 The government has regarded a successful
 election outcome as the first step toward restruc-
 turing the political party system and further de-
 emphasizing the traditional parties. Political stra-
 tegists apparently are thinking in terms of devel-
 oping a single mass party from Golkar, which
 itself is an army-affiliated coalition of social and
 occupational  groups.  This  nevi  organization
 would enlist support from all significant elements
 in Indonesian society and hopefully would bridge
 the societal cleavages that are emphasized by the
 present parties. The pace at which the govern-
 ment moves toward developing such an organiza-
 tion, however, depends on the amount of atten-
 tion it is willing to divert from its economic
 program to political action.
 The cabinet and presidency are not imme-
 diately affected by this election because under
 the Indonesian constitution the cabinet is respon-
 sible to the president and the president is elected
 by congress. The latter, a 920-seat body that
 formulates national policy, is indirectly affected
 inasmuch as parliament makes up half its mem-
 bership.

 Fits and Starts in the USSR's Japan Policy
 The USSR seems to be having considerable
 difficulty in  formulating  a  consistent policy
 toward Japan.    Increasingly  concerned about
 growing pressures in Tokyo for better relations
 with Communist China and desirous of counter-
 ing this trend, Moscow has in recent months used
 a variety of channels to impress upon the Japa-
 nese its desire for better relations. The Japanese,
 however, attach little urgency to improving ties
 with Moscow. There is little political capital to be
 made on this issue in Japan, while advocacy there
 of better ties with China creates a highly favor-
 able popular response.
 In late June, the Soviets sent an emissary to
 publicize Moscow's current "peace offensive" and
 to help improve the USSR's image in Japan. The
 visit, however, unhappily coincided with the sign-
 ing of the Okinawa reversion agreement, and the
 Japanese used the occasion to remind everyone of
 the USSR's failure to return the "Northern Ter-
 ritories." The USSR lost further ground when it
 postponed again, this time indefinitely, the an-
 nual USSR-Japan economic cooperation meeting
 on grounds it was not adequately prepared for the
 negotiations. The cancellation probably reflected
 SECRET
 Page  10   WEEKLY SUMMARY
 disagreement in Moscow over plans for Siberian
 development and the role to be granted the
 Japanese in it, as well as economic considerations
 such as the terms of financing.
 Despite the rapid growth of Soviet-Japanese
 trade (last year Japan moved ahead of the UK to
 become the USSR's most important trading part-
 ner in the free world), economic relations con-
 tinue to be hindered by the conflicting priorities
 both sides attach to them. Moscow is thinking
 about the long-term integrated development of its
 eastern areas, whereas the Japanese are interested
 in the short-term profitability of specific ven-
 tures. Despite years of negotiations, the Soviets
 have been unable or unwilling to agree to terms
 that would attract Japanese capital and technol-
 ogy in the volume the USSR professes to want.
 Only two major joint development projects
 have been concluded between the two countries.
 Under the terms of an agreement signed in 1968,
 the Japanese agreed to supply $133-million worth
 of bulldozers and timber-processing equipment in
 exchange for an equivalent amount of Soviet
 timber and wood products during 1969-73. The
 other project involves the Japanese in the devel-
 opment of the Soviet Pacific port of Vrangel
 under an $80-million credit. The Japanese see the
 latter agreement as being more important because
 it will help improve the economic infrastructure
 of the eastern USSR. The considerable potential
 for  Soviet-Japanese economic collaboration
 cannot be realized until Soviet port facilities and
 the underdeveloped transportation network in
 this area are improved significantly.

 EU ROPE:
 New Polish Plan Recognizes the Consumer
 The Gierek regime took another step toward
 fulfilling its promises to the Polish consumer at a
 recent central committee plenum called to amend
 the  1971-75  economic  plan  drafted  by the
 Gomulka government last year. Final approval of
 the new plan will take place during the sixth
 party congress at the turn of the year.
 At the plenum,  Premier Jaroszewicz dis-
 cussed certain of the newly established goals and
 stressed planned increases in the growth of con-
 sumption and real wages. Major provisions of the
 1971-75 plan compared with achievements in
 1966-70 are as follows:
 Growth (in percent-

 Production
 18-21
 9.2
 Per Capita Meat
 Consumption
 (in kgs.)
 7.6-8.6
 17-18
 37
 Analysis of these goals indicates the difficul-
 ties of making dramatic changes in a short period.
 Consumption, which has long been slowly declin-
 ing relative to national income, is scheduled to do
 no more than retain its share over the plan period.
 Even this may not be accomplished because of
 the tendency to underfulfill the consumption
 plan. Real wages are scheduled to increase twice
 as fast as during the previous period, but con-
 sumption per capita is planned to increase by
 only 31 percent compared with the 26 percent
 growth achieved in 1966-70.
 Given the magnitude of current housing
 shortages, scheduled increases in construction will
 not provide for a significant improvement over
 the goals in the original 1971-75 plan. Assuming
 the Gierek plan is fulfilled, the over-all gain to the
 average Pole will be only slightly better than that
 projected under Gomulka.
 There are, however, some bright spots in the
 plan for the consumer. Consumption of meat is
 planned to increase rapidly, and a quicker growth
 in social services (not counted in the figures above
 on consumption) is scheduled. Finally, some real-
 location of investment from heavy to light indus-
 try and agriculture may make possible greater
 consumption  increases in subsequent plan pe-
 riods.
 Economic results for five months of 1971
 demonstrate that the consumer is somewhat bet-
 ter off than previously and that the government
 has been able to start achieving some of its goals.
 Especially good results were realized in retail sales
 and in supplies of some foods, and agricultural
 production currently is described as favorable "on
 the whole." Some negative developments include
 above-plan investments and sporadic instances of
 inadequate supplies of meat, butter, and some
 light industrial products.

 thereby providing a legal basis for the political
 reforms. Appointments to the collective presi-
 dency, henceforth the supreme state policy-
 making authority, were completed smoothly
 before passage of the amendments. All that re-

 republican administrative offices and to elect,

 Dzemal Bijedic, a Bosnian Muslim, has been
 nominated prime minister of the Federal Execu-
 tive Council (FEC) and is now selecting a new
 cabinet. Although the new FEC will be only an
 administrative body with  no policy-making
 authority,  the cabinet appointments could
 become a contentious issue. The Croats, the most
 vocal of the nationalistic minorities, have already
 announced that they want to obtain influential
 positions in the state secretariats of foreign trade,
 foreign  relations,  and  internal  security.  The
 wavering in Belgrade over the total number of
 cabinet posts is one indication of the byplay of
 interrepublic interests over control of the ad-
 ministrative body.

 The basis for resolving the question of the
 vice-presidency is consistent with the thrust of
 the whole reform  program-to counterbalance
 republic and nationality interests at the federal
 level. Central to the success of this approach will
 be the balancing of Croat and Serb officials. The
 failure of the Serbs to nominate their strongest
 leaders to the collective presidency suggests they
 are shooting for higher posts, probably in the
 party. They have succeeded in placing Mijelko
 Todorovic as head of the National Assembly but
 they will not be satisfied with this post, if only
 because until now it has been largely ceremonial.
 The Croats, because of their recent nationalistic
 outbursts, are in a poor position to bargain but
 can  rightfully  expect  some high-level federal
 posts.

 Iran Prepares to Fill a Military Vacuum in the Persian Gulf
 A major expansion of the Iranian armed
 forces is continuing in anticipation of the British
 withdrawal from the Persian Gulf later this year.
 The Shah views the British departure as a develop-
 ment that will afford. Iran the opportunity to
 assume a pre-eminent role in the security of the
 Gulf area and he considers expansion of his mili-
 tary forces. essential to this new role.
 The air force recently received the first four
 of 32 late model Phantom fighter aircraft and
 further deliveries are scheduled at the rate of four
 per month.  Iran already has 31 earlier model
 Phantoms and 109 F-5 fighters. By the end of .~~
 1975, the Shah plans to have about 135 Phan:,`
 toms but anticipates no appreciable increase in
 the number of F-5s. The air force will also acquire
 additional reconnaissance and transport aircraft.
 The Iranians have been building three "new
 airfields on the Persian Gulf at Bandar Abbas,
 Bushire, and Jask. When the last one;is completed
 later this year, Iran will be capable of covering the
 entire  Persian and  Oman  Gulf,, areas.  Bandar
 Abbas also is the site of the new Iranian naval
 base on the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the
 Persian Gulf. The combination of a major new
 airfield and an important naval base there will
 strengthen Iran's ability to,control the mouth of a
 vital sea lane.
 To enhance the mobility and the military
 cargo and troop-carrying capabilities of all three
 armed services, Iran has ordered a wide variety of
 helicopters from Agusta of Italy-all of which are
 manufactured under license from US companies.
 The first group of an order of 16 Chinook
 medium transport helicopters already has been
 delivered to the air force and by the end of 1972
 Iran is to receive 55 light transport and 145
 utility helicopters. The/6nly helicopters now
 the Iranian inventory,,are 25 light transport types
 supplied by the US }Some of the new helicopters
 that are destined for the Iranian Navy reportedly
 will be stationed on the Persian Gulf to sup-
 plement the patrol activities of the navy's newly
 acquired hovercraft,.
 The navy has received from the UK eight
 10-ton' hovercraft capable of carrying 30 to 35
 combat-equipped troops at a cruising speed of 50
 knots. It also will receive four 50-ton hovercraft,
 which can transport 120 to 140 troops at 60
 knots. The Shah views these craft as vital to a
 fast-moving, flexible, and effective armed force in
 the Gulf and has had a special hovercraft base
 built on Khark Island in the northern Gulf. The
 navy also is scheduled to receive this year from
 the UK at least two of four new 1,200-ton frigates
 armed with Sea Cat SAMs.
 The Shah has; not neglected the army; he
 'recently purchased `about 300 Chieftain tanks
 from the UK to bolster the current inventory of
 about 850 US-manufactured tanks. Delivery of 36
 Chieftains will be made this year and the entire
 order is to be completed. early in 1975.
 Among the littoral states of the Gulf, Iran is
 in the best position to ;,establish military pri-
 macy-it has the largest, best equipped, and best
 trained army, navy, and air force. Only Iraq is
 capable of posing any serious threat to Iran. Many
 Iraqi troops, some formerly,;stationed in Jordan,
 are being redeployed to eastern and southern
 parts of Iraq, where military:,sk,irmishes between
 Baghdad and Tehran have been 'normal fare for
 the past several years. Despitelithe potential threat
 from Iraq, however, Iran could defeat any of the
 littoral  states,  individually  or  in combina-

 South Africa: Political Liberals Hope to Widen Constituency
 The Progressive Party-a small but vocal lib-
 eral voice in South Africa-has launched a vigor-
 ous campaign to attract young Afrikaners dis-
 satisfied with the ruling National Party. In pursuit
 of this goal, the party has changed its leadership
 and some of its policies, and is trying hard to
 change its image as well.
 Since the party's formation in 1960, it has
 concentrated on recruiting members from among
 the more liberal elements of the English-speaking
 community in urban areas. Party officials now
 sense a changing political climate in South Africa,
 with the two major parties no longer able to
 command the allegiances of the past, and the
 young, urban Afrikaner as an increasingly possible
 "swing" group in white politics.
 The Progressives' "new look" came out of
 their party congress in February 1971. The most
 significant change was the election of a dynamic
 and hard-working political activist, Colin Eglin, as
 the new chairman of the party. The youthful
 Eglin, the complete antithesis of his aging pred-
 ecessor, maintains extensive contacts in intel-
 lectual circles and youth groups.
 At the congress, the party membership also
 approved a major shift in policy-from outright
 opposition to qualified approval of the govern-
 ment's plan for developing African tribal home-
 lands (bantustans). The Progressives said in effect
 that if "development" of the African within an
 independent bantustan really means "improve-
 merit," then the government should get on with
 it. The rest of the platform remains essentially
 unchanged.  The  party advocates a nonracial,
 "qualified" franchise based on certain minimal
 standards of education or earnings. It seeks to
 promote  unity between Whites and Coloreds
 (people  of mixed  race)  as  well  as between
 Afrikaners and English speaking citizens, and to
 eliminate the more offensive aspects of apartheid.
 In their attempt to attract new adherents,
 the Progressives have held meetings and organized
 new chapters in several Afrikaner strongholds,
 and have appointed a number of young Afri-
 kaners as full-time party organizers. Moreover, the
 party may soon offer an important position to
 the recently resigned public relations officer of
 the National Party, who left because his liberal
 ideas clashed with the more conservative views of
 the party leadership.
 Despite these moves, the Progressives can
 still be expected to proceed cautiously because
 important  elements  within  the  party remain
 skeptical  about the new image. Moreover, al-
 though the new enthusiasm and dynamism will
 attract added membership to the ranks, the party
 drew only 50,000 votes in the last election and
 placed only one member in Parliament, so that it
 has a long way to go before it becomes a sig-
 nificant political force. Of more immediate im-
 portance, however, is the possibility that any
 successes may prove catalytic, speeding the intro-
 duction of policy changes in the two major politi-
 cal parties.

 Dominican Republic: A Plotter Is Exiled
 President Balaguer has been both criticized
 and commended for his handling of the case of
 former General Elias Wessin y Wessin, who arrived
 in Spain on 5 July after having been sentenced to
 exile for conspiring against the government.
 Several political figures, including Balaguer's
 first-term vice-president, Francisco Augusto Lora,
 and former president Juan Bosch, have publicly
 objected to the highhanded way in which Presi-
 dent Balaguer dealt with Wessin's self-proclaimed
 conspiracy against the government. Bosch termed
 the President's televised accusation against Wessin
 on 30 June a "grievous spectacle." He also ex-
 pressed alarm at the absence of protest from any
 member of the judicial branch of the government
 against the President's alleged usurpation of the
 judiciary's responsibility. The general reaction as
 reflected in the press, however, has dwelt almost
 entirely on the theme that coups cannot solve the
 country's problems and that constitutional gov-
 ernment, however imperfect, is infinitely prefera-
 ble to a government brought to power by vio-
 lence.
 Just what Wessin was trying to do and how
 far he had progressed are still unclear, although it
 seems generally accepted that a plot was afoot.
 The press, however, has shown little curiosity
 about details, possibly because almost no one but
 General Wessin himself believed that he could
 seriously threaten the government.

 The failure to establish clear-cut "rules of the
 game" by delineating mutual responsibilities of
 member states and foreign investors is considered
 a serious shortcoming from the investor's point of
 view. The code's actual impact on foreign invest-
 men,t probably will not be evident until a record

 likely that this goal will be realized in the near
 future. The code contains numerous inconsist-

 most of which remain to be clarified. Five articles
