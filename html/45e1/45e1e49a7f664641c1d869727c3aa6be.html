leaving the partnership and going to Dublin 
to live, with his family, a life devoted to the 
jobs that he knew needed urgently to be done. 
The pros may not have won out all at once, 
but in later years they did indeed carry the 
day.' 
Theash of so-called loyalty statutes of 
iikv, 
the 19 's, calling for, among other things, 
special ths for schoolteachers, awakened 
Grenville Clark to a new internal danger?
the subve lon of our historic freedoms un-
der the Bit of Rights by often sincere but 
misguided sti,perpatriots in legislative bodies, 
local, State, d National. Convinced that 
lawyers gener y and the American Bar As-
sociation in pa tinder should be vigilant in 
the protection o ndividual liberties, he pro-
posed the creatio of a bar committee at the 
national level to uard the Bill of Rights 
from trespasses of 11 kinds. He did this In 
an address tothe Nsau County (N.Y.) Bar 
Association on June fl, 1938. 
Arthur T. Vanclerbil then president of the 
American Bar Associat tip, read the account 
of the address in the le- York Times. At 
\ 
once he telephoned the s ker and told him 
that this idea of a bar c Mee charged 
With continuous concern ' out American 
freedoms and rights had occ ed to both of 
them independently. Vander t, who was 
soon to leave the American Ba ssociation 
presidency, arranged a meeting ltr himself 
and Clark with the incoming esident, 
Frank J. Hogan, who agreed to sue rt com-
mittee of 14 with Clark as Its ch man. 
Clark accepted on the condition that e be 
allowed to select members who believed tjth 
him in the mission of the committee. C k 
chose all the members except one, who w 
recommended by Hogan. That single excep 
tion was out of tune with the committee's 
purposes - and opposed its most important 
early decisions. But, on the whole, it was a 
remarkably unified committee of outstand-
ing lawyers from over the Nation, including, 
in addition to Clark's classmate, Lemann, 
such stanch supporters of civil liberty un-
der the Constitution. as Douglas Arent, 
Zechariah Chafee, Jr., George I. Haight, Ross 
L. Malone, Jr., and Charles P. Taft. 
As chairman, Grenville Clark moved 
promptly to make the new and in many ways 
surprising committee an effective force in 
American life as well as , within the bar. 
Careful plans were laid for the publication 
of a journal through which the work of the 
committee and the issues before it could be 
communicated to the bar and to the public. 
Named the Bill of Rights Review, this ex-
cellent publication first appeared In the sum-
mer of 1940. Sustained at the outset by a 
grant from the Carnegie Corp., it was pub-
lished by the committee with the chairman 
as one pro tem editor and Joseph Harrison 
as the other. As its reason for being, the 
Bill of Rights Review said both frankly and 
perceptively: 
... 
"A growing volume of cases in recent years 
has made it increasingly apparent that a dis-
tinct field of law?that of civil rights?is 
emerging and taking its place along with the 
older established fields and such newer fields 
as administrative law, labor law, and tax law. 
The subject often involves heated contro-
versy and is intrinsically of such importance 
that it requires a wise and balanced treat-
ment on the part of the ablest members of 
the bar. These can best help maintain the 
American system of free institutions by be-
ing guided by the letter and spirit of the 
law-of civil liberties rather than by their 
political or economic predilections. Such an 
approach to this all-important subject would 
be timely and might well become the orga-
nized bar's greatest contribution to the 
preservation_ of the American way." 
The Bill of Rights Review came out every 
quarter for several years. In that time it did 
Much to resist the war hysteria against those

harder, so was its opportunity the greater in 
awakening, at the very least, some members 
of the legal profession, educators and editors 
of newspapers and magazines to the increas-
ing assaults on the liberties of the individual 
citizen. It can only be regretted that this 
noble undertaking did not continue straight 
through the years. Nearly a quarter century 
later the Review's files are a collection of 
many of the finest editorials and articles ever 
written and published on American free-
doms. 
Even before it could issue volume 1. No. 1 
of the Bill of Rights Review, the committee 
went into action as friends of the court?in 
two eminent civil liberties oases. First it 
strongly opposed Mayor Frank Hague in his 
arbitrary and unconstitutional deportation 
of Norman Thomas, from Jersey City, where 
the Socialist leader was prevented from ad-
dressing a public meeting. In the Hague 
case the committee was resoundingly on the 
winning side. Then, after a year of study 
of the compulsory flag seine issue, the com-
mittee filed a brief, prepared by Clark and 
Chafe?, in opposition to the claims of the 
Minersville (Pa.) School District that it 
could, first, compel children to salute the 
flag as a condition to staying in school, and, 
second, that if pupils did not join in the 
compulsory flag salute the school board had 
the authority to suspend them. 
Two children in the school, Lillian Gobitis, 
aged 12, and her brother, William, aged 10, 
refused to take part in the daily salute. 
Their parents taught them that according 
to their religion (Jehovah's Witnesses) to 
salute the flag was to "bow down before a 
graven image." The committee's brief ar-
gued that to insist on the flag salute in 
hese circumstances amounted to an un-
llikristitutional infringement of religious lib-
e . Here the committee, in June 1940, lost 
8 1?temporarily. The majority opinion 
by classmate Frankfurter, then a 
new ice, was soon seriously weakened In 
the 5-t Handbills case also arising from 
the ac les of the Jehovah's Witnesses. 
In less th 3 years, the 8-to-1 decision in 
Minersville cool District V. Gobitis was re-
versed by th upreme Court in the 6-to-3 
decision in We irginia State Board of Edu-
cation v. Barna The brief of Clark and 
Chafe? and the t. of Rights Committee of 
the American Bar sociatIon had become 
the law of the land. 
Oddly enough it 
Clark to perform in 
tion very much like t 
him the Distinguished 
World War I. The con

through a national Selective Service 
But the Secretary of Viral', Harry H. 
ring, was opposed to conscription when 
United States itself was not at war. Clar 
solution to this first aspect of the proble 
was to work for a change at the Cabine 
level. He laid his plans carefully and deal 
quietly with men influential in Washington. 
When his movements were completed, Presi-
dent Roosevelt had, on June 20, 1940, re-
placed Woodring with the eminent Republi-
can, Henry L. Stimson, who had served as 
Secretary of War under President Taft and 
as Secretary of State under President Hoover. 
One of the conditions that Stimson had set 
as a basis for acceptance of the secretary-
ship (at the same time Republican Frank 
Knox became Secretary of the Navy) was 
that he have a free hand to work for Se-
lective Service. As in World War I, Clark 
took the cause to the public. He set up a 
program to inform the country as to the

Then he largely wrote the Selective Service 
Act which, alter amendment, passed the 
Senate, 2 to 1, and became law in Septem-
ber 1:940. In 1941 he answered Stimson's 
call for help, went to Washington and was 
in the War Secretary's office to write the 
declaration of war against Japan after the 
dastardly attack on Pearl Harbor. Citizen 
Clark had done it again. 
Yet he would probably say that vital 
though survival is, nothing he did in the two 
World Wars is as important as his efforts for 
world peace. He began to turn over thoughts 
about limited world government as long ago 
as the 1920's. In 1939, spurred by the pre-
carious state of global affairs, he wrote out 
his developing ideas in "A Federation of Free 
Peoples." With the Second World War sub-
stantially won by July 1944, Clark quit 
Washington and went back to Dublin to work 
on winning the peace. Secretary Stimson 
encouraged him to, raise his sights so as to 
devise a world constitution for the postwar 
era. 
The result was that he produced an outline 
for a world government to maintain peace 
which the Indiana Law Review published 
that same year with the significant title, "A 
New World Order?The American Lawyer's 
Role." In October 1945, he assembled the 
meeting known as the Dublin conference. At 
Clark's inspiration and with Supreme Court 
Justice Owen J. Roberts as chairman, a group 
of 40 distinguished citizens met in sight of 
old Monadnock to think together about the 
means for preventing the holocaust that 
could destroy civilization. Out of their de-
liberations came the Dublin declaration look-
ing to the formation of a world federal gov-
ernment. 
The essence of the Clark position on world 
peace is that as long as the nuclear arms 
race continues, the world lives with a loaded 
gun at its head. This, he submits, is not only 
dangerous to the point of foolhardiness but 
Intolerable. And so he is for world law, 
legislated by a world body and enforced by a 
world administration, with a world police 
force to keep international order. Any dis-
putes would be adjudicated or mediated by 
world courts and related tribunals. This 
comprehensive peacekeeping machinery 
would be supported by an adequate world 
revenue system. 
The United Nations is good so far as it 
goes, but as is evident from the Clark plan, 
it does not go far enough. And so Citizen 
Clark undertook to work out a detailed revi-
sion of the United Nations Charter with a 
view to provoking "the worldwide discussions 
which must precede the adoption of uni-
versal and complete disarmament and the 
establishment of truly effective institutions 
for the prevention of war." 
In the formulation of his plan's many 
details, he enlisted the help of Prof. Louis B. 
Sohn of the Harvard University Law School, 
whose field is international law. Their book, 
"World Peace Through World Law," was pub-
lished by the Harvard University Press in 
March 1958. The first edition was soon ex-
hausted and a revised edition came out in 
1960. It has been translated in whole or in 
part into at least a dozen languages, among 
hem Chinese and Russian, and serves as a 
is for genuine world peace and disarma-
m t talks wherever they are held. Then in 
ord to propose an alternative method he 
and ofessor Sohn published in 1962 a draft 
treat stablishing a World Disarmament and 
World velopment Organization within the 
framewO of the united Nations. The pur-
pose was create a compact but inclusive 
treaty texE,t which statesmen might start 
to work In a y sincere effort at drawing the 
teeth of war. 
/n recent months Grenville Clark has been 
studying the probable effect of disarmament 
on the world's population problem. One of 
the fruits in this area was a provocative 
article which he contributed in February

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE July 9 
1963, to a ser es n e Review. 
His encouraging expectatioris can be told 
from these hopeful words: "The release, 
through complete disarmament, of vast re-
sources to raise-living standards in the 'have-
not' areas of the world could bring about 
effective population control within a few 
decades." Those who strive for peace and 
those who strive for population control 
should, he wrote, "strike hands in a united 
effort for the preservation and welfare of 
mankind." 
How do fellow lawyers appraise the career 
of Grenville Clark? Judging by the widely 
criculated exchange of letters in 1949 on the 
issue of "Freedom at Harvard" between him, 
\ as a Harvard fellow, and Harvard law grad-
itiate Frank B. Ober, of Baltimore, there are 
those who find fault with parts of it?to say 
tile least. But then there are countless ?th-
eirs who regard the patient, far-seeing man 
With the square, strong jaw as among the 
glckies not only of their profession but of 
all erica. 
0 presenting Grenville Clark with th 
Am ican Bar Association's highest award, 
its'id medal for "conspicuous service to 
the c use of American jurisprudence," Presi-
dent oss Malone spoke for many lawyers, 
on A ust 27, 1959, at Miami Beach, when 
he sai quoting the citation: 
"Thr ugh his dedication to the discharge 
of the ublic responsibility of the bar dur-
ing a lo and distinguished professional ca-
reer, he rallied many others to that noble 
concept. He has helped keep freedom's flag 
flying, by his example has ever reminded 
his fell' lawyers of their duty to uphold 
liberty an to expand support for the rule of 
law." 
Yet mor than gold medals and citations 
he must ch ish the words of Secretary Stim-
son from handwritten letter sent after 
World War : 
"You bert nly should record your work. 
At almost e y critical period in our his-
tory which I remember, it was your saga-
city which di osed and pushed forward the 
best remedy, a you have not had a quarter 
of the recognirn for it which you should 
have had." 
Among those high place who have com-
mended Grenvill Clark's work is President 
Kennedy. Praisi him as a man alert, ,in 
both war and p ce, to vital needs, the 
President has wel said that "his example 
is one for which can all be grateful." 
But let Grenville lark speak for himself. 
His words come to from the spotlighted 
rostrum of the bar c vention where he has 
received the gold m 1, from the study in 
the Harvard law libra where he is hard at 
work, from the old f house on the moun-
tain slope in New Ham hire where he takes 
comfort from the seren y of the lake that 
greeted the pioneers two centuries ago. He 
says to us: 
"I hope that we may co*, staritly recall the 
words of Lincoln: 'As out case is new, so 
must we think anew and act anew.' For I 
wish that our thinking shall not be crip-
pled by timidity or undue regard for tradi-
tion, but shall be as imaginative and creative 
as the problem is vast and new. I further 
wish that we may resist any temptation to 
avoid the hardest problems. 
"I earnestly hope that we may have the 
Insight to perceive the uselessness of talking 
about any effective rule of law in world af-
fairs unless in addition to world tribunals 
we are prepared to accept world legislative 
and executive agencies equipped with ade-
quate authority to make the judgments of 
those tribunals surely enforcible. 
"In particular I hope that we will realize 
that nothing less will suffice than universal 
and complete, rather than partial, national 
disarmament, together with an adequate 
world police force. On no easier terms than 
these, I believe, can a world rule of law, how-
ever strictly limited to the prevention of War, 
become a reality. 
"Th problem of world peace under law 
is indee hard. But it is not insoluble and 
the goal i worth the effort. There is a tide 
in the aff s of men. It brings us now a 
supreme o ortunity and also imposes an 
urgent duty. If we can rise to that duty we 
shall fairly rn the gratitude of all man-
kind." 
And so goin west out of Dublin watch for 
that turnoff the left into the woods. It 
is a third of a -toile beyond the village post 
office which putir the cancellation, "Dublin, 
N.H.," on so many important letters and 
statements and parnphlets that go out around 
the world?just a third of a mile and no 
more. Citizen Clark, 'U.S.A., walking stick 
in hand, is waiting in the cool of the sum-
mer evening at the lane that leads up to 
Outlet Farm where Fanny Dwight Clark has 
been cultivating her prize roses. It would 
be too bad to miss even a minute that you 
ye had there. 
THE WAR IN VIETNAM 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, last week, 
on Saturday, July 4, the convention of 
the Oregon Democratic Party, meeting at 
Coos Bay, Oreg., adopted a resolution 
calling for submission of the jurisdiction 
of the war in South Vietnam to the 
United Nations. At this large conven-
tion, there was only one vote in opposi-
tion. The comments made at the con-
vention also left no room for doubt that 
the participants in that Democratic con-
vention in Oregon are very concerned 
about the course of action that the 
United States is following in the foreign 
policy in southeast Asia. 
In my judgment this is the most 
sensible action that has been taken by 
any party convention yet on this critical 
international conflict. 
The resolution states in full: 
We urge that the United States ask the 
United Nations to take responsibility for 
the settlenaent of the conflict in Vietnam and 
that the United States declare its readiness 
to contribute troops and military support 
under United Nations command upon the as-
sumption of this responsibility by the United 
Nations. 
There is no doubt as to the position 
of these Democrats in support of having 
other nations who are members of the 
United Nations proceed to carry out 
their responsibilities, along with the 
United States, in applying the rule of 
law, rather than American unilateral 
military action in Southeast Asia in an 
attempt to settle this dispute. 
The American people everywhere, not 
just in Oregon, are beginning to awaken 
to the fact that what is happening in 
Southeast Asia is not the exclusive busi-
ness of the U.S. Department of Defense 
or of the U.S. Government as a whole. 
They are beginning to appreciate that it 
is a threat to international peace of 
exactly the kind the United Nations was 
created to handle. 
Even the Secretary General of the 
U.N., U Thant, is coming to appreciate 
the same thing. At long last, he has 
called for a new 14-nation conference 
on Southeast Asia, with the possibility 
that the United Nations could play a 
role in enforcing its decision. I would 
that the U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Mr. Adlai Stevenson, would give 
to Mr. U Thant the help and coopera-
tion that is needed, rather than follow 
the course of action that Mr. Stevenson 
has been following in recent months in 
regard to the war in southeast Asia. 
The United States opposes any new 
agreement on Southeast Asia until the 
existing agreements are lived up to. But 
since we are not living up to them any 
more than North Vietnam or China, this 
is only a semantic objection and not a 
real one. It stands to our historic dis-
credit. 
The official position of the United 
States only raises the question of why the 
United Nations should not be brought in 
to enforce the existing agreement. If we 
really want it enforced, why do we try 
to keep the U.N. out? The American 
concern about living up to existing agree-
ments will not be believable even to our 
own people until we seek an interna-
tional, not a unilateral, enforcement of 
them. Until we demonstrate in good 
faith?and the United States in south-
east Asia is not demonstrating good faith, 
but bad faith?the United States in 
southeast Asia is not living up to its obli-
gations under even the Geneva accord of 
1962, and we did not even sign the 
Geneva accord of 1954. The United 
States is not demonstrating good faith 
in southeast Asia until it demonstrates a 
willingness to sit down at a 14-nation 
conference table, as Mr. U Thant now, 
at long last?but better than never?has 
finally proposed in the press today. 
I am proud that the Oregon Demo-
cratic convention has raised its voice in 
behalf of the rule of law in world affairs. 
As the war continues, as it becomes more 
widely discussed in this country, and as 
more information about it trickles down 
to the American people, there will be 
more voices raised along the same line. 
More people in the country are speak-
ing out through the various media of 
public information than there were 90 
clays ago. I ask unanimous consent to 
have certain communications that I have 
received in support of the position I have 
taken on this issue and certain newspa-
per articles printed in the RECORD at the 
close of my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, great 
concern is being demonstrated among 
our allies over our military course of ac-
tion in southeast Asia. We are begin-
ning to hear rumblings of fear and doubt 
In respect to the U.S. policy in southeast 
Asia among the people of many lands. 
In today's press, our potential enemy, 
Russia, is making disquieting statements 
about her concern over what she alleges 
to be U.S. aggression in southeast Asia. 
She is beginning to make noises to the 
effect that she does not propose to ignore 
her commitments made with other coun-
tries to see to it that aggression is not 
carried out in southeast Asia or else-
where. 
Certainly, I agree that she ought to be 
the last to be discussing it. When one 
looks at the blood of aggression on the 
hands of Soviet Russia, it becomes a bit 
paradoxical to read her pratings today. 
But, nevertheless, we have placed our-

selves, I respectfully submit, in a: posi-
tion so that Russia can carry on that 
kind of propaganda against ,the United 
States. In this instance, the United 
States is wrong. Russia is going to take 
advantage of every Mistake we make. 
She is beginning to indicate that she is 
not going td walk out on Red China. 
There are stirrings, rumblings, and prop-
aganda announcements coming out of 
Peiping itself. 
Red China is showing an intention not 
to be bluffed by the United States, not 
to submit to the United States as we 
continue our policy of making war, and 
not peace, in southeast Asia. 
In my judgment, the war clouds are 
becoming more black and ugly over Asia. 
'They are 66COIlling so black they have 
cauSed even Pakistan to endorse ?a 14-
nation conference according to today's 
press reports. Pakistan is one of the 
SEATO members that has refused to join 
American forces in Vietnam, despite the 
vast aid we furnish to Pakistan. I am 
more concerned than ever before that if 
we continue our unilateral military 
course of action in Asia, the probabilities 
are that there will be a full-scale war in 
Asia, and the United States will live to 
regret that we took the course of action 
that brought about the beginning of that 
war, rather than resorting, as we should, 
under treaty commitments, to existing 
procedures of the rule of law on at least 
an attempt to settle the dispute by peace-
ful procedures, rather than by American 
military might.

DEAR SIR : I have read in our newspapers 
recently your sane and balanced views on 
world affairs particularly with regard to 
events in southeast Asia, a part of the world 
that is of great concern to those of us that 
live in the South Pacific region. 
Your comments as reported today (June 
25, 1964) on the question of the course in-
.dicated by the United States in this vital 
area are listened to and understood by peo-
ple from many walks of life here. To those 
of us that look with great concern at the 
march toward a conflagration in southeast 
Asia, your voice is an indication of wiser 
councils that rise above the constant bar-
rage of talk of war that flows in an endless 
stream from so many U.S. spokesmen and 
various journals. 
' Please accept my thanks for your courage 
and, humanity in speaking out on these is-
sues which keep alive the faith: that so many 
people like myself still endeavor to retain 
in the American democratic tradition of the 
past, despite so many blows against a re-
tention of that faith during recent years. 
Whilst persona like yourself in positions of 
responsibility'in.your country still Speak out

Interests of ,peace, independence, and coin-
Mon luillaanity, we know that the best tradi-

?some hold In these dangerous times. 
Please accept my assurance based on my 
own experience that your words are not 
lost onmilliins of ordinary people outside 
'the United States, we can well see what 
would he the inevitable result of the policies 
you speak out against as a true American.

SENATOR FEARS BIG WAR 
WASHINGTON.?,Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Democrat, of Oregon, said in the U.S. Senate 
yesterday that the United States was head-
ing for a major war in Asia. 
He said he had just come from a briefing 
on the military situation in South Vietnam 
held by the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Mc-
Namara, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
"If the United States continues following 
the course indicated by this briefing," he 
said, "we are headed for a major war in 
Asia, in which thousands of American boys 
will die. 
"We will be hated for 500 years and we 
will be known as the Nation that was chiefly 
responsible for scuttling the United Nations. 
"The greatest threat to the 'peace of the 
world is the United States," 
Senator MORSE said the situation in South 
Vietnam should be put before the United 
Nations.

WHO IS FIGHTING THE: VIETNAM WAR? 
In spite of propaganda to the contrary, it 
is obvious that the United States is fighting 
in the Vietnam war, and using some modern 
techniques in doing so. Several times Gen-
eral Hester had pointed this out in his ar-
ticles In the Churchman, in which he has 
quoted many authorities. Life magazine de-
serves credit for printing the letters of Capt. 
Edwin Shank, 27, to his wife, in its issue of 
May S. The captain was killed in Vietnam 
2 days after his last letter, dated March 22. 
In a letter of December 4, 1963, written 
following one of 'their night attacks, we 
read: "After the first two bombs, we spotted 
the bad guys shooting at us. So Frank di-
rected me in and I burned them with na-
palm." Please note the "I." In a letter of 
January 4. of this year. Shank wrote: "Na-
palm is gasolire which Is jellied into a mass 
about the consistency of honey. When you 
drop it, it ignites and spreads fire about 
210 to 300 feet. With charcoal in it, the char-
coal is thrown another 200 feet, like a burn-
ing baseball, and does further damage to 
Vietcong houses." On January 7 he wrote: 
"I don't know what the United States is do-
714. They tell you people that we are just 
In training situations. But we're at war. 
Apponect For Release 2004/01/1561CURIRDRE6D011,4R039161103.3607 
We are doing the flying and fighting. We are 
losing." And on January 15: "We can no 
logger gave face over here, for we have no 
face to save. We are more than ever fight-
ing this war." On January 20: "What gets 
me most is that they won't tell you people 
what we do over here rn bet that anyone 
you talk to does not know that American 
pilots fight this war. We?me and my 
buddies?do everything. The Vietnamese 
'students' we have on board are airman 
basics, They don't even know their own 
serial numbers. The only reason they are 
on board is: in case we crash there is one 
American 'adviser' and one Vietnamese 'stu-
dent.' They are sacrificial lambs." 
So?we send our boys to Vietnam under 
orders to burn innocent people, including 
mothers and children, with napalm?and to 
bp killed. Senator MORSE, member of the 
Foreign Relations Committee, who has per-
sistently denounced our Vietnam policy, de-
clares that "millions of Americans are be-
ginning to realize that it is time for us to 
get out of South Wetnam." And he told the 
Senate "all of South Vietnam isn't 'worth the 
life of a single Anlerican boy." At this Writ-
ing the count of Americans soldiers killed is 
225. 
[From the Churchman, June 19641 
WHAT KIND, OF FREEDOM? 
(By Hugh B. Hester) 
The American people have been shown two 
pictures in their daily newspapers recently 
which depict the situation In the world bet-
ter than many thousands of words. One 
shows the bloody, cruel, and utterly insane 
war the U.S. Government Is waging against 
defenseless, innocent, and poor men, women 
and children?In this instance, halfway 
around the world. /t is of a Cambodian 
father holding in his arms his badly burned 
napalm-bombed child. The other picture 
shows the abysmal poverty of the "have-
nots" in Latin America. 
To state, as did the late John Poster Dulles 
and many others, that the presence of Com-
munists among the people of Vietnam, Laos, 
and Cambodia pose a threat to the interests 
of the mighty United States is fantastic; to 
claim that the U.S. Government is not re-
sponsible for the war In this area is false; 
and to call this a defense of freedom Is lit-
erally obscene. This is coldblooded, sense-
less murder, worthy only of the heirs of 
Hitler's Nazi Germany, her concentration 
camps and crematories. 
The picture of a village in northern Brazil 
illustrates more clearly than anything else 
possible the reasons for discontent and tur-
moil in this continent south pf us. The 
recent coup d'etat in Brazil which deposed 
President Joao Goulart will not solve this 
problem of poverty. The continued use of 
U.S. funds for the arming of the feudal forces 
in Latin America will not solve this problem 
either. The causes of instability in this vital 
area can only be achieved through the 
eradication of the worst features of poverty. 
Unless the leaders of the United States are 
willing to attack the causes Instead of the 
, syraptorns of this deadly malady, they would 
be wise to completely disengage the United 
States from this area. 
A real solution, of course, would consist of 
a vast program for agricultural reform and 
for IndustrialIZation for education 'and med-
ical care. Only when these people have 
adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical 
care, and education, can democracy, as we 
think of it in the Anglo Saxon world, be 
cultivated. 
It ,Is vitally important, it seems to this 
Writer, that the leaders of the capitalist West 
reCognite that the conditions in most of the 
undeveloped *rid are fundamentally differ-
naked, and homeless people. Their ordei of 
freedom consists of the freedom to eat, to 
have shelter, clothing, medical care, and edu-
cation. Unless our leaders can understand 
this, no amount of military aid, no amount 
of "economic" aid ala Western style can solve 
the problem. You can't shoot an Idea with 
bullets or bombs and you can't fill the empty 
stomachs of hundreds of millions of hungry 
people with the crumbs from the capitalist 
table.

Dna SENATOR: In a letter from the orga-
nization PAX I read an excerpt from your 
letter to Norman Thomas concerning the 
growing willingness in the Pentagon and the 
State Department to go to war with Red 
China. 
I am writing to tell you that I am in 
agreement with you about the immorality of 
this attitude. Please do your utmost to make 
your views heard. 
Respectfully yours, i 
Mrs. ANNABEL WOLFSON. 
PHILADELPHIA, PA., 
July 6,1964. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENA:INDIC / am enclosing a copy of a 
letter which I sent to President Johnson. 
This will serve to contey my views on the 
war in southeast Asia. / wish to add to that 
an expression of gratitude for your many 
forthright statements in opposition to that 
war. It is reassuring to know that there 
are a few men in Congress who dare to ask, 
"Where are the emperor's clothes?" 
Very truly yours, 
Mrs. Ins G. KLINGSBERG. 
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: For several months 
/ read with a growing feeling of ease and re-
assurance your many statements in favor of 
finding peaceful solutions for the world's 
problems. Recent developments in southeast 
Asia, however, point in the direction not of 
peace but of war. American lives continue 
to be lost; Laos is bombed; a military man 
serves as our ambassador to South Vietnam; 
talk increases of expanding the war. These 
things are most alarming. 
Wag we not learn from .history? After 
0 years of warfare In Indochina, the French 
suffered a quarter-million ?amities. Despite 
billions of dollars in U.S. aid they surren-
15663 
headed for the point of no return??a nu-
clear conflagration? There is a third choice, 
Mr. President. /n a nuclear age it is the 
only choice: the conference table. Two 
frameworks for such a conference already 
exist: The United Nations and the Geneva 
Conference. 
"As a lifelong Democrat I have not enjoyed 
hearing the repeated charge that the Demo-
cratic Party is the party of war inasmuch 
as the three wars of this century have oc-
curred in Democratic administrations. In 
the past / have regarded this charge as 
fraudulent and politically motivated. But 
X pray, Mr. President, that it will never be 
possible to make such an accusation again."

IICM. WAYNE MORSE, 
The U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
MY DEAR SENATOR: Since I feel that your 
position concerning the war in southeast Asia 
and its inevitable consequences is correct 
and commendable, I would like to pledge my 
support to you in your efforts to encourage 
a more sane policy there. Until the U.S. 
Government recognizes the necessity of work-
ing within the UN. and adhering to interna-
tional law, it will continually jeopardize the 
peace of the world, as it has during the past 
few years. It is surprising that this Nation 
which began with a struggle for Its own in-
dependence from a colonialist power should 
now be falling into the same errors DS INS 
earlier opponents. 
Sincerely yours, 
Mrs. KATHERINE HARAMUNDANIS, 
MILLERS FALLS, MASS., 
July 4,1964, 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to quote 
part of a book review from the New York 
Times which was partially reproduced in an 
article by A. J. Muste in Liberation. It was 
written by Prof. George Kateb of Amherst 
College: 
"There is already evidence of a new stat-
ism which makes of International relations 
a Renaissance game; which Spends incon-
ceivably large sums of money on redundant 
or artificial projects; which so encloses our 
leaders in their struggle with the enemy 
that one day they could have more in com-
mon with their counterparts in the enemy 
country than with their own people; which 
can speculate on thermonuclear casualties 
in the scores of millions and still speak about 
the survival or victory of the Nation." 
Brief as it is this statement clearly in-
dicates the present trend of U.S. policy in 
southeast Asia. Vietnam and Laos have now 
become the focal points In a struggle against 
Communist aggressors while they should 
really be treated as signs and alarms of the 
increasingly complex political, economic, 
and social situation which exists in south-
east Asia. 
/ applaud and wholeheartedly support 
your opposition to our Government's war-
hawk attitude. To be certain, peacekeeping, 
and not warmongering, is the central task 
for the United States in southeast Asia. 
For the first time in our Nation's short 
history, when and if the administration 
calls for more overt action, there will be 
opposition from representative officials like 
you and some of your colleagues. 
have already written a letter to President 
Johnson voicing my opposition to the pres-
ent trend of military and political affairs in 
southwest Asia, but / urge you to keep the 
voices of opposition strong and creative 
enough to offer an alternative of peaceful 
conciliation in Vietnam and Laos. 
The President made an unfortunate choice 
ant from those in the developed world. De- dered at Dien Bien-phu with a half-million in appointing General Taylor to the am-
Mocraey and freedom as prated about in the 
troops still under their command. be we bassadorlal post in Vietnam. / sincerely

To the Emma: 
On June 21 you carried ar editorial on the 
situation in southeast Mt t which ended: 
,dctory is not possible for either 
side In this struggle, but he danger of a 
NGIIIMBEMAILHASSE(9)011003SMIATE 'July 9 
global conflict seems to be advancing with 
fearful speed." 
On the next day In the Senate WAYNE 
MORSE Made a bitter, and documented attack 
on the administration's policy. / didn't see 
it reported in the Times and he tells me that 
It seems to be the poncy.of newspapers, tel-
evision stations and so forth throughout the 
country to let the administration lead us to 
war without reporting important dissent 
even in the Senate by him and Senator 
Garmrsmo. Administration supporters have 
not yet bothered to answer them. 
Lae him, / an one of those who believe 
that "In the State Department and Pentagon 
are Men who think Red China will never be 
weaker than she is at the present time, and 
therefore now is the time to finish her off if 
she resists a U.S. takeover in southeast Asia." 
Even in the name of the most righteous 
anticommunism, it is madness for us to em-
bark on a course that may lead to world 
war. The world in general would not think 
us Champions of righteousness but of a neo-
imperialism, and even if we could and should 
crush China in a tall dory sense, we would 
lose. 
We canna: thus organize Asia, much less 
the world, for democracy. We should be ac-
cused of white Imperialism pretty much 
around the world. One shudders at the cost 
we might have to pay in money and in lives. 
Even if our present threats, delay or hinder 
action by Communist forces, It Is nonsense 
to think that we can get a settlement in 
communist Asia, halfway around the world, 
and hold it simply by military power, Any 
hope there is lies in negotiation for neu-
trality. When will the public begin to speak 
OWL? 
NORMAN Elio tuns. 
NEW YORK, June 23, 1964. 
NEW YORE, N.Y.?In Minneapolis on Sun-
day, June 28, President Johnson warned the 
world that the United States, 'when neces-
sary," would not hestitate "to risk war" in 
southeast Asia. Of course, in order to pre-
serve peace. On Wednesday, July 1, Sec-
retary Rusk asserted his belief that peace 
can be achieved without further extension 
of fighting. This sort of talk is characteria-
tic, probably of doubt in the administration 
itself of what It will do and certainly of the 
great desire to juggle the issue of peace or 
war until alter the election. 
Senator OHLDWATER will have none of that. 
No, who does not believe it is the business of 
Federal Government to guarantee ordinary 
rights of human 'beings; in Mississippi, wants 
a tougher policy in southeast Asia. That is, 
a government, winch can't protect Its own 
citizens, should play policeman around the 
world, using the most diabolical forms of 
war in that role. The House Republican 
Policy Committee went along with GOLD-
WATER, not Lodge, when it argued that we 
must repeal today's complacent commitment 
"to prevent a Communist victory" and sub-
stitute a commitment "to Insure victory for 
freedom." 
'Under no circumstances shall we insure a 
victory for freedom by the indefinite con-
tinuance of our present confused policy in 
southeast Asia, much less by any expansion 
of war. In purely military terms this is not 
a war that we can win any more than did the 
French. It is the irony of our present mili-
tary power that we can't use our weapons of 
total destruction to preserve people or free-
dom anywhere. Neither can we win In a 
civil war such as that which we face in 
South Vietnam. There is extraordinarily 
little evidence of direct Chinese or North 
Vietnamese military help of consequence. 
Most of the Vietcong's guns are American, 
captured In guerrilla war. Vietcong's leader 
is a Vietnamese who is said not to be e. Com-
munist. In the new nations, communism 
can do nothing but gain by a long, dragged 
out war in which we will be represented as 
the neo-imperialists and the white racists. 
The situation will become Infinitely worse 
as soon as the war is expanded as it doubt-
less will be if it should long be continued. 
Sooner or later, China would be drawn in. 
There Is reason. to believe that Senator MORSE 
Is right in charging that important figures 
in the State Department and the Pentagon 
want to fight China now while she is rela-
tively weak. This, among the other dis-
astrous consequences, would take Russia off 
the hook. We could weaken China for her 
while she cou.d still profess loyalty to the 
Communist cause and even render some 
service to It. To the nonwhite world we 
should be made to appear as racial imper-
ialists. There Is no better way to a third 
world war as the eventual end of our policy. 
In any case its costs would .be catastrophic. 
We must negotiate. Any solution of the 
problem must be political, involving the 14 
nations which made the Geneva agreement 
on independence and neutrality. it should 
also Involve tae United Nations and most 
certainly Communist China. It is not to 
deny that it will be difficult to deal with 
China to say that we have made It im-
possible to deal constructively with her so 
long as we insist that Chiang represents the 
country out Cf which he was ingloriously 
driven. 
One of the more rational spokesmen for 
the State Department in a recent debate with 
me in Detroit firgued, first, that we could not 
deal with the Chinese Communists because 
of the nature of their communism, and, sec-
ond. that we did not need to recognize Chi-
nese Communist government and were in 
fact dealing with it without giving it rec-
ognition. It may be that Peiping will prove 
so intransigent that the end will be war 
no matter what Washington does. I don't 
believe this, partly because of China's pres-
ent relative moderation in southeast Asia. 
But the 'United States has no right to fulfill 
its own prophecies of Chinese intransigence 
by its absurb policy of nonrecognition and 
the exclusion of the real China from the 
ITN. Peace, all too probably the world's 
peace, depends upon political solution of 
southeast Asian problems in terms of ne-
gotiation and neutralization.

DEAR Salaam's: This letter is to let you 
know that I stand with you in any further 
extension of the war In Vietnam. 
I am particularly disturbed by the replace-
ment of Lodge as Ambassador by General 
Taylor. I fail to see how a man with a mili-
tary mind like Taylor can fit into what is es-
sentially a delicate political situation. 
What can be done by you and your other 
four constituents in breaking what seems 
like an almost conspiratorial silence on the 
part of the press and television in reporting 
your remarks? Could the National Commit-
tee for an Effective Congress (of which you 
may be a member) come up with some an-
swer on this? 
I have written to Senators KENNEDY and 
SILTONSTALL, and they both say the same 
thing; i.e., If we lose in South Vietnam, then 
the famous domino theory will prevail; one 
by one the nations of southeast Asia will fall 
to the Communists. 
lam not subscribing to wholesale American 
evacuation of South Vietnam. As the ori-
entate, we would not or could not lose face. 
There must be other political ways that have 
not been pushed or explored to ease the ex-

aware that you have San Francisco's Repre-
sentative PHILIP BURTON and New York's Rep-
resentative WILLIAM Frrrs RYAN, calling for 
negotiations in economic trade and peaceful 
elections. 
But, sir, the ambiguity arises out of press 
coverage as to whether there is Communist 
infiltration of South Vietnam and Commu-
nist supplying of the national liberation 
front. From one source I understand the 
army itself has stated that the infiltration 
and alleged supplying of rebel forces is neg-
ligible, yet from the mass (or is it mess?) of 
others the cry goes up of Communist infil-
tration, conspiracy, armament, atrocities. / 
ask you sir, which is it, what was reported 
by Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNamara and the 
Army intelligence. Sir, I with a multitude 
of others thirst unquenchably for informa-
tion, good honest information, of the situ-
ation and receive none. I have written to 
Senator KUCHEL but I have received no 
answer, I suppose the letter was discarded 
as pressurized by the activities of groups here 
in the bay area. / ask you to inform me as

DEAR SENATOR: It is wonderful to hear you

that makes one wonder if most of the people 
in the Government who tolerates CIA who 
refuses to see what is happening to many 
countries, especially our attitude in South 
and North Vietnam, also Laos and Cambodia, 
besides Cuba, Germany, etc., we must realize 
that our attitude must eventually lead to 
atomic war. 
Also peace seems to be a dirty word. How 
can one possibly get the people to realize 
our only hope for survival is peace?and a 
strong movement that can force the Gov-
ernment to recognize their wishes. Or will 
peace topple the capitalist system?

JULY 1, 1964. 
DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I have Just 
heard the halting and not very credible or 
creditable speech of your recent Ambassador 
to Saigon before the National Press Club. 
/t was evasive, when not actually menda-
cious, on Vietnam. 
/t was a rather disgraceful performance. 
But, in its being so, it unfortunately 
echoes the position of our Government on 
the civil war in South Vietnam?for it is a 
civil war, and not an international conflict 
(except insofar as we are making, it so), 
which our Government represents it as and 
is apparently trying to escalate it to. 
I see the role of the NLP as indistinguish-
able from the forces that fought to get rid 
of the Fiench?to get rid of all foreign power 
and make Vietnam self-governing. 
This, by the same logic, means getting rid 
of all puppet dictators like Diem and Kanh, 
who continue under different forms the op-
pressive aims of a colonial power. 
We have seen to it that we succeeded 
France as the colonial power in southeast 
Asia, and have acted rather more rapaciously 
than the French, more murderously. 
Our aim there is immoral because it is to 
prevent the self-determination of a people. 
And, as could be expected with an im-
moral aim, our methods are equally immoral, 
what with defoliation, napalm, and torture 
and terrorism directed toward the ordinary 
citizenry, to say nothing of death. 
As a reflection of this immoral aim of ours, 
the NFL has the allegiance of 70 percent of 
the area, 50 percent of the population, has 
its own government, issues its own postage 
stamps, collects taxes from U.S. Government 
contractors in Saigon itself, can have its 
military forces operate within 5 miles of 
Saigon, can have its agents operate freely 
within Saigon, and has the secret sympathy 
of a large number of foreigners. 
In addition to the immorality of our aims 
and methods in South Vietnam?or as a 
consequence of it?we are threatening to run 
the risk of a world war in the course of 
which we as a nation, as well as many others, 
would most likely be wiped out. 
Sir, are you really unaware of these things? 
Respectfully yours, 
ROBERT MELTON.

B.S. OPPONENT OF VIE ['NAM WAR 
(By George Bain) 
WasmivaroN.?In the UI. Senate it has 
became almost a daily occur snore that Sena-
tor WAYNE MORSE, of Oreg on, rises in his 
place to denounce what he calls McNamara's 
war in Vietnam. 
He says that the United States cannot 
legally justify its presence there, that it is 
following E policy which is likely to lead to 
a long drawn out and costly war with China, 
and that if the fighting in Vtitnarn endangers 
the peace of the world?as he thinks it 
does?the place to take the issue is to the 
United Nations. 
Ile says that the United States has acted 
not only unwisely but improperly, and points 
out that South Vietnam as well as North 
Vietnam has been accused by the Interna-
tional Control Commission of violating the 
1914 Geneva accords?SoutIr Vietnam by re-
ceiving U.S. military assists nee. - ' 
lie has made public answers given him by 
experts appearing before tie Senate foreign 
relations committee, of which he is a mem-
ber, to the effect that very few North Viet-
namese, or Chinese, or other foreigners have 
been found among the Vietc mg taken prison-
er in the fighting in South Vietnam. 
The foreigners in South t ietnam today, he 
bars said, are Americans. 
He looks upon the war in South Vietnam 
as a civil war, in which each side has its 
backers outside, rather than as an aggres-
sive war waged from Nor- ,11 Vietnam. He 
.beileves, however, that Nor t Vietnam. with 
Approved For Release 2004/01/16 
China beyond it, has been the greater of-
fender against the Geneva accords, and that 
the case conk. be proved in the United Na-
tions, although to do so might be to eispose 
the mistakes of the United States. 
In a recent speech he said: "Peace is more 
important than U.S. face. Peace is more 
important than a temporary loss of U.S. 
prestige, if we lose prestige by seeking to 
right a mistaken course of action, / believe 
the opposite would be true." 
In his long campaign. Senator Moose: has 
had several associates-- most notably Sena-
tor ERNEST ausserneri, of Alaska. They are 
both Democrats. Both from time to time 
have criticized the U.S. press for the scant 
attention It has paid their other- side-of -the-
case argument at a time when Vietnam and 
Laos rarely have been off the front pages. 
Net all the attention that has been paid 
them has been favorable. 
The Washington Star in an editorial this 
week said: 
"It must be that Senator WAYNE MORSE 
stands on his head when he looks at the 
international situation. ? ? ? The latest of 
(his) attacks accuses President Johnston of 
carrying out an illegal and immoral Asian 
policy "making the United States the world's 
leading threat to world peace." This is an 
outrageously IrresporisIble staternent It does 
violence to the realities, and it certainly 
lends more than a, little aid and comfort to 
the Communist enemy in southeast Asia." 
Whether or not the conclusion complained 
of by the Star editorialist was warranted, the 
Senator's attack on the legality and morality 
of the U.S. policy can hardly be called ir-
responsible. Both are open tc1 question. 
The losing war which France waged to 
maintain Its indochina colonies--a war sub-
stantially assisted by the Unitde States at the 
end?was brought to an end with the sign-
ing of the Geneva accords in July 1954. What 
had been Indochina was divided in four?. 
Cambodia. Laos, and North and South Viet-
nam. 
The United States did not sign. Senator 
MORSE says: "St is my view that we did not 
sign the Geneva agreements because we did 
not intend to go along. We have not gone 
along. Therefore we stand here today in this 
ugly, shocking posture of the United States 
before the eyes of the world. angagng in 
McNamara's war in South Vietnam." 
It is part of his thesis that, after en-
couraging France not to give up the fight, 
then sounding out Britain particularly to see 
if a joint venture could not be launched to 
keep up the war against the Communist 
Viet Minh, that John Foster Dunes, the then 
Secretary of State. reluctantly accepted the 
work of the Geneva conference and. with 
reservations. 
'Why did not our representatives sign that 
treaty?'' Senator Mosso asks. "Why did not 
South Vietnam sign it'? I think the answer 
is that their refusal to sign it, was based on 
the fact that the United States had already 
decided to step into South Vietnam at least, 
and carry on where France had left off?to 
keep South Vietnam as a Weston protector-
ate and toehold in Asia." 
Whether or not that was the intention, 
the fact is that while- withholding its sig-
nature from the accords the United States 
issued an independent statement to the 
effect that 11, NOILM Observe them. 
But as early as January 1955, Mr. Dulles 
was referring to the Geneva agreements as a 
major setback. And even before that, In 
September 1954, he had pasted together the 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization BS a 
response to the new situation in southeast 
Asia. 
Its members were Australia, France, New 
Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, 
Britain, and the United Staten. A protocol 
to the treaty extended to Cambodia, Laos, 
and South Vietnam the protection of clause 
: CIA-RDP75-00149R00050033000 
4, which says, among other things, that 
an attack upon one will be regarded as an 
attack upon all. 
It is upon this shaky foundation that U.S. 
involvement in the fighting in South Viet-
nam rests. Ostensibly, the United States is 
there?and has been since 1955?at the re-
quest of South Vietnam to assist it in its 
defense against aggression from North Viet-
nam. 
What Senator Moser says is this: "Today 
South Vietnam toes not run the war against 
the guerrillas. She does not make her own 
foreign policy or military policy. The United 
States does. The U.S. Air Force is fighting 
in South Vletrum. Its planes and men are 
providing the air support and air transporta-
tion for the 001:erIlMerli; ground forces. 
Americans numbering at least 15,000 are 
fighting with the ground forces. When they 
are shot at, they shoot back." 
U.S. participation on this order is not in 
keeping with the Geneva accords, article 16 
of which says: "With effect from the date of 
entry into force of the present agreement, 
the introduction into Vietnam of any troop 
reinforcements and additional military per-
sonnel is prohibited." 
It was in 1957 that the International Con-
trol Commission, composed of Indian, Polish, 
and Canadian members, complained of viola-
tions by South Vietnam involving U.S. troops. 
The most serious incident involved the in-
troduction of 290 U.S. military personnel into 
the country even after the Commission had 
said that their entry should be held up by 
pending further study by the Commission. 
There were complaints of North Vietnamese 
violations then and have been since. Sena-
tor MORSE accepts that assistance has been 
given the Vietcong in the training of men 
and the equipping of them?although much 
of the Vietcong equipment is American-
made, having been captured--but that what 
North Vietnam may have done does not war-
rant the United States matching it. 
LEBANON, OREG., 
June 21,1964. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Washington, D.C. - 
SENATOR MORSE: We DSO deeply concerned 
over the recent decision of the Government 
in risking total all-out, hopeless, war in 
southeast Asia. Another stalemate like 
Korea is all that can be hoped for, in Viet-
nam, land of political indecision and Com-
munist bounded. Various reports over news-
casts, from time to time, have made known 
your fight against this contemplated action. 
Keep it up, by all means. The peace of our 
Nation and the lives of the young men are 
at stake. And if you who represent us do 
not cry out against this foolhardy thing, who 
can? 
We are writing each of our Congressmen 
front Oregon, to begin at once, in earnest 
to decry this thing that is sweeping our 
Nation toward another hopeless conflict. 
(Which the Communist world gleefully an-
ticipate, etc.) 
Also we have written the editor of the 
Oregonian, to urge the readers, to beseech 
the President and Congressmen by tele-
gram and letter to protest against the pro-
posed, further intervention in such a hope-
less, far-off war. Also, did ask the editor 
to contact other editors of the Nation for 
such an effort, that the voice of the people 
might be heard in protest against such fool-
hardiness. Only the united voice of the 
people can hope to stern the tide, from all 
indications of the rash action being taken by 
those in authority. And concern is all but 
smothered out, by the complacency and 
harangue over the political Issues (and can-
didates) of the day, etc. 
Therefore, continue to stand strong and 
sure for those things which are right and 
true regardless of men's words and actions.

You have stood, time after time, for the 
right, in the face of great opposition, and 
many of us have cheered behind the scenes, 
and now we want you to know we are behind 
your efforts by word and by prayer, and 
when our life's work is finished the only 
thing that will really count for time and 
eternity, is "Have we obeyed and striven to 
do those things, that God hath put into our 
hand to do, for His glory ?and men's good." 
As we obey His voice to our hearts day by day, 
"The steps of a good man are ordered of the 
Lord," Psalms 37: 23 (if that man will hear 
and heed). How can they be, if he won't? 
We can move by word and deed in the will 
and way of the Almighty, and what better 
way is there to move? None. I daresay. God 
says, Psalm 119: 105: "His word is a lamp 
unto our feet and a light unto our path." 
But what if we Ignore God's lamp and light 
unto men? We do walk in darkness without 
His help, His guidance, His presence along 
the way. How well I know, I have walked 
both paths. And again, "As many as are led 
by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of 
God," Roman B: 14. But if those who bear 
His name (regardless of church affiliation) 
neither listen nor pay heed when that Spirit 
of the Almighty ("God is a spirit" John 4: 21) 
strives to urge and prompt the spirit (or 
heart of men) to lead and direct their steps, 
their words, their actions, in the best way, 
for their good and God's glory, they do not 
walk in all the privileges of "sons." 
May God bless and direct you day by day, 
is my prayer. 
We plan to send the following telegram 
to the President, concerning the Vietnam 
issue: 
"Mr. PRESIDE:TIT: Do the leaders of this Na-
tion seek another Korea? How foolhardy. 
"Mr. and Mrs. Gas BEARD." 
These words of encouragement to stand 
firm and strong, in and with Gods help and 
guidance, are from the heart of some friends 
of the home State. 
God bless you, 
Mr. and Mrs. OTIS BEARD.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We are business and

about the critical situation in southeast

volvement of American men and arms is 
immoral and is disastrous to world peace and 
American prestige. . 
You are performing the most valuable 
kind of service by presenting the unembel-
lished facts about this situation to the 
American public. However, there has been 
a virtual blackout of your speeches and 
statements in all gonununIcations media In 
this area. 
There are many people in San FESECISCO 
who wish to be acquainted with your posi-
tion. We believe that a speech delivered by 
you personally in San Francisco would be 
attended by a significantly large audience 
and would break the news blackout. 
Could you possibly make room in your 
busy schedule to speak on a publicplatform

well in advance for your convenience and 
approval.

and its dangerous consequences has 
prompted this letter from Us. Sponsorship 
of the proposed meeting would be by the 
undersigned and other interested people. 
We are not members of any organized group

Proud as I am of, this, you can appreciate 
its possibilities for placing my son in immi-

Senator MORSE, the potential for slaugh-
ter of our fine young men Is not only very 
real, but appears more imminent every day. 
I cannot sleep lately. Here astute and 
strongly intuitive / can only see wanton 
waste and irreparable loss sherd for parents 
(if the present administration conttnues op 
the course 1,'s chosen). I concur with you, 
sir. 
No young man is going to be called 
"chicken," so, if he'S ordered to Vietnam, 
he'll go, quietly. It is time we parents let 
the proper authorities know that we did not 
raise our young men to die for the likes of 
such a Godforsaken country. Why do we 
always jump in, ready to bristle our armor, 
and "show our strength" for, any country 
that yells (and now, for one who didn't?) 
It's sickenirg. 
A mother who lost her only son in Viet-
nam the other day was intennewed on TV 
yesterday. Until the day I die, I shall see 
her pitiful face with the large, haunted eyes. 
I shall hear her ask, over and OIMT again: 
"Why? You tell me, why did my son have 
to leave the United States, and go to Viet-
nam to die? What good did it do?" From 
her appearance, I do not belicte she'd slept 
nor ,eaten since.. But she'd wept. For 
what? The truth was proven In Korea. No 
one ever wins a war. The crosses are mute 
testimony. 
In God's name, tell me what we parents 
can do to stem this tide? Had Johnson two 
fine young sons (same age as; his girls), I 
wonder if he would not listen less to Mc-
Namara and more to his heart? Yes 
love my son. He has had a tough life 
and only lately, after graduation, has Jim 
men been able to have a suit, shom when 
he needs them, a little happiness at last. 
We parents are not ready to sacrifice our 
sons for Vietnam. Please tell me tc. whom 
I can write to get this across? Soon. I'm 
a former Cregon constituent of beautiful

step would escalate the southeast Asia war 
to a point where the Chinese themselves 
will have to decide whether they want to 
take on the United States in another 
Korean-type action." 
Now, what is unsaid but follows as in-
evitably as Math follows war, is that the 
escalated war to avert what they call dis-
aster in Vietnam will bring heartbreaking 
disaster to thousands and thousands of 
American homes through lost, killed, and 
maimed American sons. What about that 
disaster? It's great to talk about saving 
Vietnamese but someone neglects to tell us 
that in the saving we sacrifice thousands 
of our own sons, fighting a war for a people 
who don't seem willing to fight their own 
and in a country so far away the average 
American doesn't know where to look for 
it on the map. 
The people of the country never wanted 
any one of the last three wan we have had 
and they don't want this one. Then who 
does? 
/t seems Mr. Johnson, Mr. McNamara, and 
Mr. Rusk are credited officially with the 
decision and behind it all is the soporific 
reason "to save face," and "give freedom to 
the Vietnamese". Poppicock. 
If it costs the life of your son or mine it 
Is not worth it. If the Vietnamese want 
communism, Mt 'em have It. If they don't 
want it, let them fight against it. It looks 
like in all these situations a majority want 
what they get and we are siding with a mi-
nority. I'm sure that if a majority of any 
nation didn't want communism, they will 
eventually rebel and overthrow it just as did 
our small rebellious colonies with England. 
The principles are the same today, only the 
tools of war have changed. If we could and 
did do it with England, Vietnam can do it 
with communism if the majority want to 
desperately enough. If they don't, to hell 
with it?don't send my son to do it for them. 
I'm positive 99 percent of all American par-
ents and perhaps an equal- percentage of 
7Leligible draftees feel we have too many sol-
ApOrOSItcl For Release 2004/01/1c961W5PIPAMaitialianterTE 
Wer .graves in foreign lands and too many 
Veterans Hospitals here filled with broken 
minds mid bodies from foreign conflicts. 
We want no more. Only WAYNE MORSE 
seems to have tne courage to speak out and 
in doing so he speaks for millions. He said 
Of the yietnarn sffair, as reported in Mr. 
Lahey's column, 'The United States is h, ead-
ed for War in Asia and will be Ikated for the 
next 500 years by the majority of mankind." 
Mass told the Senate that this country 
"will go down in history as the nation chiefly 
responsible for scuttling the United Nations." 
He said he told McNamara and Tailor at the 
COMmittee briefing that they had convinced 
him that "the greatest threat to peace In the 
world is the United States." ? , 
If the officials of this Nation need their 
"face saved" in V etnam or anywhere else, let 
them save it by some other means than war 
and the waste of young American lives. One 
NYKy plight be as suggested by Eric Remarque 
in "All Quiet On the Western Front," put 
the officials Who want war in a ring with 
the Communist officials and let them scrap 
It out. I doubt it.

you for your forthright statements on Viet-

viously studied the problem thoroughly and 
ate standing by your conclusions. To find a 
Man of your courage and convictions is rare 
in these days of wishy-washy thinking and 
talking. / salute you, Senator. 
I am also writing Senator HART, my Sen-
ator, this evening to ask if he will not join 
you in your efforts to prod the administra-
tion into recognizing their United Nation's 
commitments?to stop this waste of human 
life. We, a nation of peace, should not be 
setting a bad example all over the globe, 
billions for arms and other instruments of 
war; we should be leading a peace race and 
the place to start is the U.N. 
As a concerned citizen, mother of two

let me know if I can be of assistance to you 
hi your quest for peace. I remain,

American people who are, as you say, delib-

dangerous action, which involves the peril of

keep quiet In public because of the chau-
vinistic trend Cif sentiment in the country. 
I assure you that I know many people even 
here in California who view the trend of 
developments in Vietnam with dismay. 
Am Z not correct in thinking that Gen-
eral MacArthur viewed our entry into a war 
on the mainland of Asia with grave mis-
givings? Should not his name be invoked 
in the present circumstances? Surely he 
knew more about that situation than (say) 
Senator Gorzwarra. 
An English observer of the *United States 
once observed that we have the illusion of 
omnipotence, lie was quite right about this. 
Anyone who knows anything about history 
knows that Such an illusion gets a country 
into very serious trouble.

your efforts to have the Vietnam situation 
handled by a United Nations deliberation 
and possible presence of some kind. I wrote 
you longhand on the 26th, on hearing part 
of the interview by NBC with Senator 
CHURCH to follow up your presentation the 
day before. 
After reading the various insertions and 
speeches in CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for the 
23d, the 25th, and 26th, / decided that a 
letter to NBC to include suggestion that 
more views be given how to get the United

I enclose copy of my letter to let your office 
know that at least one person is asking for 
more TV appearances to get this U.N. idea 
out in the open. 
/ do think that it is alarming to read, as 
you pointed out in your remarks, page 14301 
in RECORD of the 23d, that after Senator 
CHURCH'S convincing speech on the United

in Vietnam situation, then that a series of

' DEAR Ma. MORGAN: The "Today" show on 
TV it to be congratulated on seeking out 
last week the views of two Senators on what 
mast of us agree is a topic of highest con-
cern to the peace of the we lid--our pOlicy 
in Asia. Senator MORSE on Thursday., the 
25-th of June and Senator Stumm* on the 
nazi, day, Friday. the 26th co nbined to bring 
before your vast audience some of the Issues 
and the concern they each hold for efforts 
before the 'United Nations to bring about 
peaceful solutions. 
This kind of attention to Issues of the day 
which has been heightened, it seems to me, 
in recent weeks, Is good for the viewer's ad-
Vantage In watching the "Top lay" show. 
I trust that the seemingly critical note in 
WIGS remarks in the course c f interview with 
Senator CHURCH, Charged te Senator MORSE 
(per his entry in the CONGM SSIONAL RECORD, 
/DIG 14714, of June 26) will be corrected in 
sonle subsequent statement. I had taped 
most of Senator Mortses Ir terview and on 
playing it back I could not detect any basis 
for criticism of President Johnson as a "war-
monger". Yet in listening to the 'interview 
with Senator CHURCH I have the impression 
that some such implicatior was unhappily 
givem. We are all aware that Senator MORSE 
In his entries in the CONGRESSIONAL TIECORD 
lam confined himself to vies and opinions; 
Limn any Senator Cnintotr Li his address on 
the United Nations on June 23, 1964, gave 
such a detailed analysis of lie views in reas-
oning for more use of It. N. peacekeeping 
machinery of the U.N. (especially column 2 
of page 14290, June 23) th at many viewers 
might wish more extended time on TV by 
these two Senators who to Thhe reader might 
seem. good choices for more explanations to 
American audience of the possible advan-
tages of use of the United Nations. 
We hope that "Today" sh Be will continue 
to tiy to give its close attention to the ef-
forts toward use of -United Nations for peace-
keeping authority and influence.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations On 
i7011r magnificent TV talk of June 28. 
Would that other respectee I. and Influential 
Government officials would have the cour-
age to bring the true state of affairs to the 
people. Neither do most ol our newspapers 
live up to their obligati?, i to inform the 
public by printing any 1 ackground news 
such as the why and hoar of happenings. 
For several years such meg! mines as the New 
Republic, Christian Cent try. Progressive, 
and even Newsweek have said that we have 
no business to be hi ViitIlE011' mid that 
we were In violation Of he 1954 Geneva 
agreement. laut since a Very small seg-
ment of the people read these magazines 
they were voices crying in the wilderness, 
Pm afraid. But I am hopeful that your TV 
Ineerview was seen by a great part of 
A13130311484atftr'RelePthigg'266411iligit 
spire and encourage other like minded per- the "Today" show will rouse up millions and 
millions of Americana. When Judgment Day 
come how will our President justfy his 
sending our boys to their deaths and Barry 
Truman for the war in Korea. How can he 
justfy for the many he sent to die in Korea. 
But at least he as you said, turned it over to 
the U.N. Today our President told of send-
ing 500 more guerrilla fighters. But he 
should know as you and X know a guerrilla 
war they are experts at that type of fighting 
over there. This type of warfare is extremely 
difficult to win and even if it was won where 
would it leave us if Johnson pushes us Into 
full scale war. If he is prepared to face our 
people, the parents of our men and explain 
to them why he made us face the loss of per-
haps 50,000 to 100,000 of oar young men plus 
the enormous cost to our Nation not only 
In lives but mc nay. It would also mean a 
loss of face for us before the rest of the world, 
then how do we know Red China may not 
feel there is nothing to Ic.se in even a more 
direct challenge to America? We Americans 
may soon find we are faced or must make a 
drastic decision on Vietnam, and we better 
get used to it or toughen our thinking. Our 
efforts to train and aid them has brought no 
decisive results. 
sone to protest our present foreign policy. 
I am writing about this to the President and 
the State Deportment As a registered Re-
publican (who finds it more difficult each 
election to find a worthwhile Republican to 
vote for) I want to say that I am thankful 
that you and others such as Senators Hum-
EMMY, PIELBRMHT, and MANSFIELD have the 
mental honesty and the courage to criticize 
our Government's actions when necessary 
and the wisdom to present alternative ac-
tions.

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR: We heard your TV interview 
Sunday, and agree with you wholeheartedly. 
In fact, President Johnson has just lost my 
vote, because / certainly would not vote for 
GOLDWATER, and because President Johnson 
is talking war. Because both President 
Johnson anud ex-President Kennedy are not 
stopping this Government interference into 
the States. Governor Scranton will get my 
vote. 
The colored ?MD should be given an edu-
cation. You can only force education, reli-
gion, etc., just so far. 'They can be given 
the opportunities to learn, and should have 
them?but let them go from there. I am not 
with the Council of Churches, and many of 
our ministers are not, either. You cannot 
force me to like my neighbor. I must want 
to. You cannot make a student do anything 
but obey the laws of the school, but cannot 
force them to go to a library to learn more. 
There must be a line drawn. 
Our Government, out schools, and our 
churches must have laws. But they must 
only go so far. The people revolt?a natural 
thing. 
One the other hand, the Negroes must be 
made to understand, and should be made 
to understand (instead of giving Into them) 
that the white race came up to where we are 
by hard work?by education?nothing has 
been given to vs except our heritage from our 
ancestors. Now, they want it handed to them. 
Let them make it?instead of all this 
hullaballoo that is going on, dangerous as it 
may become?start working. Our working 
Negroes are not in this line of march. 
/ blame the white peciPle for what they are 
doing too. All of this force is no good?it will 
explode some place. I think what may hap-
pen down hers is the fact that some busi-
nesses will be forced to close. We have some 
eating establishments that have hostesses?
they will seat the colored, to be sure when it 
Is law, if it is law?but where they want them 
: elAa-iktinTeeffilbitiAtibab 0007-7 on to be seated. Education?both church and

Aplar84ed For Release 2004/01/491WPfkbicifftfilhalkfliMS1/3513107A711 
achool?should be given them, but nothing 
else. And this is the opinion Of the majority. 
NO American wants to hear anything about 
War. President Johnson Should be patient 
and work for peace?war out of the question. 
He should be winning friends and influenc-
ing people all over the world America 
CiOesnit need to be aliitdp,d amongst its 
Whites?it is?thanks to the Eennedys. He 
will Mid that no One is .lacyind him even tak-
ing a risk of war. Win the People over, all 
over the world, and if that cannot be done, 
1$ them lose their freedom. Of course, at-
tention at home should come first. , 
Americans are so busy living, / feel 'cer-
tain they do not step to write but we are not 
behind President Johnerin in many things. 
Therefore, my vote Is going to Governor 
Scranton, if he can get "elected. / think 
Texans will show how ranch they are against 
GOLDWATER, if at the coming convention Gov-. 
ernor Scranton can make_ $, this late date. 
America must have a man In the White 
House who respects State's rights. My great-
great-great-grandfather left Virginia for 
Tennessee, for the unknown lands, to have 
freedom of religion and be free of England's 
rule. That is what has been handed to us?
We have worked for the rest. We must 
keep it.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: This looked like 
something you should have and should share 
with Senator ORDERING. Should even insert 
It in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
McNamara's war is Johnson's war now and 
the idiocy Is incurable.

SINCE WHEN WAS DYING RINE? 
(By Henry J. Taylor) 
41 think the military situation is coming 
along fine now," 'U.S. Gen. Paul D. Harkins 
Stated June 22 on his return to Washington 
from command in South Vietnam. This was 
apostasy, tragic to observe. 
Fine. That's Defense Secretary Robert S. 
McNamara's line. Ant it's utterly heart-
breaking to see a distinguished officer ped-
dling that kind of pap under McNamara's 
censoring eye. God help us. This is what 
happened to the prewar armed forces In 
France. 
Any of about 16,000 Americans in South 
Vietnam could tell you how fine the situa-
tion Is. Our entire position is just a long, 
drawn out Bay of Pigs all over again. 
In another sense?an even more basic 
sense?the truth about a war is known only 
to a soldier under the gun, there or anywhere, 
ever. 
It's easy to confuse morale with a desire to 
fight. I've never known one soldier in a 
thousand who wants to fight. Most fight for 
a dozen other reasons combined; but, oh, 
no, not that one. 
Along with hunger, fear Is a universal emo-
tion. It has nothing to do with bravery. 
Anybody with any sense is afraid. 
,,Nothingis fine when you're getting 
shot at. - 
Nothing's fine when you start to count the 
missing and the dead, and you do not know 
how it could happen that one of them is not 
you. 
Nothing's fine when the road blows up and 
your eyes go blind because something 
smashed them closed. You're afraid to open 
them, because you may not be able to see. 
Or it's pitch dark anyway and your face?
do you still have a face??is flat down in the 
mud. 
Nothing's fine when you hear a sharp, hard 
"ping"?a single shot?and you feel the man 
next to you in a jeep or helicopter suddenly 
strain his body against yours. A moment 
ago he was your friend. Now he is dead, 
He is lost, to everyone who loved him, and 
to the world, He will never see morning 
again, write a letter or sing a song. He has 
no hope and any hope of this world in him 
Is gone forever. 
It's easy to discuss the problem of war?
in South Vietnam, Laos, anywhere. But this 
is different and it is the essence of war. 
One man. Men in their prime, dying one by 
one. 
General Eisenhower Once said in a letter to 
Ernie Pyle: "I get so eternally tired of the 
general lack of understanding of what the 
frontline soldier endures?the acceptance of 
unendurable conditions?that I become com-
pletely inarticulate." 
Or listen to Ernie Pyle himself. 
We were In Italy. An infantry column was 
coming out of battle. All ranks were 60 feet 
apart, for dispersal. So were Ernie and I. 
The wounded were lying with the dead be-
cause the Germans had shot our litter 
bearers when they stood up and walked over 
to get them. That night this is what Ernie 
wrote: 
"The line moves on but it never ends. All 
afternoon men kept coming STOUnd the hill 
and vanishing eventually over the horizon. 
There is agony in your heart. The sag of 
their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaus-
tion. They're just guys from Brooklyn and 
Main Street, but you wouldn't remember 
them if you saw them. Their world can 
never be known to you." 
Each day In South Vietnam armed Amer-
icans die quietly, tragically, unknowingly, 
obediently. 
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who personally 
takes over in South Vietnam now, recently 
admitted to the Armed Forces subcommit-
tee that we control nothing there. 
Fine? As at the Bay of Pigs and the give-
away of Laos, the United States is defeated 
again. But not a noisy debacle, mind you, 
nothing noisily noticeable. General Taylor's 
task is to see that the collapse stops short of 
that. 
On June 24 able Washington insider James 
Reston wrote in the New York Times: "This 
RCIMIDISDISHOIS is not prepared to accept any 
spectacular defeat in South Vietnam, par-
ticularly in an election year." 
In short, Americans are just to die quietly, 
tragically, unknowingly, obediently?while 
nobody rocks the political boat until No-
vember. 
Isn't there anything?anything, anything, 
anything?that can bring conscience into 
politics?

DEAR SENATOR HUCHEL I SGMHOT WAYNE 
MORSE, of Oregon, is reported in today's news-
papers as saying that there is no justifica-
tion for the U.S. course in Vietnam, and that 
the only way a major war can be averted is 
for the American people to stop it. 
I agree with Senator MORSE. / agree also 
when he says that the greatest threat to the 
peace of the world is the United States. 
-U.S. military action in any part of Asia is 
Inexcusable. We have here on our own con-
tinent problems of greater magnitude when 
it comes to matters of social justice and 
malignant behavior. 
I am requesting that you support Senator 
MORSE and oppose escalation of U.S. military 
action in Asia. The situation in South Viet-
nam?and other areas of southeast AMU-
15671 
should indeed be put before the United Na-
tions. 
Very truly yours, 
L. A. LAUER. 
SEATTLE, WASH.,

DEAR SENATOR, MORSE: I have followed your 
speeches in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD with 
great interest and heartily agree with you 
and your colleagues who are opposed to the 
dangerous American adventure in South Viet-
nam and now in Laos. 
It is appalling that the administration is 
supporting a government that does not have 
the backing of its people and steadily moving 
toward a potential world war. 
Even worse is the virtual blackout In our 
press of views stich as yours. If more Ameri-
cans have access to the facts as raised by you 
there would be More opposition. 
/ would appreciate receiving copies of your 
speeches so that I could Inform others. 
Your courage is commendable, , 
Sincerely,

nam, and relative to the United States func-
tioning through the United Nations.

Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SW.: Someone should tell you, I think, 
that your views as expressed on the "Issues 
and Answers" program on TV Sunday, June 
28, were very much appreciated. 
As you suggested?if we keep on moving 
down the blind alley that we are In now 
there may not be much to boast about after 
the smoke clears away. 
While to be sure I don't want Russia arm-
ing Cuba against us as they were doing at 
the time of the "missile crisis" it sure still 
beats the ham out of me to figure out how we 
could justify the bellowing we did at that 
time when we just stop to consider that we 
had men and military supplies in many 
areas of the Far East for years before Russia 
slipped into our hemisphere. 
As you said Sunday, war and especially 
nuclear war is unthinkable as a sensible 
means of settling disputes. Let pride be 
damned if it must but there is Just no sense 
In saving face at the reckless expense of a 
ruined future for millions of people Includ-
ing ourselves quite likely. My mother had 
four sons and one daughter and ended up 
with five of us in the armed services at one 
time or another and I'm telling you that if 
I feel any more secure today than I did be-
fore the first one of us went, it is simply 
because I've learned not to let the state of 
international affairs worry me so much as it 
once did. All our armed might, mighty as 
It is, has merely, so far as I'm concerned. 
made our problems greater instead of our 
world safer. 
Incidentally, wouldn't that BARRY Gotn-- 
Winn be a reckless reuben in case he should 
get charge of things in an emergency? I 
really believe he stands out as a freedom 
smasher. 
Mr. MORSE, I hope / haven't been too dis-
tasteful for your digestion and may God

DEAR SENATOR: Thank you for your 
thoughtful and courageous talk on "Issues

The Honorable WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
Dear SENATOR MORSE: I heartily agree with 
you in regard to our present policy in Viet-
nam. 
I have asked the Honorable Adlai E. Steven-
son why the United States is going it alone 
in South Vietnam, why a U.N. force isn't 
there, but have not had a satisfactory reply. 
Also, what has happened to SEATO? 
I am extremely worried that the war in 
Vietnam may lead to World War III. God 
forbid. 
How can the United States glibly talk peace 
while spending enormous amounts of money 
for arms and interfering in civil wars? 
I object having my tax dollars (I'm 63 and 
would like to semiretire) handed out to 
South Vietnam or any other country where 
we have no right to be. My heart aches for 
the poor Vietnamese who have endured un-
told suffering for so many years. How heart-
less can we get? 
I am proud of you, Senator MORSE, and 
agree with your statement to the Senate 
"that this country will go down in history 
as the nation chiefly responsible for scuttling 
the United Nations." It appears our faith 
in the U.N. is badly shaken. 
Do you suppose that one of these days 
before it's too late that others in Washington 
will come to their senses? Or, are they en-
joying the cold war and interfering in the 
self-determination of other peoples? 
Thank you for your courage. My hope 
and prayer is that soon others will join you 
in protesting the continuation of the war 
in Vietnam. It's our men who are losing 
their lives needlessly. 
Respectfully, 
MRS. MARY O'NEILL HAYES. 
P.S.?I saw you on "Issues and Answers" 
Sunday and you were great.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE; As an American, and 
a concerned supporter of the United Na-

your views on Vietnam as stated on ABC's 
Sunday program "Issues and Answers." This 
agreement also stands for your views on 
Laos. 
I am not an Oregonian, but were I a con-
stituent of yours, I would proudly wear a 
WAYNE MORSE campaign button. Good luck 
to you and the Democratic Party from an-
other reconstructed Republican. My wife, 
apparently somewhat brighter than both you

since her first vote, and sends her greetings.

DEAR SENATOR: I am inclined to support 
you in your attitude of the policy toward 
southeast Asia. 
I am inclined to fear any nation that is 
all powerful, and that includes our own. 
' I fear a "prevention" war toward Red 
China on a national policy under the guise 
of a forced peace. 
"Peace" yes?but "peace on our terms" 
could lead to war with a nation such as Red 
China. We felt we were entering on her 
internal affairs. 
You have a tough job in combating the 
Pentagon-industrial complex. 
Sincerely, 
LA MCGELL/NARY. 
ST. LOUIS, MO., 
June 29, 1964. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your appearance on 
TV was very enlightening to me, as I had 
not understood what was going on in Laos, 
and I only wish that the administration 
would take as sensible an attitude. The 
American people actually are not given much 
information as to what choices are possible 
in such situations. Our, leaders make the 
decisions without consulting the people, al-
though this is supposed to be a democracy. 
We do not have any more genuine leader 
in public life today than you have proved 
yourself to be over a considerable period of 
years. 
SPENCER WILLIAMS. 
WASHINGTON, D.C., 
June 30, 1964. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I had the good for-
tune of being present in the Senate gallery 
on June 29 when you made your speech 
criticizing the U.S. foreign policy of military 
intervention in southeast Asia. I applaud 
both your stand against the United States 
policy in Vietnam and your suggestion for 
the establishment in troubled areas of a 
peace force under the direction of the 
United Nations. 
A specific issue which I as a professional 
botanist am concerned about is the use by 
the United States of chemical defoliants on 
the Vietnam flora. Use of chemical defoli-
ants is a form of CBR warfare which we (the 
United States) categorically deny using. I 
suppose it is argued that economic crops are 
not sprayed and therefore the people are not 
affected. Nevertheless severe damage to the 
local flora will quickly lead to an imbalance 
in both plant and animal communities and 
eventually will have a direct affect on the 
inhabitants. The ultimate magnitude of the 
destruction of such a defoliation program 
cannot be imagined. 
The responsibility that you show by mak-
ing public the important issue of the mili-
tary situation in southeast Asia is greatly 
needed. I can only hope that other ears 
were tuned to your speech. 
Sincerely, 
PETER K. FLEPLER, Ph. D.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: May I commend your 
courage in speaking out against our involve-
ment in South Vietnam. 
If, indeed, intervention is necessary, / be-
lieve It should be handled through the 
United Nations. 
It frightens me to know that Mx. Lodge 
is being replaced by a general; this seems to 
indicate to me that we are heading toward 
a full-scale war. 
It is my hope that enough thinking people 
will seek a more peaceful solution in these 
troubled areas. 
Please keep your voice heard, Mr. MORSE; 
many of us are listening.

many friends,

answers. Surely we do not want war in Asia, 
and for a long time I have wondered why this 
had not been taken to the United Nations. 
Have not liked the way Mx. McNamara has 
taken over. He is apparently so sure of him-
self. Is there any way to change the Presi-
dent's attitude, so that a peacemaking force 
could take over? 
Have long admired your stand.

We were glad that through the "Today" TV

It is heartening to find someone with the 
courage to speak out in opposition to the 
stand being taken by some of his own coun-

this in the United States at present might 
be construed as being on the side of the

WASHINOTON.?Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Democrat, of Oregon, charged again yester-
day that the United States Is an outlaw 
nation fighting a unilateral war In southeast 
Asia. 
The Senator called South Vietnam this 
puppet of ours. 
MORSE said it may be true that Red China 
and North Vietnam are violating the Geneva 
accords on Laos, but that two wrongs do not 
make a right. 
He charged the United States is pursuing 
a course of action outside the charter of 
the United Nations, 
Speaking on a television program, MORSE 
Said that a peacekeeping operation sup-
ported by U.S. SEATO allies ought to take 
the place of unilateral U.S. action until 
such time as the United Nations can move in 
with its own force. 
He rejected the notion that In the time it 
takes to set up such operations the Commu-
nists can move in. He said it would not take

MORSE Said he had faith in President John-
son, "But I think he's being ill advised." 
MORSE, a Senate Foreign Relations Com-

want war, but American policies in South 
Vietnam and Laos are escalating the fight-

My DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am appalled 
by the threats of unlimited war If China 
continues to help the Communists in Laos 
and South Vietnam. I know that you will 
do all that you can to reach the President 
and to alert the country to the dangerous 
turn in our foreign policy. There is no one 
else in the Congress who has shown so much 
courage in speaking out against the war in 
Vietnam, and on whom we can so hope-
fully rely to mobilize others for sanity and 
responsibility. 
The following is a copy of the telegram 
which I sent to the President and to Senator 
KUCHEL last evening: 
"I do not believe that either honor or com-
monsense are served by U.S. military involve-
ment in southeast Asia. Threats against 
China may deter temporarily but they will in-
crease enmity. This is the road to war, now 
or in our children's time. It may put the 
human race in jeopardy. Real responsibility 
to mankind requires that we act through the 
U.N. and set our own house in order." 
Is It not strange that we are willing to risk 
a nuclear war to defend the freedom of Asian 
peasants who want nothing so much as to be 
let alone, yet we cannot defend the right of 
many of our own citizens to vote, or the lives 
of our idealistic young people who are willing 
to sacrifice so much for freedom here?

DEAR Soutnoit: Again I waited anxiously to 
hear your talk about the Vietnam situation. 
Your calling It McNamara's war does not

I know he wants to prove to the Republi-
cans he is not weak in foreign affairs?but 
all he proves Is that he must take responsi-

of the Vietnani war.

Senator WAyNE MORSE. 
DEAR MR. MORSE: Just heard you on TV 
and we were with you on the Vietnam situ-
ation and the U.N.. etc. You were fine 
Now for some questions and answers, 
please. 
Politics in both parties are going full blast 
now, viz the "war on poverty" and unem-
ployment, and more economy. Seems of 
much concern to our Government and the 
President at this time. While at the same 
time the House passed an outrageous Pay 
raise to Cabinet officers, Supremo Court Jus-
tices, district justices, House Doorkeeper, 
postmasters, Federal civil service. Federal 
civil service employees also enjoy fringe 
benefits, vacation pay (generous), sick leave, 
retirement benefits, and provided InFtRinIUM 
job security; also a great percentage of Dis-
trict of Columbia Federal Workers are colored. 
Last but not least the House voted them-
selves and tha Senate a nice reuse also again, 
since last yearn Where is our dollar? "An 
indefensible raid upon the Treasury," so 
states the Hunan Eve nts?a weekly Wash-
ington report. 'Our Government debt is 
sky high." 
Where do the retired and "over" age 
(limit) come in these days? Some livtng on 
very small pension or social sec:Ur-Hy. Going 
back to 1958, what have the House and 
Senate given our retired personnel arid, offi-
cers, especially the military? 
Too many of World Wars I and II had hard 
and brilliant careers in Army, Navy, and 
other services, with disabilities, unable to 
work out a full life, small pensions only. 
Why shouldn't these retired, capable men 
and women deserve some raises also? Last 
Year they were the forgotten ones and again 
this year. So far the one or two raises since 
1958 have teen pitifully Small. This year 
again, nothing for the retired military man. 
One of our living heroes, Sergeant York, has 
existed on 4130 (and less at fret) for many 
years, and not even a plaque in memory of 
his heroism. 
My husband wns in both wars?in its worst 
p: aces--and when he retired with a pen-
sion?not enough in return for his service?

Senators, for instance, reach ripe old age and

How about the Senators and the law-

instead of allowing the honorable Supreme 
Court to reign supreme?and get back to 
the Constitution of our country. 
Thank you for listening. 
Very truly and respectfully yours, 
HOGAN P. JONES. 
OTEGO, N.Y., 
June 29, 1964. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It WAS Very gratify-
ing to See and hear you on TV the other day. 
It's about time that someone got on the floor 
and told the truth about South Vietnam and 
the whole Asian question. Are we the police 
department for the whole world, I thought 
we had the U.N. fcr these trouble spots. 
I agree with you, this administration is 
bent on escalating the war or Wars in Asia 
and it looks to me and to others, that a 
behind-the-door deal- has been made. The 
Russians are pulling out or Cuba; for what 
reason? Is it a deal in which we are to clip 
Red China's wings, to save the Russians the 
job, I wonder? 
Any way, it certainly would be the height 
Of folly for this country to start to tangle 
with Red China. Our boys would just be put 
down the drain, sacrificed for nothing, as no 
matter what manpower we put in Asia it 
would be swallowed up and nothing accom-
plished. 
Was no lesson learned from France's dismal 
record In Indochina? The same man that 
beat the French is now doing it to us. I say 
Asia for the Asiatics, keep our boys and our 
tax money to home. I hope you get up in the 
Senate and howl good and loud; maybe it will 
penetrate up to high what we want. It took 
Senator KEATING VD expose the Cuban fiasco; 
you can do the same with the Asian one. 
Another thing, these Negroes should be 
gotten off the streets with their fake pas-
sive demonstrations. It's all bunk. They are 
not too interested In civil rights; when they 
finally get them by law, they will not use 
them to advantage. Their big Interest and 
major aim is intermarriage; they want to be 
white, that's their major aim. I ought to 
know how they think. I've lived with them 
for a time. If demonstrations are not 
stopped, there will be much bloodshed, I am 
sure. 
Good luck to you on Vietnam.

I think that 'talk of expanding that war is 
insanity. 
I share the opinion of the French Foreign 
Minister that this war is primarily an in-
ternal political wan 
It appears to me that we are again backing 
a strong man against the will of the local 
people. 
Information seems to he coming out now

DEAR SENATCR MORSE: I believe your stand 
on the South Vietnam question is absolutely 
correct. The :United States is guilty of break-
ing international law just as the Communists 
are. It appears that we are Just as desperate 
to gain control of this piece of property for 
the sake of prestige as they are to set up 
114.17;07 another Communist country. Being 17 years

old it scares me to think that I might have 
to serve my country in an undeclared and il-
legal war. 
The answer, of course, is the United Na-
tions. It was created to handle this type of 
situation. If the LiniWciffitates has no faith 
in its power to settle this dispute, the U.N. 
is doomed. You must continue to fight. We 
can't continue to turn our backs to the truth 
much longer. I know you have been criti-
cized on your stand. Well, keep in mind that 
there must always be men like you around 
to blast some sense into Uncle Sam?keep it 
Up. I am now going to write Senator 
DovoLss on this matter. I think he can be 
one of your helpers.

I agree with your views wholeheartedly. /t 
is a dreadful mistake for us to be escalating 
the war in Vietnam as we surely are doing 
and seem to be about to continue doing. It 
can only lead to a real major war. NATO 
and SEATO are our only hope and we must 
call upon these in as forceful a way as can 
be managed and now. I have Just written 
to President Johnson to express these same 
Views. I hope a lot of other people do the 
same, so he can realize the people are not 
supporting this dangerous new policy.

true, so logical and to the point. You seem 
to be one of the very few brave souls left. 
Our treatment of South Vietnam and Cuba 
has been a disgrace and has lost us respect 
and friends. 
I do hope that President Johnson, whom 
I believe, as you do, really wants peace and 
the welfare of mankind In general, will take

the Cuban affair. I have never been so dis-
illusioned In a man aS I have In him. Be has

be taking in Vietnam. We believe that our 
national interests will be better served by 
going to the conference table as SOOn as 
possible. To extend military action will not 
make us friends. Napalm bombs and de-

drawn from Vietnam?on leg i grounds, their

on moral ground, the- Unitel States has no 
right to force the regime oi our serpentine

as a U.S. Army veteran, I :eel pretty sure 
that our military program Is hopeless. 
Your courage?and foresight--on this is-
sue are commendable, and your speeches and 
statements are in the finest tradition of 
American politics, Just es we (rightly) 
crithize the police state that the Russians 
have imposed on the East Germans. we must 
also have the candor and coirrage to criticize

world peace."

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I hid to read in an 
obscure periodical your position against war 
Writin,13tricnkt#041411140/ZU 
empress artythiag but the mildest criticism 
of war. Can't even get a "letter to the editor 
published." Thus 1.write you to help stop 
this insanity. 
The WOHI1011gnIt and industrial-military 
complex General Eisenhower warned against 
have gained control of this 001121DIy. I 
understand every nation but this wishes to 
arbitrate or negotiate neutralism in south-
east Asia. But they prefer count-less thou-
sands of our youth be slaughtered and muti-
lated defending another corrupt military 
dictatorship In Asia. How many thousands 
were killed and maimed to produce the dic-
tatorship in Korea with recent riots against 
its corruption? Were hundreds of thousands 
of the flower of French youth slaughtered 
before they were dithen cut? I would appre-
ciate as an American citizen your answering 
me the above and the following questions: 
1. Has Congress given up - RS sole power 
to declare war, thus making this country a 
military dictatorship? 
2. What is 'the authority of this country 
for establishing protectorates in Asia backed 
with military occupation and the power of 
one man to send the country to war? 
3. Is the enclosed statement, that appeared 
in a San Francisco newspaper true? 
4. In the "aid to South Vietnam bill" will 
you include free passage to the frontlines 
for these warmongers so anxious to defend 
cart upt military dictatorships to: relieve them 
of sitting comfortably in front of their TV 
sets listening to the news of nlIPULICLIS of 
thousands of our youth and sons being 
butchered, to keep their prestige and 
interests? 
5. Is the foreign policy of this country to 
encourage, aid and abet, and protect military 
dictatorships throughout the world even at 
the cost GI LIICRISMIUS of our youth killed? 
Are they afraid to use nuclear weapons as 
they Might get hurt themselves? No wonder 
we 'have to go it alone. 
The world love this country when it 
invades Asia,- and you can count on me to 
expose the butchers from the top clown. 
Hundreds I've talked with feel- the same.

Is it moral, to slaughter peasants for a 
corrupt dictatorship engaged in a brutal and 
hopeless civil war? 
Do U.S. security interests, defined by 
the cold wanders, have a priority over the 
rights of self-determination of the southeast 
Asian peoples? Do the former, in fact con-
flict with the latter? 
Perhaps a partial answer to these ques-
tions lies in the conduct of U.S. foreign 
policy in Laos in 1958. From 1955 to 1957 
in aCCOHLRHOL with the Geneva agreement, 
the neutralist government under Souvanna 
Phouma had stabitized itself and demobilized 
most of the Pathet Lao armies. In 1958 
elections were held and resulted in a sub-
stantial popular victory for the Patna Lao 
and other leftist forces. The United States 
thereupon suppressed the democratic elec-
tions by supporting, politically and mili-
tarily, a PIOX:Wing COW.

July a 
the great majority, completely support your

I realize that President ilOnnS0n must be 
careful how he handles this controversial 
issue, this being an election year. I am sure 
that our President would like to wash his 
hands of this mass, as much as any of us, 
providing it wouldn't hurt him politically. 
However, I sincerely believe that if you 
could persuade President JOLIESCAI to be hon-
est with our citizens and to make known to 
the public the true facts ti at you have been 
courageously revealing about our involve-
ment in this war, the great majority of our 
citizens will support your position. 
The failure of President -Johnson to reveal 
these realities will encourage our cold war 
politicians to utthze this issue for their polit-

DEAR SENATOR I scan the newspapers and 
I am extremely dissatisfied with information 
about the U.S. policy in the Indochina area 
of east Asia. 
Today I read Edwin Lahey's article on 
your speeches on this subject. I am deeply 
alarmed about our policy in this area. I feel 
our policy violates the United Nations Char-
ter. Also as a practical matter I believe 
President Johnson Is trying to prove he is 
tougher than Mao Tse-tung with the fate

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I want LO congratu-
late you on your very frank and very apropos 
discussiion of the Vietnamese situation, or 
should I say disaster. 
It is very heIMMling and encouraging to 
hear a Democrat dare to criticize the Presi-
dent's policies :n Asia. I thought you were 
magnificent and couldn't help but laugh at 
the way you said everything you wanted to 
say, instead of being interviewed and led 
into answering the questions Ray Scherer 
and Nancy had evidently prepared to ask 
you. It does my heart good every time a real 
redblooded American patriot stands up and 
speaks the truth fearlessly. You are right 
about the people not being behind "Mc-
Namara's War." I have felt ever since he 
was appointed that he was a ruthless, opin-
ionated pip squeak and that we have con-
sistently lost face and ground since he was 
put in charge of our defense. I also agree 
that General Taylor should never have been 
las7 in Henry Cabot Ledge's place. /t is

As long as we have men of your caliber 
and principles, Senator, I feel our chances 
of survival as a democracy have a fighting 
chance. 
Senator, may I have a copy of this tele-
cast of the "Today" show, June 25? 
Bless You.

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
U,S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. MORSE: Congratulations upon 
your analysis and expressed convictions on 
the Vietnam situation. I saw you on the 
"Today" show June 25 and I thoroughly con-
cur with your views that the United States 
should make a desperate effort to have the 
United Nations handle the situation rather 
than try to deal with it militarily on a uni-
lateral basis. 
I am president of the Head of the Lakes 
Chapter of the Association for the United 
Nations and am greatly concerned for peace 
and feel the U.N. is our best hope for keep-
ing the peace. For years I have talked and 
preached more solid support of the U.N. on 
the part of the United States. 
?How do your fellow Senators stack up on 
this issue? Do you have much support 
there? 
Would it be possible to have a copy of your 
presentation of June 25, or another address 
in which you have dealt with this subject? 
May your tribe increase and rapidly. 
Cordially yours, 
G. TRUETT limn.

realistic views on the different political 
Issues pertaining to the foreign policy of our 
great country. 
During World War /I I was in Greece. We 
suffered under the 'German-Italian-Bulgar-

personal experience of war.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have been doing 
my best to follow American policy and action 
in southeast Asia. From what little I have 
been able to find in the newspapers (New 
York Mires and Washington Post) about 
your position, I support it fully. Please keep 
up your good work. We appear to be at the 
brink with no room within the present policy 
to turn to new means to resolve our conflicts. 
It is very disappointing to read today's Post 
and see them all but declare wax on China 
and North Vietnam, 
Since I have found It so difficult to find 
your Senate speeches reported with any de-
tail in the press, / would like to know if you 
could send me copies of your major speeches 
on Laos and South Vietnam for the last few 
months? If it is available, I would appreci-
ate earlier speeches too. 
Please continue your efforts and please

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: ROT ITICalThs, I and 
many of my acquaintances and friends have 
followed the lonely battle that you and 
others, though much too few, in the Senate 
have been waging against the brutal and 
dangerous policy of the United States in 
Vietnam. Your courage and your honesty 
are among the brightest spots in the morass 
that our Congress seems to be sinking in. 
As / write, I almost feel that I am writing 
to someone / am close to personally, and a 
typewriter is a most inadequate instrument 
to convey my admiration for you through. 
/ hope it is important to you to know that 
there are individuals like myself, and many 
others, who share with you an intense re-
vulsion against our policies in Vietnam. This 
is an issue that I believe must be carried 
to the American people, one which, I be-
neve, might 
be able to prick their collective 
conscience if the facts were known. With 
this in mind, I would like to ask you to send 
me as much of your materials on the Viet-
15677 
11RIDeSe situation as you can: speeches, in-
serts into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, arti-
cles, fact sheets, etc. To the extent that I 
can, I will use these materials to publicize 
the issues and your own activities. I am 
chairman of a campus organization called 
Voice on the University of Michigan cam-
pus, which is a chapter of students for a 
Democratic Society, a growing national stu-
dent organization which is very concerned 
about American policy throughout the un-
derdeveloped world. We believe that Vietnam 
may be all too typical of a pattern which 
may be developing. 
You may be Interested to know that this 
letter was immediately prompted by the ap-
pointment of General Taylor to replace Mr. 
Lodge as Ambassador to Vietnam, a move 
Which I feel bodes further ill to that be-
leaguered country and to the Americans 
who, I fear, in increasing numbers, may be 
sent there to fight and perhaps to die. It 
was also prompted by an article I read in the 
Cleveland Press yesterday in which you were 
quoted as saying that the United States "is 
heading for a war in Asia and will be hated 
by a majority of mankind for the next 600 
years." I am ashamed to have to say that 
/ fear you are right. Any help / may be to 
help you in your battle against this sense-
less war Is at your disposal. 
Looking forward to hear from you and 
receive your materials, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
RICHARD F. MAGIDOFF. 
P.S.?If you might be interested in more 
information about Students for a Democratic 
Society, and particularly our activities re-
garding Vietnam, please let me know.

Los ANGELES TIMES, 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, 
Los Angeles, Calif.: 
The U.S. Government would have the 
American people believe we are fighting for 
'freedom" in South Vietnam, when actually 
we are intervening in a civil war. I agree 
with Senator Warsin MORSE that the United 
States has violated the U.N. Charter, making 
us- an outlaw Nation. Are we fighting for 
American freedom 10,000 miles from home? 
Are we protecting the people of South Viet-
nam-by consistently supporting a succession 
of corrupt, repressive, dictator regimes that 
have never had, the support of the people? 
Reliable Sources tell us that the Saigon gov-
ernment has the allegiance of no more than 
SO percent of the people. We are not being 
told the truth about Vietnam. By labeling 
the Vietcong Communist we overlook the 
fact that the Vietcong, or properly called the 
National Liberation Front, is a coalition of 
many groups, peasants, certain Buddhist 
sects, the Cambodian minority and ethnic 
tribes, students:, Intellectuals, several politi-
cal parties Including the Communists. The 
NIP has the support of 70 percent of the 
Vietnamese people. The $10 million that 
General Khanh boasts about came out of 
our pockets. We continue this immorality 
by giving Khanh $1.5 million additional daily 
to fight a war that even military experts say 
can't be won. If the United States is a moral 
Nation, we should be negotiating a peaceful 
settlement, instead of sending more Ameri-
cans to be killed, instead of rattling our 
sabers at China and the whole of southeast 
Asia, instead of threatening to carry the war 
into North Vietnam and risking the possibil-
ity of a full-fledged nuclear war.

safe to assurUp front what has gone before, 
that our bloody and expensive struggle

in a world without a trace of democracy or

are aping makes no sense wnatsiever. 
f especially fully_ share your indignation 
Over our illegal war in southeast Alia, where, 
reportedly, 2515,000 Vietnamese have already 
died since 104 as a result of our highly 
efficient techniques of mass murder in a

Or offense except as they capture these from 
our fercea. gere too, it is evident, in the 
unlikely event that we win the war fcir

ASIAN POLICY ASSAILED?NORMAN THOMAS 
SAYS HOPE IAEA ONLY IN NEGOTIATION 
To the Emma: 
On June 21 you carried an editorial on the 
situation in southeast Asia which ended: 
"Military victory is not possible for either 
side in this struggle, but the danger of a 
global conflict seems to be advancing with 
fearful speed." 
On the next day in the Senate WAYNE 
moms made a bitter and documented attack 
on the administration's policy. I didn't see 
it reported in the Times and he tells me that 
it seems to be the policy of newspapers, tele-
vision stations and so forth throughout the 
country to let the administration lead us to 
war without reporting important dissent 
even in the Senate by him and Senator 
GREENING. Administration supporters have 
not yet bothered to answer them. 
Like him, I am one of those who believe 
that "in the State Department and Pentagon 
are men who think Red China will never be 
weaker than she is at the present time, and 
therefore now Is the time to finish her off If 
she resists a U.S. takeover In southeast 
Asia." 
Even In the name of the most righteous 
anti-communism, it is madness for us to em-
bark on a course that may lead to world war. 
The world in general would not think us 
champions of righteousness but of a neo-
imperialism, and even if we could and should 
crush China in a military sense, we would 
lose. 
We cannot thus organize Asia, much less 
the world, for democracy. We should be ac-
cused of white imperialism pretty much 
around the world. One shudders at the cost 
we might have to pay in money and in lives. 
Even If our present threats delay or hinder 
action by Communist forces; it is nonsense 
to think that we can get a settlement in 
Communist Asia, halfway around the world, 
and hold it simply by military power. Any 
hope there is lies in negotiation for neutral-
ity. When will the public begin to speak 
out?

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I read in the New

southeast Asia). 
In view of the fact that I have been to 
southeast Asia most of last year and spent 
considerable time traversing the length and 
breadth of South Vietnam and as I fully con-

the past, I would be keenly interested in

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: / sa v you, I think it 
was last Friday morning, on the "Today" 
show, and want to congratulate you on your 
stand on Vietnam. That we should be there, 
if at all, only to keep the peace, not to make 
war, and that we should oetter be acting 
through the United Nations, seems to me 
sensible and just. I was glad to see that 
Senator CHURCH also favored U.N. action. 
I an currently chairman of a local Mount 
Desert Island Committee :Or Peace which 
sees as its role the study and propagation 
of Intelligent- means of co 'pending peace-
ably with all peoples. Last winter we de-
cided that we did not know enough about 
the southeast Asia situatb in and that we 
should can In someone who could tell us the 
facts. We tried to set up a public discus-
Elan on Vietnam. I wrote to Senator Maws-
ranee, who is a "classmate" and old friend 
and whom I knew to be something of an ex-
pert on that region, for suggestions on 
speakers. He gave me no specific names, but-
referred me to the universiVes of this region.

for South America where I at least have in-
telligent colleagues. We remain in profound 
ignorance of what is really going on, and 
particularly of why we are there. I respect 
the abilities of Mr. Lodge and Mr. McNamara, 
but no decent American is going to support 
wholeheartedly a war entered into by the 
back door and under the cloak of secrecy. 
I shall write to MARGARET CHASE SMITH, 
from whom I have yet to get a straightfor-

much more forthright, to heed your voice. 
And I will write to MIKE MANSFIELD and

Senator WAYITE MORSE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Wish to end my 
voice to those who have already expressed 
serious concern over the deteriorating situ-
ation in southeast Asia, where our Govern-
ment has committed itself to a disastrous 
policy of unilateral military action and nu-
clear brinkmanship reminiscent of the era 
of John Foster Dulles diplomacy. Our com-
mitment to prosecution. of the war in South 
Vietnam, with the imminent possibility of 
escalation into a nuclear confrontation be-
tween East and West, is an unjustifiable vi-
olation of the U.N. Charter and the Geneva 
Agreements of 1954. As you made unmis-
takeably clear this afternoon on television's 
"Is-sues and Answers." we cannot enforce 
peace in southeast Asia., or anywhere else in 
the world, if we place ourselves above and 
outside the jurisdiction of international law. 
To judge from recent developments in South 
Vietnam, as well, as the statements from 
Washington and our military command in 
southeast Asia, it. appears that we are pre-
pared to risk an all-out nuclear Conflict with 
China in order to have our way in that part 
of the world It is preposterous to speak 
of freedom and independence for the people 
of South Vietnam and the rest of southeast 
Asia, when we are conducting a brutal war 
of annihilation in which the native popula-
tion are the victims of napalm, crops con-
taminated by poisonous chemicals, and vil-
lages which are strafed and burned to the 
grout nriAthis tine, when American public opin-
ion is bewildered due to misinformation and 
conflicting repors out of Washington and 
Saigon, It is vitally important that you (and 
the courageous minortly in Congress, such as 
Senators ORITENING and MANSFIELD I continue 
to voice load and clear your criticisms of 
present; U.S. policy in southeast Asia.. until 
such time as the American Government is 
shamed into taking a course of action which 
Is honorable and realistic. In your speeches 
to the Senate, and on such occasions as 
your appearance on "Issues and Answers" 
today, you have made an important con-
tribution to political realism, and 'what I

east Asia. As in the case of Senator Fat-
mucurs remarkable speech to the Senate on 
the divergence between myth and reality in 
foreign policy. I predict your unceasing ef-
forts to arouse the American conscience to 
the truth about Vietnam, will incur the 
wrath and indignation of those who have rea-

something which is indefensible. In closing,

Washington, 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: WEIS appalled the

Sharer) that you had labeled the President 
as a "warmonger." 
Perhaps this Is just another Sharer Inac-
curacy or worse still, an outright distortion. 
I would hope .30 as such a statement can 
only do irreparable harm to our cause in 
Florida where we are seriously being chal-
lenged by the Republicans come next No-
vember. I do hope that you can disavow this 
opprobrium and will appreciate learning 
your more temperate views in due course. 
Perhaps the most incredible part of all this 
is Senator Cirinton's failure to defend or 
dilute the assertion by Sharer.

Re interview of Mr. Ray Sherer with Senator 
MORSE of Oregon. 
NATIONAL BROADCASTING CO., 
New York, N.Y. 
GENTLEMEN: We heard the interview Mr. 
Sherer had with Senator MORSE cm the "To-
day" show June 25. On the "Today" show of 
the following morning we were dumbfounded 
to hear Mr. Sherer say that Senator MORSE 
had called the President of the United States 
a warmonger. This is a very serious accusa-
tion to make against a Senator and it could 
do irreparable damage to a public career if ac-
cepted as true by an unsuspecting public. 
We knew it was entirely untrue. 
We have long been aware that Mr. Sherer 
Is one of the reporters or commentators who 
slants his interviews by using questions that 
717 loaded or slanted, or by sneering In-
? 
ASMed For Release 2004/01/1C01:31$101:31M314614941310,0101311331=4 
flections of the voice which change the 
qtettion into: a disparaging comment. We 
concluded, rightly I think, that this was a 
tactic to Mit Senator Moan in a very bad 
light and ditcredit Ids views with which, no 
dbubt, Mr. Sherer disagreed . 
- This morning Mr. Sherer read a letter from 
Senator lylous8 and Stated that the Senator 
had not called President Johnsen a warmon-
ger.' could detect no sincere feeling of re-. 
gret apOlogy on Mr. Sherer's part. 
I can see Init two possible explanations of 
this incident, The first is that Mr. Snerer 
Was Cdfapletely unaware that he had dis-
torted and misquoted what the Senator had 
Said. If this Is true he Is incompetent and 
should not have the responsible of report-
ing to a nationwide audience. 
The seconkpossibility is that Mr. Sherer 
deliberately and knowingly altered the news, 
in _which cede complete dishonesty would 
be involved. 
Neither explanation combined with the 
weak' cOrrection given today?I cannot call 
it an apology?lcan excuse such, reprehensi-
ble tactics to chop down someone Mr. Sherer 
disagrees with. The incident has the, ap-
Peafance of inexcusable arrogance. 
can oath you that from now on a 
number of us will question the veracity of 
Mr. Sherer's statements except for news 
items which we can corroborate from other 
reporters on other networks. 
I have no connection with Senator Moses 
I do not particularly agree with him, and I 
know hp does not need me to, defend him. 
However, this flagrant violation of honesty 
in reporting could involve and reflect un-
favorably on any Senator, Representative, or 
private citizen. 
/ hope this incident will anger enough 
people In the ,country that future episodes 
of the nature here demonstrated be 
detected by the public for what they are 
and be properly resented as foul Play.

our freedom to choose some other method

Senator WAYNE Mossy, 
Senator from Oregon, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SIR: I ani enclosing a clipping from 
yesterday's newspaper?and / beg of you to 
give this article some notice and publicity in 
the Congress. 
I have a son engaged In the fighting In 
Vietnam and a husband who will surely be 
going soon if this war continues. There are 
many, many more wives and mothers like 
myself who are vitally concerned over the 
lack of any apparent concern in Washington 
over this situation. . 
Unless Congress becomes concerned enough 
to force the present administration into do-
ing something about Vietnam there may not 
only not be a Democratic administration 
after November, but a great many Members 
of Congress may find themselves without 
fobs before too much longer. The American 
public is finally becoming aroused over Viet-
nam and will demand that some steps be 
taken to end this war?one way or another. 
We are fully aware that Congress does 
not make foreign policy, but on the other 
hand our representatives should be the con-
science of this country?and many of them 
seem to have forgotten that they even have 
a conscience in this election year. 
Again, / respectfully request you take some 
action to bring this to the attention of your 
fellow Members of Congress. 
Sincerely, 
Mr. RosEaT L. Gomz. 
H.Erune J. TATLOR WRITES 
"I think the military situation Is coming 
along line now," Gen. Paul ID Harkins stated 
lune 22 on his return to Washington from 
corn/nand in South Vietnam. This was 
apostasy, tragic to observe. 
Fine. That's Defense Secretary Robert S. 
McNamara's line. And it's utterly heart-
breaking to see a distinguished officer ped-
dling that kind of pap under McNamara's 
censoring eye. God help us. This is what 
happened to the prewar armed forces In 
France. 
Any of about 16,000 Americans in South 
Vietnam could tell you how fine the situa-
tion is. Our entire position is just a long, 
drawn-Out Bay of Pigs all over again.

sense?thg truth about 5, war is known only

not.that one, Along with hunger, fear is a 
n 
u versid emotion It has nothing to do with 
bravery. Anybody with any sense is afraid. 
Fine? Nothing's tine when you're getting 
shot at. 
NOTHING'S FINE IN COMBAT 
, 
THE U.S. DEFEATED AGAIN 
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who personally 
takes over in South Vietnam now, recently 
admitted to the Armed Forces Subcommittee 
that we control nothing there. "We com-
mand nothing," he agreed. Fine? As at the 
Bay of pigs and the giveaway at Laos, the 
United States is defeated again. But not a 
noisy debacle, mind you, nothing noisily no-
ticeable. General Taylor's task is to see that 
the collapse stops short of that. 
On June 24 able Washington insider James 
Reston wrote in the New York Times: "This 
administration is not prepared to accept any 
spectacular defeat in South Vietnam, partic-
ularly in an election year." 
In short, Americans are just to die quietly, 
tragically, unknowingly. obediently?while 
nobody rocks the political boat until Novem-
ber. 
Isn't there anything?anything, anything, 
anything?that can bring conscience into 
politics?

WHAT THE TOLD ERNIE FYLE 
General Eisenhower once said in a letter 
to Ernie Pyle: "/ get so eternally tired of the 
general lack of understanding of what the 
frontline soldier endures?the acceptance of 
unendurable conditions?that I become com-
pletely inarticulate." Or listen to Ernie Pyle 
himself. 
We were in Italy. An Infantry column 
was coming out of battle. All ranks were 
60 feet apart, for dispersal. So were Ernie 
and I. The wounded were lying with the dead 
because the Germans had shot our litter 
bearers when they stood up and walked over 
to get them. That night this is what Ernie 
wrote: 
"The line moves on but it never ends. All 
afternoon men kept coming around the hill 
and vanishing eventually over the horizon. 
There is agony in your heart ? ? ?. The sag 
of their bodies speaks their in human ex-
haustion ? ? ?. They're just guys from 
Brooklyn and Main Street, but you wouldn't 
remember them if you saw them ? ? ?. Their 
world can never be known to you." 
Each day in South Vietnam armed Ameri-
cans die quietly, tragically, unknowingly, 
obediently.

program. No doubt you will receive very few

of them. 
I am very encouraged about the fate of 
mankind when I hear a Senator make the 
appeals to reasons that you did. A world of 
law is our announced goal, and we should 
live up to our professed beliefs. 
You have my complete support in your

there should be a very compelling justifica-

is obvious where the sympathies of the Viet-
namese people Ile. They are not interested 
in dying for an oligarchy possibly created 
arid certianly maintained by an alien power. 
The right of a people to self-determination 
is meaningless if we feel free to abrogate 
it whenever they disagree with our idea of 
what is best for them. 
The United States places a high value on 
liberty and life at home. /t is ironic that 
we should be so callous abroad. We should 
admit our mistakes instead of compounding 
them, and attempt to negotiate toward a 
neutral Vietnamese Government that enjoys 
the support and reflects the will of its peo-
ple. A powerful nation saving face is not 
worth the life of a single human being. The 
spectacle would be ridiculous if it were not 
also cruel. 
If, as I suspect, the President is indeed 
postponing a decision on this until after the 
election?thus allowing the slaughter to corr.

involvement in southeast Asia. All of the 
controversy on this issue that is allowed to 
appear in the press centers over whether, we 
should step up the war or simply continue it 
at its present pace, and it is indeed rare to 
hear expressed the view that we have no 
business there altogether?a view which, we 
believe, has considerable support among a 
large segment of the American people, but 
which up till recently, has lacked a spokes-
man. 
There are all too few public figures today 
willing to speak out on unpopular issues, 
and we are always thrilled to see you often 
fighting off the entire Senate?your one-man 
filibuster against the communications satel-
lite bill, on which your colleagues were for 
Once quite ready to vote for cloture, is a 
worthy argument in favor of unlimited de-
bate, despite the fact that the procedure is 
generally used for far less worthy causes. 
Keep up the good work. Only with envy 
and embarrassment can we compare Oregon's 
delegation in the U.S. Senate with our own.

ure to hear and see you on television on 
Sunday, June 29, at 1:90 to 2 on ABC news

/ agree with you in your belief that two 
wrongs do not make a right and that war 
solves no problems but creates them, also 
that the United States ought to pursue a

policy. As a professor of philosophy I found 
your arguments to be both consistent and 
cogent.

great hope today as we are surely inching

nouncement of emphasizing principle as the 
basis of conduct in the Far East is something 
that the uninformed and Ill-Informed alike 
may understand. How can President Johnson 
be made to see the light and the danger of his 
policy? With the recent revelations of the 
..,pjja,pc1 Pentagon more enlightenment may 
come. How far are these men going because 
of their idea prosperity depends upon the 
vast heavy industry deals? To have such

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: My husband and I 
heard you on a KABC program Called "Issues

don't know when we've heard such a marvel-

one tell the truth about our activities in 
Vietnam. I just want you to know we agree 
with everything you said and hope there are 
more people with us. 
What can we as citizens do about this? 
This morning the Times carries President 
Johnson's speech about being willing to go 
to war over this situation, Nobody asks the 
people any more. We're not willing to fight 
but we seem to have no voice-any more. 
Perhaps, if you'll keep speaking for us, 
we may see some sanity.

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: This Is to express in

through multilateral diplomatic action and 
work toward U.N. collaboration.

the Pacific Coast where, in spite of the dust 
kicked up by the ultraminded, there are 
those who view with concern the fact the 
European and Latin American countries are 
not Interested in our fracas, but in building 
up practical trade relations. 
In my own Instance, this concern keen 
though it is, is secondary to my very great 
revulsion at the spectacle of torture which 
we inflict on thousands of homes and fam-
ilies in order to support for political reasons 
decadent potentates who obviously are re-
pudiated by their people. I find It very dif-

EXPERTS ARE WORRIED: WESTERN EUROPE 
SUFFERING ACUTE ATTACE OF PROSPERITY 
(By Carl Hartman) 
BONN, GERMANY.?.I.VSSYSTIS Europe is SUr-
iering from an acute attack of prosperity. 
People are earning a lot more money than 
they used to, and they're not having to work 
so hard to get it. Eko they're spending it 
with an abandon that has the experts wor-
Just about disappeared 
ried. 
Unemployment has 
except In Italy. Even in Italy there are many 
places where labor is short, in part because 
high pay in other countries has drained away 
skilled hands. 
MILLION GO TO GERMANY 
-7 
Almost a million foreign workers have come 
to West Germany, and many thousands to 
Switzerland and France. They come not 
only from Italy and Spain, but from Turkey 
and Greece and even a few from Yugoslavia. 
In Wolfsburg, home of the Volkswagen, 
5,000 young Italian workmen are living three 
to a room in rows of neat wooden barracks. 
A good deal of the money they get is sent 
home?and helps bid up the prices of Italian 
goods. 
?Moved For Release 2004/1e161.1offisli,8W109{WWW_OCANREFE7 
In West Germany and Frei ce, thousands 
of goad jobs go begging for ?rant- of appli-
cants. 
The experts call this overenployment and 
say it results in excess demand. The ordi-
nary European finds such terns hard to un-
derstvad. To him things loot pretty good: 
Wages high, jobs easy to get, plenty of goods 
In the shows. 
The businessman never hat had so many 
customers, with so much n.oney in their 
pockets. , 
FARMERS DO LESS WELL 
Etiners are doing less well than the rest 
of the population despite hat ;y Government 
subsidies. Wages are so good and farm 
prospects so relatively bleak taat large num-
bers of farmers have found :ndustrial jobs. 
But they are not moving to town fast 
enough to satisfy the need of factories for 
labor. That's one reason- Jr dustrial wages 
keep !Ming up. 
Ai igh wages mean high pa ices--especially
in Italy where the law says price increases 
must bring wage increases as well. The re-
sult is that the Italian economy is getting 
as hos and breathless as a puppy chasing its 
tail an a summer afternoon in Capri. 
It's Italy, the experts say, where inflation 
is at its worst, although there has also been 
a wage explosion recently in Holland. 
EASY TO UNDERST. \ND 
From the. human viewpoint it's easy to 
understand. Italy has Ions, been a poor 
ccuntry, with the average workman earning 
only half as much as his counterpart in 
France or Britain, and only I. fifth what the 
average American makes. Unemployment 
Is traditionally' high and famdies are large. 
Between 1958 and 1968, national income in 
the European Common lVf.trket countries 
rose by half, and in Italy It increased by 
nearly two-thirds. A lot of the money went 
Into food, but more and More into TV sets 
and refrigerators. 
In 1960, only 1 Italian Jr 25 had a car. 
In 1953 it was 1 in 13. 
The result, say economists, Is that not 
enough is being saved for in' estraent in new 
plant to increase productim in years to 
come. This they find highly dangerous. 
ITALY RUNS TRADE /EMIT 
They are worried that the :tallans are buy-
ing co much goods abroad flat they are not 
able to export enough to pat for them. Re-
cent:I the United States hail to come to the 
rescue and advanced a billion dollars to help 
the Kalisz-a out of this particular hole. 
LfranCe and, to a lesser extant, Holland and 
Belgium have also been hit by this kind of 
inflation. 'Up to now, Weft Dern:911y has 
been able to avoid it. Wages here have gone 
up but production has kept in step and 
prices have held steady. 
They have held so stem y. In fact, that 
West, German firms are fit ing their books 
with French and Italian or(ers. Such trad-
ing Is favored by the gradual disappearance 
of the tariff wall between Common Market 
countries. The big and gro.ving demand for 
German goods tends to raise prices at home. 
Inflation can be catching.

West German labor unions are coming up 
this fall with some wage demands to- meet 
the price rises. If they get them, stable 
prices will, be seriously threatend in West 
Germany, too. 
The experts say they hay a remedy, hard 
and. unspectacular but effe :Bye. It's called 
holding the line, and the Wet Germans have 
shown its effectiveness up to now on a na-
tional scale. The calculation Is that every 
year roughly 5 percent mote goods are pro-
duced, so a 5-percent Mere tee in wages and

A CRUEL AND PASTY WAR 
How seriously should we take last weekend's 
threats of American military action to "re-
store" the situation in southeast Asia? Gen. 
Maxwell Taylor's appointment to replace 
Ambassador Lodge will strengthen the mili-
tary setup in South Vietnam, but gives noth-
ing to the hotheads; anti President Johnson 
went out of his way in announcing the ap-
pointment to emphasize that he was not 
contemplating an extension of the war. On 
the other hand, the deep, background brief-
71.4 on which most of the Washington cor-
Appsved For Release 2004/0105NGIMM91)1411=00039204:1/176 
respondents based their reports of renewed 
American toughness seems to have originated 
with Secretary Rusk in person. It is thus 
clear that the administration means this 
further final warning to impress outsiders 
with the threat of interdiction by American 
bombers. It may still be bluff?'-directed, per-
haps, as much to Messrs. Goldwater and 
Nixon as to Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi Minh. 
Even so, the domestic device of trying to out-
bid GOLDWATER'S lunacy is self-defeating. 
The truth is that American policy in Laos 
and South Vietnam is now in a disastrous 
situation. In Laos Communist control ex-
tends over four-fifths of the country; in 
South Vietnam the military situation is on 
paper a shade less disastrous, but all the 
evidence suggests that, outside one or two 
anti-Communist fortresses, most of the suf-
fering population would prefer to settle for 
the hardships of a regimented peace under 
the Vietcong than prolong the misery of 
war and corruption under General Khanh. 
If this is true, what would be the end of 
aggressive American air intervention? The 
bombing of Hanoi and the Vietcong supply 
lines would greatly increase the prospect of 
a direct United states-China confrontation?
and it would be imprudent to suppose that 
the Russians could remain indifferent to 
that. It would also harden non-Communist 
opinion in the whole of Asia against the 
United States. Moreover it would almost 
certainly be ineffectual. The Pathet Lao 
and the Vietcong are guerrilla fighters and 
they, will go on fighting, hampered but not 
suppressed by interrupted supply lines, until 
either the Chinese call them off or the popu-
lations of Laos and South Vietnam find an 
alternative which inspires their resistance. 
The intervention of American bombers in 
this situation could do nothing to change it 
fundamentally, and any effect It had would 
be at a heavy?even unacceptable?political 
price. 
There are in fact only two serious options 
open to President Johnson. He can, if this 
is what he wishes, claim the Indochinese 
Peninsula as vital to American security and 
send In troops to conquer it. Such an opera-
tion might be successful in the end and at a 
cost. But it would be a lengthy,' difficult 
campaign and it would have to finish with a 
long-term American occupation. To almost 
the whole of world opinion outside the 
United States, it would seem both senseless 
and immoral and It would command little or 
no support from any of America's major al-
lies, including Britain.' 
Moreover, when the full cost in men and 
Material was understood by the American 
public, the war weariness which led to the 
end even of the Korean war would be aggra-
vated by a sense of shame and exasperation 
at the futility of an operation which failed 
to distinguish between vital interests?In-
dia, for instance, or Berlin?and mere. po-
litical prestige, /f the President is not pre-
pared to recommend this, the alternative re-
mains a settlement by negotiation?a settle-
ment which must include the Chinese and 
which must in the long run involve the 
abandonment of 10 years of disastrous Amer-
ican policy. Unpalatable? Certainly. But, 
as President Kennedy bravely told his peo-
ple a year ago, not even they can expect an 
American solution to every world problem?
and the alternative (es the French found to 
their cost) would be worse. 
The Johnson administration now faces a 
test of statemanship. Clearly negotiation 
with the Chinese and the North Vietnamese 
is impracticable before the election. But, 
short of an all-out war, it must come soon. 
Tile President's best course now would be to 
follow the adviqs which Secretary McNamara 
is believed to be offering?to concentrate on 
defending what is left of Saigon-controlled 
Vietnam and the line of the Mekong River, 
meeting Communist attacks with no more 
Approved For Release 2004101116: 
than equivalent force. That situation would 
be militarily and politically uncomfortable, 
but, in the short term, not impossible. It is 
the only course which leaves the door open 
for serious negotiation later, to end what 
Walter Lippmann has bluntly called a cruel 
and nasty war that has no visible end. The 
alternatives are escalation or humiliation.

NEUTRAL INDOCHINA STILL A BUFFER?ASIA 
SCHOLAR ARGUES THAT PEIPING ONLY WANTS 
A QUIET BORDER 
(Norz.?Two weeks ago in this section, 
Prof. Wesley R. Fishel, of Michigan State 
University, wrote that the United States 
could neither withdraw from former Indo-
china nor allow it to be neutralized. Our 
only choice, he argued, was to "stay and 
fight." Here is a differing opinion on what 
our policy should be, written by an associate 
professor of sociology and a staff member of 
the Institute of War and Peace Studies at 
Columbia University. Amite]. Etzioni is also 
the author of "Winning Without War," re-
cently published by Doubleday.) 
(By Amite'. Etzioni) 
In the last few weeks, the United States 
has again escalated the war in southeast 
Asia by strafing pro-Communist positions in 
Laos with rockets which hit, among other 
targets, a Chinese mission. 
Like previous escalations, this one did not 
bring us an inch closer to winning the war; 
guerrilla wars are never won from the air. 
Like previous escalations, it Involved us more 
deeply in a war that continually costs more 
lives and resources. This involvement, In 
effect, has given Communist China the option 
to decide if and when to turn this war into 
a Korean-type confrontation. 
If tomorrow, China were to match oar 
thousands of "advisers," our mass supply of 
modern weapons and our aerial bombard-
ments, we would either have to retreat open-
ly under fire (which is quite inconceivable), 
engage in a large-scale conventional war 
(which the Democrats swore never to get en-
tanglerin again after Korea) or use nuclear 
weapons, which would at least push China 
back into the arms of the Soviet Union and 
probably instigate a world war. 
A DULLES LEGACY 
15687 
solution for southeast Asia is our expecta-
tion that it will result in Chinese domination 
of the region. China is depicted by our 
propaganda as a major aggressive, expan-
sionist power ready to engulf first the Indo-
chinese peninsula, then Malaysia and In-
donesia, and soon all of Asia. 
PEIPING OVERRATED 
A busy team of learned State Department 
staff members and consultants provides an 
endless flood of quotations from Chinese 
writings and speeches to this effect. But we 
should learn to distinguish between pro-
nouncements and policy. 
In reality, China is neither a major nor an 
aggressive power, and neutralization of the 
area would be in line with its present foreign 
policy. China's bellicose threats seek to cover 
up a quite cautious foreign policy in order 
to gain favor in the international Communist 
movement without incurring the risk of a 
major war. 
China has talked about liberating Taiwan 
for half a generation but has done nothing 
about it. China has criticized Khrushchev 
for retreating from Cuba but itself did not 
try to move Into next door Hong Kong, full 
of pro-Chinese Communists. It has not 
launched an attack on Quemoy and Matsu, 
3 miles from its mainland shore. 
Far from being the aggressive nation we 
tend to describe, it has improved its rela-
tions with Japan, Pakistan, and Ceylon, in-
creased its trade with Britain and Canada 
and won the recognition of more than 50 
countries. 
In general, Communist China's policy at 
this stage seems to be to support weak neu-
-tral governments on its borders. Cambodia 
has been such a weak neutral country for a 
decade and a half; Burma readily qualifies 
or the same characterization; Nepal is not 
exactly a formidable opponent or a Western 
ally. Yet these countries are as free as 
Pakistan or Thailand. 
Even when India's defenses collapsed, 
China did not take the risks involved in 
marching deeper into the country but lim-
ited itself to holding a border zone that has 
been In dispute for years, and over which 
even Nationalist China recognizes mainland 
China's claim. Once India was shown to be 
weak, it was left alone. 
None of these neutral countries has been 
annexed because China itself is weak. Her 
agriculture is in a mess; her industrializa-
tion is floundering; a succession of admin-
istrative crises and food shortages have left 
the country with a low morale; the Chinese 
Army is poorly equipped; China has found it 
difficult to obtain gasoline to fly its airplanes 
since the Soviet Union cut off the supply; it 
has no nuclear weapons or modern systems 
of delivery. 
For at least the next decade, China will 
have to focus on building up its industrial 
base. Whether that goal can be reached in 
less than 20 years and whether China will be 
as Stalinist and bellicose after that period 
as it is now are open questions. For the 
next 10 years, however, China is to be ex-
pected to prefer weak neutral countries on 
its borders over the risks of a fuller con-
frontation with the United States as a result 
of a violation of a neutrality pact. 
To be successful, neutralization must be 
backed by power. We must make clear from 
the onset that neutralization will win our 
support only if China and Russia will com-
mit themselves to refrain from armed inter-
vention in the neutrillzed area, and that any 
violation of these commitments will bring 
our return with a vengeance, with whatever 
force required. 
We are now, committed to protect the peo-
ple of the area from external aggression and 
to assure their right of self-determination; 
we can fulfill this commitment under neu-
tralization by setting up remote deterrence 
forces; i.e., by holding forces in a state of 
-7 
The alternative is not preventive surrender 
but genuine neutralization. In examining 
neutralization, we have not yet freed our-
selves from the Dulles tradition that sees in 
neutrality the immoral position of noncom-
mitment in the struggle between the forces 
of light and darkness as well as an invitation 
to the Communists to try to fill the resulting 
vacuum. That neutarlization is supported 
by De Gaulle (and the U.S.S.R.) is viewed 
by many in the Capital as sufficient evidence 
In itself that this idea does not warrant care-
ful consideration. 
The critical question is not whether the 
area can be neutralized but whether neutral-
ization can be made to stick and not be a 
thin cover for an American retreat and a 
Communist takeover.,In principle, neutral-
ization Can be made o work Only if it is in 
the ,interest of all the big powers concerned. 
It is my Central contention that this is the 
case in southeast Asia now.

DEAR SENATOR KENNEDY: Concerning the 
involvement In Vietnam, I hope you will 
support the position taken by Senators 
AIKEN, MORSE, PELT,, ORUENING, and BART-
LETT on the matter. 
We seem to be in Vietnam for emotional 
reasons, not for the defense of the United 
States. Defense of the country seems to me 
to be the only constitutional reason for or-
dering our forces into action, unless the ac-
tion is called for by our United Nations 
treaties. In the Vietnam matter there has 
been no U.N. action, and there has been no 
declaration of war by our Congress. This is 
another Korea-.like trap. 
Indeed our security is endangered by our 
presence in Vietnam. There Is no visible 
military advantage there which we do not 
have anyway from our naval position. 
What we seem to be getting is a progres-
sive military socialization of the American 
economy in the guise of battling communism 
in the far reaches of the world. Does this 
make sense? 
Let's settle the Vietnam adventure before 
war and ruin overtakes Us. 
Sincerely yours,

This similarity of view must have been

shouldn't turn 'tail, though. He was quite 
right in his "brinksmanship" analysis last

Senator MORSE is also quite right in ad-
vancing "the grave charge," according to Mr. 
Freedman tonight, "that the American pro-

that "he commands no support for this

SIR: I agree with you heartily In your 
summation as to the involvement abroad 
into which our country's foreign policy is 
leading us, vis-a-vis southeast Asia. The 
foolhardiness of our unilateral intervention 
there could but bring about a contest of 
wills between China and ourselves, a test 
which jeopardizes the whole world. It 
shapes up almost as though we are engaged 
Approved For Release 2004/01/16 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000500330007-7 
15689 
In "Red-baiting," hoping to lure Red China 
to move as it did finally In Korea (we dis-
believed clearly stated warnings then), to 
the end that Nationalist forces on Formosa 
may be unleashed to assault the mainland, 
and all that hardware the military have had 
around unused for so long, may be thrown 
at the Chinese?which as you have said, will 
only beget us the hatred of the Asiatic 
peoples, if not the world. Would we allow 
Chinese intervention in Mexico or Central 
America? 
/t was bad enough noting in a recent copy 
of Life magazine, torture shots of Vietcong 
by their captors, the Vietnamese, Wherein we 
Americans are indirectly implicated. Though 
the Vietnamese officer administering the 
"treatment" Is quoted as only "doing his 
duty," / believe that was the defense re-
peated by German war criminals and for 
which the German people as a whole were 
indicted. The hate reflected in the captive's 
eyes perhaps js indicative of what we can 
expect when they have license to do the 
same (not that they are not using methods 
of terror, but that's their guilt, not ours). 
Could it be possible that there are 
"vested interests" there in South Viet-
nam of which we have no knowledge, for 
which our otherwise uncalled for unilateral 
action was devised to protect? Could it be 
possible that the loss of King Ranch prop-
erties in Cuba Is what has whipped up such 
agitation in relation to that island under-
going social change?while almost complete 
disregard exists in another dictatorship 
every bit as ruthless in Haiti where the 
Murchison brothers apparently have consid-
erable property? 
Again and again, the issue of property 
seems to be what we are called upon to 
defend as against human rights, i.e., the 
desperate search of peoples throughout the 
world to change the existing status quo, 
and in great many cases to the end that 
they may have opportunity for a more 
abundant life, long denied. Just which side 
are we really on? Life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness?for whom? 
Our pretentions to the "defense of free-
dom" has a hollow ring in light of the fruit-
less struggle by some peoples In the world 
who have had to resort to whatever methods 
are available?confronted by our "shows of 
force," what can they think? 
The British seem to have learned their 
lesson, and the French theirs, but we, brash 
adolescents that we are, seemingly may have 
to learn ours the hard way. if we persist in 
our present course of unilateral action. 
That we could not have been more aware 
of historical imperatives, indicates our sad 
state of immaturity. God have mercy on 
our souls.

Re the shocking and brutal war in Vietnam. 
EDITOR, 
Life Magazine, 
New York, N.Y. 
Sia: The shoe-king photographs shown in 
the June 12, 1964, issue of Life, are "ipso 
facto" proof of' guilt as well as positive 
identification of the guilty. 
These shocking offenses against the body of 
prostrate and shackled prrsoners are against 
all canon laws pertaining to treatment of 
human beings. 
Crimes against humanity must not go un-
punished. The guilty should be held for in-
ternational war crimes trials, regardless of 
national origin, color, or race. 
To date of beginning of World War II, 
beating a prisorer with a cane; "the tortur-
ing went on intermittently for nearly 3 
hours." "A captive turns to avoid choking 
on water poured into his nose," by these 
minions of the devil, would have called for a 
court-martial and a prison sentence or, 
possible summary execution of the guilty. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE (Oregon) NM stated, 
"that the American. program in Vietnam. 
violates one International commitment 
after another. Why are American soldiers 
there? 
Let the preacher from the pulpit preach 
and let all the Christian people in Christen-
dom rise up as one nation and put a stop to 
this shocking and brutal war. 
As a veteran of World War I, I recall with 
sorrow the mockery of the slogan on 1917-18, 
"To make the world safe for democracy" and 
"this Is the war that is to end all wars."

DEAR SIR: I am writing to offer whatever 
encouragement I can in your effort to deflect 
the insane warmongers of U.S. policy in 
southeast Asia. From the material made 
available by most of our daily newspapers 
(even here in New York) it s extremely dif-
ficult to form a rational estimate of current 
happenings; the few accurate reports on 
your speeches in such journals as the Na-
tional Guardian have been a most welcome 
note of sanity in our present circumstances. 
If our country ever gets out of its present 
position of being the leader of all the most 
reactionary forces in the world, much of the 
thanks will be owed to you. Please accept 
the gratitude of one citizen. I hope that we 
are not too alone in this struggle.

DEAR SENATOR: I just read your speech of

Mr. WILLIAM WINTER, 
Editor, "William Winter Comments",

DEAR MR. WINTER: Your May 4 issue which 
I just read (forwarded from Honolulu) says 
"we have been deceived"--about Vietnam, 
etc. 
I :have a theory of deception even worse 
than, yours, viz: No military strategist in his 
right mind would undertake to maintain a 
landing by conventional tactics on a coast 
8,000 miles away from his base. with 700 
million potential enemies In the hinterland 
and the coastal inhabitants indifferent or 
even hostile. 
Therefore, since Pentagon strategists have 
done this, and have gradually increased our 
forces in Vietnam from a few advisers to 
now 18,000, and are now pressing for more; 
and since I don't. believe they are entirely 
crazy, / deduce that they have had in mind 
from the beginning the possibility of using 
nuclear weapons either on Hanoi or Peiping 
or troth whenever the necessity arose. They 
would figure this might be a good chance 
for some practice. By the use of nuclear 
weapons they might maintain an otherwise 
untenable position. 
Furthermore, / suspect that the buildup 
for peace which has been going on ever since 
last Christmas, has been to prepare the 
American public for the bad news that we 
now must undertake another oriental war, 
this time even worse than Korea.

HAROLD BASS. 
"BACKS SENATOR MORSE 
"DEAR EDITOR: Senator WAYNE MORSE, Of 
Oregon, deserves the praise and support of 
the American people for his courageous con-
demnation of "McNamara's war" in south-
east Asia. It is tragic that only a handful 
of our Congressmen realize what complica-
tions would grow out of expanding that war. 
Not only would there be the certainty of 
*Chinese participation but the very nature 
of the terrain would impel us to use tactics 
that would arouse the condemnation of ,most 
Afro-Asians and perhaps the world. 
"It would not be expedient for us to meet 
the enemy man to man in the jungle; we 
would make extended use of air power, 
napalm, poison sprays and atomic weapons. 
These indiscriminately directed as they are 
not only against people but to the destruc-
tion of vegetation and the soil itself, would 
incite the flaming hatred of most Asian peo-
ples. They feel what we seem sometimes to 
forget?that life itself is sustained by the 
"Good Earth." They know that, to date, 
such weapons have been used only against 
Asiatics. We, without our great wealth and 
atomic might would be regarded as the great 
bully endeavoring by superior size and 
weight to subdue the brave but poorly 
equipped underdog. 
"Moreover, what could we 'do with those 
parts of east Asia we might subdue? We 
have not been able to produce commendable 
results in South Korea? where, in 12 years, 
though our country has expended billions 
of dollars, the government is honeycombed 
with corruption, millions are unemployed 
and hungry, and tens of thousands of stu-
dents ELITI demonstrating in opposition the 
trend to put Japan back into control of 
South Korean business and? affairs. True, it 
would ease our load if Japan could manage 
South Korea; but to Asiatic peoples it looks 
like We are for turning the clocks back. 
Could we do any better in southeast Asia? 
Let's support Senator MORSE'S effort to get 
? us out Of there. . ?

?EAR SENATOR MORSE: In the National 
Guardian I have read your statement regard-
ing the South Asian war. I admire you for 
trying to raise the issue involved for the 
opposition to this war. This war as I see it 
is a Pentagon war used solely for the purpose 
of testing weapons and war gadgets. That is 
all, except for a church group. 
A recent letter from a soldier in this area 
wrote a letter and published in the Philadel-
phia Bulletin?in long, long?that testing of 
war gadgets is essential true?the main pur-
pose. This next door neighbor to a fellow 
who defends the other side is on the spot of 
getting his scholarship revoked by the flag 
wavers. 
The German military in 1914 was the 
strongest and bast. Look where it led Ger-
many. During the World War II the German 
military was the strongest in the world. 
Look at the result. Now the U.S. military 
is the strongest. If this military sustains its 
Asian policy It too can bring this country to 
a brink of disaster. 
You deserve much credit for speaking out 
as you do against a fatal policy than can 
only lead to discredit. 
Cordially, 
P.S.?DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Would like BO

our interference there, and hope that it will

out of envolvement that will bring about a 
war in which our sons will have to take part.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It was With deep 
gratification that my wife and I read of your 
sane approach toward a solution to the un-
declared war we are waging in South Viet-
nam. 
? It was particularly refreshing when so 
many elected officials are actually leading 
mass hysteria for war with any government 
with whom the United States differs politi-
cally. 
Your lone voice must take the same kind 
of personal integrity and courage as must 
have faced Abraham Lincoln when as a 
U.S. Senator, he alone opposed the then 
"popular" war against our neighbor, Mexico. 
I urge you to continue your fine effort 
toward awakening America toward the dan-
15691 
ger implicit In these days of nuclear power, 
and I am sure, many millions of other Ameri-
cans who have no voice also wish for a true 
peace. 
Respectfully yours,

OREGON DEMOCRATIC 
TION UNANIMOUSLY REJECTS 
SECRETARY UDALL'S PROPOSED 
ELECTRIC POWER INTERTIE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH PRIVATE 
UTILITIES 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, while 
the Democratic convention in Oregon 
last week almost unanimously, with only 
one dissenting vote in support of the 
administ tion policy, called for a Isub-
mission o the jurisdiction of the war 
in South ietnam to the United Nations, 
they una imously rejected Secretary 
Udall's pr ent proposal for an intertie 
arrangeme t in connection with the so-
called elect ? power intertie arrange-
ment with itivate utilities on the Pacific 
coast. 
Let me m ke very clear, Mr. Presi-
dent, that th Oregon Democratic con-
vention does ot object to the sale of 
power into C ifornia and other West-
ern States fro the Bonneville system; 
nor does it, of ourse, object to the sale 
of Canadian is er, after the Canadian 
treaty is impl ented. Other States 
are entitled to 'r share of the power, 
too. 
The senior Se tor from Oregon has 
never taken the p ition that the Pacific 
Northwest has a tonopoly on, or mo-
nopoly ownership the power that is 
developed from da s that have been 
built with the mone of all the taxpay-
ers of the country. . 
But we do have a F e al power policy. 
That Federal power ? licy is a sound 
Policy. Our Federal er policy gives 
certain rights, benefits and protections 
to so-called public p er preference 
users. 
The Democratic Party onvention last 
Saturday wanted to kns the specific 
details of the protection ?at Secretary 
Udall proposes as a guarI,tee in carry-
ing out the long existing ederal power 
policy. They wanted to e certain of 
protettions such as those enacted into 
law, for example, when t Bonneville 
Act was adopted in the fir- place. 
I am in accord with the c tics at that 
convention who hold that th agreement 
as tentatively proposed by t . Secretary 
of the Interior does not co tain those 
guarantees and protections , That is 
why the Oregon convention wint on rec-
ord rejecting the agreement i its pres-
ent form as submitted by the Depart-
ment of the Interior to the a ropriate 
committees of the Congress. 
it 
Last Thursday I spoke on th subject 
on the floor of the Senate afte testify-
ing before*. the Senate com ttee. I 
stand on every word that I laid last 
Thursday. I made my plea then that the 
proposed intertie agreement be made 
more specific.

Is written into the agreement the con-
struction of a Federal lire from Hoover

As the conve on point 3d out, and as 
some of us in r testimony last week 
also pointed out, ,that line is essential

I stress again that I am highly 
sinus of working out a satisfacto 
arrangement or agreement that will pro-
tect the legitimate?and I underline the 
word '"legitirnate"-Tinterest,s of the pub-
lic utilities, the legitimate interests of 
the public power group, the legitimate 
Interests of the public power preference 
_ users, and, most of all, the legitimate 
Interests of the taxpayer. 
I ain satisfied that the interest of the 
taxpayer will not be prate cted under the 
Udall agreement as offered in its present 
brim That Is why the two Senators 
, from Oregon have already served notice 
that we shall oppose the intertie agree-
ment in its present form I am hoping 
that in the weeks and mc nths ahead we 
cart work out with the S :cretary of the 
Interior and with all parties concerned 
a satisfactory adjustmerr. of the differ-
ences. 
One provision, for instance, that must 
be deleted is that which would permit 
an escape from the assurance that an 
all-Federal transmission I ne will be built 
front The Dalles to Hoover Dam. I refer 
to the sentence on page 25 of the Secre-
tary's report which indicates that it 
Might in the future be passible to build 
that line through contracts with private 
utilities. 
Under no circumstance 3, if we look at 
the agreement in its entit ety, would any 
such proposal be acceptane or satisfac-
tory to the Senators front Oregon. 
In light of the discussion, the debate, 
and the reSolution adopted by the Demo-
cratic Party convention in Oregon last 
July 4, the present adminstration would 
be well advised to note now that it is 
headed for the type of an ill-out tight on 
the power issue in MY State, such as past 
administrations, both Thmocratic and 
Republican, have experienced In the last 
25 years. It will come if there is any 
attempt to underwrite an agreement, 
such as the one proposed, which would 
rot give preference, in eft let, to the pub-
lic preference users under existing law, 
but would, rather, in effect give prefer-
enc e: to the private utilitie i.

judgment, needs much reco.nside:t tion 
and redrafting. 
This is not the first time that I h e 
found myself in this position. Not 
many years ago there were those in In 
State and throughout the Pacific North-
west who wanted me to swallow another 
Partnership program. .Under that pro-
gram the Eisenhower administration 
sought to have the taxpayers pay for the 
nonreimbursable costs of a great mul-
tiple-purpose dam and then turn the 
power generation facilities over to the 
power utilities at the darnsite. They 
called it a partnership. It was a fine 
partnership. My colleague at the time, 
Dick Neuberger--I paraphrase him, but 
I think the paraphrase is close to the 
original?said on the floor Of the Senate 
one afternoon_ 
What is praposed Is -;hat the Federal tax-
payers supply a cow, from which the private 
utilities can take the milk. 
We won both fights. Now we have one 
dam completed and another on its WRY. 
The same thing was attempted in con-
nection with one of the greatest of all 
our western dams, now under construc-
tion, the John Day Darn on the Colum-
bia. We fought that battle, and we won. 
I want my President to know now that 
we are going to scrutinize with the 
greatest of care the Udall intertie agree-
ment. I want to say to some of my col-
leagues from the Pacific Northwest who 
are on the other side, "You had better 
scrutinize it, too. You had better go 
over the proposal with a fine- tooth 
comb." 
We would like to sit down with the ad-
ministration to work out a settlement 
that will protect the consumers and pro-
tect this country's power policy. If we 
cannot arrive at such a negotiated set-
lement of this matter, we are ready to 
ht. The people in our part of the 
cf\c? iv 
ntry are ready to flight. 
embers of the Democratic Party RS-

When w rotect those people, we pro-

country and-the taxpayers as well. 
I thought l'ashould make these com-

that an attempt will be made to rush 
this matter through. I sincerely hope 
that, on reflection, the administration 
will decide to consider further before it 
acts.
