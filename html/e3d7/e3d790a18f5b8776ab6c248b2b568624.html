 Creditors and debtors are increasingly active in a growing but often secretive swap
 market for LDC debt in which banks sell or swap troubled LDC loans at less than
 their face value. Some observers believe this could lighten the LDC debt burden
 but, in our view, both creditor and debtor reluctance to use these techniques will
 maining loans to that borrower.
 Bankers, frustrated by the current approach to debt problems, are expanding their
 use of swaps to limit risks, reduce exposure to a given country, and strengthen their
 balance sheets. For some smaller banks, swaps have provided an opportunity to
 eliminate LDC exposure completely. For others, it has offered a means to
 concentrate or consolidate loans within a preferred geographic region. West
 European banks and the smaller US banks are particularly active in this market.
 The larger US banks, however, are constrained by accounting standards that
 require a bank that sells a portion of its debt at a discount to write down its re-
 loans, and 75 cents for Brazilian loans.
 Approximately $3 billion in international loans will be traded at a discount this
 year                           Purchase prices for debt range from about
 10 cents on the dollar for Nicaraguan debt to 87 cents for Colombian exposure.
 Other price examples include 25 cents for Peruvian loans, 58 cents for Mexican
 One of the most significant factors in the expansion of the swap market has been
 the debt-to-equity programs instituted by debtor countries including Brazil, Chile,
 and Mexico. In such schemes, a bank sells debt at a discount to a multinational
 corporation or private investor who transfers it to the debtor country for redemp-
 tion near or at full face value in local currency or government paper; the proceeds
 are then used to purchase equity in local businesses. These arrangements benefit
 the debtor country by reducing its external debt level and lowering the accompany-
 ing interest payments. It may also serve as a stimulus for additional foreign
 investment:

 over $500 million by next year.
 ? Mexico has just developed a system to handle the swapping of public-sector debt
 for equity in private Mexican companies.
 LDC's central bank in return for specified goods.
 The swap market also is being stimulated by the increased use of a debt-for-
 exports scheme. Under such a plan, a company seeking to import goods from an
 LDC would purchase some of the LDC's debt at a discount and exchange it at the

 Although offering relief to both sides, we believe swaps provide only a marginal so-
 lution given total LDC debt of roughly $900 billion. Some observers doubt that
 there would be enough buyers for large-scale debt purchases unless the loans are
 substantially marked down, and they doubt commercial banks would be willing to
 take the resulting losses. Nonetheless, if the market for discounted paper continues
 to grow, regulators could force the banks to value their entire loan portfolios at the
 lower market rate.
 In our judgment, bankers are worried that a growing recognition that LDC debts
 are not worth par value could lead debtor countries to argue that their obligations
 to creditors should be correspondingly adjusted downward. For example, Mexico
 might argue that, with the market price of their debt only 58 cents on the dollar,
 their debt obligations should only be $58 billion, rather than the $100 billion they
 actually owe. Alternatively, debtor countries may buy back more of their own
 debt-through third parties-at deeply, discounted rates. Thus, we believe bankers
 will continue to downplay their participation in this emerging market.

 Third World: Limited
 Economic Prospects
 During the last six years, the LDCs' economic per-
 formance has deteriorated markedly. After averaging
 5.5 percent a year in 1973-79, annual real GDP
 growth dropped to roughly 3 percent during 1980-85,
 where it is projected to remain this year. Although
 world economic conditions are becoming more favor-
 able-oil prices, inflation, and interest rates are de-
 clining-we believe a number of factors, particularly
 heavy debt burdens, reduced lending flows, and weak
 world demand, cloud the prospects for a strong LDC
 economic recovery.
 Factors Constraining LDC Economic Performance
 In our judgment, one of the more onerous economic
 constraints confronting the LDCs is their burdensome
 financial problems. In 1985, aggregate LDC external
 debt reached $850 billion, and, according to several
 estimates, is likely to top $900 billion this year. The
 ratio of debt service to exports of goods and services,
 for example, has risen from roughly 15 percent in
 1980 to over 22 percent in 1985.
 The LDCs' economic outlook is further complicated
 by the reduction in the net flow of financial resources
 from Western and OPEC sources. Between 1970 and
 1981, these capital flows steadily increased from
 $20 billion to almost $110 billion. This trend, howev-
 er, shifted in 1982-85 when official flows stabilized
 and private flows began to decline. In fact, the
 increased debt service burden and reduced inflow of
 financial resources has led to a net outflow of funds.
 We believe most of the financially troubled LDCs
 currently are caught in a vicious circle as the demands
 of debt service crowd out money available for domes-
 tic investment, thus making it difficult to stimulate
 economic growth.
 Another factor negatively affecting the LDCs' growth
 prospects is the changing nature of world trade as
 compared with the 1960s and 1970s when the LDCs
 registered high rates of economic growth. In
 particular:
 ? Weak World Demand for LDC Exports. Between
 1965 and 1975, when the LDCs registered some of
 their highest rates of export growth, the industrial
 countries' average annual real GDP growth was
 about 4 percent. This has since fallen to below
 3 percent, and world demand for LDC exports has
 declined. According to private and official forecast-
 ers, the industrial countries' economic performance
 will remain sluggish throughout the remainder of
 the 1980s, depriving the LDCs of a major source of
 demand for their exports.
 ? Falling World Commodity Prices. A significant
 change has occurred in the composition of the LDC
 exports. Manufactures have expanded from slightly
 over 15 percent of their total nonoil exports in 1965
 to more than 55 percent in 1984, but this trend
 reflects a significant decline in world demand for
 nonoil primary commodities. In all, nominal com-
 modity prices have fallen by over 25 percent from
 their peak in 1980. Moreover, many experts believe
 that continued weak demand and abundant supplies
 will push commodity prices to historically low levels
 in the next several years.
 ? Industrial Country Protectionism Persists. Since
 the mid-1970s, industrial countries have reacted to
 their own slower economic growth and rising unem-
 ployment by trying to protect their industries from
 LDC penetration of their markets. As a result, the
 LDCs' access to industrial-country markets has
 been restricted by greater use of orderly marketing
 arrangements, import quotas, and tightening of
 preferential trade arrangements. According to the
 IMF, the most severe protectionist pressures in the
 period since 1974 have come in textiles and clothing,

 footwear, electronics, and chemicals-industries
 from which many LDCs are launching their manu-
 factures export drives.
 ? Heightened LDC Protectionism. The industrial
 countries are not alone in trying to protect their
 domestic industries. The LDCs themselves are in-
 creasingly erecting trade barriers to protect ineffi-
 cient or domestically important industries, and to
 avoid making adjustments to economic policies that
 are painful, but which are needed to promote
 growth and make their economies operate more
 efficiently.
 ? Increased Trade Competition. In the 1980s compe-
 tition among LDCs for access to the industrial
 countries' markets has intensified. This competition
 has been accentuated by the emergence of a number
 of low-cost producers such as Hong Kong, South
 Korea, Taiwan, and China, as well as the financially
 troubled LDCs, such as Brazil and Mexico, which
 are more aggressively promoting their exports to
 generate the revenue they need to repay their debts.
 In addition to issues such as debt and trade, we
 'believe the LDCs' economic prospects are also affect-
 ed by their continued rapid population growth. Ac-
 cording to World Bank estimates, the LDCs' share of
 world population will increase from 75 percent in
 1980, to 80 percent in 2000, and to 85 percent by
 2050. The challenge to the LDCs is to generate a
 sufficient number of jobs to absorb their rapidly
 growing populations into productive employment.
 This rapid population growth will also require that
 LDC governments provide adequate health care, edu-
 cational and transportation services, as well as to
 ensure an adequate supply of food and energy. Com-
 bined, these demands of a rapidly expanding popula-
 tion will impose a significant drag on the growth of
 the LDCs' economies.
 We believe there are several indications that world
 economic conditions are becoming more favorable and
 may be a stimulus to the LDCs' future economic
 performance. Oil prices are way down. Inflation is
 declining sharply. Interest rates are falling. Exchange
 rates have moved into a much more sustainable
 configuration, and substantial adjustment of trade
 and current account balances is under way.
 The LDCs cannot assume that their economies will be
 propelled by the factors that contributed to their high
 rates of economic growth during the 1970s. The
 evolving structure of the world economy means that
 they will have to adopt new, flexible policies for
 economic development such as a greater role for the
 private sector, realistic exchange rates, agricultural
 reform, and a more favorable investment climate.
 Some LDCs such as the newly industrializing coun-
 tries of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and
 Taiwan probably will be able to capitalize on the
 improvements in the world economic environment.
 We believe the economic prospects of most LDCs,
 however, will depend on their ability to respond to the
 changes that are occurring in the structure of their
 own and the world economy-their burdensome fi-
 nancial problems, the changing nature of the world
 trading environment, and their population growth.

 China: Reformers
 Pressing Ahead
 The 1986 slowdown in Beijing's economic reform
 program is most likely a temporary phenomenon.
 More stable economic growth, slower inflation, and
 political setbacks for key conservative opponents have
 given reformers new opportunities to advance their
 programs. This summer Beijing has aggressively
 launched experiments designed to test the influence of
 market forces on enterprise fundraising, the allocation
 of capital, and labor mobility. In June, China's Na-
 tional People's Congress Standing Committee debated
 an enterprise bankruptcy law. While the scope of
 these new experiments has been limited so far to
 selected enterprises and particular cities, Chinese
 leaders appear to be building momentum toward an
 announcement of the next phase in the reform pro-
 gram-possibly including new price reforms-before
 the end of the year.
 for renewed reform efforts. Although seemingly
 strong last fall, conservative critics of reform recently
 have suffered some serious setbacks. Aggressive inves-
 tigations into the illegal activities of the children of
 senior officials have damaged the reputations of sever-
 al key opponents of reform, and recent discussions in
 the Chinese media about interference in factory deci-
 sion making by low-ranking party officials reflect
 Beijing's determination to attack reform critics at all
 levels. In addition, reformers have won a lively debate
 on the applicability of Western economic theories to
 China's development strategy, and conservative ideo-
 logues have been forced to lend support publicly to the
 study of Western philosophy, economics, and human-
 ities in Chinese universities. Some reformers appar-
 ently have felt confident enough recently to argue that
 greater democracy within party and state organs is
 necessary if economic reforms are to achieve their
 maximum benefits.
 Last year the Hong Kong media reported that party
 conservatives took advantage of numerous economic
 problems-such as skyrocketing investment spending,
 soaring inflation, a burgeoning trade deficit, and
 declining foreign exchange reserves-to criticize
 Deng Xiaoping and his reform coalition for economic
 mismanagement, and to press Deng to slow the pace
 of reform. Beijing announced in January that 1986
 would be a year of adjustment and consolidation in
 the reform program. We believe that reformers or-
 dered this pause, apart from conservative pressure,
 because they recognized the need to slow growth and
 improve macroeconomic control techniques before
 further decentralizing economic decision making. In
 addition, Beijing probably wanted to use the pause to
 allow Chinese economists to form a concensus on
 what the next steps in the reform program should be.

 Beijing's success in throttling back an economy that
 was racing out of control last year also has opened the
 way for new reform experiments. Measures enacted
 last year have slowed excessive industrial growth,
 runaway capital spending, and inflation-key subjects
 of conservative criticism in the past. Official statistics
 indicate that industrial output increased at a
 4.9-percent annual rate during first half 1986, com-
 pared with the unusual 23-percent rate registered a
 year earlier. Capital construction grew at an annual
 rate of 9.5 percent during the first quarter-faster
 than Beijing wanted, but only one-fourth of the rate
 experienced last year. In addition, preliminary first-
 quarter statistics indicate that prices are rising more
 slowly .than during the last half of 1985. The trade
 deficit is the most serious problem this year and was
 apparently little changed in the first quarter from the

 The Ma Ding Controversy
 A 30-year-old philosophy professor writing under the
 pseudonym Ma Ding touched off a sharp public
 debate over the relevance of Western economic theo-
 ries to China's economic reforms by publishing an
 article titled "Ten Major Changes in China's Eco-
 nomics" in a party newspaper last November. The
 scholar argued that "no ready answers can be found
 in Das Kapital" to guide the development of a modern
 socialist economy and that "Chinese economists must
 free themselves from Marxist books ... and found a
 new branch of economics. " Ma also argued that
 Chinese economists must study the writings and
 experience of Western theoreticians, including Keynes
 and Samuelson. In an editorial on 19 December, a
 left-leaning Chinese-language newpaper in New York
 with connections to the PRC criticized the Ma Ding
 article for presenting the view that Marxist political
 economy has lost its vitality. This past March, senior
 conservative ideologues apparently tried to use the
 New York editorial as the basis for stifling discussion
 of how Western economic theories could be used in
 China's development and attacked reform policies in
 general. According to the Hong Kong press, senior
 leaders-including Deng Xiaoping-ordered the
 ideologues to cease their attacks. Reformers respond-
 ed with a flood of articles extolling academic free-
 dom and supporting economic debate as necessary to
 advance modernization. By May, the swell of support
 for open discussions of economic theories forced the
 same ideologues who tried to cut off the debate to
 acknowledge publicly the need to study Western
 concepts.
 The slowdown in economic growth resulted largely
 from credit restraints and cuts in state construction
 projects. Policies limiting the imports of electronic
 components and automobile parts apparently have
 reduced growth rates in finished goods industries.
 Chinese officials also have indicated that the slow-
 down has been caused by "subjective" factors-such
 as complacency on the part of managers because of
 last year's strong performance, and worker dissatis-
 faction caused by central efforts to limit wage and
 bonus increases this year.
 Although the Chinese press chronicled complaints this
 spring by government officials who were dissatisfied
 with the poor performance in the energy sector and
 thought that industrial growth had fallen too low, we
 believe the economy is likely to come close to achiev-
 ing the target of 8-percent industrial growth set early
 this year. The recent 13.5-percent devaluation of
 China's currency, moreover, probably will boost ex-
 port performance by the end of the year.
 Broadening the Role of Market Forces
 Although Chinese leaders remain concerned that the
 economic problems experienced last year may re-
 emerge, Beijing is encouraging a wide-ranging debate
 among Chinese economic advisers over what the next
 steps in the reform program should be. We believe a
 consensus is emerging that China should rely on more
 markets to allocate goods, capital, and labor, and
 Beijing has promoted experiments this summer de-
 signed to test the impact of market forces on enter-
 prise fundraising and labor mobility.
 Goods Markets. In the past, local governments pre-
 vented enterprises in other regions from competing
 with factories in their own jurisdictions. This protect-
 ed local revenues and prompted the development of
 enterprises that manufactured all components re-
 quired in the production of the finished product.
 Beijing now is urging all localities to remove artificial
 barriers to commerce and is promoting the develop-
 ment of specialized enterprises to serve broader geo-
 graphic areas.
 Enterprise Fundraising. Reform economists are call-
 ing openly for the establishment of a capital market in
 China. Since April, enterprises in five Chinese cities
 have been allowed on a trial basis to issue shares to
 individuals and other businesses. Shares owned by
 individuals may be resold, given away, inherited, or
 mortgaged-but are not traded in organized markets.

 surplus workers. Beijing also apparently will step up
 efforts to phase out the "life-tenure" employment
 system under which workers are given jobs for life and
 paid salaries that do not depend on individual produc-
 tivity. According to press reports, Beijing will allow
 enterprises to hire an increased share of workers
 under fixed-term labor contracts-making it easier
 for factory managers to adjust the size of their work
 forces according to production needs. Under experi-
 mental labor policies in one Chinese city, 95 percent
 of workers recently hired were given labor contracts.
 A further indication of renewed reform momentum
 this summer is that Chinese leaders have drafted and
 are debating China's first enterprise bankruptcy law.
 By providing lenient terms under which unprofitable
 state enterprises can receive government support to
 reorganize their operations, the law appears designed
 to prod enterprises to improve performance-rather
 than to shut down large numbers of firms. Neverthe-
 less, it is an important step in furthering market
 accountability in China. In 1985 enterprise manag-
 ers-convinced that Beijing would bail them out

 of greater decisionmaking authority by excessively

 Secret
 Experiments with industrial reforms have been under
 way in China since 1979, but the pace and scope of
 implementation accelerated after the urban reform
 program was ratified by the Communist Party in
 October 1984:
 ? Reduced Central Planning-Only about 60 major
 industrial products, such as steel, petroleum, and
 chemicals, remain under mandatory state produc-
 tion quotas. Although many enterprises still must
 meet production plans established by departments
 and local governments, reformers want to use eco-
 nomic incentives increasingly to guide enterprises
 toward general production targets.
 ? Increased Enterprise Autonomy-Enterprises can
 retain a larger share of their revenues, and manag-
 ers have more leeway to develop production plans
 and decide how to use retained earnings. Enter-
 prises now have the right to sell overquota industri-
 al production at prices above state-set levels. Last
 year, some industrial enterprises, on a trial basis,
 were allowed to adjust wages upward or downward
 on the basis of profits earned. Exporting
 increasing capital construction and worker bonuses.
 This year the government signaled its intention to get
 tough by publicizing the results of an experimental
 bankruptcy regulation in one Chinese city, which will
 close down an unprofitable state-owned enterprise in
 August and auction off its assets to meet its debt
 obligations.
 According to press reports, the bankruptcy law
 sparked a sharp debate when the State Council in
 June submitted it to the National People's Congress
 Standing Committee for deliberation. Some commit-
 tee members argued that China is not ready for a
 bankruptcy law-pointing in particular to the irratio-
 nal price system that obscures enterprise efficiency by
 forcing some factories to sell their output at prices
 significantly below market levels. Implementation of
 the law also is likely to meet strong resistance from
 firms are allowed to retain a portion offoreign
 exchange earnings for their own use, and a few
 state enterprises have been granted independent
 authority to sign contracts for technology deals
 and joint ventures.
 ? Price Reforms-Beijing took a cautious approach
 to price reform last year. The key reform imple-
 mented was the removal of controls on retail prices
 of vegetables, meat, and other nonstaple farm prod-
 ucts. Beijing also removed price controls on sewing
 machines, watches, and some brands of bicycles,
 and-to encourage greater use of highway trans-
 port-raised short-haul railroad rates for passen-
 gers and freight.
 ? Increased Use of Monetary and Fiscal Policies-
 Since 1979 Beijing has strengthened the powers of
 its central bank while increasing the range of
 indirect credit controls that the bank can use.

 revenues during 1983-84, and is now considering

 local officials who fear the economic-and political-
 costs of unemployment when enterprises close. Other
 officials have stated, however, that Beijing will pro-
 mulgate the law within a year.
 One of the controversial issues being debated this
 summer is price reform-which is crucial to the
 success of the overall reform program. Despite the
 success of most management reforms, Chinese offi-
 cials have complained that many firms that benefit
 from high state-set prices have taken advantage of
 increased autonomy to reap large profits, even though

 Secret
 their production efficiency is low. While some eco-
 nomic advisers are pressing for implementation of new
 price reforms, Chinese leaders-remembering last
 year's surge in inflation when some price controls
 were eased-are reluctant to proceed until they are
 convinced that prices have stabilized.
 Beijing ultimately plans to establish a more rational,
 three-tiered price system. Prices of key products will
 still be set by the state, but at levels that better reflect
 relative scarcities in the economy. Prices of many
 other products, including most manufactures, will be
 allowed to fluctuate in response to market conditions
 within bounds set by the state. Supply and demand
 alone will determine the prices of some consumer
 goods and overquota production of most industrial
 goods.
 So far, experiments testing the impact of market
 forces on capital and labor allocation have been
 limited to selected enterprises in a few cities-and
 discussions of bankruptcy and new price reforms have
 not gone much beyond rhetoric. Nevertheless, reform
 leaders clearly are building momentum, and we be-
 lieve they will move ahead with key reforms in late
 1986 or early 1987 if Beijing can maintain economic
 stability in the next six months
 By broadening the reform program, Beijing could
 reduce many of the inefficiencies in the economy, but
 it also risks renewed economic instability:
 ? Increased enterprise authority to raise money by
 issuing shares would promote capital formation, but
 could also reduce Beijing's control over the direction
 of investment.
 ? Reforms in labor policy and enterprise bankruptcy
 would spur increases in managerial efficiency and
 labor productivity while risking heightened social
 tensions that would accompany increases in
 unemployment.
 ? Price reform would allow increasingly auton-
 omous enterprises to base production decisions on
 rational signals-promoting more efficient use of
 resources-but would threaten greater inflation in
 the short run.
 Although the economic reforms mark a sharp depar-
 ture from Soviet-style central planning, they are not
 designed to transform China into a capitalist econo-
 my. Even if the reforms are implemented fully, the
 state will continue to control the large industries, and
 a high percentage of production will still fall under
 the mandatory plan. Moreover, Beijing will still allo-
 cate a large share of investment, limit labor mobility,
 and maintain extensive control over banking and
 foreign trade.

 scapegoat.
 Cuba is experiencing its worst financial difficulties
 since it began rescheduling its hard currency debt in
 1982. Faced with declining export earnings, Havana
 has almost totally exhausted its hard currency re-
 serves and increasingly resorted to expensive short-
 term borrowing. Western creditors have insisted on
 major import cuts before considering requests for
 rescheduling of debts falling due in 1986-87, and
 Moscow apparently has refused increased hard cur-
 rency assistance. Havana has not yielded to creditor
 demands and unilaterally suspended interest pay-
 ments on both its official and commercial debt coming
 due in early July. Fearing that cuts in Western
 imports would further slow production and fan domes-
 tic discontent, Cuban economic planners appear to
 hold unrealistic expectations for a surge in nontradi-
 tional exports and modest import substitution efforts.
 As pressures build, President Castro could again
 allow many of the disgruntled, unemployed, and
 imprisoned to leave the country and could even re-
 nounce at least some of Cuba's hard currency debt in
 an attempt to turn the creditors into a collective

 head off popular dissatisfaction.
 Despite Castro's announced plan to limit import
 spending, hard currency imports grew by at least
 7 percent in 1985. Havana was forced to purchase
 sugar in Western markets to meet its export obliga-
 tions to Moscow, while controls on imports of produc-
 er goods were eased to stimulate the economy and
 According to official Cuban financial data, Cuban
 hard currency export earnings could not match the
 increase in imports last year. A sharp drop in world
 sugar prices, weather damage, and the diversion of
 sugar exports to the Soviet Union contributed to a
 34-percent drop in Cuba's hard currency sugar earn-
 ings. Despite Cuba's energy conservation measures,
 falling energy prices toward the end of last year cut
 Cuba's income from the resale of Soviet oil-its
 largest foreign exchange earner-by 5 percent. Start-
 up delays, planning and distribution problems, agri-
 cultural disasters, and the continued impact of the US
 trade embargo also were cited by Cuban officials as
 major factors retarding the growth of hard currency
 exports last year.
 Early indicators point to a continued hard currency
 trade deficit in 1986. In particular, Cuban planners
 estimate that plunging world oil prices will cut hard
 currency oil reexport earnings in half. Meanwhile,
 damage from Hurricane Kate last November will cut
 sugar production from 8 million metric tons last year
 to about 7 million tons this year. In addition, Havana
 signed a large number of fixed-price contracts before
 the recent rebound in world sugar prices. Cuban
 officials estimate that hard currency income from
 sugar will fall by more than $50 million this year.
 Finally, Cuban efforts to develop new export products
 and markets have made little progress because of
 Cuba's well-documented problems with quality con-
 trol and transportation, its limited technological base,
 and foreign exchange shortages
 Havana emphasized
 the "impossibility" of reducing imports because a
 large part of Cuba's imports has already been con-
 tracted for and, that doing so, would cut Cuba's
 production of critical exports. Havana drew down its
 foreign exchange reserves from $248 million-or
 about two and a half months of import coverage-at
 the beginning of this year to about 2 weeks' import
 coverage by May, according to press reports. The
 recent flurry of short-term commercial borrowings by
 Havana suggests that Cuba continues large import
 purchases. Official Cuban statistics reveal that short-
 term commercial credits tied to imports now account
 for more than 30 percent of Cuba's more than

 Apparently having dug in its heels against the severe
 import cuts demanded by its creditors, Havana hopes
 to ease the foreign exchange crunch with several
 modest adjustments:
 Cuba is pressing
 its Western suppliers to barter goods for Cuban
 exports, primarily sugar.
 ? In a move toward greater import substitution,
 Havana recently called for the collection of scrap
 metal, paper, and textiles, according to the Cuban
 press.
 ? To support dwindling foreign reserves, the National
 Bank of Cuba is attempting to salvage precious
 metals by establishing specialized stores to ap-
 praise and purchase gold and silver coins and
 jewelry from Cuban citizens, at world market prices
 according to the Cuban press. Western press reports
 that the gold mine on the Isle of Youth, closed for
 the past 25 years, has been reopened.
 So far, Moscow apparently has refused to bail Ha-
 vana out of its current financial crisis and may even
 be relishing Western creditor demands of financial
 discipline from its spendthrift client. The Soviet
 Union apparently is holding firm on its refusal earlier
 this year to significantly increase hard currency assis-
 tance to Cuba and
 agreed to no major new capital investment
 projects in Cuba during the 1986-90 plan. More
 recently, according to US Interests Section sources,
 Soviet officials in Havana said that Moscow denied
 Cuba's request to reduce sugar deliveries to the
 USSR.
 Capping hard currency assistance to Havana would
 be in line with Moscow's previous criticisms of Ha-
 vana's economic mismanagement and wasteful hard

 In the end, financial stringencies probably will force
 Havana to yield more to Soviet pressures to substi-
 tute often inferior Soviet Bloc goods for hard curren-

 Western consumer goods into Cuba is likely to slow
 further unless the transactions can be funded profit-
 ably by the state, as with the government-operated

 state exorbitant prices in hard currency to purchase
 consumer goods for their friends and relatives in

 It also would help ease Moscow's own hard

 oil production and low energy prices. We believe

 we expect the Soviets would comply only as a last
 resort if Havana is unable to strike an agreement with
 Western creditors. Even then, we believe Moscow
 would require tough austerity measures as a price for
 the aid.

 At this point, however, hints of debt repudiation
 probably are designed to extract additional conces-
 sions from the Western lenders who want to maintain
 a chance of eventual repayment. Castro almost cer-
 tainly realizes renunciation would effectively freeze
 Cuba's access to foreign currency inflows, and, with
 little or no foreign reserves remaining, Cuban plan-

 lukewarm reception Castro received last year in his
 creditor nations as a collective scapegoat to justify image would, in Castro's eyes, outweigh the cost
 sharply increased austerity, and he may also believe associated with a cutoff from Western lenders.
 such a move would regain some prestige lost last year
 when he was criticized by some Third World leaders
 for not following his own calls for debt renunciation. The Emigration Safety Valve
 The continuing stream of
 hard currency imports, despite the near elimination of
 foreign reserves, may indicate that Havana is stocking
 its shelves with critical Western goods in case the
 decision is made to cut ties to Western lenders.
 Another surge in Cuban emigration is a distinct
 possibility as the regime struggles to provide an outlet
 for the disgruntled, unemployed, and imprisoned cur-

 Belgium: Deficit Politics
 Belgium's large public-sector deficit-12 percent of
 GNP in 1985, one of the highest in the OECD-is
 probably crowding out private investment.' Prime
 Minister Martens's Social Christian-Liberal govern-
 ment is making deficit reduction a top priority, claim-
 ing its reelection last year as a mandate. The govern-
 ment is pledged not to raise taxes, however, and
 coalition politics hamper efforts to cut spending. The
 recently announced budget for 1987-which took six
 weeks of intense bargaining between the coalition
 partners-probably will result in a deficit of at least
 10 percent of GNP, well above the government's
 8-percent target. Further delay in reaching debt
 reduction goals will make the task more difficult and
 threatens coalition stability.
 Belgium's large public-sector deficit reflects the con-
 sequences of slow growth, high unemployment, and
 generous social welfare coverage. Public expenditures
 soared from 39 percent of GNP in 1974 to 56 percent
 just eight years later as Brussels tried to ease the
 social costs of slower economic growth and to assist in
 the adjustment of the aging industrial sector. Unem-
 ployment-which peaked at over 13 percent in
 1985-also forced increased spending on unemploy-
 ment compensation and job creation. Because of
 Belgium's slow economic growth, government reve-
 nues did not keep pace with increased expenditures
 and Brussels's borrowing requirement rose from
 3.5 percent of GNP in the early 1970s to a peak of
 13.2 percent in 1981-one of the highest in the
 OECD.
 Interest payments on the soaring debt-which now is
 more than 100 percent of GNP-have been the
 fastest growing component of government expendi-
 tures over the last few years. In 1985 these payments

 The Martens government has followed an austerity
 program since 1982 in an effort to reduce the deficit.
 The initial goal was a deficit of 7 percent of GNP by
 1985, but the political sensitivity of expenditure cut-
 backs has led Brussels to continuously push back the
 target date, and the level last year was 12 percent.
 Past measures included restraining wage increases for
 public-sector employees, delaying civil service bonus-
 es, and cutting welfare programs-especially family
 and unemployment benefits. These efforts have re-
 duced government spending for consumption and
 transfers by almost 2 percent of GNP, but this gain
 has been wiped out by higher interest payments.
 There has been less emphasis on raising taxes al-
 though there have been some increases such as social
 security contributions and the value-added tax. To
 make last year's spending reductions politically palat-

 tax brackets and made a 2.25-percent reduction in

 marginal tax rates to be phased in over a three-year
 period. As part of its deficit reduction effort, Brussels
 also introduced a debt management program in 1985
 to convert short-term foreign debt into long-term
 bonds with lower interest rates. The Finance Ministry
 has also issued about $150 million worth of zero-
 coupon Eurobonds.

 ing-were needed
 As with most controversial decisions in Belgium, the
 coalition's discussions on the 1986 and 1987 budgets
 were arduous and were not completed until late this
 spring. Before negotiations began, Martens described
 the attainment of a deficit of 8 percent of GNP by
 1987 as "do or die for my government." To achieve
 this goal, tax increases or spending cuts of $4.2-4.7
 billion-more than 10 percent of projected spend-
 next two years.
 The budget that emerged called for limited measures
 for 1986, since the year was nearly half over, but
 outlined a somewhat vague plan to reduce the deficit
 by $4.1 billion in 1987. Although Martens generally
 opposes higher taxes, the budget provides $375 mil-
 lion in new revenues by restoring the value-added tax
 on construction to its normal level and eliminating
 some tax deductions. Brussels will take advantage of
 lower domestic interest rates by refinancing some of
 its debt at a savings of over $600 million in 1987. The
 government also estimates that lower energy prices, a
 cheaper dollar, and lower international interest rates
 will save an average of $300 million annually over the
 The largest cuts-$1.1 billion-will be made in social
 programs and unemployment benefits. The govern-
 ment is reducing hospital capacity, instituting a user
 fee for some medical tests, cutting some public em-
 ployment programs and privatizing its workman's
 compensation fund. The most controversial move is
 the $440 million reduction in the education budget,
 most of which will derive from the elimination of
 14,000 secondary school teaching positions. The edu-
 cation cut reflects Budget Minister Verhofstadt's
 determination to reduce the teacher/student ratio, the
 highest in Europe.
 The Defense Ministry is also hit by the budget axe.
 While there will be a 2-percent nominal increase in
 defense spending this year, it will be followed by a
 3.4-percent decrease in 1987-to be achieved mainly
 by cutting equipment expenditures. Finally, business
 subsidies will be cut-including a $200 million reduc-
 tion in R&D subsidies-while public investment will
 be decreased by pressing ahead with the privatization
 of portions of the telecommunications industry and
 the medical insurance sector.
 The 1986 and 1987 budget plans announced by
 Brussels almost certainly will not put Belgium's finan-
 cial house in order. The US Embassy reports, in fact,
 that the deficit may actually rise this year to nearly
 13 percent of GNP. We believe this puts the 1987
 target of 8 percent out of reach.
 Even if Martens resists making concessions on spend-
 ing, the government probably will miss its 1987 deficit
 target because many of the budget cuts are uncertain
 or overestimated. Many Belgian economists are
 claiming, for example, that sure savings from the
 budget amount to only $2.3-2.5 billion rather than the
 government's projected total of $4.1 billion. US
 Embassy officers estimate that, if the remaining $1.6-
 $1.8 billion in cuts are not realized, the deficit will fall
 to only a bit less than 10 percent of GNP in 1987.
 In our view, however, some further spending conces-
 sions are likely. In particular, Martens will be hard
 pressed to resist easing spending cuts affecting Catho-
 lic unions and schools. Martens's Flemish Social
 Christian Party relies heavily on the backing of the
 Catholic unions, which in recent years have been
 drifting toward Belgium's socialist parties. Moreover,
 Brussels may find itself spending more money than
 anticipated on subsidies for aging and troubled indus-
 tries such as coal and steel
 Implications
 The longer Brussels postpones serious deficit reduc-
 tion, the more difficult the task becomes because of
 the burden of servicing the growing debt. According
 to Embassy estimates, Brussels would have to cut the
 deficit to 6 percent of GNP in 1987 if it is to have any

 chance of stabilizing the debt/GNP ratio before the
 next election due in 1989. Alternatively, the debt
 burden could be stabilized if real GNP growth were to
 average 4 percent annually over the next few years,
 but our estimates are only about half that rate.
 Consequently, we expect government debt to rise to
 perhaps 112 percent of GNP by 1990.
 We believe the budget deficit is having an increasing-
 ly negative impact on the economy, mainly by crowd-
 ing out private investment. By 1984, private invest-
 ment accounted for only 14 percent of GNP compared
 with 21 percent in 1974. The combination of falling
 private investment and government austerity has held
 economic growth to below 2 percent in each year of
 this decade, and probably will limit 1986 growth to
 about 1.3 percent.
 The budget plan for 1987 also will hinder efforts to
 reduce unemployment because it cuts programs that
 have helped to lower joblessness from over 13 percent
 last year to the current 11.6 percent. In addition,
 Brussels's plan to eliminate teaching positions is likely
 to strain government-labor relations as well as the
 unity of Martens's Flemish Social Christians. In the
 weeks encompassed by the Coalition's budget negotia-
 tions, there were numerous strikes by public employ-
 ees, and we expect them to continue-albeit at a
 diminished level-for some time to come. Meanwhile,
 the need for more deficit-cutting measures leaves
 open the possibility of decreased stability in the
 governing coalition.

 Algerian Borrowing    International lenders are increasingly wary of Algeria as a result of the
 Prospects Wane        country's declining petroleum revenues. Algiers has borrowed $700 million
 since February and plans to borrow another $200 million this year to soften the
 impact of domestic austerity. Nevertheless,
 the success of Algeria's last syndication in mid-June stemmed primari-
 ly from the skillful management of the Arab Banking Corporation and a US
 bank rather than international interest in the loan. Soft oil market conditions
 threaten to cut Algeria's oil earnings in half, which would push the debt
 service ratio above 80 percent for the year. Moreover, since 1983 Algiers has
 abandoned its stated goal of reducing its foreign debt that probably exceeds
 $20 billion. At a minimum, further Algerian borrowing will be on less
 favorable terms-Algiers has received some of the best terms of any Third
 World country-and probably will have to be used to finance imports of basic
 necessities such as food rather than of capital goods. In addition, a prolonged
 slump in oil prices below $15 per barrel may force Algiers to pursue some form
 of debt relief before 1988.

 $1 billion to $600 million between 1982 and 1985 despite bilateral trade
 agreements with all 10 member countries. Mexico City hopes to boost exports
 to its Latin trade partners to ease its trade deficit, but, in our judgment, trade
 improvements will be limited. Member countries lack the funds to increase
 imports significantly and are focusing instead on boosting their own exports.

 Initial Resolution     In a victory for France, the European Space Agency (ESA) adopted a
 on Hermes Spaceplane   resolution on making the French-designed Hermes spaceplane an ESA
 program. ESA members will meet in October to define the program's stages,
 including division of work and financing. The French have long sought West
 German participation in Hermes, and, although Bonn voted for the resolution,
 it is not scheduled to make a final decision until this fall. The West German
 vote may reflect its growing support for greater European independence from
 US space programs. Current plans call for construction of two Hermes
 spaceplanes about one-fifth the size of the US shuttle, with initial launching in
 1996. London took the lead to ensure that, unlike the Ariane program, ESA
 and not the French space agency will control Hermes. Financing for the
 $2.8 billion project-which must be decided by mid-1987 to keep the program
 on schedule-will probably, in part as least, have to come out of existing
 programs. A final decision this fall on Hermes most likely means that the
 British-initiated HOTOL-whose more advanced engine technology would
 allow use of a regular runway-will not be a part of ESA's initial spaceplane

 would limit the technology Thomson could provide to the Soviets in the
 MT-20. A more modern exchange-the E 10-MT-was eventually substituted
 when the original supplier, Thomson-CSF, merged with another French
 electronics firm, CIT-Alcatel. The E 10-MT has more than twice the call-

 in the quality of communications for military and government users. France
 did not notify COCOM of the original sale and is unlikely to volunteer

 political ties to the Pacific Basin, especially ASEAN, but have usually focused
 on countering Western proposals and excluding the United States. It is
 possible that ASEAN's lukewarm reception for General Secretary Gorba-

 Lebanese Unions       In reaction to the rapidly declining economy, the General Confederation of

 UNESCO building, the GCLW scheduled widespread demonstrations for 17

 offer positive economic reforms. Union goals transcend confessional politics
 and are moderate in tone. The demonstrations were prompted by high
 inflation-estimated by the US Embassy at 20 percent per month-and
 government inability to handle mounting internal debt, which is expected to
 increase 50 percent in 1986 and add to inflationary pressures. This month's
 strikes represent the first collective response by Lebanon's formerly prosper-

 makes successful implementation more difficult. Babangida so far has not
 provoked the vociferous public opposition that forced him to abandon IMF
 negotiations last year, but he probably still lacks the consensus needed to
 resolve crucial economic and social problems.

 military supplies.
 Liberian               Despite progress toward implementing US-recommended economic reforms, a
 Economic               recent spending binge prevented Liberia from making a payment on official
 Developments           US loans last month, triggering Brooke Amendment sanctions that could block
 disbursements of most types of US assistance, according to the US Embassy.
 Liberia, meanwhile, has been able to reduce domestic tensions by paying back-
 salaries with recently issued local currency. Monrovia probably will make the
 loan payment soon, but its resolve to pursue economic reform will be tested lat-
 er this summer once the new currency is depleted and the government is again
 faced with the need to reduce expenditures drastically. Stringent austerity
 measures or renewed delays in wage disbursements could aggravate labor
 grievances and strengthen support for the opposition.
 Pakistani              The level of concern many Pakistani officials have toward opposition leader
 Provincial Minister    Bhutto was recently demonstrated by the impromptu announcement by the
 Hikes Minimum Wage     Chief Minister of Sind Province that the minimum wage would be doubled to
 $63 per month-matching a proposal by Bhutto. The US Consulate in Karachi
 reports that a Sind Department of Labor official said that the proposal took
 government officials by surprise. The higher minimum wage would, in fact,
 leave many workers ineligible for death and injury benefits. Passage by the
 provincial assembly of the required legislation is doubtful due to the low
 priority of labor issues within the assembly.
 Soviet Defense         In a recent speech, Party Secretary and Politburo member Lev Zaykov said
 Industry Support for   that the leadership had decided "to make more active use" of defense
 the Civilian Economy   industries in the 1986-90 plan to produce civil machinery and consumer goods.
 At the Supreme Soviet meeting last month, Chairman of the Council of
 Ministers Ryzhkov spoke on the leadership's intention to involve all machine-
 building ministries, including the defense industry ministries, in production for
 light industry. The defense industries produce machine tools, computers,
 microelectronics, and telecommunications equipment and could make a major
 contribution to the modernization campaign. The Minister of the Shipbuilding
 Industry recently indicated that he was being tasked to increase production of
 consumer goods and complained about not being allocated enough computers
 to fulfill his modernization tasks. Pressure on the defense industries to support
 the modernization campaign and consumer goods program apparently is
 building. Earlier leadership statements had called on defense industries only to
 share their management expertise with the rest of Soviet industry. Help to the
 civilian sector may limit the pace of defense-industrial modernization, but it

 does not necessarily imply any cuts in weapons production. Because of major
 investments since the mid-1970s, the defense industries are well positioned to
 accommodate the relatively slow growth in weapons production projected by
 the US Intelligence Community.
 Soviet Minister       Nikolay Panichev has replaced Boris Balmont as Minister of the Machine Tool
 of Machine Tool       and Tool Building Industry, according to TASS. Balmont, who had held the
 Industry Replaced     post since 1981, was said to have retired, although he is only 59. The change
 reflects General Secretary Gorbachev's determination to root out resistance to
 his industrial modernization program. The Ministry has come under public
 attack for low-quality production, and Premier Ryzhkov criticized Balmont
 last month for failure to support managerial reorganization intended to spur
 technological innovation and to raise efficiency. Balmont had also proposed
 performance targets for his Ministry that were less ambitious than national
 plans. Panichev is a strong proponent of rapid retooling and modernization of
 the machine tool industry. He favors the importation of Western robots and
 control systems for automated equipment.
 New Soviet            The Soviets are developing three new civilian transport aircraft they claim will
 Airliner Programs     be superior to Western designs. The aircraft will emphasize efficiency and fuel
 economy and will incorporate technologies roughly equivalent to current
 Western state of the art-including digital avionics, sidestick controls, com-
 posite materials, and turbofan engines. The new Soviet aircraft are unlikely to
 match the performance of those in the West or to offer much sales competition
 except in client states. Previous Soviet experience suggests the aircraft will not
 meet Moscow's performance claims, in part because the USSR has been
 slower than the West in introducing new manufacturing technologies. Never-
 theless, the transports will probably give Aeroflot additional flexibility in
 augmenting military cargo aircraft in carrying troops and, to a lesser extent,
 equipment for a variety of domestic and international missions.
 East German Economy    East Germany reported last week that most major economic goals were met
 on Target in First Half for the first half of the year. Produced national income and industrial
 production both were 4.3 percent above year-earlier levels, about in line with
 annual targets. East Berlin claimed that labor productivity in industry rose 8.6
 percent, more than planned-high-tech sectors showed the greatest increases.
 Computer output reportedly rose 112 percent and integrated circuits 30
 percent. Although aggregate growth figures undoubtedly are inflated by price
 increases, the economy apparently is continuing its fairly strong performance
 of the past three years. The East Germans probably continued their recent
 pattern of hard currency trade surplus in the first half(
 The
 reported acceleration of the economy in June suggests that, like last year,
 second-half growth rates may be somewhat higher. Fulfillment of most annual

 goals would keep growth high by East European standards and would confirm
 in East German leaders' minds the wisdom of their current economic strategy.
 Yugoslav               The government last week reversed a two-day-old increase in bread and flour
 Bread Price            prices. It noted the price rise-which averaged 60 percent-would adversely
 Rise Revoked           affect workers and blamed regional authorities for improperly handling the
 decision. The rollback follows public warnings by some officials in poorer
 southern Yugoslavia that the price hikes could increase public discontent.
 Food prices in June were 109 percent above levels a year earlier. Such a quick
 turnabout is highly unusual and spoils the impression of decisiveness and
 organization that Premier Mikulic's new government is trying to project.
 Belgrade outlined its broad new price policy only two weeks ago and is already
 considering other changes. Despite desiring government action on the econo-
 my, the public remains unwilling to accept subsidy reductions. Mikulic will
 have to improve coordination with regional and public bodies to implement
 other price policies, as well as his broader program for economic recovery.
