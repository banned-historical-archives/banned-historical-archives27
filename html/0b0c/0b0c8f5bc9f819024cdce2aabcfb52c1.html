 August 10, 1967         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 industry is to furnish its proper share of
 these needs, prompt action is necessary
 and I join with my colleagues in urging
 that proper and prompt action be taken
 by the Secretary of Commerce.
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I
 take second place to no man in my ad-
 miration of the excellent judgment,
 sound leadership, and expert knowledge
 of American housing needs and pro-
 grams possesed by the Senator from
 Alabama.
 When he speaks as he has today, he
 does it with good reason and logic. I
 agree with him and I am amazed at the
 facts he has laid before us.
 Improved housing for all citizens, as
 he has told as, has been a consistent pol-
 icy of the Senate and of the House for
 many, many years. But apparently, we
 have a department of Government, re-
 luctant to support the intent of the Con-
 gress.
 I have confidence in Secretary Trow-
 bridge, and though he is new in his pres-
 ent responsibilities, I hope that he will
 reject the advisory panel's recommenda-
 tions.
 Certainly, on the evidence the distin-
 guished Senator from Alabama has
 given us, the existing lumber standard
 should be withdrawn and the industry
 permitted to go ahead with its new and
 improved product. This would be a true
 public service.
 I hope the Secretary will permit the
 industry to do the job it is trying to ac-
 complish.
 Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, it has
 long been recognized that the present
 lumber standards are technically inade-
 quate and not in the public interest. As
 early as 1957 the southern pine industry
 petitioned the American Lumber Stand-
 ards Committee to revise the standards
 to relate lumber sizes to a specific mois-
 ture content. In 1964, after several years
 of careful study, the committee recom-
 mended to the Department of Commerce
 a set of standards endorsed by the major
 part of the lumber industry and many
 interested Government agencies. Still, we
 are operating under standards developed
 in 1925, which have become totally un-
 realistic because of changing practices
 in the industry.
 These outdated standards are an in-
 convenience to the industry and unfair
 to the consumer. Only a small minority of
 green lumber producers derive any bene-
 fit from the present standards. The
 standards now in effect are intended for
 dry lumber but are not related to any
 specific moisture content. Since lumber
 shrinks  as  it  is  seasoned,  however,
 standards which do not take into ac-
 count the moisture content are really no
 standards at all.
 This was no problem before World War
 IT, because green lumber was surfaced
 to a larger size than dry lumber to com-
 pensate for shrinkage. Since the war,
 however, green lumber producers have
 been finishing their product to the same
 size as dry lumber and the shrinkage has
 been passed on to the consumer.
 The purpose and effect of the revised
 standards proposed by the American
 Lumber  Standards  Committee  is  to
 establish uniform standards upon which
 the consumer and the industry can rely.
 The Secretary of Commerce has the re-
 sponsibility and authority to withdraw
 the present inadequate standards with-
 out further legislative action. I strongly
 urge him to assume that responsibilty
 and exercise his authority promptly in
 order that revised standards, which will
 protect the public and promote the con-
 tinued development of the industry, may
 be adopted without Aurth: r delay.

 STATES TOOK A CLEAR STAND
 FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY
 IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, in the
 aftermath of the swift and decisive vic-
 tory of Israel forces over the Arab
 armies, a number of facts have become
 crystal clear which had previously been
 obscured by the rhetoric of the Arab
 governments, by the material support
 provided by the Soviet Union to the Arab
 military forces, and by the confusing and
 uncertain policies of the United States.
 It is imperative that these facts not be
 swept under the rug and forgotten in
 the feeling of relief that now exists be-
 cause the shooting has ceased. Such feel-
 ing is entirely understandable in the
 light of the serious situation which would
 have confronted the United States had
 the roles of victor and vanquished been
 reversed and if the Arab armies now
 occupied Israel, and Soviet Russia in con-
 sequence would have dominated the Mid-
 dle East.
 Nevertheless, if a start is to be made
 in establishing a lasting peace in the
 Middle East, a frank appraisal of the
 underlying causes of the conflict is es-
 sential. Unless we face up to these factors,
 we must anticipate resumption of hos-
 tilities, with all the dangers that would
 entail for the world, in the next' 5 or
 10 years, or even sooner.
 The roots of the conflict can be found,
 in my opinion, in the unremitting hos-
 tility of the Arab countries to the very
 existence of Israel and in their illusion
 that Israel can be destroyed by force of
 arms; in the Soviet Union's support of
 such illusion and its attempt to use the
 Middle East as a pawn in its cold war
 tactics; and in the mistaken policy of
 the United States that economic and mil-
 itary assistance to the Arab nations
 would somehow divert these countries
 from aggression. If these issues were not
 clear to the American people before, even
 though some of us in the Congress have
 over the years been pointing out the
 dangers of U.S. Middle East policies, it
 must be abundantly evident now that to
 return to the conditions and policies of
 our Government prior to May 1967 can
 only bring about renewed conflict. Be-
 cause of this, I would like to discuss
 today in some detail the root causes of
 the conflict as I see them and to suggest
 some possible alternative courses by our
 Government.
 Arab opposition to the very existence
 of Israel and its view that the United
 States is the principal culprit responsible
 for Israel's continued existence have
 been expressed in such hyperbole and in-
 vective that we have been inclined to
 discount such statements as expression
 of policy. But recent events have shown
 S 11275
 that we cannot dismiss these statements
 so lightly or attribute them to domestic
 propaganda efforts at bolstering the flag-
 ging morale of peoples for whom the
 promises of a better life have not borne
 fruit-largely through their own short-
 comings and the ineptness of their lead-
 ers-and who now must be sustained by
 the ideas of a mystic "Arab unity" and
 the recapture of territory which they
 never rightfully possessed. It is now evi-
 dent that statements of Radio Cairo and
 of the Arab governments, as irrational as
 they sound to our ears, are indeed ex-
 pressions of policy. We must now rec-
 ognize that when the Arab leaders pro-
 claimed toward the end of May 1967, that
 "we feel confident that we can win and
 are ready now for a war with Israel,"
 and that if war came "it will be total
 and the objective will be to destroy Is-
 rael," they had every intention to carry
 these threats into action. Indeed, their
 secret orders provided for the slaughter
 of every Israeli-man, woman, and child.
 Events have proved that the Arabs
 meant what they said and indeed pro-
 vided us with a detailed blueprint of
 their aggressive intentions as witness the
 following excerpt from a broadcast of
 Radio Cairo on May 20,1967:
 With the closing of the Gulf of Aqaba,
 Israel is faced with two alternatives, either
 of which will destroy it: it will either be
 strangled to death by the Arab military and
 economic blockade, or it will perish by the
 fire of the Arab forces encompassing it from
 the south, from the north and from the east.
 It is now evident that the statements
 of King Hussein of Jordan regarding his
 solidarity with the Arab cause, which the
 United States tended to discount since it
 conflicted with its picture of a plucky
 little ruler strongly aligned with us by
 the massive economic and military aid
 the United States had furnished him,
 provided a precise account of the course
 of action Jordan would follow.
 On June 2, 1967, King Hussein said:
 There is no doubt that I am looking for-
 ward to further frank cooperation with Egypt
 and the other Arab States both to the east
 and to the west, so that we may march for-
 ward along the road which leads to the wip-
 ing out of our shame and to the liberation
 of Palestine. This is a basic cornerstone bf
 Jordan's  general  policy,  both  within  the
 realm of Arab  affairs,  as well  as  in  the
 spheres of internal and foreign policies.
 That "plucky little ruler" then pro-
 ceeded to initiate hostilities against the
 Israelis, employing the tanks, aircraft,
 and other weapons the 'United States
 furnished him to carry out plans which
 had previously been made in coordina-
 tion with the Egyptians, placed his forces
 under  the  Egyptian  command,  and
 opened his country to Iraqui forces
 which began to move several hundred
 tanks into the Jordanian salient 15 miles
 from Tel Aviv.
 This action by King Hussein came after
 a plea to him by Israel not to, attack ac-
 companied by Israel's pledge that, if he
 did not, there would be no Israeli inva-
 sion of the territory then held by him.
 It is time-that the United States took
 a good, hard look at the statements com-
 ing out of the Arab countries and begin
 to recognize that no matter how illu-
 sionary and irrational they may seem to

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         August 10, 1967
 us, they represent the hard convictions
 of the Arab rulers. Unless we do this, we
 will continue to base our policies and
 actions on the fanciful notions of what
 we would like the Intention of the Arab
 governments to be rather than on what
 is actually planned.
 Statements emanating from the Arab
 countries In recent weeks show not the
 slightest realization of the magnitude of
 their military defeat, of the loss of size-
 able territories to the Israelis, and of the
 resultant precarious economic situation
 which their aggression brought upon
 them. For Egypt it has meant the loss of
 the Suez Canal revenues. To put it
 briefly, their view is one of unremitting
 hostility both to the United States and
 to Israelstated In abusive and often vio-
 lent language. The United States is the
 arch villain, an imperialist, colonial
 power and Israel is its tool of aggression.
 Here are some samples:
 On July 19, 1967, the Cairo Voice of the
 Arabs stated:
 It appears that the outcome of the recent
 tripartite aggression masterminded by the
 United States has enthralled the Israeli gangs
 and driven them into a euphoria of self-de-
 lusion and arrogance, whereby they are now
 brazenly aspiring to realize dreams and am-
 bitions that will never be attained . . . Is-
 rael, the dog of imperialism and the panderer
 to the world imperialist forces, is today con-
 templating and dreaming of passage- through
 the Suez Canal ... This Zionist attempt
 enjoys the encouragement and support of the
 imperialist forces. No evidence of this could
 be more eloquent than the United States'
 insistence upon making the withdrawal of
 the aggressor forces contingent upon  the
 fulfillment of the conditions contemplated
 by the United States, which are- of course in
 favor of the Israeli aggression: against the
 Arabs-such as free passage for Israel in the
 areas' waterways ...
 Lest these words again be dismissed as
 domestic propaganda, here is an excerpt
 from the July 23, 1967, statement of
 Egyptian President Nasser, which, unbe-
 lievably, has been greeted as a temperate
 and reasonable address by some news-
 papers in this country:
 A large part of the U.S. role in the recent
 aggression is still vague. But we already know
 a few things; We have already found the an-
 swers to several questions. What was behind
 the political and diplomatic role which the
 United States played before the battle? This
 role included the call for self-restraint, the
 threat that any action taken by us would
 expose the entire region to dangers, the pro-
 posal to send the U.S. vice president to con-
 fer with us on the subject, the approval of
 Zakariya Muhyi ad Din's trip to Washington
 to meet with Johnson to confer on the sub-
 ject and to try and reach a solution. All this
 took place before the aggression, before the
 battle.
 It was a deception. We must ask: in whose
 interest was this deception? Certainly it was
 in the Interest of the Imperialist Israeli ag-
 gression. The deception was part of a U.S.
 plan drawn up two years ago.. The aim of this
 plan was to overthrow the free revolutionary
 regimes, which do not heed the words of the
 big powers and refuse to be under anyone's
 influence.
 The New York Times, in a recent edito-
 rial  appropriately  entitled  "Fantasy
 From Nasser" charges that in accusing
 the United States of an imperialist con-
 spiracy to destroy Egypt's Socialist revo-
 lution, Egypt is guilty of fantasy. The
 editorial goes on to say that:
 In spite of his impulsive seizure of Suez, his

 August 10, 1967         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 pantomine, the Egyptian Army demonstrated
 how it had won the great war of 1956.
 The scene was at Suez, where a handful
 of heroic Egyptians held off and finally de-
 feated not an Israeli army but invaders
 storming ashore from French and English
 battleships. For each Egyptian soldier, scores
 of Frenchmen and Englishmen rushed on-
 stage, only to be overwhelmed by sheer cour-
 age. In the end, the invaders had to re-
 treat, whereupon the Egyptian defenders fell
 into a tableau of victory as fine as any I
 had ever seen. The great powers had been
 driven off, and Egyptian honor was once more
 secure.
 I looked about- me at the audience, and
 it was apparent that the adults, many of
 whom must have participated In the events
 thus portrayed, had begun to accept this
 version as history. Their eyes glowed, and a
 real patriotism suffused their faces. As we
 left the park, I saw one young boy of nine
 or ten lunging out with an imaginary bayo-
 net to hold off imaginary Frenchmen and
 Englishmen. When I made inquiries about
 the performance, I found that it was paid
 for by the government and was repeated
 throughout the year.
 The whole thing was fantasy, of course,
 and certainly no worse than similar versions
 of English history offered in London or
 French history in Paris. I am sure that
 parallel perversions could be found in Amer-
 ican folklore, and I doubt that much harm
 is done to children by this patriotic non-
 sense. But in the case of Egypt and the other
 Arab lands, there was an additional danger
 because  adults,  too,  were  accepting  such
 fables:  college professors, university stu-
 dents, newspaper editors, businessmen be-
 lieved that Egypt had won a great victory in
 1956. I could find no evidence that anyone in
 public  life was willing to admit that in
 Egypt's military adventure against a handful
 of Jews, the latter had easily won.
 All nations engage in fantasy, but few
 Indulge themselves with so virulent a dream
 as the twofold Arab dream that Israel does
 not exist and that the Jews who presently
 occupy  the  land  of  Israel  can  easily  be
 pushed into the Mediterranean ... when-
 ever the Arabs finally decide to do so.
 Sometime in the spring of 1967, the Arab
 leaders decided that the time was ripe. Under
 incessant pressure from Ahmed Shukairy,
 leader of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion, who stood to win himself the satrapy
 of Palestine if he could goad Egypt. Syria,
 Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia into
 declaring war on Israel, and with the full
 connivance of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who stood
 to win himself an emperorship if the war
 was successful, the Arab nations reached an
 understanding. These men who had lived so
 long on fantasy now conceived the supreme
 fantasy that they could quickly destroy the
 nation that had twice defeated them and had
 in the interim grown stronger socially, psy-
 chologically and morally, even though its air-
 planes and tanks had not kept pace in num-
 bers with those of the Arabs.
 On May 16, 1967, President Nasser initiated
 the two final moves. On that day, he elbowed
 the United Nations Emergency Force out of
 its peacekeeping positions along the Egyp-
 tian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula
 and forced it ignominiously to retire from
 the area, thus depriving Israel of the one slim
 assurance it had that a surprise attack would
 not be launched from the desert. The fire
 engine that was supposed to protect the com-
 munity scuttled out of town at the first smell
 of  smoke.  In  its  place,  President  Nasser
 moved up his own divisions, and the stage
 was set for war.
 On May 22, 1967, he made his second
 crucial move. With the retreat of the United
 Nations troops, he found himself in sole con-
 trol of Sharm el Shiek, the fortress-com-
 manding the strait leading into the Gulf of
 Aqaba. It was a simple matter for him to an-
 nounce that henceforth, the Gulf would be
 closed to Israeli ships and even to ships of
 other nations carrying strategic materials
 bound for Israel. None would be permitted
 to enter and none to leave. This was a hos-
 tile act and had to be construed as a declara-
 tion of war. That President Nasser was aware
 of the gravity of his act, he took no pains to
 hide:  "Sharm el Sheik and the blockade
 mean real confrontation with Israel. Taking
 such a step means that we should be ready
 to enter full-scale war with Israel. It is not
 an isolated operation."
 The Gulf has been recognized as an inter-
 national waterway because four sovereign
 nations lines its coasts: on the east, Saudi
 Arabia; on the west, Egypt; on the north,
 Israel; and on the northeast, Jordan. But it
 Is more important economically to Israel than
 to any of the other three, since Elath is a
 major port for handling oil and other heavy
 cargoes. If the Gulf of Aqaba were to be
 closed to all shipping, whether to Jordan or
 Israel, the blockade would damage Jordan,
 but it would prostrate Israel. However, ships
 intended for Jordan were allowed to pass,
 and during the exercise of the blockade, sev-
 eral did proceed unmolested to Jordan. This
 underlined the fact that the blockade was
 meant to be an act of war, and lest any mis-
 understand the intention, President Nasser
 proclaimed on May 26:
 "The Arab people want to fight ...
 "We have been waiting for the suitable day
 when we shall be completely ready, since if
 we enter a battle with Israel we should be
 confident of victory and should take strong
 measures. We do not speak idly.
 "We have lately felt that our strength is
 sufficient, and that if we enter the battle with
 Israel we shall, with God's help, be victorious.
 Therefore, we have now decided that I take
 real steps.
 "The battle will be a full-scale one, and
 our basic aim will be to destroy Israel."
 Obviously, the major maritime nations of
 the world, having anticipated that such a
 blockade might one day be attempted, in
 which case their ships would be powerless to
 enter the narrow strait, had long been on
 record regarding two points: (1) the Gulf of
 Aqaba was an international waterway, and
 (2)  as such, it must be kept open for all
 nations to use equally without let or hin-
 drance.
 By flouting international law and block-
 ading the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping,
 President Nasser had effectively and some-
 what  cleverly  cut  Israel's  lifeline  to the
 south. If the blockade were allowed to con-
 tinue unchallenged, Israel would experience
 what its Arab neighbors had been threaten-
 ing for so long-its strangulation. This was
 war, but still only an indirect version, in the
 economic field. One could reasonably hope
 that from it, President Nasser might back
 away, but such hopes were dashed on May 28,
 when he announced over the radio: "We
 intend to open a general assault against
 Israel. This will be total war. Our basic aim
 is the destruction of Israel."
 As  the  Arabs  prepared  for  what  they
 assured themselves was to be the final con-
 quest of Israel, their morale was at high
 pitch. And because of what they had been
 told so continuously over the previous eight
 years regarding their victory over the British
 and French in  1956, they believed in all
 honesty that this time they were going to
 crush Israel, and fairly easily.
 President Nasser encouraged this belief by
 his belligerent speeches. From Syria, Chief
 of State Al-Attassi thundered. that his army
 was impatient to begin marching.
 The foot soldiers, the aviators, the tank
 commanders and even the generals prepared
 to launch what they were convinced would
 be an easy, victorious sortie. In the fantasy
 world in which they had lived for so long,
 and to which they had contributed, words
 took the place of accomplishment, wishes
 S 11281
 took the place of military discipline, and in-
 flated dreams of revenge superseded facts.
 If the Arabs with their verbal assaults had
 made life difficult for Israel, they had per-
 petrated a worse crime against themselves:
 for they had come to believe their own in-
 flated nonsense.
 At the hour of attack, the Voice of the
 Arabs  radio  station  in  Cairo  issued  this
 stirring call to its soldiers. It is the usual
 heartening battle cry that all nations use
 at a time of crisis and in general purpose is
 not much different from what Englishmen
 or Russians or Americans would shout to
 their soldiers: but In the cry for avenging
 1948,  one  hears  a  unique  and  ominous
 overtone:
 "Destroy, ruin, liberate. Woe to Israel, your
 hour has arrived. The Arab nation is on its
 way to render its account. 0 Israel, this is
 your end.
 "Every Arab must take revenge for 1948,
 must cross the Armistice lines from all di-
 rections and head for Tel Aviv. We shall
 drive out of existence the shame of Zionism.
 Rescue the looted Palestine. Hit everywhere
 till the end.
 "There is no room for Israel in Palestine.
 This Is your responsibility. 0 Arab soldiers!
 Israel, taste death!"
 It required less than 72 hours in June to
 deflate this bombast.
 What can be done to awaken the Arab
 masses  to  the  reality  that  Israel  stands
 where it does and will presumably remain
 there for some -centuries? In the aftermath
 of 1948, the rest  of the world permitted
 and perhaps encouraged the Arabs to fol-
 low a policy of blindly refusing to admit
 that Israel existed. The armistice commis-
 sions, which should have worked out re-
 gional policies, were not permitted to oper-
 ate effectively. Decisions upon which peace
 depended could not be made because the
 Arabs refused to acknowledge that history
 had produced an old-new nation that would
 prove most viable-that was too young to
 die. The normal intercourse between nations,
 such as Is conducted between Russia and
 Germany,  which  were  certainly  as bitter
 enemies as Egypt and Israel, was forbidden,
 and the region fumbled its way to the war
 of 1956.
 When Israel won handily, the refusal to
 admit realities persisted, and the same er-
 rors were allowed to continue. International
 commissions did not function, and normal
 Intercourse between nations did not mature,
 even though the Arab portion of the region
 and the Israeli form a marvelous, interlock-
 ing whole-a unit whose various segments
 could well profit from economic, medical,
 educational, developmental and planning co-
 operation. The blindness and the arrogant
 folly that produced this stalemate also pro-
 duced the speeches cited in this article. And
 they in turn produced the hysteria that led
 to a third war in less than 20 years.
 If the world, in 1948, had insisted that the
 nations of this area sit down in honest con-
 sultation,. 1956 might have been avoided. If
 the world, following the disaster of 1956, had
 insisted  that  the  Arab  nations  at  least
 awaken to the existence of Israel, the tremen-
 dous folly of 1967 could have been avoided.
 Now, the world has a third chance, and if
 some right decisions are made in the months
 ahead, the even greater tragedy of 1977 may
 be avoided. What is necessary is a reason-
 able revision of boundary lines: a sensible
 settlement of the Palestinian refugee prob-
 lem: a cessation of verbal assault and phy-
 sical battery;  and a union of talents and
 interests, of resources and abilities, so that
 the region can move forward to a creative
 society in which all members live infinitely
 better than anyone there now does.
 Am I hopeful that the world will now
 sensibly tackle its problems when it refused
 to do so in the aftermath of 1948 and 1956?

 I am not. President Gamal Abdel Nasser
 -pulled out of the hat .one of the cleverest
 tricks of his career when, in the first hours of
 defeat, he invented the enticing theory that
 once again it was not Israelis who were
 crushing his armed might from every direc-
 tion but English and American; aviators. His
 explanation captivated the imagination of all
 Arabs, and within a few days was adopted as
 official dogma. In 1970, when I revisit the
 lovely waterfront of Alexandria, I expect to
 see a tableau explaining how, in a moment
 of travail in the spring of 1967, the Egyptians
 and their Arab allies stood bravely against
 the combined air might of Great Britain and
 the United States and repulsed it. That Israel
 was Involved will not be mentioned.
 At the moment when Egyptian armies were
 suffering their worst defeats, Egypt's unde-
 feated radio was broadcasting the following
 careful analysis of the situation:
 "The United States is the, enemy. Its
 fighters and bombers gathered in large groups
 to provide for Israel an air umbrella that
 prevents the Arabs from bombing Israel's
 towns and villages, while it is: moving fast
 all along the occupied frontiers of the Arabs.
 The United States, therefore,, Is the ag-
 gressor.
 "The United States saw Israel about to
 collapse under the  blow of  death. The
 Chicago gangs moved: the state of gangster-
 ism and bloodshed moved; it moved in order
 to protect its aggressive base in the Middle
 East. How vile and treacherous the United
 States has been in Its Collusion with the
 Zionists!  It  refrained  from  coming  out
 openly to fight us. It refrained; from facing
 the Arabs with an open and daring hostility.
 No, Arabs. The United States is; too vile and
 too base to have the ethics of cavaliers. The
 United States threw, from all: its airports
 and aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean,
 huge and continuous massings of its fighters
 and bombers in order to provide that air
 umbrella  that  protected  Israel  from  the
 revenge of the Arabs, from the; massings of
 the Arabs, and from the victory of the Arabs.
 "The battle is continuing, United States.
 It is going on until you: become, as
 Britain  became after  the  19y56  collusion,
 third-rate  state. Here we shall   bury the
 American international gangsterism. Here,
 Arabs, dig graves everywhere; dig them for
 every U.S. existence; dig them. Arabs. Dig all
 the homeland a grave for U.S. existence. Dig
 it, Arabs. Dig it, Arabs. Dig it, Arabs.
 "The curse of all the Arabs, from the
 ocean to the gulf and from every corner of
 the globe, is on you, America, and on your
 lackey, Israel; together with the curse of all
 free peoples, the curse of free men every-
 where."
 On the night when the defeat of the Arab
 armies was known to the world as one of
 the most crushing in history., I discussed
 matters on an all-night radio show with Dr.
 M. T. Mehdi, secretary-general of the Action
 Committee on American-Arab Relations, and
 he made these points: "Nothing has changed.
 Israel is worse than Nazi Germany, and the
 Arabs will have to drive her from the region.
 The war will continue precisely as it has
 been going for the past 19 years. And what
 the Americans and the English took away
 from the Arabs by their Intervention, the
 Arabs will recover at the conference table.
 Peace talks, of course, will have to be con-
 ducted through third parties at the United
 Nations, because no Arab leader will ever
 agree to sit down and talk with an outlaw
 nation like Israel. You'll see. The United
 Nations will force Israel back to her 1948
 boundaries, after which all Arai} nations will
 unite in a war to exterminate her, because
 this is going to be just like the Crusades.
 For two hundred years, the Arabs will con-
 tinue their fight and in the end they'll do
 exactly what they've said. Push Israel into
 the sea."
 Nasser will probably gain more from the
 Arab world in defeat than he would have
 gained in victory. The war made him a tragic
 hero -ar fund whom the emotional Arabs can
 rally. Se ton, his new crop of generals will be
 making the old speeches of 1948, 1956 and
 1967. H.s people will believe them, for fan-
 tasy is impossible to eradicate if one's whole
 society Is structured on the perpetuation of
 the Aralan Nights.
 Yet vie must dispel that fantasy. To do so
 is the , ob to which we are all committed
 . un:.ess we are content to watch this
 pathetic farce of Arab self-delusion repeated
 in 1977, 1988 and 1999.
 [From the New York Times, July 28. 1967]
 FANTASY FROM NASSER
 Presic.ent Nasser of the U.A.R. has been
 variously described as cautious and impul-
 sive, reasonable and Irresponsible, calculating
 and tee ipestuous. During his thirteen-year
 career is absolute ruler of his people and
 aspiring leader of pan-Arab Socialism, Gamal
 Abdel Sasser has displayed all of these con-
 tradictcry traits..
 In sp.te of his impulsive seizure of Suez,
 his irresponsible campaign in Yemen and
 other fcrays into international politics, many
 informed observers have been inclined In
 the past to minimize the Egyptian leader's
 excesses, citing his relative caution in com-
 parison to other, more volatile, Arab leaders,
 and pointing to many reasonable and con-
 crete steps he has taken to try to rebuild
 Egypt's impoverished and demoralized feudal
 society.
 Today, however, it must be sadly noted
 that President Nasser has apparently thrown
 caution and reason to the desert winds.
 In calling on Egyptians once more to mobi-
 lize their meager resources for continuing
 warfare against azi Israel he refuses to recog-
 nize after a third, shattering Egyptian de-
 feat by Israeli armed forces, Nasser has be-
 trayed Ifs promise of a better life for 'the
 Egyptian people. He has shown himself to
 be -a pr Boner of the extreme Arab emotions
 he once sought to master.
 Speaking on the fifteenth anniversary of
 the Egyptian revolution the other day, Nasser
 charged there is "an American imperialist
 conspiracy to destroy our socialist revolu-
 tion." Thus have failure at home, where
 the ecoi Lamy is a shambles, and defeat abroad
 reduced a once-promising leader to fantasy.
 It is, rf course, no American conspiracy but
 Nasser's own intemperate ambitions and in-
 flexible  antipathies  that  are  destroying
 Egypt's hope to show the way to a better
 Arab society.
 AND REALITY
 On tie basis of well-authenticated evi-
 dence, Egypt has been using and is continu-
 ing to use poison gas against Yemeni royal-
 ists. Thy) United States has a last made public
 its beliief that gas may have in fact been
 employe d. An investigation by the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission is clearly
 called f )r.
 The IaternationaI Red Cross sentone team
 to a vilage called Gahar in north Yemen
 on may 15. While its report has not yet been
 oficiall3 released, the text has been printed
 in U.S. News World Report. The Red Cross
 doctors found proof of-the use of toxic gas
 by the Egyptian forces. Their report has been
 circulated  offlcia:tly  only  to  Egypt,  Saudi
 Arabia and both sides in the Yemen civil
 war; but each of these parties has reasons to
 keep tho contents secret.
 Two hundred Members of Parliament of all
 parties in London have just called upon their
 Government to take the issue to the United
 Nations Foreign Secretary George Brown in-
 dicated that Britain would not take action.
 Although he did not say so, the reason is
 presumably that the British do not want to
 get int) more trouble with Egypt. Saudi
 Arabia, which is most concerned because it is
 support.ng the royalists and because Yemen
 is on Ila borders, evidently does not want
 further to disturb Arab unity in these critical
 times.
 Washington had been holding back for va-
 rious reasons. It had no positive proof and
 still has none, and it too was trying to get
 along with Nasser. However, relations with
 Cairo could not get worse than they are now.
 And the increasing evidence of the use of
 toxic gas has become too disturbing to ig-
 nore. It is believed that in recent bombings
 the Egyptians have used a modern, sophisti-
 cated nerve gas, whereas previously they had
 used World I phosgene.
 The State Department said yesterday that
 it will support International action to investi-
 gate this horror. Washington should do more.
 It should initiate such action.
 [From the Washington Post, July 30, 1967]
 ISRAEL FAKED EGYPT OUT OF' HER SOCKS
 (Excerpts from an article entitled "The 6-
 Day  War"  by  Randolph  and  Winston
 Churchill)
 It all started with a lie---a Russian lie. In
 early May, the Soviet government passed to
 Cairo the story of a large Israeli troop con-
 centration on the Syrian border. During the
 following two weeks, Cairo received informa-
 tion from Moscow indicating that an Israeli
 force of up to 11 brigades was involved. At
 the time, the Israelis had no more than a
 company (120 men) in that particular area,
 waiting in ambush for Syrian saboteurs.
 The United Nations, which had observa-
 tion posts along the Israeli-Syrian border,
 confirmed, toward the end of May, that it
 had no evidence of the alleged troop move-
 ments. It seems that the: Russians, alarmed
 by the possibility that Israel might be plan-
 ning a punitive raid on Syria, wanted Egyp-
 tian President Nasser to commit his forces
 in Sinai as a diversion to deter the Israelis
 from attacking.
 The crisis had been building up for six
 months.  In October and  November,  1966,
 there had been an intensification of Arab
 terrorist activities against Israel by the El
 Fatah terrorist organization. On Nov. 4,
 Syria and Egypt signed a- defense agreement.
 There followed two incidents in which- the
 Israelis undertook major ,punitive action.
 On Nov. 13, a large Israeli force, including
 tanks and armored cars, rolled over the- Jor-
 danian border and attacked Samu, a village
 of 4000 people. Israel felt no great hostility
 toward Jordan but carried out the raid in
 order to show that she was not prepared to
 tolerate the use of Jordanian territory by
 the El Fatah organization.
 At the beginning of April, 1967, the Israelis
 decided to knock out Syrian artillery which
 was bombarding Israeli farm workers in a
 demilitarized zone near the Sea of Galilee.
 In the resulting air battle of April 7, the
 Syrians lost six Mig fighters, a significant
 proportion of their total air strength.
 EMBARRASSING FOR NASSER
 The situation was clearly becoming in-
 creasingly embarrassing for President Nasser.
 In particular, the presence of the United
 Nations Emergency Force,  commanded  by
 Gen. Rikhye of India,  on the borders of
 Egypt and Israel was a subject of scandal
 and scorn among his Arab rivals.
 Nasser, believing that a confrontation be-
 tween Israel and Syria was imminent, felt
 bound to demonstrate the reality of his de-
 fense pact with Syria by some evidence of
 military zeal. On May 15, large numbers of
 Egyptian troops were seen moving through
 Cairo on their way to the Suez Canal. They
 were accorded the maximum publicity by the
 government-controlled press, radio and tele-
 vision.
 Then at 10 p.m. on May 18, the Egyptian
 chief of staff, Gen. Fawzy, sent a telegram to
 Gen. Rikhye:

 iiayan's inclusion as Defense Minister was
 among the three additions made.
 It is now a controversial issue in Israeli
 politics as to who should be given credit for
 the decision to strike and for the successful
 conduct of the war. Dayan'sadmirers claim
 that when he entered the cabinet the deci-
 sion to fight had yet to be taken, and add that
 no detailed plan of attack had been worked
 out.
 Brig. Gen. Ezer Weizman has said that
 when Dayan became Minister of Defense, "he
 knew that there was a possibility that the
 decision to go might not be taken." Others
 claim that the Eshkol government was too
 fearful to make the decision without him.
 They wanted Dayan included so that if the
 whole thing ended in disaster they would not
 have to hold the bag alone.
 Eban and Allan recall events differently
 from Weizman. Eban says that the decision
 to fight had been- reached by June 1: it was
 dictated by the pact between Nasser and
 Hussein. Allan agrees. He says that prior to
 the defense pact there was a division in the
 cabinet, a majority still hoping for a diplo-
 matic solution. But after May 30 war was in-
 evitable.
 Dayan was included in the cabinet because
 the Eshkol government was being forced to
 two unavoidable conclusions: Israel had no
 alternative but to fight, and the Israeli gov-
 ernment needed Dayan because the nation
 demanded it and because it needed his knowl-
 edge, courage and optimism.
 Just as It had taken Hitler to make
 Churchill Prime Minister in 1940, so, as Dayan
 put it shortly before the start of the war, "it
 took 80,000 Egyptian soldiers to. get me into
 the Israeli cabinet."
 By the time Harold Wilson and Lyndon
 Johnson met in Washington on. June 2, it was
 too late for a diplomatic formula to succeed.
 War was certain. Only the date was open.

 thorized to be appropriated the sum of $2
 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30,
 1968, $3 billion for the  fiscal year ending
 June 30, 1969, and for succeeding years such

 tional fiscal years after the fiscal year for
 which they   were   authorized  and   ap-
 propriated.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I conclude
 as follows: We have all been talking, at
 least a good deal of debate has been had,
 about the Marshall plan. I have done my
 best to implement this concept, in order
 to lay before the Senate what can con-
 ceivably be done in more specific terms
 than those which are usually loosely used
 when we speak of the Marshall plan. I
 have come up with a figure, Mr. Presi-
 dent, and a plan by which this might be
 started. I commend it to my fellow Sen-
 ators for study and careful thought.
 As one who has lived a full lifetime in
 and with the slums, I can tell my fellow
 Senators that I do not believe the job
 can be done any differently than through
 a massive application of resources at a
 given target within a given period of
 time. The means must be massive.
 Finally,  Mr.  President,  this effort
 would infinitely more than pay for itself,
 even in the hardest-headed financial
 terms, in terms of increases in income,
 in the improved vitality and -skills of our
 people, in the devotion of our people to
 the American system, and in the enor-
 mously increased tax base which will re-
 sult for cities and States.
 It is accomplishable, Mr. President. In-
 deed, the figure which I have named-
 $50 billion-is a fraction of the gross an-
 nual product of the United States for 1
 year.
 This is the order of magnitude which
 Is required. It implements the words
 "Marshall plan," which are magic words.
 The idea was an enormous success on the
 foreign front and I think it can be on
 the domestic front. It offers to the Sen-
 ate a plan and a channel through which
 this accomplishment can be effected.

 oQ
 `-     L THAL GAS IN YEMEN
 Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, per-
 sistent accounts of the use of lethal gas
 in Yemen have appeared from time to
 time in the Nation's press. Some of these
 charges were investigated by an Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross.
 On July 28, 1967, the New York Times
 published the full text of the Red Cross
 report, as follows:
 TEXT OF THE RED CROSS REPORT ON THE USE
 OF POISON GAS IN YEMEN
 (By Andre Rochat)
 WASHINGTON, July 27.-On May 11, 1967,
 the I.C.R.C. delegation in Jidda received ap-
 peals for assistance from the two villages of
 Gadafa and Gahar in the Wadi Herran, in
 the southwestern Jauf. According to these
 appeals a proportion of the inhabitants of
 these villages had been poisoned by gas
 dropped from raiding airplanes.
 Some hours later this news was confirmed
 by representatives of the Yemeni Royalists
 and by the Saudi Arabian authorities, who
 requested the I.C.R.C. delegation to go im-
 mediately to the assistance of the victims.
 The head of the delegation decided to pro-
 ceed immediately to the scene, accompanied
 by another delegate, two doctors and a male
 nurse; members of the I.C.R.C. medical team,
 and a Yemeni escort. The two-lorry convoy,
 loaded with food and medical supplies, left
 Amara on May 13, after having given due
 notice of its line of march and timetable
 to the Egyptian authorities.
 Unfortunately, following an air attack on
 the I.C.R.C. convoy, it was not until the
 night of May 16-16 that the mission reached
 Gahar. This village is situated atop a hill
 some 500 feet in height. All the houses are
 clustered closely together, giving the appear-
 ance of a small fortress.
 ACCOUNTS OF SURVIVORS
 According to the inhabitants, 75 people
 were gassed during a raid in the early hours
 of May 10, 1967.
 The account given by the survivors is as
 follows :
 The bombers circled the village for some
 time then dropped three bombs on the hill-
 side, east of and below the village, two or
 three hundred yards away to windward (wind
 direction from east to west).
 No houses were damaged. The explosions
 were relatively mild. The bomb craters were
 about eight feet in diameter and 20 inches
 deep, smaller than the usual craters.
 Twenty minutes after dropping the three
 gas bombs, the planes dropped four or five
 high-explosive bombs on the village and
 the western flank of the hill. Only one of
 these bombs caused any damage; this was
 sustained by a house in the center of the
 village.
 Many animals, Including almost 200 cat-
 tle, sheep, goats, donkeys and numerous
 birds, were also killed. The villagers, who
 were not contaminated, buried the dead ani-
 mals in a large pit west of the village, whilst
 the 75 humans killed were buried in four
 large communal graves.
 REPORT OF OBSERVATIONS
 The I.C.R.C. delegates, for their part, ob-
 served the following:
 They inspected  the village  for several
 hours, checking, whenever possible, the ac-
 curacy of the information mentioned above.
 The doctors examined the four surviving
 gas casualties. Their medical report is at-
 tached hereto.
 The head of the mission had one of the
 four communal graves opened. There were
 15 corpses in it. An immediate autopsy by
 Dr. Brutschin and Dr. Janin left no doubt
 that death was due to pulmonary edema
 (see attached medical report and photo-
 graph).
 The 75 gas casualties were either within
 range of the gas when it was released or
 were in its path as it was blown by the
 wind. Some of the victims were found dead
 in their homes, as if they had died in their
 sleep.
 Other inhabitants, working in the fields
 or watching over the livestock, were east-
 ward of the area where the gas bombs fell,
 some of them very near to the spot, and
 none of them were affected.
 The four survivors who were In the con-
 taminated area are all in pain from their
 eyes and almost blind. All have pains in the
 chest and none has any wound.
 The doctors cannot testify to an air raid
 with gas bombs of which they were not per-
 sonally witness.  On the other hand, they
 stress that all the evidence leads to the con-
 clusion that edema was caused by the breath-
 ing of poison gas.
 The delegates were later informed that on
 May 17 and 13 the villages of Gabas, Nofal,
 Gadr and, for the second time, Gadafa were
 raided with gas bombs and that as a result
 243 persons were killed.
 Mr. President, the use of lethal gas in
 Yemen has been reported on several oth-
 er occasions by British as well as Yemeni
 sources. The Israel Government reported
 that gas containers were found in the
 Sinai desert at positions evacuated by
 the retreating Egyptian Army in tht
 wake of the Arab-Israel confict.
 Mr. President, the use of gas in war-
 fare was specifically condemned by tht
 1925 Geneva Convention.
 As an instrument of death, poison gar
 does not discriminate between soldie
 and civilian. Borne by the prevailint

 My bill would make a start on this
 effort by providing new money for the
 first 2 of these 10 years through an ear-
 marking of one-third of the revenues of
 the President's proposed income surtax,
 thereby producing about $5 billion. over
 the 2-year period. If the income surtax
 is not passed, the bill would make the
 added funds available by direct authori-
 zation and appropriation of $5 billion in
 new funds.
 The sound and fury of congressional
 and public reaction to the riots has al-
 ready produced the introduction of bills
 to provide emergency assistance. But the
 riots which have racked American cities
 in recent weeks are evidence of a deep-
 seated social illness which will not be
 cured in a day or a year. The breakdown
 of an orderly and adequate system for
 the redress of grievances and the wide-
 spread alienation of a significant portion
 of our population present a major na-
 tional crisis which requires a major na-
 tional commitment of long duration.
 Short-term and emergency measures are
 needed, but they must not divert us from
 the opportunity of seizing this occasion
 to face up to the long-term needs-of
 recognizing them and charting them out.
 The Administration must not and the
 Congress must not simply divert funds
 from one purpose to another to meet
 the emergency needs of the hour' and let
 it go at that. This is robbing Peter to
 pay Paul. We must heed the call of the
 Marshall plan concept for our cities,
 which was to my knowledge first raised
 by Whitney Young of the Urban League
 and was endorsed by me over a year ago
 and most recently by Vice President
 HUMPHREY and others, to make a new
 commitment and to advance new funds.
 My proposal would notcreate new pro-
 grams. We have, in. model cities, the
 Economic Opportunity Act, the Man-
 power Development and Training Act,
 the- Housing Act, the Elementary and
 Secondary Education Act, and in other
 laws of this type, all or most of the pro-
 gram authority which we need. What we
 do not have are the necessary authoriza-
 tions and appropriations within this
 existing framework. The bill I am intro-
 ducing would make new money avail-
 able to the President to be allocated to
 these existing programs, or to new pro-
 grams serving the same purposes, to
 increase their impact over the next 2
 years and would include a moral com-
 mittment'if the program went well to
 continue it for a decade. The President
 would also be authorized to use such
 funds to help public and private organ-
 izations to meet their responsibilities
 under these Federal programs to pro-
 vide non-Federal matching funds.'
 The money for these purposes would
 come from either of two sources. First,
 and preferably, the bill would earmark
 one-third of the revenues to be raised
 under the President's new 2-ye4r in-
 come surtax proposal , if it is enacted
 into law, for expansion of these anti-
 slum and antipoverty programs. We are
 told that this is not a war tax; if that
 be the case then let us be sure of that
 fact by allocating some of its revenues
 to  domestic programs of  overriding
 priority. Since it is expected that $6.3
 billion would be raised in fiscal year
 1968, and mo:~e in fiscal year 1969, this
 earmarking p ovision would make funds
 on the order A $5 billion available over
 the' next 2 years for expansion of the
 programs designed to cure urban ills.
 The bill. provides a carryover of funds
 so that if as sy amou:,,its were not ex-
 pended in the .year for which they were
 appropriated they could be carried over
 for use in thi: succeeding 2 fiscal years.
 Funds thus earmarked from the Pres-
 ident's proposed income surtax would
 be appropriated to an "economic oppor-
 tunity trust fund," similar in operation
 to the highway trust fund.
 The establishment of this trust Sind
 assures a minimum level of expenditures
 and continuity for the programs dedicat-
 ed to eliminating poverty and providing
 economic sect Lrity.
 It should be doted that earmarking a
 prescribed  p:rcentage  of  general re-
 venues for a specific purpose is not un-
 usual on the State level. In my own State
 of New York, fqr example, the law re-
 quires that ogle=ninth of the State's per-
 sonal income, fax collections be deposited
 in a fund now devoted to financing bonds
 for the construction of mental health
 facilities;'
 A second approach provided in the bill
 is direct autt orization. of appropriations
 from eneral Treasury revenues of $2 bil-
 lion   fiscal year 1968 and $3 billion in
 fiscal year 1939. If funds were forthcom-
 ing  nder they earmarking of the income
 surtx appropriations to implement this
 news uthoriztion would not have to be
 enae d. As evidence of the congression-
 al inte t to c .rry on these programs un-
 til the *eed is. satisfied, the bill makes
 reference - to authorizations extending
 through fis'r it year 1977 in the same
 manner in which the original Marshall
 plan legislatiunaf 1943 sought, in similar
 terms, to ind:.cate 'J,S. commitment over
 a 4-year pet iod without actually com-
 mitting fund: ? beyond thefirst year.
 This is an experience very fresh in my
 mind, as I participated in drafting that
 very provision of the Marsha .l~lan.
 The $5 bill: on that my bill would make
 available would, of course, only, be the
 beginning in terms of really meetlg the
 problem. I would hope that afte these
 first 2 yearn of additional allot ents
 the administration would recogni  the
 need and would build up its existin pro-
 grams to nee led levels.
 And, letnc one think that these evels
 would tax our capacities beyond eason-
 able limits, for, as the freedom, budget
 pointed out, a provision of $1 ~5 billion
 a year would amount to anwerage of
 only 2 percent. of the estim   d annual
 gross national product betten the 1966-
 75 period. Ard as the aut ors of that re-
 port so aptl' pointed: What could
 better illustr3,te that the whole question
 of whether we "can (ford" the "freedom
 budget" is a mor  question and not an
 economic, issae?t

 from New York.
 The bill (S. 2274) to provide addi-
 tional funds for programs designed to
 eradicate poverty and urban slums by
 reserving certain revenues raised under a
 surcharge on income tax liabilities and
 by other means, introduced by Mr.,JAVITS,
 was received, read twice by its title, re-
 ferred to the Committee on Labor and
 Public Welfare, and ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 ,.-~              S. 2274
 A'e it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives  of  the  United  States  of
 America in Congress assembled, That this
 Act may be cited as the "Domestic Marshall
 Plan Act" of 1967.
 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE
 SECTION 101. The Congress hereby finds
 and declares that a new dedication of na-
 tional will and resources must be made to
 improve the quality of urban life and sub-
 stantially to eradicate poverty in the United
 States. The high concentration of unem-
 ployed and low-income persons in certain
 urban and rural areas, the heavy migration
 of persons of limited skills into urban areas,
 and the deterioration of housing and of pub-
 lic services in the city slums have resulted
 in conditions that degrade human dignity,
 are basic causes of riots and civil disturbance,
 threaten internal security, and require a re-
 assessment of our national priorities.
 The Congress further finds and declares
 that such conditions must not and need not
 be allowed to persist in this country and that
 it is the first domestic priority of the United
 States substantially to end poverty and to
 eradicate widespread urban blight and decay
 within the foreseeable future; and that pres-
 ent programs to achieve these purposes are
 receiving inadequate public funds and pri-
 vate participation.
 The purpose of this Act is to commit addi-
 tional resources over an extended period of
 time to programs of job training, employ-
 ment, economic development, small business,
 housing, health, income maintenance, com-
 munity development and  individual  and
 family services in order to dedicate this Na-
 tion to the elimination of poverty, to the
 eradication of degrading slums and the estab-
 lishment  of  economic  security for  our
 citizens.
 ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM
 SEC. 102. (a) The Presiden, with the advice
 of the Economic Opportunity Council, is au-
 thorized to allocate funds made available
 under this Act to existing programs, or to
 new programs adopted after the effective date
 of the Act, designed:
 (1) provide work training and employment
 opportunities, including supportive services,
 for unemployed or low-income persons;
 (2)  promote  economic - development  in
 order to provide job opportunities for un-
 employed or low-income persons;
 (3) assist in the establishment or strength-
 ening of small business enterprises located in
 areas of high concentration of unemployed
 or low-income persons or owned by low-
 income residents of such areas;
 (4) provide public or private: housing for
 low-income persons;
 (5) promote community development ac-
 tivities in areas of substantial concentra-
 tion of low-income persons;
 (6) provide income support for low-income
 individuals or families; and
 (7) provide individual and family services,
 including health, education and legal serv-
 ices, to low-income persons.
 (b) The President is authorized to make
 grants or loans to public or private agencies
 or organizations to meet up to 80 percent
 of the aggregate amount of non-Federal con-
 tributions otherwise required to be made to

 winds, gas inflicts its horror on men, wo-
 men, children, animals, and crops alike,
 without regard to status as combatants
 or noncombatants.
 Needless to say, the use of gas war-
 faxe invites retaliation in kind, In an age
 when sophisticated chemical warfare
 agents are readily available to almost
 every nation; the possibility of escalat-
 ing poison gas warfare looms as a ter-
 rifying prospect.
 To date, our State Department has
 "condemned" the use of poison gas, and
 our Government has voiced "concern" in
 the United Nations. But, Mr. President,
 that is not enough.
 I propose that the United States in-
 troduce a resolution in the Security
 Council of the United Nations calling for
 establishment of a five-nation Commis-
 sion to investigate and take action con-
 cerning the use of lethal gas in the
 Middle East.
 I believe that such a Commission
 should be authorized to-
 First, determine the source and loca-
 tion of such poison gas in the Middle
 East, if it exists;
 Second, seek  assurances from  the
 Soviet Union and other Communist bloc
 nations that no chemical warfare agents
 are now being supplied to the Middle
 East;
 Third, demand on-site inspection to
 insure observance of an embargo on
 such chemical warfare agents, and make
 sure that any existing supplies in the
 area are destroyed; and
 Fourth, insist upon reparations for the
 victims of poison gas attacks.
 Some apologists for the administration
 seem- to indicate that our Government
 may be reluctant to pursue this matter
 at the present time for fear of being re-
 garded as too "pro-Israel." I see no,
 reason to hesitate mer8ly because our
 words and actions might antagonize the
 perpetrators of such criminal acts.
 The use of poison gas is not just a
 crime against a race or a nation; it is a
 crime against humanity. From the first
 gas attacks in the trenches in France
 during World War I, to the murder of 6
 million Jews in World War II, the use of
 poison gas in war has been universally
 and justifiably condemned. In Yemen,
 gas warfare has been a crime of Arab
 against Arab.
 As the leader of the free world, the
 United States should speak out and
 condemn such atrocities whenever they
 occur. As a great nation surely we have
 an obligation to do more than the record
 reflects to :date. The people of the United
 States have a right to expect no less than
 the action I propose today.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed in the RECORD an article entitled
 "Why Israel Stocked Up on Gas Masks,"
 written by Col. Ray Cromley, and pub-
 lished in the Detroit, Mich., News, of
 August 8, 1967.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 WHY ISRAEL STOCKED UP ON GAS MASKS
 (By Col. Ray Cromley)
 WASHINGTON,--There  is no longer doubt
 that the Soviet Union Is using the civil war
 in Yemen as a proving ground for some of
 Its advanced "poison gas" warfare chemicals.
 The Russian chemicals were supplied to
 Egyptian forces which are providing the bulk
 of the military power of the rebels against
 the Yemeni royalist government.
 The chemical agents have proven highly
 effective in some of the about five confirmed
 cases of their use in the desolate country
 at the southwestern tip of the Arabian penin-
 sula.
 This  information  was  obtained  from
 sources which this reporter respects.
 The Egyptian use of Russian mankilling
 chemicals in Yemen, first reported in Jan-
 uary, so worried the Israeli armed forces that
 they made heavy purchases of gas masks at
 the start of the June fighting with Egypt.
 The Saudi Arabian government, which sup-
 ports the Yemeni royalists, has protested this
 use of chemical warfare to the secretary-
 general of the United Nations.
 Thus far, Secretary-General U Thant has
 refused to take any action other than to
 ask Egypt if its troops were using gas in
 Yemen. The Cairo government replied that
 they were not.
 It can be stated, however, that the Russian
 chemicals  were  supplied  to  Egypt in the
 form of thin-walled "bombs" which break
 open and spread their chemical agents over
 a wide area.
 The Russian-sponsored experiments seem
 to have been systematic. The Egyptians have
 not used the chemicals generally in the war
 but only in certain areas. The attacks have
 been carefully selected and the techniques
 and agents used have varied.
 Russian-built  IL-28s,  which  have  been
 supplied in quantity to the Egyptian air
 force, were used to carry the bombs over
 the royalist targets. There is reason to be-
 lieve  Russian  technicians  supervised                                                                                   the
 aerial attacks and the use of the chemical
 "bombs."
 There is no evidence that Russians piloted
 the planes.
 The chemicals being used are of several
 types. One is a particularly deadly nerve
 agent (commonly called a nerve gas) which
 kills quickly. Analysis of fabric found with
 bomb splinters after one raid showed traces
 of organic phosphorous compounds which
 are essential components of "nerve gas."
 According to Saudi Arabian medical re-
 ports,                                                                                   there  are  indications  that  several
 man-killer chemicals were used in combi-
 nation in some areas.
 In Russian scientific literature, Soviet sci-
 entists have reported finding chemical or
 bacteriological agents used in combination
 are more effective as killers than when used
 singly,
 Military experts make two points about
 these gas attacks:
 They recall that Russia as well as Nazi
 Germany and Fascist Italy used the 1936-
 39 Spanish civil war as a proving ground
 for weapons and tactics used full-scale in
 World War II.
 The deserts and mountains of Yemen are
 an ideal location for such experiments since
 communications inside the country and with
 the outside world range from nonexistent
 to primitive.
 Few independent observers or journalists
 have been able to tour the battlefield areas.
 And  quick follow-up Investigation of gas
 attacks Is essential since the evidence rap-
 idly fades away.
 The Yemen Unit 2 of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross did report to
 its regional office on Jan. 14 the gas attack
 nine days earlier on Kitaf, Yemen.
 The unit insisted that its members be
 provided with gas masks before they could
 continue their work.
 The isolated nature of Yemen explains in
 part, perhaps, the absence of any world out-
 cry against the use of toxic chemical warfare.
 In thoroughly reported Vietnam, the occa-
 sional use last year of nonlethal riot control
 gas by U.S. forces set off public demonstra-
 S 11365
 tions and government criticism in both the
 Communist and non-Communist worlds.
 The failure to act of UN Secretary-General
 U Thant-is less easily explained.
 Thant took no steps toward sending an
 investigating team to interview victims of
 the  attacks,  to  study  gas  samples  or  to
 analyze the remains of deal animals.
 There is no sign to date that the UN will
 ask both sides in the Yemeni fighting for
 the right to send an Investigating team into
 the area to discourage future attacks or to
 get the evidence if they occur.
 Thant has refused to make at this time
 even a general statement condemning the
 use of lethal gas without mentioning Yemen
 or implicating Egypt or the Soviet Union.
 In a letter on April 3 to Jamil Baroody, Saudi
 Arabian ambassador at the UN, Thant wrote:
 "In view of the fact that the secretary-
 general of the United Nations, in being faith-
 ful to the ideals and principles of the United
 Nations, is necessarily against war and all
 waxlike acts, including the, use of lethal gas
 anywhere by anyone, and since,- as you well
 know, I have repeatedly given expression to
 this attitude, I do not believe that any use-
 ful purpose would be served in acting on
 this suggestion at the present time."
 Baroody had noted in earlier correspond-
 ence that Secretary Thant had not been re-
 luctant to make statements about the war
 in Vietnam.

 DISTURBANCES
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, we have been
 deluged by statements concerning em-
 ployees of, or participants in, Office of
 Economic Opportunity programs and
 their alleged 'involvement in the civil
 disturbances which have recently oc-
 curred in our Nation. Most of these have
 been critical of the Office of Economic
 Opportunity people, blaming them for
 inciting, contributing to, or at least hav-
 ing an approving attitude about the
 riots. I am compelled to speak about
 these allegations.
 Recently, in my own State of Rhode
 Island, there were some disturbances. I
 am very happy to report that through
 the effective and wise work of the Provi-
 dence and State police, the city officials,
 and the important contribution of per-
 sons connected with Progress for Provi-
 dence, these disorders were held to a
 minimum.
 Progress for Providence, Inc., is the
 antipoverty agency in the capital city
 of Rhode Island. This agency is dedi-
 cated to the goal of improving living
 conditions among the poor. Categorically
 it can be said that one did not find em-
 ployees of this community action agency
 walking the streets calling for civil dis-
 orders-on the contrary they walked the
 streets of Providence on the 1st, 2d,
 3d, and 4th of August calling on the
 people to return to their homes, and to
 use the vernacular, "cool it."
 These poverty workers have been given
 much of the credit for averting a major
 outbreak in Providence. After the first
 night of violence, the Providence Jour-
 nal carried the following feature, which

 ANTIPOVERTY WORKERS PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE
 Antipoverty workers were active along with
 police in South Providence last night and
 played a major role in trying to prevent a'
 major outbreak.
 One Incident, in particular, illustrated the
 role played by the volunteers from Progress
 for Providence, Inc., the city's antipoverty
 agency.
 At about 9:30 p.m., a group.of about 20
 youths gathered on Prairie Avenue and began
 moving toward the Willard Avenue Shopping
 Center.
 Kenneth it. Delves, of 261 Rhodes St., a
 young  assistant director of the agency's
 South Providence drop-in center on Prairie
 Avenue, began to, follow the group from its
 starting point at Blackstone Street.
 Using a bullhorn, he urged the crowd re-
 peatedly to go to the center. "Listen," he
 called. "We've got to get back to the drop-in
 center. That's why it's there."
 The gang continued to move toward Com-
 stock Avenue and the shopping plaza. Police
 remained in the background while Mr. Delves
 continued his pleading.
 When the crowd arrived at Comstock Ave-
 nue, it stopped and listened to a sailor who
 tried to stir them up with inflammatory re-
 marks.
 After a few minutes, however, Mr. Delves
 regained the youths' attention,, telling them
 firmly: "Now come on-I'm on my knees to
 you guys."
 The group heeded Mr. Delves' urging this
 time and moved to the drop-in center, where
 most of them remained. It was 15 minutes
 after Mr. Delves began using his bullhorn.
 It was one of those turning points that kept
 the area relatively calm before midnight.
 Mr. FELL. Mr. President; Sgt. Manuel
 Rodrigues of the Providence Police De-
 partment is quoted as saying about the
 poverty workers:
 They did a good job; a very good job.
 Going further than Sergeant Rod-
 rigues, Mayor Doorley, of Providence,
 stated:
 As far as I'm concerned, there's no telling
 how bad this might have been if it hadn't
 been for you guys.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed at this point in the RECORD an
 article entitled, "Mayor Praises Work of
 Police, Poverty Aides," published in the
 Bulletin on Thursday, August 3, 1967.
 There being no ob7'ectibn, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 MAYOR PRAISES WORK OF POLICE, POVERTY
 AIDES
 Providence Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr.
 today gave high praise to city police and
 antipoverty workers for their efforts in try-
 ing to head off and then quelling the dis-
 turbances in South Providence Monday and
 Tuesday nights.
 The police, the mayor told his press con-
 ference,  showed "remarkable restraint" in
 handling  the  trouble,  a  factor  that  un-
 doubtedly prevented even greater violence.
 As for the antipoverty workers, the mayor
 said, they were invaluable in helping to deal
 with the people of the community and the
 city does not intend to lose contact with
 them.
 Some of these workers conceivably could
 have been on the other side during the dis-
 turbances in South Providence last summer,
 the mayor said. Now there is great rapport
 between them and the police, he added.
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, these teams
 of poverty workers went without sleep
 and did everything possible to help offi-
 cials control the area-from getting peo-

 unanimous consent that this article be

 "SOUL PATROL" CHECKS: QUIET WAS
 UNBELIEVABLE
 (By C. Fraser Smith)
 Team:r of Progress for Providence worker/
 strolled through a bushed South Providence
 last night unable to believe the quiet of-,the
 Section in which most of them grew up.
 Organized into teams of four, the "Soul
 Patrol" moved out of the Willard. Avenue
 Shopping Center shortly after nine. With
 them v as a woman who was not aware of
 the curfew set by city officials yesterday.
 Escorting her home, they walked by the
 vacant  house  o:a  Prairie Avenue between
 Dudley and Blackstone Streets where snipers
 exchan led fire with police'Tuesday night.
 Robert Young, 19, of 109 Chester Ave.,
 stopped at the corner house on the north side
 of the street, He pointed at several bullet
 holes in the peeling white columns of the
 house. The night before the street had been
 tilled vith the sound of gunfire.
 Last night, the Entire area was calm. Four
 young people walked quickly by the white
 helmeted patrol.,They said they would get off
 the stl eet.
 "We are ope{ating on the theory that many
 people don't know about the curfew," one
 of the workerjy said. They turned left on Dud-
 ley Street,                                                                                  here firemen had been pelted
 by bottles a d pricks two nights before. For
 the fl,
 jet 10I yards along the unlighted street
 they : net     o:ze. Barking dogs offered the
 only break In the stillness.
 "I've nev      seen it this quiet here and I've
 been .iving    this area for 12 years," Young
 said.
 "It's-almost too quiet," Said Felix Donaiwa,
 27, v ho is Working with the antipoverty
 agency to develop a rehabilitation program
 for d: rug addict,
 Frcm the end of Dudley Street, they turned
 down West Clifford at about 9:10 p.m., after
 spealing to people in'a car. The driver had
 pulle i away immediately.
 At West Clifford and Peart;ytreet they cor-
 ralled three youngsters walking down from
 Broai Street. These three were esbprted home
 also.                                  \
 At Pearl Street and Prairie Avenue, a spot
 where a brick smashed the windshi Id of a
 police car on the first night of the   sturb-
 ance r, they turned back toward the                                                                                   enter.
 The first police car they had seen     assed
 slowly at 9:45 P.M.
 Coming again to the  corner  of Dudley
 Stre st, they turned left and moved    ward
 Rhole.Island Hospital.
 A younger boy in a white tee shir passed
 going swiftly the other way. "The min's go-
 ing to grab you. It's going to cost yqu if you
 get naught," be was told.
 A aother youth taunted them g  tly. "Why
 don't you guys have billy clubs. " he asked.
 `hey, I forgot where my souse is,'- he
 added. They kept walking as he left the
 street.
 "Any trouble up there yet, Robert," some-
 one yelled from the shadows referring to the
 cen ter. "Not yet, " he answered.
 At Dudley and Gay they met the only group
 who refused ':o listen: "They knew about the
 curfew, but they're going to stay out," said
 Lester Fairweather, 22, a detached worker.
 They  turr..ed down  Gay  to  Blackstone,
 turned right and moved past the Flynn
 School. Half way up the block they stopped
 to talk to Walter Steele, 58, of 239 Black-
 stone St.
 I just put my wife on the bus for Dela-
 ware, ' he said. "She's got a heart condition.".
 Mr. Steele, who has a grocery store at the
 corner of Blackstone and Gay Streets, said
 he hoped he'd get some sleep.
 "I CAN'T FIGHT"
 "I haven't been to sleep in two days," he
 said. He had been up watching the turmoil
 in the center from his porch, while keeping
 an eye on his store, he said.
 "I can't fight," he said. "I'm 58 years old.
 I'll fight for my rights, but I can't go up
 there with those guys."
 By then It was 10. A car passed and was
 stopped by Mr. Fairweather's whistle.
 "He was coming in from New Bedford.
 Didn't know about the curfew," he reported.
 Later, while checking out reports of fire
 bombs on the East Side, the workers said
 they had hoped the curfew would be ex-
 tended to that area.
 "What I'm worried about," said Lonnie
 Wilkinson, 22, of 105 Rugby St., "is what will
 happen at 1 a.m. when all those joints close
 down." He was afraid that a lot of people
 would begin to move back into the South
 Providence with trouble in mind,
 FAINTLY IN RED
 They drove beyond Cypress Street and
 stopped in front of a boarded store front
 with the letters            painted faintly in
 red. Someone reported trouble on Pleasant
 Street. They turned around..
 As their car came to the intersection of
 Pleasant and Camp Street, they stopped. The
 macadam disappeared down a black cav-
 ern. There were no street lights.
 "Boy, I'm not driving down there," the
 driver said, "Saul Brother or not."
 But they would walk, they decided. "If we
 can see them we can talk to them," they
 reasoned.
 More than 10 of the 29 Progress for Provi-
 dence workers were in the Camp Street area
 by then. They stopped each police car they
 passed.
 "Can we help you?" they asked. The police
 briefed them each time, There was teamwork.
 Mr. PELL, Mr. President, tribute for
 the job done came from all segments of
 the community. I think that an editorial
 from the Providence Evening Bulletin of
 August 4 aptly describes the role played
 by Progress for Providence during the
 outbreaks. I ask unanimous consent that
 this editorial be printed at this point
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 ON THE SCENE To HELP
 if antipoverty workers have been instru-
 mental in stirring up trouble in some U.S.
 cities this summer, as charged, the evidence
 is quite the contrary in Providence.
 When trouble began in South Providence
 Monday night, workers for Progress for Provi-
 dence stepped in without hesitation to assist
 police officers on the scene. Donning helmets,
 they went among groups of. neighborhood
 youths, pleading for an end to the disturb-
 ance and asking them to disperse. One worker
 used a police bullhorn for three hours, ap-
 pealing for law and order. Observers said his
 efforts were effective.
 Tuesday night, volunteers from the agency
 again formed the vanguard of those attempt-
 ing to restore calm in the troubled area.
 Police held lack as the workers pleaded with
 the crowd.  "Now come on," one volunteer
 shouted. "I'm on my knees to you guys."
 Eventually, gunfire forced the police to step
 in, but the volunteers' efforts had not been
 wasted.
 Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. extended this
 well-earned praise. "As far as I'm concerned,"
 he said,  "there's no telling how bad this
 might have been if It hadn't been for you

 POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO ARAB
 REFUGEE PROBLEM
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. FARSSTEIN] is
 recognized for 60 minutes.
 Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, when
 Israel occupied substantial segments of
 territory previously held by Jordan,
 Egypt, and Syria during the war last
 June, many of us who were familiar with
 conditions in the Middle East felt a deep
 foreboding about the problem of the
 Arab refugees.
 Ever since the 1948 war, the refugee
 problem /had been one of the principal
 contributing factors to instability in the
 Middle East. During these 19 long years,
 the Arab States did nothing to resolve
 the problem and Israel, perhaps, did less
 than it might have done. But while Israel
 accepted hundreds of thousands of Jew-
 ish refugees from Arab lands, it, at least,
 made overtures to solve simultaneously
 the problem of the displaced Arabs. The
 Arab states, however, responded to none
 of these overtures and refused to hear
 of a settlement. In seeking to perpetuate
 the suffering of the refugees for their
 own political purposes, I believe the Arab
 States have borne the burden of respon-
 sibility for this misfortune. But we have
 all paid the price.
 Of the 1,300,000 refugees that were
 under UNWRA care, some 700,000 have
 now come under Israel  jurisdiction.
 More refugees have since joined them,
 perhaps hundreds of thousands, victims
 'of the war last June. The number is un-
 certain, for there has been a consistent
 pattern of disseml ling to inflate the re-
 fugee rolls. But Israel, a country of only
 21/2 million itself, obviously cannot ab-
 sorb them, whether there are a million
 or 2 million. Not only are its resources
 inadequate, but it would be politically
 absurd for Israel to try to give homes
 to millions of people who have vowed
 their eternal enmity to Israel's existence.
 In a framework of peace and security
 Israel may be satisfied to negotiate the
 return of all or part of the land on which
 the refugees are currently settled; but
 since the Arab governments refuse to
 negotiate a peace, Israel has no choice
 but to maintain its jurisdiction. Arab
 leaders recognize that the presence of
 the refugees suits their purposes by mak-
 ing life difficult for Israel. As for the
 refugees themselves, the Arab States
 seem to consider them political pawns
 to be manipulated as policy demands.
 They have not treated the refugees as
 human beings, so it has been impossible
 to appeal to a humanitarian impulse
 within the Arab world.
 Within the past few days, Mr. Speaker,
 it has become increasingly clear that the
 Arab chiefs who look upon the refugees
 as a source of turmoil have assessed the
 situation with some  accuracy.  Arab
 propagandists are again at work with
 their messages of hate and destruction.
 The shock of the first days of war has
 worn off and the troublemakers again
 find receptive ears. We have only to take
 note of the general strikq of Arab mer-
 chants in Jerusalem last week. By the
 agreement of all observers, Israel has
 treated the Jerusalem Arabs well. The
 strike indicates the kind of behavior one
 could expect en masse if Israel tried to
 absorb some millions of Arabs. That be-
 havior might range from civil disobedi-
 ence, such as we saw in Jerusalem, or
 guerrilla warfare, such as was conducted
 for years from the Gaza Strip. The Arab
 refugees are restless. They are being
 stirred up. They may soon be contribut-
 ing actively, as they have in the past, to
 instability in the Middle East.
 Four years ago, I visited Israel and.I
 made an extensive study of the refugees
 living under United Nations jurisdiction
 on the Israel frontiers. I warned then
 that "unless the United States takes the
 initiative, another decade will find that
 the Palestine Arab refugees have become
 even more institutionalized and more
 difficult to integrate." I made 10 recom-
 mendations for the purpose of restoring
 fluidity to the situation. They were not
 followed-with a result that we all
 know-another round of destructive war.
 I visited Israel again last month and
 found the situation much worse than be-
 fore. Millions of dollars had been spent,
 most of them by the United States, to
 sustain  the  refugees.  But  the  years
 brought no    improvement.    Conditions
 have obviously become more threaten-
 ing and all our money and efforts have
 been wasted. I repeat now that the
 United States must act if war is not
 again to be the fruit of our efforts.
 Mr. Speaker, it is against our national
 interest to allow the current refugee situ-
 ation to continue, deteriorating as it does
 week by week. If the volatile situation in
 the Middle East explodes once more, the
 price may be much heavier for all of us.
 I believe we cannot afford, no matter
 what the cost, to permit the current
 refugee problem to rigidify, as it did after
 the 1948 war. Solutions obviously become
 more difficult, Mr. Speaker, in ratio to
 their rigidity.
 Unfortunately, my recommendations
 of 4 years ago will no longer do. Had
 they been followed then, I believe the
 refugee problem would have been re-
 duced to manageable limits. But that is
 spilled milk and we must look elsewhere
 for an answer.
 That is why, Mr. Speaker, I believe
 that a dramatic gesture of constructive
 good will on our part is both mandatory
 and urgent. That is why I feel the time
 has come to divest ourselves of some pre-
 conceptions. It is the moment for cour-
 age and audacity.
 I would like, Mr. Speaker, for the Pres-
 ident of the. United States to announce
 at once his willingness to accept into this
 country 25,000 refugees of the Arab-
 Israeli wars.
 I have no animosity for the Arab peo-
 ple, nor do my fellow Americans. On the
 contrary, I believe they can make pro-
 ductive citizens of this country. My
 study into the refugees 4 years ago indi-
 cated that, with relatively little training,
 many of them could be made into highly
 skilled workers. I believe that many
 Arabs would gladly accept the offer to
 settle in the United States and that the
 United States would absorb them with
 almost no difficulty.
 It is delusive to expect miracles, Mr.
 Speaker, but I would hope that such a
 gesture on our part would produce a
 chain reaction that might lead to the
 end of one of the most troublesome as-
 pects of the Middle Eastern morass.
 I would look to the other countries of
 the West to make similar gestures. Most
 of the Western European countries are
 still short of labor. Australia and New
 Zealand welcome immigrants. Canada,
 Brazil, and Argentina have already of-
 fered to accept some Arab refugees. The
 West has room for more Arab peoples.
 The nations of the Communist bloc
 would, I hope, behave with equivalent
 magnanimity. Certainly they could do
 no less than the nations of the West to
 assist their recent allies.
 The various international philanthrop-
 ic organizations, including the agencies
 of the United Nations, would, I am sure,
 cooperate in a major resettlement pro-
 gram.
 If I am right in foreseeing events, then
 surely all the Arab States would be put
 to tremendous pressure to take in their
 own brethren, to the limit of their capac-
 ity. Certainly, we would help them make
 the transition, because we would rather
 spend our money on resettlement than
 on reconstruction made necessary by
 another war. How long could the Arab
 leaders resist welcoming the refugees, if
 they were being welcomed by peoples
 throughout the world?
 I have no doubt that Israel would also
 make its contribution, if such a chain
 of events were underway. Israel is ready
 to take a proportionate part of the re-
 sponsibility for the integration of the
 refugees into society, though obviously it
 cannot take the full responsibility. Israel
 has clearly indicated that it would help.
 Once the momentum of resettlement
 begins, we may be able to resolve this
 problem. The time has come, at least,
 to make a beginning. We will solve noth-
 ing by paralysis. The initiative in this
 field must lead to negotiations in a
 variety of other fields where differences
 remain acute. We must restore fluidity
 to a situation which is rapidly worsen-
 ing. Peace in the Middle East requires no
 less of us, and the cause is worth our ef-
 fort.
 Mr. Speaker, in my report to the Con-
 gress in 1963, I stated:
 Although I do not regard the solution of
 the Arab refugee problem as the key issue
 between Israel and the Arab states, I am
 convinced that the refugee problem is one of
 the problems that must be solved if there is
 to be peace and stability in the Near East.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          August 10, 1967
 Today, however, I am of the opinion
 that unless and until the Ai *b refugee
 problem is solved, there can be no peace.
 It is tragic, Mr. Speaker, that 4 years
 have passed since I made that report
 on the Near East and we have gone
 through another destructive war, but we
 are still left with the same dilemmas.
 The refugee problem is, as I said then,
 only one of the many differences that
 exist between Israel and the Arab States.
 But we Americans learned to our dis-
 may when we went to the brink of war
 last June that the problems of the Mid-
 dle East are the world's problems. A new
 war may be a world war. We :cannot af-
 ford to sit back waiting for the initiative
 to come from another quarter. We must
 not wait for the milk of human kindness
 to flow from sources which, in our time,
 have only been dry. We must show by
 our own good will what the possibilities
 are for peace. I believe we can set an ex-
 ample for the community of nations.
 We have the resources and the capacity
 for moral leadership. I call: upon the
 President to respond positively to my
 proposal to restore the movement toward
 permanent peace.
 Mr. TENZER. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. FARBSTEIN. Yes, I will be glad
 to yield to the gentleman from. New York.
 Mr. TENZER. Mr. Speaker, I want to
 congratulate the gentleman from New
 York, a member of the Committee on
 Foreign Relations, for his compassion
 and understanding of the problem. With-
 out the settlement of the Arab refugee
 problem in the Middle East, 'permanent
 peace cannot be established in that area
 of the world. And while I do not speak
 and cannot speak for what the State of
 Israel might do, I believe it is. commend-
 able that the suggestion is made that the
 United States take the lead in suggest-
 ing and promoting a worldwide program
 for the resettlement of the Arab refugees.
 Of course, the gentleman understands
 that 25,000 of the 1.3 million' refugees is
 a very small proportion.
 I would like to say to the: gentleman
 that on June 13, 1967, I made a state-
 ment on the floor of the House rather
 proposing an extensive program for re-
 settlement of the Arab refugees on the
 land available in the various territories
 around the State of Israel, and that it
 would cost far less to reclaim that and
 desert land than it would to conduct an
 arms race in that area.
 Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to com-
 mend the gentleman for all of his sug-
 gestions. They deserve the greatest con-
 sideration of our Government.
 Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, I want
 to thank the gentleman for his remarks.
 I want to say his view and his idea is an
 excellent one. I might say that of course
 this is part of this plan. But Ii feel that if
 the entireworld felt a sense of awareness
 of this problem, if the entire world did
 something to break the logjam that has
 existed for 19 years, that today these
 Arab refugees who are presently under
 the control and direction of Israel will
 be permitted to emigrate from these
 areas where they are presently located,
 where previous to June 5 the Arab na-
 tions would not permit them to emigrate,
 because they used those Arab refugees
 as a po itical whip with which to beat
 Israel o'er the head.
 Mr. Speaker, K. again want to say to
 the gen;leman that any plan that will
 tend to break this long logjam is a plan
 that will lend to fluidity because if there
 is an agreement insofar as one item is
 concern xi, then who knows but one may
 lead to another, this may start a chain
 of events which will result in peace in
 the Mic dle East, which is necessary in
 order to have peace in the, world.
 RYAN 11ILL TO FACILITATE ITALIAN
 IMMIGRATION
 The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.
 SMITH cf Iowa). Under a previous order
 of the House, the gentleman from New
 York ^ Sr. RYAN]. is recognized for 30
 minutes.
 Mr. F.YAN. Mr. Speaker, remedy as it
 did many of the irrational and inequi-
 table policies of our. previous laws, the
 Icnmigr:ition and Naturalization Act of
 1965 ccntains certain defects-defects
 which tndercut specific policies embod-
 ied in that legislation.
 Under the preseht law certain aliens
 register-d in the fifth preference cate-
 gory for immigration into the United
 States find themselves in a situation
 which is clearly inconsistent with the
 policy of equality of treatment and that
 favoring reunification of families-pol-
 icies which are fundamental to our new
 philosophy regarding the treatment of
 aliens who wish to immigrate to the
 United States.
 Mr.  3peaker,  as  I  will  explain in
 greater detail, the effect of the immigra-
 tion lav, is to discriminate against Ital-
 ian brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens
 compared to brothers and sisters of
 other nationalities applying for perma-
 nent immigration visas.
 The Existing situation is such that an
 Italian brother and sister as well as his
 spouse ,end children, on behalf of whom
 a petition for immigration under the
 fifth, preference category is filed today,
 will wa:.t at the minimum 10 years be-
 fore he will receive a visa. A more real-
 istic estimate is that he will wait 15 to
 20 year, ~.
 In comparison, one from any of the
 other f 3 nations for which the fifth
 preference is oversubscribed, for whom
 a similtsr petition is filed, will probably
 be required to wait, in most cases, no
 longer -han 1 or 2 years before receiv-
 ing an immigration visa.
 Convrsely,  an Italian eligible for
 fifth preference status must have filed
 over 1.'  years ago in order to receive
 an immigration visa. An alien, holding
 fifth preference status, from any of the
 other i3 nations for which that cate-
 gory is oversubscribed, must have filed
 only 13 months ago in order to receive
 a simils.r visa.
 The 'visa Office. of the Bureau of Se-
 curity f,nd Consular Affairs of the State
 Department informs me that as of the
 end of 1966 there were nearly 100,000
 Italian:. who had been approved for fifth
 prefere:ace status.
 Under the current law the Italian
 quota ii,5,666 per year; but section 201
 (c) and (d) of the Immigration and
 Nationality Act of 1965-8 U.S.C. 1151
 (c) and (d)-provides that quota num-
 bers, unused in a preceedin?; fiscal year
 are to be put in an immigration pool
 for use duringthe next fiscal year. Im-
 migrants unable to obtain an immigra-
 tion visa. under the regular allotment for
 a specific preference category can ob-
 tain a visa fromthis pool during a sub-
 sequent  fiscal year  in  accordance  to
 their preference status and the date
 their petition was- filed with the Attor-
 ney General-section 203(d) of the Im-
 migration and Nationality Act of 1965-
 8 U.S.C. 1153(c).
 Although the 1965 act abolishes the dis-
 criminatory national origin quota sys-
 tem, it does place a maximum limit of
 170,000 on the number of permanent
 immigrants permitted to come into the
 United States each year from non-
 Western Hemisphere countries. Section
 201(a)-8 U.S.C. 1151(a). Furthermore,
 section 202(a)-8 U.S.C.  1152(a)-re-
 stricts the number of permanent im-
 migrants from any one country to 20,000
 per year. Special immigrants defined by
 section 101(a)  (27) -8 U.S.C. 1101(a)
 (27)-and immediate relatives of U.S.
 citizens-defined in section 201(b)-8
 U.S.C. 1115(b)--as children, spouses and
 parents of a citizen of the United States-
 are not subject to the numerical limita-
 tions.
 Under section  203(a) (5)-8  U.S.C.
 1153(a) (5)-24 percent of the 170,000
 annual maximum are permitted to immi-
 grate annually under the fifth prefer-
 ence  classification.  That  is,                                                                                         40,800
 brothers and sisters, and their spouses
 and children, of U.S. citizens are per-
 mitted to come into the United States
 each year in the order in which their
 petition has been filed with the Attorney
 General-section 204(a)-8 U.S.C. 1154
 (a); section 203(c)-8 U.S.C. 1153(c).
 I point out that the 40,800 limit in-
 cludes not only brothers and sisters of
 United Citizens, but a spouse or child-
 unmarried person under 21 years of age-
 who is not otherwise entitled to an im-
 migrant status and the immediate issu-
 ance of a visa, or to conditional entry,
 under another preference category-sec-
 tion 203(a) (9)-8 U.S.C. 1153(a) (9).
 Thus, for example, of the 3,538 perma-
 nent immigrant visas issued to fifth pref-
 erence Italians between December 1,
 1965, and June 30, 1966, 1,269 were for
 brothers or sisters of a U.S. citizen; 726
 were for spouses of those brothers and
 sisters; and 1,543 were for children of
 those brothers and sisters--Annual Re-
 port of the Visa Office, Bureau of Security
 and Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of
 State, 1966, page 45.
 . Theoretically, any visas not required
 for the first four preference categories
 can be used by fifth preference applicants.
 Since the Visa Office has not, as yet,
 compiled figures regarding permanent
 visas issued for the fiscal year ending
 June 30, 1967, my projections are based
 upon the number of permanent visas is-
 sued between the effective date of the
 1965 act, December 1, 1965, and June 30,
 1966. During that period the number of
 permanent visas issued to Italians by
 perference category were as follows:

 HON. HASTINGS KEITH
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, August 10, 1967
 Mr. KEITH. Mr. Speaker, recently
 there has been a great deal of publicity,
 most of it unfavorable, focused on the
 House of Representatives rejection of the
 resolution to consider the Rat Extermi-
 nation Act of 1967.
 My vote against the resolution was
 based on the conviction that rat eradi-
 cation can best be handled at the local
 level, and that the existing Federal pro-
 grams to provide financial assistance to
 fight rats do not require further prolifer-
 ation.
 No one, Mr. Speaker, ever denied that
 rats pose a serious problem to the health
 and economy of our Nation. Yet, there

 that Congress is impervious to the wel-
 fare of small children-that it spends

 Sentiment has obscured reason in this ap-
 proach. Contagious disease among animals or
 humans, whether hookworm, hepatitis or
 cancer, is properly a challenge to the federal
 government. But there is no epidemic threat
 in this country from rats, says Dr. Donaldson.
 Rats would not be a threat without ac-
 cumulations of garbage and filth and proper-
 ty neglect, for which lazy or indifferent peo-

 It is at that level that Mr. Johnson should

 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, August 10, 1967
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, President
 Nasser's inhumanity to his fellow man,
 and to his brother Arab no less, was once
 again demonstrated by his use of lethal
 nerve gas against the Yemenite popula-
 tion.
 The International Red Cross has con-
 firmed the use of this gas and has re-
 ported that women, children, and live-
 stock, as well as Yemenite troops, have
 fallen victim to Nasser's brutality.
 I commend to the attention of our col-
 leagues an article written by Ralph Mc-
 Gill, for the August 3, 1967, edition of
 the Washington Evening. Star. The ar-
 ticle concerns Nasser's atrocious acts and
 follows :
 NERVE GAS:  A FIRST FOR NASSER
 In Yemen President Nasser's love and com-
 passion for his brother Arab is revealed by his
 army's use of lethal  gas  on  villages and
 troops. Women, children, cattle and other
 livestock are among the victims.
 The International Red Cross has confirmed
 the use of these gases. The United Nations has
 a report. The gas is being dropped in bombs.
 It is a mixture of phosgene and nerve gas.
 Phosgene was the gas which attained no-
 toriety and condemnation in the First World
 War. The Germans initiated use of it against
 French and Canadian troops on the Ypres
 front, on April 22, 1915.
 Nerve gas has been used in Yemen for the
 first time in the history of warfare. It is, as
 used in Yemen, mixed with phosgene. Nerve
 gas, either in liquid or spray form, is a killer.
 There is an injection of atropine which, if
 taken immediately after exposure will save
 the victim's life.
 Adults, however, will find no comfort in
 news of the specific. Persons around 40 years
 old and above are not helped by the injection.

 they are being built from both sides. The

 Rhodesia's problem, If we may try to guess

 remained loyal to their king, who was dis-
 .placed by a Nasser-supported coup. Despite
 the fact they are relatively untrained and
 possess few weapons, they have managed to
 stand off the Egyptian troops.
 Now, however, they are probably near de-
 feat. The first use of phosgene gas against
 them was in 1966.
 In January 1967, the International Red
 Cross reported another gas attack, largely
 against villagers. This was nerve gas, the first
 use of it in history. Over 200 villagers, in-
 cluding women and children, and livestock
 were killed.
 In May, shortly before mobilization against
 Israel,  there was another  attack.
 Since that war ended, Nasser has stepped
 up use of gas. On July 4, 5 and 10, nerve gas
 was dumped on the Yemen villagers and on
 areas where the stubborn army was holding
 out. There understandably is growing panic
 and fear among the people who have for so
 long opposed Nasser's army.
 There has been loud outcry because of the
 general use of napalm in recent warfare, in-
 cluding that in Vietnam. There was protest,
 even, against the use of defoliation sprays to
 kill leaves in jungle areas of heavy troops
 and arms concentration.
 But Nasser's  brutal  use of lethal  gas
 against  civilians and troops-all fellow
 Arabs-has gone unprotected in and out of

 rageous.
 Just why the Russians, who are now the
 most influential power with Nasser, do not
 use their connection to halt use of gas also is
 a question. It does not redound to Soviet
 credit  to  be  rebuilding  Nasser's  armed
 strength and not demanding he cease the
 ugly and barbaric use of gas in Yemen.
 Key Job To Fill at State
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. PETER H. B. FRELINGHUYSEN
 OF NEW. JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, August 10, 1967
 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker,
 it is with regret that many Members of
 Congress learn that Wayne Fredericks,
 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
 African Affairs, is leaving Government
 service. Mr. Fredericks is a man of un-
 usual qualifications and his absence will
 be felt in the State Department and here
 in Washington. I wish to insert an edi-
 torial from today's New York Times pay-
 ing tribute to Wayne Fredericks.
 The editorial is as follows:
 KEY Jon To FILL AT STATE
 A Deputy Assistant Secretary for African
 Affairs does not rank high in the State De-
 partment bureaucracy, but J. Wayne Fred-
 ericks transformed that post into a key in-
 strument of two-way education. He did much
 to educate leaders of the new Africa about
 America, but his greater contribution may
 have been the education of Americans about
 Africa's problems and prospects.
 Mr. Fredericks was a tireless advocate of
 an activeand distinctive American policy for
 a continent usually low on Washington's pri-
 ority  list. He  thus helped overcome that
 "tremendous institutional inertial force" at
 State of which Adlai Stevenson warned Presi-
 dent-elect Kennedy in 1960. He aroused an
 enduring interest in Africa on the part of
 intelligent young members of the Congress
 and many others in the community at large.
 This dedicated man could carry on such a
 free-wheeling,  many-faceted  operation  in
 part because . he was not a career diplomat,
 beholden to the Foreign Service establish-
 ment. With his departure from Government,
 President Johnson and Secretary Rusk would
 be well advised to conclude that they can
 best fill the job by going outside the Foreign
 Service, as President Kennedy did when he
 appointed Mr. Fredericks in 1961.
 Providing an Improved Promotion Sys-
 tem for Medical and Dental Officers of
 the Armed Forces
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. DURWARD G. HALL
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 7, 1967
 Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
 port of H.R. 10242 which would provide
 for an improved promotion system for
 medical and dental officers of the Armed
 Forces. This legislation was a long time
 coming and is urgently needed, in my
 considered opinion.
 By improving the promotional system
 the poor retention rate of physicians and
 dentists in the armed services will be im-
 proved. This, in turn, will provide for
 more experienced medical personnel, the
 end result being improved quality in
 medical care to our service men and
 women.
 Unsatisfactory promotion opportunity
 has long been an important factor in our
 poor retention rate in the medical and
 dental officer corps. Physicans and den-
 tists are highly trained and scarce com-
 modities of personnel who have never
 had equal promotion opportunity in the
 armed services. They have always had
 to compete with other officers in the line
 for promotion when a vacancy occurred.
 This new legislation will eliminate the
 wasteful and unnecessary competition
 with line officers, and will create new
 promotional opportunities in the Medi-
 cal and Dental Corps, especially for field
 grades.
 The legislation would also grant much
 needed relief of the presently severe re-
 striction in the number of authorized
 general or flag officer positions. As we
 well know, under existing regulations,
 we cannot expect to retain our senior
 colonels beyond the 20-year point un-
 less there is a reasonable opportunity
 for further promotion.
 I have introduced similar legislation
 which would assist in the elimination of
 this problem  throughout  the  entire
 armed services which is entitled "selected
 extended tenure program." Coupled with
 this is the fact that the military is un-
 able at present, to promote their ex-
 perienced clinical specialists to general
 officer grade without removing them
 from their clinical position. What is re-
 quired is authorized flag and general of-
 ficer positions in our teaching hospitals
 and larger medical centers, so as to pro-
 vide the incentive for highly qualified
 physicians to remain in the military serv-
 ice. The remaining step is to possibly
 increase and certainly -compress spe-
 cialty professional and- proficiency pay.
 A4073
 Mr. Speaker, in summary, this legis-
 lation not only provides new career in-
 centive through promotion and reten-
 tion, but it would substantially enhance
 the prestige of highly qualified physi-
 cians and dentists in the armed services.
 Parceling Out the Riot Blame
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GEORGE M. RHODES
 OF PENNSYLVANIA         -
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 - Thursday, August 10, 1967
 Mr. RHODES of Pennsylvania. -Mr.
 Speaker, the events of the last few weeks
 have demonstrated that there, is a need
 for a reappraisal of the problems facing
 the cities of America. However, rather
 than a serious reappraisal, what we are
 experiencing is a frantic effort to place
 the blame for these tragic events on the
 President, Congress, Governors, mayors,
 and others.
 I would commend to my colleagues a
 column written by Frank Getlein, and
 published in a recent issue of the Wash-
 ington Star. It illustrates-the futility of
 attempting to indict any one person or
 institution for riots and other ills of our
 society. The column follows:
 PARCELING OUT THE RIOT BLAME
 (By Frank Getlein)
 The amazing things about the recent riots
 in our cities is how perfectly they bore out
 the direst forebodings of practically every-
 one. It' isn't just that they didn't take any-
 one by surprise. Nothing takes anyone by
 surprise anymore. But beyond that, after the
 events-and  even  during them-the  riots
 turned out to be- the predictable result of
 what everyone on all sides of every question
 has been arguing all the time.
 Take the gunnuts, pro and con, who are
 the easiest to identify with a simple, strong
 position. From the point of view of the anti-
 gunnuts, if only Congress had passed a fire-
 arms control law after the assassination of
 President  $ennedy, - as  the  anti-gunnuts
 urged at the time, the riots would never have
 taken place,  since the   only guns around
 would be in the hands of the police, a likely
 story.
 The pro-gunnuts, by contrast, find that
 the riots prove their point that the worst
 thing Congress could do would be to pass a
 gun control law. When riots erupt, the law-
 abiding citizen is  well-advised to have  a
 shooting iron handy to protect his loved ones
 and his property. If shopowners and pedes-
 trians had only had more guns of their own,
 the riots wouldn't have happened, another
 likely story.              -
 Moving  from  the  surface  froth  to  the
 surges of the deep, we find the same inter-
 esting  manifestation  of  simultaneous                                                                                                    ar-
 rival at the same place from opposite start-
 ing points by moving in opposite directions.
 One school holds that riots are the direct
 result of congressional inaction on adminis-
 tration proposals for expanding the poverty
 program.  "If  Sarge  were  only  here,"  the
 thought goes, "these things wouldn't have
 happened." This seems to suppose that snip-
 ers and swipers are all subscribers to the
 Congressional Record and - hit  the   streets
 whenever their favorite magazine reports pad
 news for ole Sarge. Possible, of course. There
 have been stranger literary tastes than the
 Record, although it's - hard to think of one
 offhand.
 On the other side of that particular street,

 citizenry actually believed what a president
 said he would do for them and ran rioting
 when he didn't do it. Well, it's true that
 many Negroes have been deprived of a decent
 education, but surely they are not so totally
 deprived as to take a politician's word for his
 bond. .
 Equally comforting to those who hold it is
 the outside agitator theory of riots. The ap-
 proach here is that young unemployed Ne-
 groes in any given community are perfectly
 happy, all the time singing and doing the
 cake-walk, until those rascally outsiders come
 inside from the cold and make things hot.
 A particularly striking instance of the iden-
 tity of opposites in riot theory is found in
 the role of the police. In Detroit, the police
 are blamed for not moving in immediately
 with hard hats and hard noses and no non-
 sense. If only firm action had been taken
 from the first, it is righteously pointed out,
 nothing at all would have happened. On the
 other hand, the police in Milwaukee did move
 swiftly to control the situation and what are
 they, for their pains? Honky-fascists, that's
 what; guilty of police brutality and prema-
 ture tough-mindedness. It's not just that the
 police can't win; they can't even hope to stay
 even. No matter what they do, no matter
 whether a riot takes place or not, no matter
 whether people are killed or people are saved,
 the police are always wrong.
 And so, for that matter, is everyone else.
 From some point of view or other, everyone-
 President, Congress, poverty workers, black
 power shouters, mayors, governors, National
 Guard, police, white men, black men, begger-
 men, thieves-everyone is responsible for the
 riots.
 That's the beauty of it. What everyone is
 responsible for, nobody has to do anything
 about except sort out the blame onto all
 those other people. And that is what, in Con-
 gress, in committee, in state house and White
 House, in your house and my house, we are
 all engaged in doing.
