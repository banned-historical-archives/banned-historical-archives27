 MEMORANDUM FOR:       Director of Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director for Central Intelligence

 National Intelligence Officer for Warning

 National Intelligence Officer for
 China-East Asia Pacific
 SUBJECT               Warning Assessment:   China-East Asia Pacific
 The following items were discussed by the Community
 Representatives at the 19 May Warning meeting.
 China
 1.   Analysts discussed the apparent contradictions between the
 recent speech of Hua Guofeng which contained criticism of material
 incentives, and a Peoples Daily article the following day defending
 such incentives in strongest terms.   While Hua's speech could have
 represented a serious division among the leadership, most analysts
 considered it to be more of a personal position of Hua himself,
 who seems to be fighting a losing battle to stay in power.  Deng
 Xiaoping's reported decision to step down in August probably meant that
 he would be taking Hua with him, too, and Hua is "going out with a
 whimper."  The question of incentives would be addressed at the
 forthcoming NPC session according to Vice Premier Zhao Ziyang, but
 there was no reason to believe that present policy lines would be
 reversed even though there were clearly those at lower levels who
 opposed material rewards for production increases.  (C)

 ago with respect to Vietnam and Kampuchea (see below).
 2.   On Chinese foreign policy, analysts believe that the
 Chinese are presently quite concerned over their relations with
 the ASEAN countries, particularly the tendency among some of these
 countries -- Indonesia and Malaysia -- to seek out a negotiated
 settlement of the Kampuchean situation.   This may be why Deng
 Xiaoping spoke of accepting a phased Vietnam withdrawal from
 Kampuchea to a German reporter.   There was no question but that
 China is now in a more difficult situation then it was a year
 Indochina
 3.  Analysts did not believe that Vietnam intended to make
 any serious concessions with respect to Thai and the other ASEAN
 countries on troop withdrawal from Vietnam -- the reported VN
 willingness to withdraw some troops was regarded as a token
 gesture and possibly could be related to the practice that Hanoi
 followed in last year's rainy season in withdrawing some units
 back to Vietnam for refitting.   Vietnam Foreign Minister Thach's
 visit to Kuala Lumpur showed no real flexibility despite some
 reference to some troop withdrawals under "certain conditions."
 However, the Vietnamese apparently perceived the existence of
 differences among the ASEAN nations on negotiations and were
 trying to exploit these differences.
 4.   The purge of the Lao Dong party currently conducted by
 the Vietnamese was not regarded as being particularly serious; the
 Vietnamese were evidently attempting to weed out cadres who were
 "good at war but no good at managing the economy."  The corrupt
 and inefficient were also targeted for elimination.  Nevertheless,
 the purge (which had begun in January) could pickup steam later
 this year as high-ranking party members became involved.   It was
 noted that party members of Chinese ethnic background were being
 Arms and equipment from Chinese sources appeared adequate.

 5.  Analysts commented upon the apparent consolidation of Soviet
 military presence in Vietnam at Cam Ranh Bay.   It appeared that air
 activities formerly conducted from Da Nang were being moved to Cam
 Ranh, where Soviet ground controllers as well as avaition fuel
 storage facilities were being located.  A continuin  Soviet naval
 presence at Cam Ranh Bay was reported upon.
 6.  Within Kampuchea, analysts commented that the DK forces
 under Pol Pot had evidently developed plans for military operations
 during the rainy season, but no real action had yet occurred.
 However, the rainy season had not yet fully arrived.   The DK forces
 were evidently drawing food supply from UN stocks at the Thai border.

 the west, i.e., the Thai border area and not from the east,
 7.  Analysts observed that the Vietnamese were trying hard
 to provide a facade of a Kampuchean governmental structure under
 Heng Samrin, but were still not having much success.  Village
 committees had been set up in some areas of Kampuchea but lacked
 real authority and the only local governmental operations which
 functioned required active Vietnamese support.  Cl
 8.   On the food situation in Kampuchea reports of starvation
 in Battambang and even some of the eastern provinces adjacent to
 Vietnam were coming in, and the situation was regarded as likely
 to get worse.   The Vietnamese were making some food stocks available
 to the populace in order to draw people to support the Heng Samrin
 regime, but while Vietnamese and Heng Samrin government officials
 received 30 kilos of rice per month, only three kilos of rice per
 person were going to the Kampucheans.   Seed rice was coming from
 9.  Analysts noted that increased quantities of Vietnamese
 supplies were being sent to Northern Laos, but no serious Chinese
 provocations in this region had occurred.   The types of supplies

 10.  Analysts expressed the view that Prem's government was
 doing about as well as could be expected -- the economy was still
 in serious trouble and inflation was increasing -- but there was
 no threat for the time being to political stability nor to the Prem
 government itself.   People were giving him the benefit of the doubt.
 However, Prem would need to come to grips soon with the economic
 problems facing the country.  Analysts called attention to the
 1 October date for making annual military promotions, and speculated
 that Prem could encounter some problems around this time.  Although
 he had been identified with ISOC (Internal Security Operations Command)
 former colleagues in the ISOC had not been taken into the government
 by him and were dissatisfied. There were also elements of the ISOC
 who would like to move further away from the Chinese who traditionally
 had been identified with support for the Communist-led insurgency. fl
 South Korea
 11.   Analysts were not surprised by the declaration of martial
 law in South Korea given the failure of the government's restrained
 approach to student demonstrations.   One analyst characterized General
 Chun Doo Hwan as having a seige mentality which made his strong
 reaction to the student's ultimatum and 22 May deadline predictable.
 It was generally agreed that Chun enjoyed strong support within the

 I                                            which has come to light since
 our meeting, appears to back up that judgment.   There is probably
 a good deal less support among military officers for Chun's
 capitalizing on martial law to neutralize -- in some cases wipe
 out -- his political opposition.

 NIC Warning A.?enda:  Potential Warning Developments over the next 90 days.
 I.  Iran-Iraq:
 A.  Prospects for an escalation of tensions.
 NFAC, INR and DIA have agreed that "major hostilities" or a "full-
 scale conflict" are unlikely in the near term.  The US Interests Section in
 Baghdad has supported this consensus with the judgment that war is unlikely
 unless the internal situation in either country deteriorates markedly.
 B.  The central problem for warning:  Does this consensus address the
 least likely contingency and overlook more plausible lines of development?
 -Limited hostilities precipiitat.ed by incidents such as the attempted
 assassination of Ghotbzadeh in Kuwait and the seizure of the Irai:ian
 embassy in London;  or by a sudden escalation of border clashes or
 Iraqi attempts to intimidate Iran into withdrawing from the islands
 near the Strait of Hormuz.
 -Increased efforts by both regimes to provoke internal problems for
 the other.  There have been tenuous hints, for example, that the
 Iranians are seeking Syrian cooperation in an attempt to oust the
 Baghdad regime.
 C.  Effects on Iranian calculations and actions of Sovlrr, and East
 European promises of economic and logistical assistance to circumvent ? Iestern
 sanctions or US moves to close Iranian ports.
 D.  Current reporting has focused on short term prospects.
 Recommendation: An assessment of-Iraq's maximum and minimum aims,with special

 reference to the abrogation of the Algiers Accords and claims to Khuzestan
 and the Gulf Islands,;.  Iraq's perception of the military balance and the
 options presented by Iran's political and military vulnerability;  Iraq's
 calculations of prospects for attracting Arab support for moves against Iran
 by widening the dispute into an Arab-Iranian conflict.
 II.  Cuba:  Castro's Intentions.
 A.  NFAC assessments have implied that Castro's moves on the refugee
 issue have been influenced to a large extent by his   =_ong--range concarn for
 the island's safety" and that he is attempting to draw the US into negotiations
 not only to "regularize" 'the flow of refugees but to seek US: "assurances" against
 hostile actions toward
 his regime.  Neither IER nor DIA has offered an analysis of Castro's motives
 and intentions.
 B.  From the warning standpoint, it would be useful to consider an
 alternative hypothesis that addresses the possibility that Castro intends to
 provoke a contrived crisis with the US as a means of diverting domestic
 attention from his embarrassing Peruvian Embassy miscalculation and economic
 and political discontent.
 kahen Castro authorized the exodus from Mariel, he anticipated that
 Washington would obstruct mass emigration to Florida.  The Cuban
 press charged that the initial US reaction belied the Administration's
 human rights policy.
 -Havana planned to couple the expected impasse on refugee immi;;ration
 with a nationwide mobilization to denounce the "Solid Shield" military
 exercise scheduled to begin at Guantanamo on 8 May.  In late April,
 some military units, particularly in eastern Cuba, were placed on
 increa--,ed readiness, reserves       called up and leaves cancelled,
 new stations in the eastern border ::uard radio net were activated, and
 elements of the eastern SAM brigade may have been deployed.  The foreign

 Approved For   ease 2005/03/24 : 3 IA-RDP83B0010~00300070014-2
 minister informed chiefs of diplomatic missions that Cuban forces were on
 alert and "ready to do their duty."
 -The cancellation of the Guantanamo phase of Solid Shield caused Castro
 to postpone until 17 May his "combative people's march" and nationwide
 demonstrations against the US economic embargo, the US presence at
 Guantanamo, and SR-71 overflights.
 -In his May Day speech, Castro attempted to stimulate greater popular
 hostility to the US by announcing contingency plans in case of a
 "total blockade" by the US.  He also stated that the Army would create a
 new regional paramilitary defense .force to help defend the country.
 -Castro deliberately aggravated the refugee issue by authorizing the
 attack on political prisoners outside the US Interests Section on 2 May
 and by demanding that these "antisocial elements" be handed over without
 conditions.
 -President Carter's pledge on 5 May that the US would "provide an open
 heart and open arms" for the refugees has undercut Castro's plan to
 induce a confrontation on this issue, and he will now concentrate on the
 ecoiLomic embargo, Guantanamo, and overflights.
 B. Under this hypothesis, Castro is impelled primarily by offensive rather
 than defensive motives.
 --He may use the nationwide mobi.,ization on 17 May to issue new demands
 for the return of Guantanamo, and end to the economic embargo, and
 termination of overflights.
 The Cubans might stage an incident, at the access -ate to Guantanamo
 or along the base perimeter.
 - The impasse over political prisoners may be used as a pretext to expel
 the US Interests Section.

 C.  This hypothesis assunes that Castro has been encouraged to provoke a
 confrontation with the US by his reading of Moscow's current attitude toward
 the Carter Administration, if not by direct assurances of Soviet support.
 Moscow's recent shift toward a much harsher stance sug.ests that the Soviet
 leaders have written off any prospects for ending the downturn in relations
 with the US at least until after the November elections.  The Soviets therefore
 may have decided that the time is ripe for endorsing a Cuban challenge, in
 part as a means of settling accounts with the Administration over its hairil in,,
 of the Soviet combat brigade in Cuba and Afghariistan.
 III.  Afghanistan-Pakistan
 A.  The IIM of 13 March judged that the Soviets are unlikel,r to exert
 heavy military pressure on Pakistan so long as Islamabad avoides a close
 alignment with the US and China.  Moscow appears to be satisfied so far
 with President Zia's cautious and aloof posture on Afghanistan.
 B.  What developments in the next three months might lead. to a change in
 this Soviet policy of relative restraint?
 -Failure of Soviet counterinsurgency and border sealing operations to
 produce a significant reduction in resistance.  Would. Lhis contingency
 oblige the Soviets to commit substantially greater forces and shift to
 a more threatening posture toward Pakistan, China and other alleged
 sponsors of the insurgents?
 Soviet perception that Pakistan, China. arnr  tine US were increasing
 military, political and logistical assistance to the rebels.
 -The emergence of sharp differences in the Soviet leadership over
 military strategy and the magnitude of additional resources needed to
 master the situation.  Might the fallout from such differences,
 especially in a charged atmosphere of a widespread Olympic boycott

 incumbent President in many nears.
 --Chancellor Schmidt's reported belief that the Soviets ;re in a "trouble-
 making mood."
 -Ustinov's unexplained absence from the May Day lineup and the leadership's
 condolence call at the Yugoslav embassy.

 Will these domestic problems strengthen Assad's incentive to invite a
 confrontation with Iraq, possibly in collusion with Iran?
