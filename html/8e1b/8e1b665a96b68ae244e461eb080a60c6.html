 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS
 MEMORANDUM TO RECIPIENTS:
 In time, the long-awaited Ninth Party Congress of
 the Chinese Communist Party may come to be regarded as
 a watershed in the political scene.  The Congress did
 clarify certain points,  such as the dominant role and
 authority of the militant Maoists at the peak of party
 leadership, the failure of Mao after three years of
 effort to achieve the primary goals of his Cultural
 Revolution, and his apparent determination to persist
 in the effort.  However, the Party Congress raised as
 many questions as it answered and, at this point in
 time, the analyst is left a new layer of ambiguities
 to deal with.
 This is one of a series of SRS studies based on
 continuing surveillance of the China scene.   It was
 produced solely by the Special Research Staff; the
 research analyst      onsible for its preparation is
 The study was reviewed by analysts

 National Estimates; both offices are in agreement with
 its general thrust and findings.

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS
 Summary
 For those who looked to the Ninth Party Congress
 to provide answers to basic questions about the future
 of Communist China, this first national congress of the
 Chinese Communist Party to be held in eleven years was
 a major disappointment. Whether viewed in terms of the
 new Party leadership, the new Party structure, or the
 course of future political and economic policy, the pub-
 lished record of the Congress was generally vague and
 contradictory.   Because of the ambiguous character of the
 evidence, one's view of developments at the Congress is
 bound to be colored by one's view of developments pre-
 ceding the Congress, indeed by one's view of the Cultural
 Revolution as a whole.
 Organization of the Congress which finally con-
 vened on I April 1969 appears to have been controlled
 from the top.   As Hsieh Fu-chih had revealed in a speech
 in October 1967, the plan was to organize the Congress
 "from the top downward" by having the Party Center select
 those who would attend.
 More important than this in appraising the new
 Party organs is the character of the men selected to
 lead them.  The composition of the Politburo Standing
 Committee, by far the most important Party organ, demon-
 strates graphically the continued domination of the
 top Party leadership by Maoist radicals.  Consisting of
 just five men (Mao, Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Chen Po-ta
 and K'ang Sheng), this Standing Committee is similar to
 the one formed at the outset of the Cultural Revolution
 and, in its composition, places control over the conduct
 of the Party's daily and most ir,?portant affairs in the
 hands of militant Maoists by a margin of four to one.

 Less clear cut and therefore susceptible to
 divergent interpretation is the character of the full
 25-member Politburo "elected" on 28 April at the first
 plenary session of the new Central Committee.   It is pos-
 sible to conclude,f or example, that the most important
 characteristic of this new Politburo is the greater
 representation accorded the People's Liberation Army, a
 development signifying (according to this view) a shift
 in the balance of power in the Politburo in favor of
 proponents of relative "moderation" in domestic and
 foreign policy.  An equally tenable interpretation of
 the addition of these military leaders to the Politburo,
 however, is that it reflects an expansion in the power
 and influence of Lin Piao in this leading Party organ.
 An even more difficult question is judging the
 political complexion of the new, much larger Central Com-
 mittee "elected" at the Congress.   The central issue
 concerns the character of those military leaders who
 already dominate the provincial Revolutionary Committee
 structure and who now comprise over forty percent of the
 new Central Committee.  On this point, the evidence is
 also mixed and does not support a clear-cut judgment.
 There is convincing proof, on
 the
 one hand, of
 Mao's and Lin's dissatisfaction with
 the
 initial perform-
 ance of the People's Liberation Army
 in
 the Cultural
 Revolution in the fact that roughly
 half
 of the Military
 Region and Military District Commands were purged and
 reorganized in 1967.  Even after this large-scale
 reorganization and the selection of new military com-
 manders to positions of leadership in the provincial
 Revolutionary Committee structure, the performance of a
 number of these replacements was subjected to severe
 criticism in the anti-Rightist campaign spearheaded by
 Madame Mao in the spring of 1968.  These military commanders,
 however characterized, could hardly meet the criteria
 laid down by Lin Piao in August 1966 for the selection
 of new Party leaders--that they eagerly studied the
 thought of Mao Tse-tung, attached great importance to
 political-ideological work and were filled with
 revolutionary zeal.

 On the other hand,  the PLA has discharged its role
 as the main executer of policy during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and as the whipping-boy for problems resulting from
 that policy with remarkable discipline and obedience.
 With the possible exception of the Wuhan Incident, there
 is no known instance of local military commanders directly
 defying orders from Peking, orders which frequently resulted
 in subjecting them to physical attack and humiliating
 abuse at the hands of the Red Guards.   When mistakes have
 been made, they have either been mistakes of omission or
 the result of a natural tendency to interpret ambiguous
 directives so as to minimize disorder and safeguard their
 own positions.  On balance, then, it appears that these
 military leaders at the regional and provincial levels
 to whom important Party and government functions have
 been assigned, should be characterized as essentially
 loyal to Mao.
 Despite the general impression of uncertainty con-
 veyed by the published record of the Ninth Party Congress,
 there is good reason to believe that the Maoist leadership
 intends to persevere in the face of great odds toward
 the achievement of the original goals of the Cultural
 Revolution.  An appraisal of progress to date in achieving
 these goals demonstrates that there is a considerable
 distance to go.
 The undertaking to achieve the final goal--the
 creation of "revolutionary successors"--has in some ways
 been the most frustrating and least successful.  At the
 very top, Lin Piao of course is now in place as Mao's
 successor, but there is considerable doubt both about
 Lin's health and his ability to endure after Mao is gone.
 Although the Politburo is weighted with handpicked sup-
 porters, few if any of these are both talented and
 youthful enough to take over when the present generation
 goes.   It is at provincial and lower levels, however,
 where the failure to identify and promote to positions
 of leadership Mao's "revolutionary Leftist" supporters
 has been most apparent.

 The strange fact that after three years of turmoil
 and violence in the Cultural Revolution the Chinese Com-
 munist Party is still largely inoperative outside of
 Peking can be explained in various ways.  One explanation
 is that Mao, at least in the early period, did not intend
 to reconstruct the Party, or at least restore it to its
 former position of centrality in the political structure.
 Another is that Mao has been thwarted in his plan to rebuild
 the Party by opposition within the military and the old
 Party and government apparatus.
 A third, related explanation is that the primary
 cause for this snail's pace in Party building is a continu-
 ing fear by the Maoist leadership in Peking of a
 "restoration of the old," of a revival of the pre-Cultural
 Revolution "bureaucratic" Party apparatus staffed by
 unrepentant and unredeemed cadres.  Until such time as
 sufficient "new blood" ("new cadres") is brought into the
 leadership, it appears that the Party will conti:iue to
 lead a shadowy, ghost-like existence at provincial and
 local levels of the new structure of power.

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS
 "There is no construction without destruction .  .
 Destruction means criticism and repudiation, it means
 revolution.   It involves reasoning things out, which is
 construction.   Put destruction first, and in the process
 you have construction." -- Mao Tse-tung, Quoted in "Circular
 of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,"
 16 May 1966.
 In h+.s keynote political report to the Ninth Party
 Congress, Lin Piao discussed at some length the history
 of the "great proletarian cultural revolution" from its
 formal inception at a May 1966 Central Committee work
 conference to its nominal conclusion at the Party Congress
 in April 1969.   Although he listed the objectives of the
 Cultural Revolution as ideological, political and economic
 in character, Lin stressed that "the fundamental question
 in the current great revolution" is "the question of
 political power, a question of which class holds leadership."
 Mao Tse-tung's fundamental purpose in launching the
 Cultural Revolution, then, was to seek out and destroy his
 opponents within the Party and government, and replace
 them with loyal and dedicated supporters.  As suggested
 in the quotation cited above, Mao expected that the
 Cultural Revolution would serve to identify his opponents
 and supporters by their conduct in the "destructive"
 phase of revolutionary struggle, and thus prepare the
 way for "construction" of a new revolutionary order.
 What actually happened, however, as Lin Piao revealed
 in his political report, was that the Cultural Revolution
 produced "an extremely complicated situation" in which
 (quoting Mao) it was "hard" to distinguish "between
 ourselves ai.d the enemy."
 Inaccurate as it may be as a description of reality,
 Mao's formulation of the dialectical relationship between
 "destruction" and "construction" does provide an important

 clue for understanding the tumultuous course of the
 Cultural Revolution over the past three years.   It helps
 to explain, for example, the pattern of periods of dis-
 order ("destruction") followed by periods of relative order
 ("construction").   It helps to explain, in the priority
 accorded "destruction," why the "constructive" phases have
 been short-lived, as Mao and his more radical advisers
 have discovered new opponents (or at least less than
 enthusiastic supporters) occupying positions of authority
 in the  new revolutionary structure of power.
 Finally, it helps to explain two paradoxical and
 puzzling features of Lin Piao's political report to the
 Ninth Party Congress.  First, Lin appears to be saying
 at one and the same time that the Cultural Revolution is
 over ("a great victory" has been won in exposing and
 destroying "the bourgeois headquarters headed by the
 renegade, hidden traitor and scab Liu Shao-ch'i"), and
 is not over ("the revolution is not yet over .  . . in
 the realm of the superstructure").  The second puzzling
 feature was Lin's meandering discussion of Party building
 which, together with surrounding commentary and post-
 Congress developments, strongly suggested that the task
 of reconstructing the Chinese Communist Party as the "core
 of political power" at intermediate and basic levels of
 society was just getting under way.
 The strange fact that after three years of turmoil
 and violence in the Cultural Revolution the Chinese
 Communist Party is still largely inoperative outside of
 Peking can be explained in various ways.  One explanation
 is that Mao, at least in the early period of the "January
 Revolution" and the short-lived experiment with the Paris
 Commune and its replacement by the Revolutionary Committee,
 did not intend to reconstruct the Party, or at least
 restore it to its former position of centrality in the
 political structure.  Another is that Mao has been thwarted
 in his plan to rebuild the Party by opposition within the
 military and the old Party and government apparatus.

 A third, related explanation is that the primary
 cause for this protracted delay in Party building is a
 continuing fear by the Maoist leadership in Peking of a
 "restoration of the old" (i.e., restoring power to the
 same old "bureaucrats" who had dominated the Party before
 the Cultural Revolution).   On each occasion when tentative
 steps have been taken to re:3tore the authority of the
 Party, Mao has drawn back because of this fear.   It is
 Mao Tse-tung's long drawn-out and still largely unsuccessful
 effort to construct a new Party composed of loyal and
 enthusiastic "revolutionary successors" which provides
 the central theme of this paper.
 Construction:  The First Attempt (January-August 1967)
 "With the Commune inaugurated, do we still need
 the Party?  I think we need it because we must have a
 hard core, whether it is called the Communist Party or
 a social democratic party .  . . In short, we still need
 a party." -- Mao Tse-tung, Quoted in a Speech by Chang
 Chun-ch'iao, 24 February 1967.
 In January 1967, the Cultural Revolution was suddenly
 transformed from an effort to reform the existing structure
 of power into an all-out assault against the power structure
 itself.  Whereas Ma,% earlier (at an October 1966 Central
 Committee work confererce) had expressed confidence that
 "the majority" off' "Party cadres" would "understand" (and
 only "a few oppose") the Cultural Revolution, he was forced
 to concede in late January that "most old cadres still do
 not understand the Cultural Revolution" and to call for
 the overthrow of the Party and government apparatus which
 they controlled.  Understandably alarmed by this display
 of resistance, Mao reacted by inciting the "revolutionary
 masses" to "seize power from below" and by authorizing
 the creation on an experimental basis of a new revolutionary
 organ of power modeled after the Paris Commune.

 It appears in retrospect that one of the motives
 prompting this experiment was to provide a Marxist-Leninist
 rationale for the "January Revolution," portrayed by Mao
 as "the seizure of power by one class from another."  Also,
 as Ch'en Po-ta pointed out in a 24 January 1967 speech,
 the Paris Commune provided an organizational form through
 which "the workers, soldiers, peasants, students and
 traders" could unite and coordinate their efforts in
 "seizing power."  At the same time, the Paris Commune
 symbolized an important objective of Mao Tse-tung in
 launching the Cultural Revolution--that of involving the
 masses more directly and actively in the political process
 as expressed in the concept of "developing extensive
 democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat."  As
 expounded by Lin Piao in a major speech of 3 November 1966,
 this new revolutionary practice "provided the people with
 full democratic rights along the principles of the Paris
 Commune," including the right "to criticize and supervise
 the Party and government leading institutions and leaders
 at all levels."
 Although the experiment with the Paris Commune was
 short-lived and confined largely to the stage of "seizure
 of power," it symbolized Mao's deep suspicion and distrust
 of the "old" Party and government, and as such would have
 a lasting and disturbing effect upon the undertaking to
 '_aild a new political structure.  As a new expression of
 his "mass-line" approach to politics, Mao's flirtation
 with the Paris Commune concept revealed an intent to look
 outside the existing "bureaucratic" structure for a new
 source of power and support in the ongoing political
 process, an intent to use the "revolutionary masses" and
 their representatives as a check and balance on the
 representatives of the "old" establishment in whatever
 might materialize as the new revolutionary organ of
 power of the Cultural Revolution.
 It is important to note, however, as the quotation
 cited above makes clear, that Mao did not intend that
 the "revolutionary rebels" who had risen at his command
 to "seize power" should actually exercise the power they

 had seized.  As indicated earlier, "extensive democracy"
 in the new revolutionary order was to be carried on
 under "the dictatorship of the proletariat" and even in
 the Commune it was necessary, as Mao emphasized, to have
 a "hard core" of leadership represented by "a party."
 Of additional interest in this quotation is Mao's almost
 contemptuous reference to "the Communist Party" as only
 one among a number of different possible "parties."
 This curious statement reflects both Mao's bitter experi-
 ence with the old "Communist Party" which had turned
 against him and a determination to reorganize this Party
 drastically before restoring it to a position of dominance
 in the new revolutionary order.
 It was also envisaged from the outset that a
 reformed Party would lead the Revolutionary Committee,
 the new "provisional" organ of revolutionary power
 established in early 1967 to replace the abortive Commune.
 As is now well known, the Revolutionary Committee consists
 of a"three-way alliance" of representatives of the
 "revolutionary masses" (the Red Guards and "revolutionary
 rebels"), representatives of the People's Liueration Army
 (ordered in late January to intervene in the Cultural
 Revolution in support of the "revolutionary Left"), and
 "revolutionary Party cadres" (defined as "those leading
 cadres who follow the proletarian revolutionary line
 represented by Chairman Mao.")  As depicted in an authori-
 tative Red Fla" editorial at this time, these "revolutionary
 cadres" were to serve as "the nucleus or backbone" of the
 Revolutionary Committee.   It wasin keeping with this con-
 cept that the leadership of one of the earliest provincial
 Revolutionary Committees (that of Shansi) was vested in
 a "Party Nucleus Group," a practice described in the
 organizational regulations of this committee as "accepting
 the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party provincial
 level organization in Shansi."
 The role of the representatives of "revolutionary
 mass organizations" was undoubtedly an important one in
 the eyes of Mao Tse-tung, providing the "revolutionary"
 and "representative" characteristics which he demanded

 of these new governing bodies.  That this role was not
 one of leadership, however, was emphasized by Mao in an
 instruction at this time that the youthful rebels and
 Red Guards were "not to take over at once the duties of
 the secretaries of the provincial Party committee or
 municipal Party committee."  Rather, the "three-way
 combination" was a mechanism which would provide "very
 good training," so that after "7, 8 o  10 years" of
 learning from "the old revolutionary cadres" they could
 then qualify as "secretaries of the provincial Party
 committee . .    ."
 As experience would soon demonstrate, Mao's original
 conception of the Revolutionary Committee was filled with
 contradictions and pitfalls.   The first of these was that,
 in the absence of clear-cut guidance, PLA units would
 somehow be able to identify "revolutionary Leftists" whom
 they were to "support" in the formation of the new Revolu-
 tionary Committees.   The second was the provision that
 the "leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations" must
 be "truly representative of the great revolutionary masses,"
 thus placing a premium on factional struggle between these
 organizations to determine which should have dominant
 representation in the Revolutionary Committee.  The last,
 described in early February as "the biggest problem now,"
 was finding "revolutionary leading cadres" who could
 persuade both the Maoist leadership at the Center and
 the "revolutionary rebels" in the provinces of their
 loyalty, and thus provide the expertise and experience
 necessary to make the new revolutionary organ of power work.
 It was unfortunate for the future development and
 viability of the Revolutionary Committee that at just
 this point in time there occurred what has come to be
 known as "the adverse February current."  The alleged
 ringleader of this "counterrevolutionary current" in
 Peking was Vice-Premier and Politburo Member T'an Chen-lin
 who, it was later charged, stood up in a Central Committee
 work conference in mid-February to direct such provocative
 questions to the Cultural Revolution Group as: "Do you
 still want Party leadership .  . . old cadres . .  . the
 People's Liberation Army . .  . and production?" More

 concretely, T'an, together with a number of other Party
 and government leaders, was charged with engaging in the
 practice of "false power seizure," whereby senior Party
 cadres or revived Party committees had reinstated all or-
 most of the old systems of control, at the same time
 ignoring or suppressing the opinions of the "revolutionary
 Left."  The fact that this phenomenon of "false power
 seizure" or "restoration of the old" had also occurred in
 the great majority of China's provinces persuaded Mao that
 the great revolutionary enterprise of "seizing power" ini-
 tiated during the January Revolution had largely failed
 and to look for reasons for this failure.
 Each of the components of the "three-way alliance"
 was held responsible.  The PLA was indicted not only for
 failure to "support the Left" but in certain provinces for
 colluding with old Party cadres to suppress the "revolu-
 tionary Left" and, as a result, was stripped of all real
 authority (in a 6 April Military Affairs Committee direc-
 tive) in dealing with "revolutionary mass organizations."
 Somewhat paradoxically,  it was at just about this time
 (in March) that the Army was ordered to establish military
 control committees and thereby assume responsibility for
 exercising "the provincial leadership power" until such
 time as new Revolutionary Committees approved by the
 Center (i.e., genuine "power seizures") could be created.
 To a lesser extent, the ranks of the "revolutionary
 Left" were also held responsible, for instead of forming
 a "great alliance" as instructed in the early stages of
 the "seize power" movement in January, they had split
 into rival factions and, motivated largely by self-interest,
 had engaged in a violent struggle for power.  The remedy
 for this was to launch in early April a new political
 and ideological campaign against Liu Shao-chi and his
 supporters in "each area, department and unit" throughout
 the country, with this struggle against a common target
 serving, it was thought, to unify and strengthen the
 ranks of Mao's "proletarian revolutionaries."
 By far the greatest culprit held responsible for
 derailing the January Revolution, however, was the third
 component of the "three-way alliance"--that of the

 "revolutionary leading cadre" symbolized by T'an
 Ch'en-lin.  The realization that his new revolutionary
 organs of power had been taken over by the same old type
 of Party cadre who had opposed him in the past must have
 provided a profound shock to Mao.   Instead of a "core of
 leadership" infinitely loyal and filled with revolutionary
 zeal, Mao was confronted with the prospect of a "restoration
 of the old " a specter which would haunt him and his
 Cultural Revolution Group advisers in the months to come.
 Indeed, it appears in retrospect that the shock Mao experi-
 enced at this time led him to extend considerably the
 original timetable he had set for the Cultural Revolution,
 and to postpone indefinitely his plan to revive the Party
 as the nucleus of leadership in the new revolutionary
 structure of power.
 Mao's new attitude toward the Party came through
 clearly in a speech made to a Central work conference in
 late April.  Whereas in earlier pronouncements (e.g.,
 the 8 August 1966 Central Committee decision on the
 Cultural Revolution) the "main target" of the revolution
 had been defined as a "handful of . . . counterrevolutionary
 revisionists," Mao in this speech seemed to expand the
 target to encompass the Party as a whole.   Stating that
 "since 1952 we L.e., the Party7  have become divorced
 from the masses" because of the adoption of such revisionist
 practices as "rank differentiation in the army . .  . and
 the wage payment system," Mao asserted that "the masses
 do not want a too hasty recovery of the Party" and that
 therefore "we might wait half a year or even a year
 before restoring this organization."  What is more, this
 period of six months to a year would be used to "test" not
 only Party leaders but also large numbers of ordinary
 members of the Party who had succumbed to the bad influ-
 ence of Liu Shao-ch'i.  Because of the poor performance
 of so many elder Party cadres and members in the Cultural
 Revolution, Mao also stressed in this speech the necessity
 of bringing more young people into the new revolutionary
 organs, calling for a new three-way alliance of "old-
 middle-aged-and young."

 The first attempt to construct a new revolutionary
 organ of power had failed because those who had stepped
 forward to lead these organs turned out to be, in Mao's
 eyes, the same old unredeemed and unrepentant cadres who
 had controlled the Party before the Cultural Revolution.
 It was necessary to initiate a new destructive phase of
 the revolution, to unleash the "revolutionary masses" to
 engage in struggle and criticism in order to dig out Mao's
 opponents still concealed in "each area, department and
 unit" throughout the country.  But whereas the injunction
 "trust the masses" and "don't be afraid of disorder" in
 the 8 August 1966 decision inaugurating the Cultural
 Revolution had been directed at the civilian authorities,
 it was now directed at the People's Liberation Army which
 in 1 t  M

 defunct Party and government apparatus.  As noted above

 forbade the use of force in dealing with "mass organiza-
 tions."  At the same time, the Army was held responsible
 for the creation of "true proletarian revolutionary great
 alliances" and of revolutionary "three-way alliances" at
 the provincial and local levels, a task for which (despite
 its high degree of politicization) it was ill-prepared.
 There was  in these ill-conceived instructions an
 invitation to increased antagonism and conflict between
 the Army and the "revolutionary Left" in the months that
 followed.  The events of this new "destructive" phase
 extending through the summer of 1967 are well known and
 will not be discussed here.  It is sufficient to point
 out that the Wuhan Incident in mid-July (viewed in Peking
 as an act of insubordination by leaders of the Wuhan
 Military Region Command) and the, ensuing decision to
 arm selected Red Guard and "revolutionary rebel" units
 as a counterforce brought China by the end of August to
 the brink of anarchy.  There was no choice for Mao but
 to heed the counsel of his more moderate advisers, apply
 the brakes, assess the damage and initiate a new "con-
 structive" phase in the Cultural Revolution.

 Construction:  The Second Attempt (September 1967-July 1968)
 "We must guard against both the 'Left' and the Right.
 To guard against the 'Left' means to prevent interference
 with .  .  . Chairman Mao's latest directives.  To guard
 against the Right means to prevent conservative groups
 from reversing previous verdicts on them." -- Lin Piao,
 Instruction to Party Committee of the Air Force, Winter
 1968.
 Confronted with a damaged economy, a disturbed
 Army, a breakdown of Party and government machinery and
 the consequent threat of anarchy, Mao Tse-tung was forced
 in September 1967 to call a halt to the destructive, mass
 phase of his Cultural Revolution and press ahead with the
 construction of a new government and Party apparatus.
 Reacting to the threat of anarchy posed by the "Left"
 (i.e., the "ultra-Leftist" Red Guards), Mao issued a
 "great strategic plan" in September consisting of a series
 of "supreme instructions" designed to restore order from
 below by disciplining and reorganizing the "revolutionary
 ranks" and to restore order from above by speeding up the
 establishment of a new governmental structure.  But,as
 Mao and his more radical ad*isers probably feared from
 the outset, this plan and the means employed to implement
 it, soon produced a situation in which an equal if not
 graver threat was perceived from the Right--a situation
 in which "conservative groups" or individuals would
 attempt to "reverse previous verdicts" and attempt once
 more to subvert the goals of the Cultural Revolution by
 threatening a "restoration of the old."
 The immediate and inescapable problem in September
 was to deal with the phenomenon of "ultra-Leftism" in
 which militant Red  uards, incited by official propaganda
 and high-ranking officials, had launched a wide-ranging
 assault against the People's Liberation Army.  This, as
 Madame Mao explained, had of course been a "mistake,"
 but a mistake attributable primarily to "bad elements"

 who had sneaked into the leadership of these "revolutionary
 mass organizations."
 Another manifestation of this phenomenon was
 "factionalism," a problem which had bedeviled the Cultural
 Revolution from the outset and to which Mao now turned his
 attention.  Assigned major responsibility for this, radical
 Red Guard organizations in Peking were charged by top
 leaders with spreading "factionalism" into the ranks of
 the workers, and, significantly, the "working class" for
 the first time was assigned "the leading position" in the
 new constructive phase of the revolution because of its
 higher sense of organization and discipline.  What is
 more, another instruction by Chairman Mao given wide
 publicity in mid-October seemed to call for the dissolution
 of the mass "proletarian revolutionary organizations" by
 calling for the formation of "revolutionary great alliances
 on the basis of trade, profession, department or class in
 school."  As pointed out in a 19 October People's Daily
 editorial explaining this insturction, revolutionary mass
 organizations were no longer needed because a "decisive
 victory" had been won in the "struggle against the handful
 of Party persons in authority taking the capitalist road,"
 the purpose for which these mass organizations had been
 originally established.
 The force of this instruction, however, was largely
 vitiated by another which Mao apparently issued soon
 thereafter.                                                an
 important proviso in the program to set up "revolutionary
 great alliances" was that the "revolutionaried'be dominant.
 As a precautionary measure, local authorities were now
 instructed to "avoid dissolving  ntas> organizations as
 a means of bringing about revolutionary great alliances"
 in order to "guard against conservative forces devouring
 the revolutionaries."
 It soon became apparent, moreover, that Mao had
 changed his mind and was now intent upon retaining the
 Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" as a force in being
 to resist and offset an anticipated threat from the Right
 ("conservative forces") in the winter of 1967.  For al-
 though the Red Guards were to undergo a course of

 "rectification" and "ideological education" featuring
 "self-criticism" for past mistakes, the Army was specifi-
 cally enjoined, in conducting this course, from using force
 or suppressing "revolutionary mass organizations," and
 instead, directed "to rely on the revolutionary masses"
 in these organizations to expose and deal with "the handful
 of bad persons" held responsible for "factionalism" in the
 ranks of the "revolutionary Left."
 Apparently determined to give the Red Guards a
 second chance to qualify as "revolutionary successors,"
 Mao issued still another directive in early December
 which called for "correct treatment of veteran rebels"
 who had made mistakes in accordance with the principle
 of "help, criticism and alliance," warning the PLA to
 "never put pressure on them" and demanding that seats be
 reserved for some of them in the new Revolutionary Com-
 mittee structure.   It remained for the Chairman of the
 Kweichow Revolutionary Committee Li Tsai-han to spell out
 the implications of these directives--that the "merits"
 of these "veteran rebels" were considered greater than
 their "mistakes" and that the Red Guard "little generals"
 were still regarded as "a revolutionary force protecting
 Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."
 It is likely, moreover, that Mao was more concerned
 in the fall of 1967 about the "mistakes" committed by the
 other main protagonist in the violent upheaval of the
 preceding summer--the leaders of the PLA at the military
 region and military district levels of command.   In his
 published statements, Mao asserted that most of these
 "mistakes" had been unintentional, caused by lack of
 "education" and "experience," and to help correct this
 deficiency, "training classes" for senior military cadres
 from the provinces were held in Peking throughout the
 remainder of the year.  At the same time, the fact that
 Mao and Lin felt impelled in 1967 to purge and reorganize
 nearly half of these regional and district military
 commands was convincing proof of dissatisfaction with
 the performance of the PLA since it was ordered in late
 March to take over the functions of government at

 provincial and local levels.*
 Reflecting this dissatisfaction with the performance
 of the military, the final and perhaps most important
 "instruction" conveyed by Chairman Mao in September was
 that the process of setting up Revolutionary Committees
 in all the 29 provinces and major cities of China be speeded
 up and completed by the end of January 1968.  To meet this
 deadline, it was no longer possible to rely on the long
 drawn-out and generally unsuccessful method of "seizure
 of power" from below.  Instead, it was necessary to impose
 solutions from above, hammering out agreements between
 representatives of the Army, revolutionary leaning cadres
 and revolutionary mass organizations assembled in Peking
 in accordance with Mao's directive "to solve the problems
 of various provinces one by one."
 Despite this reassertion of centralized control,
 it is important to note that the composition and membership
 of these new Revolutionary Committees could not be arbi-
 trarily decreed from above but had to be approved by
 all three components comprising these committees, including
 the representatives of the two "factions" in each province
 who continued to wrangle over the share of power to be
 allotted each.  A major obstacle was the requirement that
 both factions approve the senior Party cadres whom Mao,
 in still another of his instructions, had ordered "libera-
 ted."  There was an urgent need, as explained in an
 authoritative 21 October People's Daily editorial, for
 more "revolutionary cadres" who, because of their "richer
 experience .  .  . better organizing and working ability
 and higher understanding of policy," could "serve as the

 The more important of these changes occurred after the
 Wuhan Incident.

 core and backbone in the revolutionary provisional organs
 of power"--the Revolutionary Committees.  As a result of
 the delay imposed by this time-consuming process, however,
 only seven additional provinces and major cities had
 succeeded in establishing these committees by or near the
 time of the Spring Festival.
 Mao's decision in September 1967 to resurrect the
 Party was directly related, it is believed, to this felt
 need to recruit experienced civilian cadres to "serve as
 the core and backbone" of the new Revolutionary Committees,
 and thus bring to an end the situation of the preceding
 eight months in which, as Chou En-lai put it in a speech
 at this time, the PLA had been "charged with the monistic
 leadership of the Party, the government and the Army."
 Although this initial effort to rectify and rebuild the
 Party was largely unsuccessful, the policy directives and
 editorial discussion at this time provide important clues
 for understanding major issues concerning the Party which
 remain unresolved today.  For example, concerning the
 knotty proulem of the relationship between the rebuilt
 Party and the Revolutionary Committee, Yao Wen-yuan-stated
 unequivocally at this time (in a 11 October report to Mao)
 that a "Party leadership nucleus" or "core group" was to
 be created within each Revolutionary Committee to provide
 Party leadership over the new revolutionary organ of power.
 At the same time, it was made quite clear that this
 concept of a "Party core group" was not to be implemented
 immediately, but rather pursued as a long-range goal.  An
 important prerequisite stipulated by Mao at this time was
 that "this core should not be set up subjectively or be
 self-appointed, but should be formed naturally in struggle
 and developed in struggle"--that is, that the Party cadres
 comprising these core groups continue to be tested by their
 performance in the Cultural Revolution to ensure their
 loyalty before being entrusted with real power.  Until
 such time as Mao and his principal advisers could feel
 reasonably confident that these new Party organs were
 controlled by loyal Maoists, it was emphasized (for
 example, in an important Hsieh Fu-chih speech of
 26 October on Party rectification) that the newly revived

 SECRET
 Party organs would "not play a leading role in the Revolu-
 tionary Committee" and that "the time of establishing the
 relations of leadership" would "be mentioned later."
 Hsieh's speech also revealed an intent to organize
 the forthcoming :;inth Party Congress "from the top
 downward," to have the Party  Center select those who      25X1
 would attend in order "to ensure that the rebels among
 Party members /i.e., Mao's supporters will be in a
 maj orit :."
 The
 further requirement that members of the "core group" must
 also be members of the Revolutionary Committee (presumably
 leading members) underlined the intimate, symbiotic rela-
 tionship between these new Party and government organs,
 and was justified on the grounds that "the better Party
 members were already chosen to serve on the Revolutionary
 Committees."
 Most of the contradictory elements in the relation-
 ship between the "Party core group" and the Revolutionary
 Committee seen today originated in this early formative
 period of Party construction.  First,  although it was
 clear that the Party was to assume the dominant position
 of leadership at some future date, actual leadership in
 the interim was to be exercised by the Revolutionary Com-
 mittee.  As suggested in a Shanghai Liberation Daily
 editorial at this time, one reason Mao continued to show
 preference for the Revolutionary Committee was that it
 afforded "advanced elements of the proletariat" who had
 emerged in the Cultural Revolution an opportunity to
 occupy "positions of leadership," individuals who "though
 not Party members . . . in essence play the role of Party
 members .  .  ."  As this same editorial revealed, moreover,
 the initial experiments in Shanghai in recruiting new
 party members had not gone according to plan.   Instead
 of applying Mao's revolutionary line in party building
 to recruit members imbued with "revolutionary combat

 spirit," some Party organs had rejected these candidates
 as "trouble makers" and admitted instead those who were
 "good in production." And with the disclosure in early
 1968 by a Shanghai official that, because of the activity
 of "class enemies" ("Some bad men want to seize our Party
 power"), "no new Party members may be recruited" without
 specific authority from the Central Committee, the first
 attempt to revive and reconstruct the Party apparatus
 initiated in the fall of 1967 in effect came to a halt.
 The return of the "class enemy" to center stage in
 March of 1968 marked the beginning of the third destructive
 phase of Mao's Cultural Revolution which would last until
 mid-year.  Whereas the threat from the "Left" (the refusal
 of mass organizations to obey "Chairman Mao's latest
 directives" as manifested in continuing "factionalism"
 and "anarchism") had been depicted as the most serious
 problem in regime propaganda throughout the fall and
 winter, suddenly the Rightist threat of "conservative
 groups" seeking to "reverse previous verdicts" became
 the  ain danger.  According to the logic of the Cultural
 Revolution, as earlier pointed out in a 7 January Wen
 Hui Pao editorial, "revolutionary and conservative-7-actions"
 could only exist among the masses when "class enemies"
 still occupied positions of authority where they could
 "stir up trouble and discord .  .  ."  In order to identify
 these "black backers," it would be necessary once again
 to test the performance of the new leadership at the
 Center and especially in the provinces by fomenting a
 new wave of revolutionary disorder.
 The ringleaders of this new Rightist threat "to
 reverse correct verdicts" in Peking were identified, in
 a virulent attack led by Madame Mao, as Acting Chief of
 Staff Yang Ch'eng-wu, Peking Garrison Commander Fu Ch'ung-
 pi, and Air Force Political Commisar Yu Li-chin.  The
 central role of the emotional and somewhat neurotic
 Madame Mao, credited as the first to sense and warn of
 the new Rightist danger, in the Yang-Yu-Fu affair is
 significant.  For it appears in retrospect that a number
 of the charges leveled against Yang Ch'eng-wu were
 either fabricated or grossly exaggerated.  One charge

 that does ring true is that Yang and his military col-
 leagues in Peking had not shown dufficient deference to
 the Madame and instead had "attempted to negate the
 influence of the Cultural Revolution Group."  A similar
 complaint uttered by the Madame meeting with a series
 of delegation leaders from the provinces not long thereafter
 was that they too had been guilty of "not paying much
 attention to the Cultural Revolution Group."
 Whatever the merit of specific charges, it was clear
 in the barrage of propaganda attacking Rightist reversal
 of verdicts, Right splittism, Rightist conservatism, Right
 capitulationism and Rightist restoration in the months that
 followed that Mao and his radical advisers were dissatisfied
 with the character and composition of at least some of the
 provincial Revolutionary Committees which had been so slowly
 and laboriously constructed in the preceding year.  As
 perceived by the Maoists, they were faced with a revival of
 the "adverse February current" of a year earlier (depicted
 in the convoluted phraseology of the Cultural Revolution
 as an attempt "to reverse the correct verdict on the
 'adverse February current"') in which senior Party cadres
 supported by military commmanders had subverted the first
 great effort to establish new revolutionary organs of
 power by staging "false power seizures" and threatening
 to "restore the old."  As had been true a year earlier,
 it was considered necessary to strengthen the position
 of the representatives of "revolutionary mass organizations"
 (viewed a.3 the "revolutionary Left") in relation to the
 military and Party cadre representatives (viewed as prone
 to Rightist error) in the new threw-way alliance.
 One way to do this was to subject "revolutionary
 cadres" to another round of denunciation, charged with
 having engaged previously in "sham self-criticism" in
 order to regain their former positions of authority.  As
 revealed in a speech by Chou En-lai at this time, a new
 tough policy was to be instituted whereby Party cadres
 would once again have to appear before the masses, admit
 error, and accept the criticism of the revolutionary
 masses.  Military leaders in the Revolutionary Committee

 system were also directed to engage ii "self-criticism,"
 both for permitting unrepentant Party cadres to return
 to positions of power in the new revolutionary organs
 and for allowing "conservative" mass organizations to
 make a comeback.  Another way to rectify the imbalance
 in the three-way alliance structure was to order that
 more representatives of the mass organizations be appointed
 to the "leading groups" or "standing committees" of the
 new revolutionary organs of power.
 The most important method of coping with the
 Rightist threat to the newly emerging structure of power,
 however, was once again to revive the "revolutionary mass
 movement" as an instrument for use in a large-scale purge
 or "purification of class ranks" initiated at this time.
 Incited by new Maoist instructions approving "proletarian
 revolutionary factionalism," Red Guards and "revolutionary
 rebels" erupted in an explosion of violence and disorder
 which would soon bring China once again to the brink of
 chaos.
 Although the hope was expressed (in a 6 May Wen Hui
 Pao editorial) that this new revolutionary upsurge !W-5517
 serve to "consolidate" the new revolutionary organs of
 power,   it soon became apparent  that the practical appli-
 cation of the new slogan "give full play to the role of
 revolutionary mass organizations" was threatening the
 very existence of the Revolutionary Committee system.
 As more and more provinces began to report in May and
 June, "class enemies" from the "ultra-Left" were exploiting
 this slogan to revive "bourgeois factionalism," resume
 armed struggle and split the entire revolutionary structure
 of power from top to bottom.  Reports from Shansi, for
 example, showed that the renewed outbreak of factional
 fighting there had created (in the words of Lin Piao) a
 "double-layer political regime," a situation characterized
 by a fundamental split between the Army and the Revolu-
 tionary Committee with each supporting a faction and in
 which (in the words of Chou En-lai) the Revolutionary
 Committee "existed in name only."  More alarming were
 reports from Kwangsi, Hupeh and Yunnan at this time which
 revealed that factionalism had once again broken out
 within the military command structure.

 Responding to this rising crescendo of violence,
 a Central Committee meeting on 13 June (at which Mao and
 Lin were reported as "highly concerned about the sta-
 bility of the Army and the Revolutionary Committee" in
 Hupeh) issued the first of a series of directives ordering
 mass organizations in Kwangsi and other provinces to
 cease armed struggle, return all weapons stolen from the
 PLA and once again form "revolutionary great alliances."
 Confronted with the continuing refusal of these mass
 organizations to obey and with an ever  expanding area of
 conflict and scale of destruction, Mao in late July (at a
 meeting attended symbolically by the leaders of the five
 most important revolutionary mass organizations) issued
 a nation-wide order authorizing the Army to put an end to
 armed struggle, dissolve the rebellious factions and in
 effect bring the era of the "revolutionary mass movement"
 in the Cultural Revolution to a close.

 Construction:  The Third Attempt (August 1968-March 1969)
 "We should .  .  . unify our thinking, coordinate
 our steps, and act in concert under the unified leadership
 of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao .  .  ."
 --Chou En-lai, Speech at 100,000 Strong Rally, September
 7, 1968.
 Initiated in August 1968, the third and presumably
 last attempt of Mao Tse-tung to construct a new revolutionary
 order is in many ways the most difficult phase of the
 Cultural Revolution to understand.  Although generally
 constructive in character, it has been characterized by
 the introduction of a number of radical, inherently dis-
 ruptive social and economic programs.  Although highlighted
 by a thorough overhaul of the central Party leadership and
 organization, it has not provided the Party with a meaning-
 ful role at provincial and lower levels of government.
 Although devoted in large part to construction of a new
 civilian Party and government structure, it has recognized
 the dominant role of the military within this structure at
 the provincial level and thus posed a continuing threat to
 Mao Tse-tung's long-held principle that "the Party must
 control the gun."  Finally, it has raised the difficult
 interpretive problem of deciding whether, in light of the
 developments during the period, Mao's Cultural Revolution
 should be considered at an end.
 The decision in late July to dissolve the mass
 organizations of Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" did
 bring to an end one of the most dramatic and prominent
 features of the Cultural Revolution--that of periodic out-
 breaks of revolutionary violence and chaos deemed necessary
 to ferret out "class enemies" hidden deeply in the bureau-
 cratic structure.  This decision, together with the speedy
 formation of the last five provincial Revolutionary Com-
 mittees in August and early September, implied a willing-
 ness to settle for the existing power structure in the
 provinces.   As Lin Piao would point out in his political
 report to the Ninth Party Congress, the establishment of

 these Revolutionary Committees marked a "great decisive
 victory" with respect to "the fundamental question in the
 current great revolution... the question of political power
 ...of which class holds leadership."
 In a series of important articles and editorials
 thoughout August, Mao's somewhat belated discovery that
 "the working class" should play "the leading role" in
 the Cultural Revolution vies explained in labored and un-
 convincing terms.  That the Maoist leadership had become
 disenchanted with the Red Guards was clear, as evidenced by
 their indictment as "swell-headed" advocates of the theory
 of "many centers" (i.e., refusal to obey Mao's directives)
 and as "intellectuals" given to'bndless quarreling" and
 "civil war," to "empty talk" and "the style of double deal-
 ing."                 As untrustworthy and unreliable "intellectuals,"
 they would now have to undergo a process of "re-education"
 described (in the important Chou En-lai speech of 7 Septem-
 ber cited above) as one of "responding to the call of our
 great leader Chairman Mao...settling in the mountainous
 areas and the countryside and taking part in physical work
 in factories, mines and villages."  Intent upon reforming
 China's educational system by combining intellectual and
 physical labor (a long-held goal), Mao and his advisers
 had decided that the Red Guards had outlived their useful-
 ness and that the time had come to send them by the millions
 to settle down permanently in the countryside.
 By contras., "the working class" was "most ready to
 accept Marxism-Leninism, Mao Tse-tung's thought" and had
 "the best understanding of the great significance of con-
 solidating the dictatorship of the proletariat."  At a
 time when the dominant propaganda theme was the need to
 "unify our thinking, coordinate our steps and act in con-
 cert," it was the working class through the instrumentality
 of the "worker-peasant Mao Tse-tung's thought propaganda
 team" (the recipient of the much publicized "precious gift"
 of mangoes from Chairman Mao on 5 August) which in theory
 was to provide the leadership necessary to effect this unity
 of thought and action by the Chinese people.   In fact, the
 composition of these propaganda teams (consisting not only
 of workers and peasants but, more importantly, of "PLA
 Commanders and fighters") and their subordination "under the

 leadership of the Revolutionary Committees" (where again
 the military frequently dominated) meant that the new stage
 of "working class leadership" initiated in August 1968 was
 to a large extent leadership enforced by military control.
 Following the establishment of Revolutionary Commit-
 tees in all the provinces of China, the Cultural Revolution
 (as pointed out in the joint editorial honoring National
 Day) "entered a new period...that of carrying out the tasks
 of struggle-criticism-transformation conscientiously."
 Although most observers have tended to view this as a con-
 structive phase of "transforming" Chinese society in accord-
 ance with Maoist ideals, it is important to note that its
 call for "struggle and criticism" in every factory, commune,
 school and government department would trigger one last
 convulsive spasm of violence in a nationwide purge of
 basic levels of society.   In a very real sense, the new
 stage of "struggle-criticism-transformation" initiated in
 September 1968 was no more than a re-direction of the
 Cultural Revolution to focus on basic-level units of
 Chinese society.
 In contrast with the preceding period, however, this
 phase of the Cultural Revolution was to be both controlled
 (by worker propaganda teams directed by Revolutionary Com-
 mittees) and expedited (carried out "conscientiously").
 Although a violent wave of purging of "bad elements" in
 basic-level administrative units swept China in the fall
 of 1968, this essential first stage was soon brought to a
 halt and attention focused on the task of "transformation"
 defined (in the 8 August 1966 Central Committee decision
 on the Cultural Revolution) as "transforming education,
 literature and art and all parts of the superstructure
 that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, so
 as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the
 socialist system".
 It was with a sense of urgency that the Maoist
 leadership in the fall of 1968 embarked upon this final
 stage of the Cultural Revolution in which China's institu-
 tional framework was to be radically reorganized ("trans-
 formed") in accordance with Mao Tee-tung's revolutionary

 vision of the good society.  As already noted, one of Mao's
 important objectives in the revolution has been to effect
 a radical reform of the educational system, both to cleanse
 it of the corrupting influence of "bourgeois intellectuals
 and experts" and to transform it into a system combining
 intellectual and physical labor.  The sending of teachers
 and students by the millions to labor in factories and
 communes in the fall of 1968 marked the first step in
 this educational revolution.
 Soon swelling the ranks of this mass migration to
 the countryside were large numbers of urban cadres sent
 down (in accordance with a Maoist instruction in early
 October) as part of a sizable reduction in force of the
 government bureaucracy.   This program, as an expression
 of Mao's well-known anti-bureaucratic bias (his preoc-
 cupation with preventing the growth of a privileged bureau-
 cratic ruling group) was soon combined with another, much
 more ambitious program expressing what might be called
 Mao's anti-urban bias--namely, an undertaking to disperse
 all unemployed or underemployed urban residents ("city
 people divorced from labor") to "the front line of agricul-
 tural production."  By means of these programs, it was
 planned to reduce the population of towns and cities (ac-
 cording to a number of reports by the end of the year) by
 as much as one third.
 In addition to these large-scale, centrally-directed
 programs, a number of radical social and economic experiments
 reminiscent of the Great Leap Forward and commune period
 were introduced at this time on a trial basis.   Reflecting
 the claim in the 1 October National Day editorial that this
 new stage of the Cultural Revolution would "consolidate and
 develop . .  . China's socialist economic base," an under-
 taking to establish higher levels of socialization in
 agriculture, both in production and distribution, was re-
 ported in a number of provinces shortly after the Twelfth
 Plenum of the Central Committee was held in October.
 Suggesting that these reforms had in fact been discussed at
 this Party conference was a Kiangsi editorial of early Decem-
 ber which asserted that the task of "expansion of communes
 and the merger of production brigades and teams" had been
 "successfully completed...in little more than a month...in

 order to consolidate and strengthen the socialist collective
 economy."  Another program initiated in various provinces
 at this time on an experimental basis was a campaign of
 learning from and emulating the model Ta-chai agricultural
 production brigade.
 At first it appeared that the main purpose of this
 campaign was to popularize the well-known Ta-chai workpoint
 system, a system whereby peasant income is based not only
 on work performed but also on political attitude.   It soon
 became apparent, however, that something more ambitious
 was involved in this campaign with the disclosure (in a
 24 November People's Dail  article) that Ta-chai in 1967
 had begun to distribute--food on the same basis used for
 awarding work points.  This innovation, together with the
 fact that the politically advanced peasants at Ta-chai ap-
 parently do not have private plots, helps explain reports
 of a radical reorganization of China's commune system under
 way in late 1968 and early 1969.
 The most striking of the new reforms reported at
 this time was the introduction of a "free supply" system
 under which farm families would receive a large portion of
 income in the form of "free" food, medical care and education
 and other basic services.   In some instances, communes
 inaugurating this new system required that peasants surrender
 their private plots, and in others, there were plans to
 re-establish public mess-halls.  The primary beneficiaries
 of this system would be poor peasant households, those with
 large numbers to feed but weak in labor power.
 This attempt to introduce a "supply system" (which
 Mao in 1967 had endorsed as preferable to a wage payment
 system) would prove to be relatively short lived.  The
 system by no stretch of the imagination could be called
 "free," since the value of food and other services sup-
 plied under it was then subtracted from the total wage
 bill (the amount distributed accc:?ding to work points).
 As the earlier merger of production tease had penalized the
 more productive teams, so the present reforms served to
 penalize the more productive peasant households by reducing
 their income.  Confronted with rising peasant discontent
 and with a threatened decrease in production, the Maoist

 leadership beat a hasty retreat in the spring of 1969,
 as disclosed in a key 22 March People's Dail  editorial
 and a follow-up Liaoning Dail  editorial   roadcast on
 20 April) devoted tspr 3nfarming."
 What had happened, according to the editorial. in
 People's Daily, was that the newly established Revolu-
 tionary Committees in various localities had misunderstood
 Mao's call to "learn from Ta-chai."  They had failed to
 realize that "the most important thing" was "to learn from
 Ta-chai's revolutionary spirit and integrate it with local
 conditions" (i.e., ensure that innovations were acceptable
 to the peasants before implementing them).  They had, in
 attempting to force these radical reforms on an unwilling
 peasantry, violated another Maoist principle revived to
 remedy the situation at this time--that of "taking account
 of the interests of the state, the collective and the
 individual" in rural work.   Specifically, as pointed out
 in the Liaoning editorial, they had not realized that
 "commune members' private plots    .  . are currently neces-
 sary for solving their problems of food and manure and at
 present still cannot be abolished."   And, in a formulation
 which appeared to suspend further experimentation with the
 "supply system," this editorial also specified that cal-
 culation of peasant household income should be based on
 "the principle of distribution according to work and not
 on the number of household members."
 If the radical reforms outlined above can be con-
 sidered primarily social in character, it seems clear that
 this process of "transforming" China's social institutions
 was expected in time (in the words of Yao Wen-yuan in his
 August 1968 Red Flag article) to "greatly stimulate the
 development Vthe social productive forces."  Although
 vague as to how and when this upsurge in production would
 materialize, Yao asserted that "many new things" were
 appearing on both the agricultural and industrial fronts
 and that a "vigorous technical revolution" was occurring
 in the midst of "an excellent and inspiring situation."
 Shortly thereafter, this situation was depicted (in the 1
 October joint editorial in honor of National Day) as a
 "new leap forward situation on the industrial, agricultural,
 scientific .and technological, and revolutionary art and
 literature fronts."

 It was not long before, in accordance with this
 injunction to discover "many new things" appearing on the
 economic front, both the central and provincial press
 began to report a series of developments reminiscent of
 the Great Leap Forward.   In the central press, the Peking
 General Knitwear Plant (selected as the model for imple-
 mentation of the "struggle-criticism-transformation"
 campaign in industry) was widely publicized for its
 achievements in "applying the revolutionary enthusiasm"
 aroused in this campaign to production, thereby fulfill-
 ing its 1968 production plan two-and-a-half months ahead
 of schedule.   In the provincial press, a whole series of
 editorials and articles revived the following prominent
 themes of the Great Leap Forward era:   (1) criticism of
 the leadership at provincial and local levels for "right  -
 conservative thinking" in failing to recognize the potential
 for "a new upsurge in production;'(2) claims of technical
 innovations all over the country in industry (e.g., low
 alloy steel) and agriculture (e.g., rice transplanting
 machines);  (3) provincial plans to achieve agricultural
 mechanization at a greatly accelerated pace (e.g., within
 three to five years in Honan); and (4) revival of large-
 scale water conservancy construction programs in a number
 of provinces as the means of securing large increases in
 agricultural production.
 Even more reminiscent of the Great Leap Forward
 period was the reappearance at this time of unrealistic
 production targets, inflated by a process of escalating
 original targets to demonstrate revolutionary zeal.  This
 occurred both in industry where "the workers" in individual
 plants began to insist that original production targets be
 increased by as much as 20 percent, and in agriculture where,
 for example, a 12 February 1969 Hunan broadcast revealed
 that 100 communes and brigades had raised earlier pro-
 duction goals to a proposed 15 to 20 percent increase in
 grain production and a 25 percent increase in total farm
 output.  The second major characteristic of the Great Leap
 Forward era--the resort to fraudulent statistics--also
 began to reappear at this time, as in the claim that in the
 three-year period from 1966-1968 Heilungkiang  Province
 had increased grain production 47 percent and industrial
 output 33 percent over the preceding 1963-1965 Period.

 Demonstrating that the Maoist leadership had learned
 something from its earlier Great Leap Forward experience,
 a 21 February People's Dail  editorial entitled "Grasp
 Revolution, Promote Production and Win New Victories n  the
 Industry Front" signaled a sharp turn to a more moderate
 and realistic economic policy.   In a sober discussion in
 which Leap Forward themes and terminology were conspicuously
 absent, the editorial reflected concern over lack of
 coordination in the national economy by calling for
 "planned and systematic" development "under a unified
 national plan."  More important was the editorial's stress
 on a new Mao instruction to "see to it that there is
 enough leeway .  .  . in drawing up plans," designed to put
 an end to unrealistic planning by substituting more reason-
 able production targets which "the masses .  .  . through
 active efforts" could "reach or surpass."  With the exten-
 sion of these guidelines to cover agriculture (as revealed
 in the 22 March editorial on spring farming noted above),
 the first venture in attempting a Great Leap Forward type
 upsurge in economic activity as An essential, concluding
 phase of the Cultural Revolution had come to an end.
 The last task in the "struggle-criticism-transforma-
 tion" phase of the Cultural Revolution was rebuilding the
 Communist Party,  a task taken up at an enlarged plenary
 session of the Central Committee (the 12th Plenum of the
 8th Central Committee) held in Peking from the 13th to the
 31st of October.   According to the somewhat meager public
 record of the proceedings, the delegates attending this
 plenum (1) listened to "a most important speech" by Mao
 Tse-tung which characterized (somewhat defensively) "the
 current great proletarian cultural revolution" as "absolutely
 necessary and most timely;" (2) expelled Liu Shao-ch'i
 from the Party as a "renegade, traitor and scab" and (with-
 out legal authority) dismissed him as well from all posts
 "outside the Party;" (3) discussed a new draft Party Con-
 stitution; and (4) decided to convene the long-awaited
 Ninth Congress of the Communist Party "at an appropriate
 time.''
 Supplementing the terse discussion in the communique,
 a Red Flag editorial (entitled "Absorb Fresh Blood from the
 Prlita    t--An Important Question in Party Consolidation")

 published while the plenum was in session provided impor-
 tant guidelines to govern a new stage of intensified Party
 building, one of "eliminating waste" (i.e., purging) and
 "absorbing fresh blood" (i.e., recruiting) in order to con-
 vert the Party, ns Mao had demanded, into "a vigorous van-
 guard organization...composed of the advanced elements of
 the proletariat..."  The first of "two interrelated tasks"
 in "absorbing fresh blood" was of course recruiting new
 members, identified as "outstanding rebels, primarily
 advanced elements from among the industrial workers" who
 had demonstrated in the course of the Cultural Revolution
 a "strong sense of class struggle" and "firmness in opposing
 revisionism."  The second part of this process--ensuring
 that admission of new members was controlled in each case
 by "a new leading body of a revolutionary three-in-one
 combination which resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's
 revolutionary line"--was of considerably greater interest.
 The suggestion in this editorial that the Maoists
 in Peking were dissatisfied with the character. of the
 new Party leadership organs which had begun to reappear
 at provincial and lower levels goes far to explain, it
 is believed, why the new phase of Party building initiated
 at this time would be so protracted and laborious.  As
 spelled out in this and subsequent editorials in the
 Shanghai press, what had happened in a number of instances
 was that there had been a "restoration of the old," a
 phenomenon which had occurred twice before in early 1967
 and in the winter of 1967-1968 when Mao had ordered the
 rehabilitation of Party cadres to provide needed adminis-
 trative expertise.   In this instance, it was charged that
 the new Party organs were "composed entirely of former
 personnel" who tended to apply Liu Shao-chi'o revisionist
 line in Party building (i.e., recruit those who "observed
 discipline" and were "good at production")  and find fault
 with and exclude "revolutionary rebels" who applied for
 Party membership.   If this were permitted to continue, Mao's
 undertaking to convert the Party into "a militant, vigorous
 and vital organization of vanguards" would, as pointed out
 in a 19 October Wen Hui Pao editorial, come to naught.

 The remedy, according to a 25 October Wen Hui Pao
 editorial, was to "renew" these "leading groups =n tTe
 Party both by purging some of the old cadres and by re-
 cruiting a number of "new cadres" who would "resolutely
 defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."  When it is
 remembered that these "leading &roups" in the Party were
 often synonymous with the "leading groups" (i.e.,'standing
 committees") of the Revolutionary Committees of which they
 were a part, it appears that another objective of this
 Party rectification campaign in the fall of 1968 was to
 expand the representation and enhance the role of "new
 cadres" (the representatives of the revolutionary masses)
 within the Revolutionary Committee system.  Whatever the
 intent, the provincial press by December was reporting
 that "ultra-Leftist" rebels were exploiting the revolution-
 ary slogan "oppose the restoration of the old" to once
 again attack worker propaganda teams, the PLA and the
 Revolutionary Committees.
 The radical and disruptive "struggle-criticism-
 transformation" movement inaugurated in September 1968 had
 by the end of the year produced confusion and disorder at
 all levels of Chinese society.  The dominant theme of the
 1969 New Year's Day editorial was, therefore, the need for
 greater unity ("unified thinking, policies, plans, command,
 actions") as a prerequisite for fulfilling the three
 "glorious and arduous tasks of 1969"--holding the Ninth
 Party Congress, celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the
 founding of the Chinese People's Republic,?and "achieving
 all-round victory" in the Cultural Revolution.  In terms
 of the elastic concept of "democratic centralism" (also
 featured in this New Year's Day editorial), the emphasis
 now was to be placed on "centralism" as expressed in a
 series of moderating policy directives issued by Chairman
 Mao.   In addition to the instructions in the editorial to
 damp down "class struggle," (e.g. "the target of attack
 must be narrowed and more people must be helped through
 education"), a new "proletarian policy on intellectuals"
 was introduced in February, one which held that "the
 majority" could be "re-educated" and redeemed.  The exten-
 sion of the new moderating trend to encompass the economy
 and society as a whole was then revealed in the key
 editorials in February and March dealing with industry and

 agriculture noted above, the shift toward more prudent
 policies in each justified by Chairman Mao
 The rationale for this general retreat, as set
 forth in these and an accompanying March Red Flag edi-
 torial(entitled "On Summing Up Experience"  was two-fold.
 The responsibility for failure could not, of course, be
 assigned to Mao's radical programs, but rather to "lead-
 ing comrades at all levels" who had failed to understand
 "Chairman Mao's basic ideas...and integrate them with
 specific conditions in each department and unit."
 In addition to being held responsible for the
 defeats and shortcomings of the "struggle-criticism-
 transformation"movement in their own localities, these
 "leading comrades" were also blamed for not providing the
 Central Committee with examples of "typical advanced
 experience" in the "struggle-criticism-transformation"
 movement, examples presumably of "things of an advanced
 socialist nature" which "the creativeness and wisdom of
 the revolutionary masses" (to quote the 1969 New Year's
 Day editorial) were expected to produce in this concluding
 stage of the Cultural Revolution.   Unless such "typical
 examples ...on the industrial and agricultural fronts and in
 the educational revolution" were "reported in good time,"
 it would not be possible (as the March Red Fla  editorial
 put it) for the Central Committee to "have      initiative
 in leading this movement."  It was on this somber note,
 then, that the long-awaited Ninth Party Congress con-
 vened on 1 April 1969.

 The Ninth Party Congress
 "From the opening of the Ninth National Congress
 to .  .  .  [its] conclusion .  .  .  , Chairman Mao consis-
 tently issued a call of great significance:   'Unite and
 strive for still greater victories.'  This call, which
 has generally outlined the basic spirit of the Ninth
 National Congress, is a strategic plan of Chairman Mao."
 --Joint Peso le's Dail , Red Flag, Liberation Army Dail
 Editorial, "Hold Aloft tliie`Ba nner of Unity of a Nint-Ti
 National Congress and Strive for Still Greater Victories,"
 June 9, 1969.
 For those who looked to the Ninth Party Congress
 to provide answers to basic questions about the recent
 past and future of Chinese politics, this first national
 congress of the Chinese Communist Party to be held in
 eleven years was a major disappointment.  Whether viewed
 in terms of the new Party leadership, the new Party
 structure or the course of future political and economic
 policy, the published record of the Congress (three commu-
 niques, Lin Piao's political report and the text of the
 new Party Constitution) was generally vague and contra-
 dictory.   In view of the ambiguous character of the
 evidence, one's view of developments at the Congress is
 bound to be colored by one's view of developments pre-
 ceding the Congress, indeed by one's view of the Cultural
 Revolution as a whole.
 Lin Piao's political report to the some 1500 dele-
 gates attending the Congress seemed designed in large part
 to dispel some erroneous views of the Cultural Revolution
 which were apparently widely held in China.  Developing
 the theme which Mao had introduced at the Twelfth Plenum
 the preceding October, Lin's report was largely a retro-
 spective review of the Cultural Revolution justified as
 "absolutely necessary and most timely for consolidating
 the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist
 restoration and building socialism."  Although hailed in
 the 14 April press communique as "a great program guiding
 China's socialist revolution and construction," Lin's

 report, characterized by retrospection, abstraction and
 defensiveness, was anything but that.
 Organization of the Congress appears to have been
 controlled from the top.   As Hsieh Fu-chih had revealed
 in a speech in October 1967, the plan was to organize the
 Congress "from the top downward" by having the Party
 Center select those who would attend.   Although there
 is some evidence of uncertainty and disagreement in the
 precongress deliberations of the top leadership,  the pro-
 ceedings of this Congress appear also to have been con-
 trolled from above, in particular the method of "electing"
 the members of the Presidium and new Central Committee
 by the Congress and of the Politburo and its Standing
 Committee by the first plenary session of the Ninth Cen-
 tral Committee held immediately after the Congress adjourned.
 It is interesting to note in this connection that
 an apparently deliberate attempt was made to mislead
 foreigners concerning the nature of this "election" pro-
 cess by substituting the term "elected" in the transla-
 tion of the final draft of the new Party constitution for
 the term "produced" which had appeared in the original
 draft of the new Party constitution.   In fact, the Chinese
 in the final version remains "produced," reflecting the
 strong disdain for electoral processes expressed in the
 15 October 1968 Red Flag editorial on Party rectification
 which had both "crTt c zed and repudiated the formalism
 of blind faith in elections" and had stipulated that both
 Party and Revolutionary Committees should be "established
 not by elections, but by relying directly upon the action
 of the great numbers of revolutionary people."
 More important than these considerations in apprais-
 ing the new Party organs is the character of the men
 selected to lead them.  The selection of Mao as Chairman
 and Lin as Vice Chairman as the only two officers to head
 the Central Committee, together with the new practice of
 listing other Politburo members by stroke-order, was
 clearly designed to underline the primacy of these two
 top leaders, with Lin Piao now officially enshrined in
 the new Party constitution as "Comrade Mao Tse-tung's
 close comrade-in-arms and successor."  The composition
 of the Politburo Standing Committee, by far the most
 important Party organ, demonstrates graphically the con-
 tinued domination of the top Party leadership by Maoist
 radicals.  Consisting of just five men (Mao, Lin, Chou
 En-lai, Ch'en Po-ta, and K'ang Sheng), this Standing Com-

 mittee is similar to the one formed at the outset of the
 Cultural Revolution at the Eleventh Plenum in August 1966,
 and, in its composition, places control over the conduct
 of the Party's daily and most important affairs in the
 hands of militant Maoists by a margin of four to one.
 Less clear cut and therefore susceptible to diver-
 gent interpretation is the character of the full 25-mem-
 ber Politburo "elected" on 28 April at the first plenary
 session of the new Central Committee.  It is possible to
 conclude, for example, that the most important character-
 istic of this new Politburo is the greater representation
 accorded the People's Liberation Army (12 of the 25, in-
 cluding Lin Piao and his wife) compared either with the
 previous Politburo or the list of 14 who had comprised
 the de facto leadership of the regime since mid-1968.
 According  o this view, it would follow then that this
 increase in military representation signifies a shift in
 the balance of power in the Politburo in favor of pro-
 ponents of relative "moderation" in domestic and foreign
 policy.
 It is important to note, however, that two of the
 ten military representatives (in addition to Lin and his
 wife) are superannuated and inactive veterans of the Red
 Army (Chu Teh and Liu Po-cheng) and that four more are
 military men of a very special type.  These four (Chief
 of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, Commander of the Air Force
 Wu Fa-hsien, Director of the Rear Services Department
 Chiu Hui-too and Navy First Political Commissar Li Tso-
 peng) have all been closely associated with Lin Piao for
 a number of years, have all survived Red Guard attack
 by inter alia making "self-criticisms," and have all
 played key political roles in the Cultural Revolution.
 When it is further noted that the two military region
 commanders (Hsu Shih-yu and Ch-'en Hsi-lien) named to
 the Politburo have also been linked with Lin Piao and
 also have survived the "test" of Red Guard denunciation
 by "self-criticism" and protracted sessions of "Mao-study"
 in Peking, it appears that an equally tenable interpre-
 tation of the addition of these military leaders to the
 Politburo is that they reflect to expansion in the power
 and influence of Lin Piao in this leading Party organ.

 An even more difficult question is judging-the
 political complexion of the new, much larger Central Com-
 mittee "elected" at the Congress.   In general, the compo-
 sition of the Ninth Central Committee suggests a conscious
 effort to apply the "three way alliance" principle under-
 lying the Revolutionary Committee structure at provincial
 and lower levels of government to the Party structure at
 the center.   Employing a criterion of primary association,
 the 279 full and alternate members of the new Central
 Committee consist of (1) representatives of the PLA, about
 40 percent; (2) representatives of "revolutionary cadres,"
 about 30 percent; and (3) representatives of the "revolu-
 tionary masses," also about 30 percent.  In addition to
 the preponderant share of the PLA, the dominant proportion
 (well over 50 percent) of regional representation (both
 from provincial Revolutionary Committees and the Military
 Regions and Districts) is another important feature of
 the new Central Committee worth noting.
 The crucial question in judging the political com-
 plexion of the new Central Committee, then, concerns the
 character of these military leaders who already dominate
 the provincial Revolutionary Committee structure and who
 now have been assigned a major role in the Party leader-
 ship.            On this point the evidence is also mixed and does
 not support a clear-cut judgment.  At the outset of the
 Cultural Revolution, Mao had called upon the PLA (in his
 famous 7 May 1966 directive) to become proficient in
 "politics, military affairs and culture," to engage in
 industry and agriculture, to "participate in each struggle
 of the cultural revolution" and in this way come "to play
 a very great role indeed."  But this role was clearly
 secondary to that of the Red Guards in the early stages
 of the Cultural Revolution, and there is reason to believe
 that Mao was reluctant in January 1967 to order the PLA
 to intervene formally in the revolution, an order which
 soon led the Army to carry out most of the functions
 previously exercised by the Party and government at pro-
 vincial and local levels.
 There is convincing proof, moreover, of Mao's and
 Lin's dissatisfaction with the initial performance of
 the PLA as the de facto government in the fact that roughly

 half of the Military Region and Military District Commands
 were subsequently purged and reorganized.   Even after this
 large-scale reorganization and the selection of new mili-
 tary commanders to positions of 'Leadership in the new
 provincial Revolutionary Committee structure, the perform-
 ance of a number of these replacements was subjected to
 severe criticism in the anti-Rightist campaign spearheaded
 by Madame Mao'in the spring of 1968.  These military com-
 manders, however characterized, could hardly meet the
 criteria laid down by Lin Piao (in his Eleventh Plenum
 speech of August 1966) for the selection of new Party
 leaders--that they eagerly studied the thought of Mao Tse-
 tung, attached great importance to political-ideological
 work and were filled with revolutionary zeal..
 On the other hand, the PLA has discharged its role
 as the main executer of policy during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and as the whipping-boy for problems resulting from
 that policy with remarkable discipline and obedience.
 With the possible exception of the Wuhan Incident, there
 is no known instance of local military commanders directly
 defying orders from Peking, orders which frequently re-
 sulted in subjecting them to physical attack and humilia-
 ting abuse at the hands of the Red Guards.  When mistakes
 have been made, they have either been mistakes of omission
 (e.g., failure to identify and support the "revolutionary
 Left") or the result of a natural tendency to interpret
 ambiguous directives so as to minimize disorder and safe-
 guard their own positions.   Whatever the case, those local
 military commanders who have survived have accepted respon-
 sibility for these mistakes by engaging in "self-criticism."
 On balance, then, it appears that these military leaders
 at the regional and provincial levels to whom important
 Party and government functions have been assigned, should
 be characterized as essentially loyal to Mao.
 t is important to note, moreover, that it was the
 Army which implemented the radical and disruptive social
 and economic programs inaugurated on an experimental basis
 in the fall of 1968.   Indeed, as authoritative editorials
 in February and March of 1969 implied, the local military
 had been too zealous in promoting these programs, resort-
 ing to coercion rather than persuasion when confronted by

 opposition to these radical reforms.  By contrast,
 "veteran cadres" were cited as "generally having richer
 experience and a better understanding of the importance
 of the Party's policies" and it was in order to make more
 of these available that Mao's "mild" cadre policy (as
 formulated, for example, in the 1969 New Year's Day edi-
 torial) of "educating and uniting the overwhelming majority
 of...cadres" was revived.
 In addition to a continuing campaign to "liberate"
 more experienced and expert "veteran cadres," there has
 been a continuing effort to increase the representation
 of "new cadres"--the representatives of revolutionary
 mass organizations--on the Revolutionary Committees at
 provincial and local levels.   The revival of these mass
 organizations, which had supposedly been dissolved in
 late summer 1968, to a position of some power and influence
 is one of the most intriguing developments in the post-
 Congress period.  Justified as necessary to "unite the
 overwhelming majority of the people," the decision by
 Peking to reinstate radical Red Guards to positions of
 leadership in a number of provinces (e.g., Kwangtung and
 Chekiang) will also serve to strengthen civilian repre-
 sentation at the expense of the PLA at provincial and
 local levels of government and provide these Red Guard
 leaders with still another chance to qualify as "revolu-
 tionary successors."
 In spite of the dominant theme of "unity" the net
 effect of the Ninth Party Congress apparently was to pro-
 duce further disunity.  By insisting on retaining the
 three-way alliance organizational form of the Revolutionary
 Committee, Mao is attempting to build a new power structure
 which is inherently unstable.  Representing disparate
 groups with widely differing interests, the three components
 of the leadership of these new organs of power are also
 expected to perform differing roles, with the PLA respon-
 sible for maintaining order, the old cadres charged with
 providing administrative expertise, and the new cadres
 assigned such important tasks as maintaining contact with
 the masses, promoting revolutionary enthusiasm and, pre-
 sumably, serving as revolutionary watchdogs to check and

 report on the per?ormance of the military and veteran
 cadres to Peking.   It is not surprising that following
 the Congress the Chinese provincial press was filled with
 reports of continuing "disunity" and, a new phenomenon,
 of "paralysis" within the leadership of these Revolution-
 ary Committees.
 If there was uncertainty about the character of
 the new leadership and the nature of the new structure
 of power emerging after the Ninth Party Congress, there
 was also uncertainty about the course of future political
 and economic policy as discussed by Lin Piao in his poli-
 tical report to the Congress.  The new stage of "carrying
 out the tasks of struggle-criticism-transformation con-
 scientiously" begun in September 1968 had been modified
 by a new set of Mao instructions issued in early 1969,
 all directed toward slackening the pace and restoring
 minimum levels of economic, social and political sta-
 bility in the name of "unity."  These instructions were
 now codified and presented by Lin as a series of "party
 policies" concerning the intellectuals (to be "re-educated"),
 cadres (to be "liberated" but only if properly repentant),
 the "class struggle" (be both "lenient" and "severe" to-
 ward "class enemies") and the economy ("grasp revolution
 and promote production").   As Lin put it, "the main question
 at present is to carry [these policies) out to the letter."
 Presented with these vague and contradictory in-
 structions, the newly established Revolutionary Committees
 were then ordered to apply them in every factory, school,
 commune and all other basic units in society "in a deep-
 going, meticulous, down to earth and appropriate way,"
 or, as Lin later put it, in accordance with "the specific
 conditions of the unit concerned."  The dilemna of the
 Revolutionary Committee leadership held responsible for
 solving problems by means of "the living study and appli-
 cation of Mao Tse-tung thought" was two-fold.  First was
 the undeniable fact that, as one provincial press commen-
 tary put it, "it requires time and effort for one to fully
 understand Chairman Mao's instructions."  Much more dif
 ficult than this, however, was the task of "applying"
 these instructions in the light of actual conditions in
 one's own department or unit; that is, "educating the

 masses in policy and translating the Party's policy into
 the conscious action of the masses."
 More specifically, how should the Revolutionary
 Committee leadership act, as the problem was posed in a
 Shanghai editorial not long before the Congress, "when
 faced with certain opinions or actions of the masses
 which do not conform with the Party's policies?"  Since
 it was taken on faith, as this same editorial went on to
 point out. that "the masses support the Party's policies,"
 any such appearance  :f conflict could only result from
 "errors" by the leadership, either in understanding or
 applying the policy in question.
 A common reaction of local leadership cadres, then,
 was to be "hesitant" and "fearful" and take refuge in
 silence when the masses "disagreed" with "Party policy."
 Lacking clear policy directives from above, rent by the
 differing viewpoints of the three disparate components
 of the three-way alliance, and confronted by the resis-
 tance of the masses to Mao's radical social and economic
 programs, it is no wonder that the performance of Mao's
 new revolutionary organ of power--the Revolutionary Com-
 mittee--was characterized in the spring and early summer
 of 1969 by instability, disunity and a general paralysis
 of leadership.

 tural Revolution.  An appraisal of progress to date in
 achieving these goals demonstrates that there is a con-
 siderable distance to go--that, in fact, "there are still
 many tasks to be completed."
 Progress toward the first goal--that of "smashipg
 revisionism"--has been most notable,  at least in a tempor-
 ary sense.  In this initial, destructive phase of the
 Cultural Revolution, Mao has largely succeeded in elimin-
 ating his opposition by destroying or radically modifying
 those institutions charged with breeding "revisionism"--
 the Party and government bureaucracy,  the bourgeois-
 dominated educational system and, to a lesser extent, the
 whole fabric of urban society held responsible for cor-
 rupting the moral and spiritual life of the Chinese people.
 Although temporarily successful, the very nature of this
 undertaking would appear to be self-defeating, if for no
 other reason than that the political, educational and
 social institutions of the new Maoist revolutionary order
 will in time harden into a new Establishment.
 Progress toward the second, related and even more
 ambitious goal  of the Cultural Revolution--that of
 changing the very nature of Chinese man by means of a
 political indoctrination campaign of unprecedented
 intensity and magnitude--has been much less notable.
 Having "destroyed 'the palaces of hell-rulers"' (as Lin
 Piao put it in his political report to the Congress) who
 in the past had "blocked Chairman Mao's instructions,"
 it was now possible for all of the 700 million Chinese
 people to "hear Chairman Mao's voice directly," a momen-
 tous development which Lin went on to characterize as
 "the most significant achievement of the great proletarian
 cultural revolution."  But, as suggested by the negative
 response of the "revolutionary masses" to the first at-
 tempt in the winter of 1968-1969 to revive some of the
 radical features of the Great Leap Forward and commune
 programs, this view of the Chinese people as willing and
 eager to subordinate self in order to promote Mao's
 visionary aims appears to be erroneous.  Indeed, this
 postulate of an identity of interest between Mao and the
 Chinese people as a whole appears to a basic fallacy which
 sooner or later will destroy the Cultural Revolution.

 Progress toward the third goal enumerated by Lin
 Piao in his political report--"strengthening and consoli-
 dating the economic base of socialism"--has been minimal,
 and, in fact, the effort so far to realize Mao's visionary
 plan for accelerated economic development has probably
 been counterproductive.  This plan, as already noted,
 embodies features of the earlier Great Leap Forward
 (the emphasis on manpower and political enthusiasm in
 place of capital and material incentives) and commune
 (the building of large-scale, self-supporting and publicly
 owned economic and social units in the countryside) pro-
 grams.   At the same time, a number of its features can be
 traced to Mao's famous 7 May 1966 directive, particularly
 its goals of redirecting material and human resources to
 the countryside and of creating an omni-competent, all-
 purpose Chinese man and thus eliminating (a long-term
 Mvaist goal) the three great differences between town
 and country, industry and agriculture, and mental and
 physical labor.   Although the current moderate trend in
 economic policy indicates an awareness of practical dif-
 ficulties, there is no reason to believe that Mao has
 abandoned the pursuit of  his basic vision for the con-
 struction of a selfless, egalitarian, authentic Communist
 society in China.
 The undertaking to achieve the fourth and final
 goal--the search for "revolutionary successors"--has in
 some ways been the most frustrating and least successful
 of all.   At the very top, Lin Piao of course is now in
 place as Mao's successor, but there is considerable doubt
 both about Lin's health and his abilityn to endure after
 Mao is gone.   As noted above, the Politburo is also
 weighted with hand-picked supporters, but few if any of
 these are both talented and youthful enough to take over
 when the present generation goes.   It is at provincial
 and lower levels, however, where the failure to identify
 and promote to positions of leadership Mao's "revolutionary
 Leftist" supporters has been most apparent.
 This more than any other reason explains why the
 program of Party rectification and building under way for
 more than two years has achieved so little.  Despite the

 flurry of activity at the Center (two Central Committee
 plenums and a National Congress between October 1968 and
 April 1969), the Party has yet to assume its assigned role
 of leadership within the provincial Revolutionary Committee
 system, nor, with one or two exceptions has it done so
 at basic levels of society.  The primary cause for this
 snail's pace is Party building appears to be a continuing
 fear by the Maoist leadership in Peking of a "restoration
 of the old," of a revival of the pre-Cultural Revolution
 "bureaucratic" Party apparatus staffed by the same un-
 repentant and unredeemed cadres.  Until such time as suf-
 ficient "new blood" ("new cadres") is brought into the
 leadership, it appears that the Party will continue to
 lead a shadowy, ghost-like existence at provincial and
 local levels of the new structure of power.
 These, then, are some of the "many tasks" of the
 Cultural Revolution which remain "to be completed."  To
 the extent that they embody visionary aims, they can of
 course never be completed.   But it would be a misreading
 both of the man himself and of the revolution which.'is
 so distinctively his to think that Mao Tse-tung will
 abandon the pursuit of these chimerical goals.   As long
 as Mao Tse-tung continues to dominate his Party and
 people, the Cultural Revolution will continue, although
 perhaps under a new name, in Communist China.
