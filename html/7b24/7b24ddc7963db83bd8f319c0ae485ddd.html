 PORTUGAL: GONCALVES' SUPPORT WANES
 Prime Minister Goncalves' position is
 steadily weakening in the face of the combined
 opposition of former foreign minister Melo
 Antunes and internal security chief Carvalho.
 Even the Communists, Goncalves' staunchest
 supporters, appear resigned to his impending
 ouster and are concentrating their efforts on
 salvaging what they can of the party's influence.
 President Costa Gomes' remark earlier this
 week that the duration of Goncalves' left-wing
 cabinet-now nearly two weeks old-can "be
 expressed in days" has touched off speculation
 that the Prime Minister is on his way out. Such
 speculation is further fueled by the continuing
 erosion of Goncalves' support within the armed
 forces. Northern military region commander
 Corvacho, the only regional commander who
 has not taken a stand against Goncalves, has
 been relieved of his duties and temporarily
 replaced by an apolitical officer. Goncalves
 suffered another blow with the firing of Colonel
 Varela Gomes, a known Communist supporter,
 from the propaganda division of the general
 staff.
 Lisbon radio reports that a group of offi-
 cers headed by Antunes and Carvalho, ac-
 companied by the army and air force chiefs of
 staff and five other officers, met with President
 Costa Gomes on August 19 to present a new
 political action program. The program included
 a demand for the ouster of Goncalves.
 The document presented to Costa Gomes is
 reported to be a synthesis of rival documents
 presented in an attempt to resolve the current
 power struggle. The first, drafted by Melo
 Antunes, criticizes the "crisis of authority" in
 the military government-mostly the fault of the
 Communists-and calls for the construction of a
 Prime Minister Goncalves at a recent press conference

 classless, socialist society "under conditions of
 democracy and liberty." The second, drafted by
 a group of radical populist officers under the
 command of General Carvalho, blames both the
 Communists and the non-Communist parties for
 the present unrest. The Carvalho group foresees
 a revolutionary government deriving its au-
 thority from popular assemblies that would
 cement the alliance between the military and
 the people.
 Although both documents denounce the
 Communists, party leaders appear to regard
 adherence to the radical populists' program as
 the best way to maintain some of their in-
 fluence. The Communists and the fellow-
 traveling Portuguese Democratic Movement
 joined in a demonstration sponsored by extreme
 left-wing groups on August 20 in support of the
 populist program, which is generally associated
 with General Carvalho. Despite these gestures
 toward Carvalho, the Communists will find it
 difficult to overcome Carvalho's anti-Commu-
 nist bias.
 In the face of the continuing attacks on the
 Communist Party and its offices throughout
 much of the north, party leaders have tried to
 regain the initiative but have failed. They began
 a campaign to reassert themselves in areas where
 they had been forced out by anti-Communist
 violence.  A  rally  in the  northern town  of
 Alcobaca on August 16 was broken up by anti-
 Communists. The rising level of violence forced
 the Communists to cancel a rally in Oporto
 three days later. A 30-minute general strike,
 organized by the Communist-controlled labor
 federation and vigorously promoted by Gon-
 calves, was almost a total faiiur .
 Apparently taking heed of the changing
 situation, Communist party leader Cunhal
 softened his line at a press conference on August
 20. He reiterated support for the Goncalves gov-
 ernment but added that the Communists were
 prepared to participate in finding new solutions
 for Portugal's political struggles. This is being
 taken as acceptance of Goncalves' inevitable
 downtall. Although he blamed the Socialists for
 creating the split in the Armed Forces Move-
 ment, Cunhal retained a conciliatory tone, as-
 serting that "no one can place his interests
 about the overall interests of the revolution."

 USSR-PORTUGAL
 Preparing for the Worst
 The deepening distress of the Portuguese
 Communist  Party has  produced a marked
 change in the Soviet perception of the situation,
 at least as reflected in media reporting. Mos-
 cow's relative confidence that events in Portugal
 were going wall has given way to shrill criticism
 of outside meddling.
 On two recent occasions, Moscow has
 drawn an explicit analogy between current con-
 ditions in Portugal and those in Chile just before
 the overthrow of Allende. The theme first ap-
 peared in a broadcast on August 15 and was
 repeated in an authoritative article in Pravda on
 August 19. The tenor of the Soviet statements
 suggests that the Soviets see the odds increasing
 for an outcome like that in Chile.
 According to Lisbon's ambassador to Mos-
 cow, the Soviets have advised the Portuguese
 Communists -to prepare for a return to clandes-
 tine status. Such advice is a routine procedure in
 contingency planning in unstable countries.
 Advancing it now would show growing Soviet
 awareness that a Communist debacle is possible
 in Portugal.
 Unlike most Soviet commentary on Por-
 tugal, the Pravda article expressed Moscow's
 views directly, rather than putting them in the
 mouths of the Portuguese Communists or other
 intermediaries. Much of the article is devoted to
 harsh criticism of NATO, the Western press,
 Western economic organizations, and "interna-
 tional social democracy." The Chinese are also
 dragged into the cast of evildoers; they are
 accused of cooperating with international reac-
 tion by fomenting discord in Angola and the
 Azores.
 Changing Emphasis
 Much of the changing emphasis in Soviet
 coverage of Portuguese events may be intended
 to prepare foreign and domestic audiences for a
 Communist setback in Portugal and to identify
 villains for the period of recrimination that
 would inevitably follow. The Soviets may also
 be trying to rebut recent statements of high US
 officials by building a case that it is really the
 West, not the Soviets, that is interfering in Por-
 tugal.
 The Pravda article charges that the Por-
 tuguese Socialists are providing a rallying point
 for reactionaries by attacking the Communists,
 but the tone is less strident than when Moscow
 was denouncing the Socialists immediately after
 they left the government. Indeed, Pravda calls
 for "concerted action" by the Armed Forces
 Movement,  the Communists, Socialists, and
 other le 't progressive forces. The Soviets have
 repeated this theme, which is nominally in
 accord with Portuguese Communist Party leader
 Cunhal's professed policies, more frequently in
 recent days.
 The voluminous Soviet commentary on
 Portugal does not offer any practical advice nor
 does it provide any clues about what, if any,
 action the Soviets might take in support of the
 Portuguese party. The Pravda article concluded
 with a call for "massive solidarity" with the
 forces fighting reaction in Portugal. Under the
 circumstances, this is the minimum that Moscow
 might be expected to say to preserve its revolu-
 tionary credentials.
 On August 19, the Hungarian party issued
 a short statement, clearly coordinated with Mos-
 cow, that expressed solidarity with the Por-
 tuguese Communists. Moscow's other friends in
 East Europe will probably soon follow suit.

 SPAIN: CRACKDOWN ON TERRORISM
 A tough new anti-terrorist law, expected to
 be announced after the cabinet meeting on
 August 22, will be the government's answer to
 the new wave of vioience that has hit the tour
 try. If the law leads to repressive measures
 against a wide segment of the population, it
 would play into the hands of the terrorists and
 damage Prime Minister Arias' efforts to project a
 favorable image abroad.
 draft law, which has been in preparation for
 three months, but the cold-blooded killing of a
 Civil Guard officer in Madrid by a Marxist ter-
 intended to soften some of the provisions in the
 Arias had
 rorist group last week ended that hope. This was
 the third policeman killed since July 14. The
 Anti-Fascist and Patriotic Revolutionary Front,
 a dissident Communist terrorist group known by
 its acronym FRAP, has claimed credit for the
 killings, which it undertook to dramatize its
 anti-Franco stand.
 Rightist groups used the funeral of the
 slain guardsman to protest his slaying and to
 criticize the Arias government. An estimated
 2,000 persons, including members of the Civil
 Guard in mufti, participated in a demonstration
 that nearly got out of hand. In addition to
 blocking the cars of departing officials, the
 demonstrators shouted "down with terrorism,"
 "power to the army," and slogans critical of
 Arias' liberalization program.
 The  new counter-terrorist measures will
 raise new tensions in the Basque provinces,
 where the emergency decree granting the police
 extra powers was allowed to expire on July 26.
 The recent terrorist incidents seem certain to
 lead to a new crackdown, and Arias' plans to
 devise  regional  development  plans  for  the
 Basque area are likely to be slowed.
 The Spanish police have already scored
 some success with their roundup in Madrid,
 Barcelona, and Galicia of terrorists who are
 members of FRAP and of the Basque Father-
 land and Liberty. 1 he most important arrests of
 Basques were made in Madrid and Barcelona
 where four terrorists were seized and one was
 killed. One of those arrested was allegedly
 involved  in the assassination of then prime
 minister Luis Carrero Blanco and also had con-
 tacts with Uruguayan Tupamaros and the Irish
 Republican Army. The arrests allegedly broke
 up plans to kidnap prominent officials as well as
 to free some Basque terrorists from jail. There is
 also press speculation that the Spanish police
 have evidence that the Basque terrorists have
 developed links with FRAP and a separatist
 Galician organization, as well as with foreign
 terrorist groups. Publication of such allegations
 is likely to lead to further demands for harsh
 measures against terrorists.

 FEDAYEEN: AGREEMENT OPPOSED
 Leaders of the three least radical fedayeen
 groups-including Fatah and Saiqa, the two
 largest-have joined with fedayeen and other
 Arab radicals in publicly condemning Egypt's
 moves toward a new disengagement agreement
 with Israel. The possibility of an early agree-
 ment has already strained Egyptian-Palestinian
 relations and prompted the Palestinians to move
 closer to Syria. Implementation of an accord
 might lead these Palestinians to adopt more
 extreme policies, including the increased use of
 terrorism.
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chair-
 man Yasir Arafat, according to a pro-fedayeen
 newspaper in Beirut, has said that his Fatah
 organization "rejects the American settlement
 and will resist it through the barrels of our
 guns." Such rhetoric is usually intended for
 internal fedayeen consumption, but might in
 this case presage an increase in terrorist activity
 designed to improve Arafat's political position.
 Since Arafat's widely publicized appearance at
 the UN last year, his prestige has diminished
 steadily as a result of his failure to produce
 anything concrete for the Palestinians.
 Last March, Fatah commandos raided Tel
 Aviv in an effort to undermine Secretary Kis-
 singer's attempt to arrange a second Egyptian-
 Israeli disengagement. That attack had no direct
 effect on peace negotiations, but helped protect
 Arafat against charges by fedayeen  "rejec-
 tionists" that he was cooperating with Egypt
 and the US in the false hope that the Pales-
 tinians would gain something from negotiations.
 Syria's stand will be the most important
 single force in determining the extent to which
 the more conciliatory fedayeen groups oppose
 Egyptian President Sadat. If the Egyptians are
 able to reassure Syrian President Asad and limit
 Syrian criticism of Egypt, those Palestinians will
 have little choice but to follow Damascus' lead.
 This would further weaken Arafat by providing
 his opponents another opportunity to charge
 that the Arab states are pursuing their own ends
 in disregard of Palestinian interests.
 Damascus so far has not joined the Pales-
 tinians in criticizing the Egyptians. This suggests
 that Syria views the prospect of another Sinai
 accord with less alarm than it did last March and
 will take no steps to upset it. The Syrians ap-
 parently have some confidence that Sadat will
 include in any new agreement provisions for
 negotiations on the Golan Heights.
 More may be known of Syria's posiflon
 when Damascus responds to the latest Pi,Ies-
 tinian initiative to implement the "Palestinian-
 Syrian joint political and military command."
 The command was originally  proposed by
 President Asad during the March round of peace
 negotiations. The proposal lay dormant until
 late last week, however, when the PLO central
 committee called for the "highest speed pos-
 sible" toward setting up a joint body that could
 take a unified stand on "current developments."
 If Syria becomes disillusioned with Egypt
 and abets Palestinian obstructionism, Arafat and
 his associates will more directly and forcefully
 criticize Egypt, the US, and the principle of a
 negotiated  settlement.  If unchecked by
 Egyptian  assurances of early negotiating
 progress on Palestinian issues, such criticism
 could lead ultimately to a new round of terrorist
 activity in Israel and abroad.             i

 There have been no signs of resistance to
 the new government since it came to power in a
 military-led coup last Friday. Within the regime,
 however, a power struggle may be developing
 between the middle-grade army officers who led
 the coup and senior officers who supported the
 plotters but now want to assert their own
 authority.
 Several army majors have been identified as
 the main instigators of the coup.
 Senior officers
 did
 not participate in the coup until after it was
 under way. This week there were indications
 that tension was starting to grow between the
 two groups.
 Khondakar Mushtaque Ahmed, Mujib's
 commerce minister, was selected by the plotters
 to serve as president. They appear to have given
 him broad authority to administer the country.
 Mushtaque, however, is unlikely to act against
 the wishes of whoever emerges in control of the
 army, which is the dominant force in the new
 regime.
 Mushtaque was long regarded as one of
 Mujib's more pro-West and conservative political
 lieutenants. He has named a cabinet comprised
 largely of middle-of-the-road  civilians  from
 Mujib's government and Awami League. The
 regime apparently wants to restore democratic
 government and civil liberties, abrogated by
 Mujib early this year, but Bangladesh's massive
 economic and social problems may make it dif-
 ficult to abandon martial law soon.
 The government's initial statements on for-
 eign relations indicate a strong interest in
 establishing closer ties with  other Islamic
 nations. Islamabad, with which relations had
 been very limited under Mujib's leadership since
 Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan
 in 1971, was the first to extend recognition. The
 Pakistanis also promised emergency economic
 assistance in the form of rice and cloth. Several
 Arab nations,  including Saudi Arabia, have
 extended recognition, as have the UK and
 Japan.
 The emphasis on Islamic ties, and Pak-
 istan's enthusiasm for the new regime,  are
 causing some concern in New Delhi, which
 enjoyed good relations with Mujib's secular and
 generally pro-Indian government. The Indians
 probably are also uneasy about the possibility
 that the new regime will be friendlier toward
 China than toward the USSR. So far, India has
 adopted a cautioi's stance. It reportedly has
 sealed the border and reinforced police and

 The Indians seem unlikely to intervene
 militarily in Bangladesh, unless major instability

 antagonizing  its much  larger  and  stronger
 neighbor to the west. For example, it appears to
 be backing away from its initial moves toward
 designating Bangladesh an "Islamic republic."
 Mushtaque has declared that his govern-
 ment wants friendly ties with all three major
 powers. Mujib's regime had generally good rela-
 tions with the US and the Soviet Union and was
 on poor terms with China, which had sided with
 Islamabad  during  Bangladesh's  independence
 struggle.
 The        Soviets have  been  publicly  non-
 committal                         about   the coup,   but-like  most
 observers-presumably see it as a setback for
 both the USSR and its ally, India. Moscow is
 unhappy about what it sees as pro-US sympa-
 thies of the new rulers. Its greatest concern,
 however, is that Dacca may now seek to im-
 prove relations with Peking.
 Until the Soviets have a better idea of
 Dacca's intentions, they are unlikely to do or
 say anything to antagonize the new leaders.
 Moscow will probably let India take the lead in
 testing the sincerity of the new government's
 expressions of desire for friendship with all. The
 Soviets may caution India against over-reacting,
 although India apparently needs no such advice.
 China  is  guardedly  optimistic  about
 developments in Dacca. This was reflected in its
 prompt reporting of the coup. Peking no doubt
 is  encouraged  by  indications that  the new
 regime is moving toward better relations with
 Pakistan. If this trend continues and the new
 government displays staying power, the Chinese,
 who see Bangladesh as a potential source of
 leverage in dealing with  India, will probably
 move quickly to establish diplomatic ties with

 Muhammed (1) with Brigadier Obasanjo
 The new military regime that took po\rer
 late last month has made a good initial impres-
 sion on the Nigerian public by avoiding any
 suggestion of ethnic favoritism so far and by
 moving to tackle several long-standing domestic
 problems. Foreign policy remains on the back
 burner for now, although continuity in Nigeria's
 relations is being stressed.
 Head of state Brigadier Muhammed, who
 comes from the large Hausa-Fulani tribal group-
 ing of northern Nigeria, has taken ri hard line
 against the corruption endemic in the gov-
 ernment and has indicated that closer super-
 vision by the Supreme Military Council is in
 store. In outlining the regime's mode of opera-
 tion last week, he declared that cabinet deci-
 sions would be made collectively and within
 guidelines set by the Supreme Military Council.
 An advisory role is envisioned for senior civil
 servants who exercised considerable indepen-
 dence under Gowon.
 State military governors have been ad-
 monished not to tolerate graft or abuse of
 power in their administrations. They are dis-
 missing large numbers of allegedly corrupt state
 officials. At the federal level, steps are being
 taken to revitalize the watchdog role of the
 auditor general. Despite clamor by the press and
 student groups, it does not appear that assets of
 high-level officials who had been in the govern-
 ment of deposed head of state Yakubu Gowon
 will be investigated. Such a move could result in
 embarrassing counter charges against some mem-
 bers of the new regime, including Muhammed
 himself.
 Panels have been set up to examine the
 feasibility of relocating the federal capital from
 overcrowded Lagos and to determine whether
 additional states should be created within Ni-
 geria's federal system. Both issues involve tribal
 interests and are politically sensitive. The ques-
 tion of more states is particularly thorny. The
 regime risks opening a Pandora's box of agita-
 tion for the creation of numerous tribally ori-
 ented mini-states that would be economically
 weak.
 On the economic front, the regime has
 thrown its support behind the $48-billion five-
 year development plan Gowon introduced last
 April. A task force is being formed to recom-
 mend ways to control Nigeria's soaring rate of
 inflation, now approaching 40 percent. The gov-
 ernment has also issued new scheduling direc-
 tives intended to help ease the country's severe
 port congestion that has resulted in shortages of
 many essential imports. Various proposals are
 being considered to expand and modernize port
 facilities.
 Nigeria's new rulers may not fully appre-
 ciate the complexity of some of the problems

 ANGOLA: NEW INITIATIVES
 The Soviet-backed Popular Movement for
 the Liberation of Angola, having succeeded in
 driving the two rival nationalist groups from
 Luanda, is jockeying with the Portuguese for
 political control there. At the same time, the
 organization is trying to strengthen its hand by
 taking military control of the territory's major
 economic centers.
 On August 19, the Popular Movement an-
 nounced that it will establish paramilitary
 "people's defense committees" in Luanda. The
 committees will be under the administrative
 control of the Movement's armed forces. They
 will be composed primarily of the thousands of
 civilians in the Angolan capital who were armed
 by the Movement earlier this year. Similar com-
 mittees will probably be established in other
 areas where the Movement is militarily domi-
 nant, such as Cabinda.
 The Popular Movement has long had the
 support of the bulk of Luanda's population, but
 in the past that support has been unorganized or
 diffused among disparate social or quasi-political
 organizations. The defense committees will give
 the Movement an umbrella organization under
 which to mobilize popular support. As part of
 the Movement's military force, the committees
 will also be an effective means of intimidating
 what little popular support the other liberation
 groups may still have in the capital.
 The Movement's announcement is also a
 strong challenge to Lisbon to either recognize
 the Movement as the only effective political
 organization in the territory or back up its own
 claim to sovereignty by suppressing the com-
 mittees. Last weekend, the Movement rejected
 they intend to tackle. They will soon have to
 translate their good intentions into some more
 visible progress or face early public disenchant-
 ment with their performance and increased pres-
 sure for a commitment to return Nigeria to
 an announcement by the acting high commis.
 sioner on August 12 that he was assuming ad-
 ministrative control of the territory because the
 transitional government that had included all
 three nationalist  groups was no longer func-
 tioning.
 Aug 22, 75
 Page  9   WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Movement is trying to capture An-
 gola's major port of Lobito and the nearby rail
 head at Benguela. The fighting there is now into
 its second week. The Movement appears to be
 encountering stiff opposition from the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
 which has strong popular support in that area, as
 well as from the National Front for the Libera-
 tion of Angola, the Movement's main rival.
 Portuguese military officials have been
 unable to arrange a cease-fire through nego-
 tiations and are unwilling to use their own
 troops to impose a truce. In any event, it is
 probably too late for the Portuguese to impose a
 truce or reassert their authority over Angola.
 The territory's future is in the hands of the
 liberation groups, who appear determined to
 settle the question on the battlefield/_1

 LIBYA: COUP FOILED
 Libyan President Qadhafi foiled a coup
 attempt last week led by two members of the
 ruling Revolutionary Command Council. Al-
 though Qadhafi easily countered the conspiracy,
 ha has now lost the mystique of the "unchal-
 lengeable" leader that provided part of the
 underpinning for his special brand of personal
 rule.
 Major Umar Muhayshi and Major Bashir
 Hawadi-two of the lesser lights on the 11-man
 council-are the only  members directly
 implicated in the plot, although Egyptian media
 claim others were involved. Muhayshi escaped to
 Tunisia where he apparently will be allowed to
 remain, despite Libyan efforts to have him
 extradited. Hawadi is under arrest in Tripoli.
 The ease with which the coup was
 squelched and the relatively relaxed atmosphere
 in Tripoli suggest that Qadhafi still commands
 the loyalty of key officials in the security and
 military services. The search for other plotters is
 apparently still going on, but Egyptian press
 reports of massive arrests and widespread defec-
 tions are almost certainly exaggerated.
 'Muhayshi has had a stormy relationship
 with Qadhafi, who has never trusted him fully
 and has occasionally manipulated his assign-
 ments and responsibilities within the council.
 Muhayshi has had no direct command over mili-
 tary or security forces since 1969 and often
 chafed  under Qadhafi's high-handed ways.
 Hawadi is the secretary general of Libya's sole
 political party; he, too, has never had direct
 access to the levers of power in Libya. Both men
 have in the past been harshly disciplined by
 their leader for "immoral" behavior and, there-
 fore, were motivated at least in part by personal
 grievance. However, their defections were prob-
 ably also prompted by broader differences with
 Qadhafi over foreign policy and economic issues
 and thus may well be a measure of growing
 frustration with Qadhafi throughout the regime.
 The extent of foreign involvement, if any,
 in the plot is unclear, but Libya's closure of its
 border with Egypt during the period when the
 coup attempt took place indicates that Cairo is
 under suspicion.
 References to the coup attempt in several
 Libyan newspapers suggest that Qadhafi is not
 especially worried about public reaction, al-
 though  one editorial-probably written  by
 Qadhafi himself-warns of a possible purge. This
 warning was underscored by a series of council
 decrees issued last weekend making subversion,
 contact with foreign powers, and other political
 crimes punishable by life imprisonment and in
 some cases death.
 That Qadhafi has ruled Libya for six years
 without such laws and without being challenged
 attests to his reliance on personal charisma, the
 loyalty of his colleagues, and "revolutionary"
 esprit de corps as sources of power and
 authority. The defection of two of the original
 12 leaders of the 1969 coup will erode these
 intangibles and presumably the confidence and
 security with which Qadhafi has ruled. The
 Libyan leader is adept at using other instru-
 ments of control, however, and will be forced to
 do so in the months ahead. Over the long term,
 his stern hand will create new stress in a regime
 already strained by internal differences.

 Economy Minister Cafiero (:second from left) attends cabinet meeting with President Peron
 Antonio Cafiero, a 52-year-old Peronist
 economist, was appointed minister of economy
 late last week. The last member of the new
 cabinet to be named and by far its most pres-
 tigious minister, he faces an ever deepening
 recession that could lead to further troubles
 with Gabor.
 During the 1950s, Cafiero held several
 important positions under Juan Peron. Most
 recently, he was his country's ambassador to the
 European Common Market. He has served as an
 adviser to the powerful  Peronist labor con-
 federation and has long been thought to be
 labor's choice for the post he now holds.
 Cafiero will find it difficult to retain the
 support of organized labor, however, because of
 the effect of the recession on workers already
 angered by the precipitous rise of prices. As
 demand reacts to rising prices, thousands of jobs
 are being wiped out. The US embassy reports a
 sharp upsurge in the number of dismissal notices
 this month, and many firms have been forced to
 curtail or cease operations because they cannot
 pay the huge wage increases wen by labor.
 Accelerating unemployment could lead labor-
 which had a major hand in the ouster of Lopez
 Rega-to take to the streets again for a new
 round of protests over government failure to
 reverse economic deterioration.
 Cafiero's only specific policy statement
 thus far has been - declaration that he is con-
 templating no new devaluations of the peso.
 Large, successive devaluations earlier in the year
 provoked angry reactions from businessmen and
 consumers alike, since the moves contributed to
 rising prices. For the moment, Cafiero is limiting
 himself to statements of the need for the co-
 operation of all sectors in problems that he
 admits are serious but claims can be solved.

 MEXICO: WORLD TOUR
 President Echeverria returned home today
 from a grueling 45-day, 14-nation trip whose
 purpose, although unstated, was to launch his
 campaign to become the next secretary general
 of the United Nations.
 At each stop on the tou; of Africa, Asia,
 the Middle East, and the Caribbean, the usual
 economic, cultural, and technical agreements
 were signed, but most were of dubious signifi-
 cance. Of more importance to Echeverria was
 the chance to be seen and heard in countries
 whose support he will need for the UN post.
 Should Echeverria actually run, his most
 obvious opponent would be the current secre-
 tary general, Kurt Waldheim, whose term ends
 on December 31, 1976. Waldheim has given no
 indication of his intentions about seeking re-
 election.
 Since entering office in December 1970,
 Echeverria has visited 36 foreign countries and
 established diplomatic relations with over 25,
 most of them within the past six months.
 Clearly, he has been attempting to portray
 Mexico and himself a,: dynamic and "revolu-
 tionary" leaders of the developing world. The
 fact that this image does not quite square with
 Mexico's national reality nor with Echeverria's
 own internatior:il stature apparently does not
 trouble him.
 The President appears to have convinced
 himself that he has the answers to troublesome
 world problems. His dogged pursuit of support
 for his Charter of Economic Rights and Duties
 of States, a UN document that attempts to
 r.'order international economic activity, is an
 example of his messianic character. While in
 Egypt,  Echeverria announced another brain-
 storm-an organization to defend Third World
 economic interests. This organization, according
 to Echeverria, would go beyond the scope of the
 nonaligned group to counter the "imperialism"
 of transnativnal enterprises.
 Echeverria is not inclined to rely much on
 his  institutional  advisers and  frequently
 bewilders them with  unexpected decisions,
 leaving them to pick up the pieces. His sudden
 decision to break relations with Chile last year
 left the  Foreign Secretariat groping for a
 rational explanation. His announcement during
 his latest trip that Mexico claimed a 200-mile
 maritime zone had the appearance of another
 hasty presidential decision. Official spokesmen
 later offered assurances that Mexico was not
 claiming a territorial sea, but the unilateral move
 ran counter to the apparent pi,licy in the For-
 eign Secretariat of working in harmony with the
 US on ;natters concerning law of the sea.
 Despite  his  frequent travels abroad,
 Echeverria remains unsophisticated in his world
 views, and his dazzling solutions to international
 issues derive from oversim-lification, if not
 ignorance. In the Middle East, for instance, his
 hopes of playing the role of peacemaker in the
 Arab-Israeli dispute prompted a naive effort to
 arrangs a meeting between Sadat and Rabin, a
 typical instance of his disregard for expert
 advice. While in the area, Echeverria added
 another fillip to his radical foreign policy by
 meeting with Palestine Liberation leader Arafat
 and announcing Mexico's recognition of his
 organization.

 Although he sees the major world problems
 as economic in nature, he does not have a good
 grasp of the subject. As in foreign relations,
 Echeverria appears to rely little on his advisers.
 Under Echeverria, inflation in Mexico has be-
 come a serious problem, the balance of pay-
 ments has deteriorated, and private investment
 has stagnated. Many of his economic decisions
 seem intended for short-run political gain. The
 recent agreements with Vie EC and CEMA may
 eventually benefit the country economically,
 but during their early years their impact will be
 primarily political.
 Echeverria's five-day visit to Cuba this
 week completed his tour. Squired around the
 island by Prime Minister Castro, Echeverria was
 rich in his praise of the Cuban revolution and
 critical of US actions against the Castro regime.
 The two leaders shared their enthusiasm for the
 Latic  American  Economic System, another
 Echeverria brainchild.
 The President's next trip abroad will prob-
 ably be to the UN in October, where he no
 doubt will all but offer himself as a candidate
 for secretary general.r
 URUGUAY: ECONOMIC TENSION
 The  confrontation last week between
 civilian and military officials over economic
 policy-making was settled by an imposed com-
 promise, but the underlying causes remain and
 could resurface at any time.
 The focal point for the continuing dispute
 is the personality and policies of Minister of
 Economy and Finance Alejandro Vegh, who
 advocates a strict austerity program to cope
 with the country's inflation-ridden economy.
 His program is designed to reform the nation's
 cumbersome economic system,  restore its
 credit-worthiness in the eyes of international
 financial institutions, and attract badly needed
 foreign investment.
 Some nationalistic officers such as General
 Gregorio Alvarez, the ambitious commander of
 the Fourth Army, and General Abdon Rai-
 mundez, vice president of the Bank of the
 Republic, disagree with many of Vegh's policies
 and criticize his alleged subservience to the re-
 quirements of international financial institutions
 and his favorable treatment of multinational
 corporations. Most members of the military high
 command tend to agree with Vegh's views but
 not his independent approach to economic
 policy. President Bordaberry, however, sees this
 independence on the part of a civilian cabinet
 member as giving him some maneuverability in
 the rreilitary-dominated government.
 The most recent clash between Vegh and
 the military was triggered by the armed forces'
 attempt to cancel a $110-million loan, secured
 by Uruguay's gold reserves, that he had nego-
 tiated with a consortium of foreign banks. The
 irate cabinet officer submitted his resignation,
 which Bordaberry refused to accept. In a sub-
 sequent acrimonious meeting with the armed
 service chiefs, Vegh demanded that his program
 be implemented without interference and that
 Raimundez and other directors of the bank be
 removed and replaced by persons who had his
 confidence.
 As in previous conflicts between civilian
 and military officials, both sides eventually com-
 promised to avoid a national crisis. Vegh's gold-
 backed loan was approved, and Raimundez re-
 mained in his post, although he apparently was
 told to stop meddling in the economy minister's
 activities.
 Whi?.; this agreement provides some tempo-
 rary stability, the continuing struggle over the
 nation's  economic  policy-making  macFinery
 undermines foreign and domestic confidence in
 Uruguay's long-term economic prospects. Vegh
 may be able to centralize economic decision-
 making within his office for a while, but his
 moves will be closely scrutinized by the military
 high command, and the conflict between civilian
 and military officials over who makes economic
 policy will continue to be a major political irri-

 VENEZUELA: REVERSION PASSES
 On September 2, President Perez will sign
 legislation nationalizing the billion-dollar for-
 eign-owned  petroleum industry. The formal
 transfer of the facilities to state control is to
 take place on December 31.
 The bill's passage through both legislative
 chambers was marked by stormy debate and
 charges that steamroller tactics were used by the
 governing Democratic Actin Party, which com-
 mands a majority in the Congress. All political
 parties agreed that the time had come for Vene-
 zuela to take over and operate for its own
 benefit the country's major extractive industry.
 Nevertheless, sharp differences emerged over
 what role, if any, the foreign petroleum com-
 panies would be permitted after nationalization.
 President Perez insisted on being given maxi-
 mum flexibility to enter into "association agree-
 ments" with the companies if he considered
 them to be in the national interest.
 Although Democratic Action leaders have
 privately criticized the government's handling of
 the oil bill, they gave Perez full backing in the
 several months of intense congressional debate.
 In dealing with his own party as weii as the
 opposition, Perez' hand was strengthened by his
 personal popularity, rising nationalistic senti-
 ment, and the apparent inability of the opposi-
 tion parties to generate public interest in either
 the vulnerable features of the nationalization
 program or the government's failure to specify
 how it intends to run the industry.
 A major reason for the lack of effective
 opposition is the internal dissension that is
 debilitating the major opposition groups. The
 Social Christian party is in the midst of a power
 struggle  between former president  Rafael
 Caldera and left-wing leader Herrera Campins
 for the secretary-generalship of the party, a
 traditional stepping stone to t'i presidential
 nomination. Further left, the Marxist Movement
 to Socialism, which for some time was con-
 sidered a leftist party with real political poten-
 SECRET
 tial in 1978, is having similar problems. The
 dissension, which began in 1974 as largely
 philosophical, has now heen accelerated by the
 personal ambitions of the party's  various
 leaders.
 With the passage of the nationalization bill,
 the government and the companies can be ex-
 pected to get down to serious negotiations. A
 Venezuelan team headed by Mines and Hydro-
 carbons Minister Valentin Hernandez has been
 holding separate talks with representatives of
 the major oil firms since June to consider
 possible post-reversion contract arrangements as
 well as compensation.
 Following President Perez' promulgation of
 the nationalization act, the government, under
 terms of the bill, must submit a formal offer of
 compensation within 45 days. The former con-
 cessionaires must then reply to the ofter within
 15 days. If the petroleum companies do not
 agree to the offer, then article 13-which re-
 quires the Venezuelan Supreme Court to deter-
 mine the amount of compensation-would take
 effect.
 The talks so far have been conducted pri-
 vately, but Venezuelan officials report they are
 going well. This optimistic appraisal appears to
 be supported by some companies' interest in
 supplying technology, transportation, marketing
 outlets, and management, in order to maintain
 access to the oil.
 With approximately 19 foreign oil firms
 operating in Venezuela, the negotiations will
 probably ta1;e some time to complete. The cur-
 rent Venezuelan negotiating strategy is to con-
 cen'rate on reaching a settlement first with, the
 larger t producing companies-Creole (EXXON),
 Mene Grande (GULF), and Shell of Venezuela-
 with .he thought that the others will fall quickly
 in line. Such thioking may be unrealistic-with
 less at stake and not as dependent on Venezue-
 lan petroleum, the smaller concessionaries may
 be tough bargainers. This phase of the talks
 could become acrimonious and lengthy

 CAMBODIA: INTERNATIONAL DEBUT
 In preparation for an international debut in
 Lima and the UN, Phnom Penh's communists
 are bestowing government titles on several of
 their prominent party leaders and are trying to
 resolve the problem of Sihanouk. The new gov-
 ernment has sent .its firs'L official delegation
 abroad since the communist take-over-a short
 visit to Peking and Pyongyang led by Deputy
 Prime Minister Khieu Samphan.
 The four-day visit to China generated a
 spate of mutually laudatory public statements,
 effusive praise of the close relations between the
 two countries, and a joint expression of opposi-
 tion to "h"gemonism," Peking's label for Soviet
 expansionism. The Cambodians were treated to
 talks with Premier Chou En-lai and Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping.
 The signing of an economic and technical
 cooperation agreement highlighted the visit, and
 Samphan referred to it as "unconditional and
 gratis aid." The Cambodian leader also hinted
 that an agreement covering telecommunications
 and civil air service was reached.
 The Cambodians said they agreed with
 Peking on "the current international situation,"
 a probable  indication that the Cambodians
 accept Peking's dark view of Soviet and North
 Vietnamese designs in Southeast Asia-and the
 joint communique refers specifically to the close
 unity between the two sides in the "struggle
 ahead against colonialism,  imperialism,  and
 hegemonism."
 to get directly  involved in determining
 Sihanouk's future role in the new regime.
 The brief announcement from Pyongyang
 revealed at least an interim agreement on the
 Sihanouk issue and indicated that the prince
 would  accompany Khieu Samphan back to
 Phnom Penh, would retain his position as chief
 of state, and will probably continue to perform
 ceremonial duties. There was no indication,
 however, th;it this is a long-term solution.
 Earlier reports have indicated that the prince's
 return to Cambodia could well be temporary
 and that he may soon make another trip abroad.
 In Pyongyang, the prince himself said that he
 will return to North Korea to celebrate the
 anniversary of the Korean Workers' Party in
 October.
 Even before Khieu Samphan's trip to sort
 out the Sihanouk issue, Phnom Penh named two
 more leading in-country communists as deputy
 prime ministers, further erod;ng the position of
 the Prince and his supporters in the government.
 Widely traveled leng Sary, who probably holds a
 top position in the Khmer Communist Party,
 was named deputy prime minister for foreign
 affairs.  Up to now, Foreign Minister Sarin
 Chhak, who has been a Sihanouk loyalist and is
 based in Peking, has handled most foreign con-
 tacts for the new communist regime. Son Seri, a
 member of the central committee of the Khmer
 Communist Party and former chief of staff of
 the Cambodian People's National Liberation
 Armed Forces, is the new deputy prime minister
 for national defense affairs.
 The only apparent problem in the visit was
 what to do with "head of state" Prince
 Sihanouk. The Chinese made a pro forma refer-

 portant, Sihanouk did not return to China to
 meet with the Cambodian leaders. The fact that
 the meetings with Sihanouk took place in

 formal title. Phnom Penh's announcement of

 as defense minister. Son Sen probably has
 primary responsibility for military affairs.
 The communists appear to be retaining
 Penn Nouth for the sake of appearance. He
 played a secondary role in the Cambodian del-
 egation's visit to China but, in a possible show
 of deference to Sihanouk, Penn Nouth was
 listed as the leader of the Cambodian delegation
 in its visit to North Korea, and Khieu Samphan
 was listed as deputy chief.
 LAOS: LIBERATING THE CAPITAL
 After nearly three months of painstak-
 ing preparations, the communists on August
 15 began the "liberation" of Vientiane.
 Their objective is to end the joint commu-
 nist and non-communist control of the ad-
 ministrative capital in Vientiane and the
 royal capital in Luang Prabang that was set
 up in accordance with the 1973 Lao peace
 accords.
 Communist organizers mustered several
 thousand people for rallies in various sec-
 tions of Vientiane and for one rally in Luang
 Prabang on August 18. The participants, ac-
 companied by Pathet Lao troops and cadre,
 followed instructions by shouting slogans
 calling for changes in the local government,
 but in general the crowds seemed unenthusi-
 astic.  Nevertheless,  Radio  Pathet Lao
 quickly announced that the government had
 bowed to the will of the people and had
 replaced corrupt non-communist officials
 with those of proper revolutionary spirit.
 The demonstrations are supposed to be
 followed by a massive rally in downtown
 Vientiane where the crowds will ask the
 government to change the 1973 accords to
 end the city's neutral status. Restrained anti-
 long Sary's prominence in foreign affairs is
 highlighted by his role as deputy in the delega-
 tion to China and as head of the delegation to
 the nonaligned conference to be held in Peru in
 late August. There has been no indication of any
 intention to include Sihanouk in the delegation,
 but Sarin Chhak is the deputy. Attendance at
 the nonaligned conference will mark Cambodia's
 first participation in an international event since
 the communists came to power in mid-April_ __ _ .
 US demonstrations are expected to coincide
 with the final mass rally. Anti-US propa-
 ganda has increased measurably in the past
 several days, with the US being blamed as
 the source of most problems in Laos and
 elsewhere in Indochina. As the process of
 "liberation" progresses, the Communists are
 moving quickly to tighten population con-
 trols. Pathet Lao troops have set up road-
 bloLks throughout the city and are ex-
 amining documentation and searching
 vehicles.
 Communist organizers are reportedly
 claiming they will not use this round of
 demonstrations to alter the arrangements set
 up for the rational coalition in the 1973
 agreements. Many Lao suspect, however,
 that the communists will use the rally iu
 pressure non-communist ministers to resign
 by instigating charges of corruption.

 THAILAND: A NEW LOOK
 Thailand's increasingly tough stance to-
 ward Laos and North Vietnam in recent weeks
 points to a new and more balanced conduct of
 Thai foreign affairs.
 During the past week, Bangkok expelled
 two Lao diplomats in retaliation for the arrest
 of two Thai military attaches in Vientiane and
 was prepared to order an economic boycott if
 the attaches had not been released. The Thai are
 convinced that the release of the attaches was
 prompted as much by their toughness as by
 Vientiane's desire to preserve good relations.
 Bangkok is also convinced that improving
 relations with Peking has helped in dealing with
 Hanoi. In sharp contrast to a desire to accom-
 modate to Hanoi's demands several months ago,
 Bangkok is stiffening its bargaining position and
 appears in no hurry to establish diplomatic rela-
 tions. Foreign Minister Chatchai, who had been
 the most prominent advocate of accommoda-
 tion with the North, recently told Hanoi to
 "mind its own business" in response to a Viet-
 namese broadcast attacking a joint US-Thai
 naval exercise.
 The shift from a precipitate embrace of
 communist neighbors and cooling of relations
 with the US can be attributed in part to Prime
 Minister Khukrit's efforts to put his personal
 stamp on Thai diplomacy. Within the past
 month Khukrit not only has conferred with
 Chinese leaders but has visited Kuala Lumpur,
 Jakarta, Manila, and Singapore, his partners in
 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
 The Prime Minister returned from his
 travels convinced that Thailand should work to
 strengthen ASEAN politically and economically
 as a means of countering communist influence.
 Toward this end, he has encouraged an early
 convening of an ASEAN summit conference and
 the early implementation of proposals for a free
 trade area and joint economic projects.
 While the process of adjusting Thai foreign
 policy to post-Vietnam realities is far from
 complete, the broad outlines of Khukrit's new
 directions are already clear. Foreign policy will
 be neutralist in orientation and anchored to
 efforts to develop balanced relations with the
 great powers as the principal means of assuring
 Thailand's security. in an effort to restrict Viet-
 namese influence in Southeast Asia, the Thai
 will seek to maintain good relations with the
 US, the Soviets, and the Chinese. To prevent
 Thailand from being dragged into great-power
 competition, Bangkok will use ASEAN to try to
 make  the  region a  "zone of  peace and
 neutrality."
 The Thai will also work to strengthen their
 neutralist credentials by becoming more active
 in Third World political and economic causes.
 Bangkok will probably vote more frequently
 with this bloc in forums such as the UN

 UN: SPECIAL SESSION INDICATORS
 The outcome of the meeting of nonaligned
 foreign ministers in Lima next week will be the
 single  most  important factor determining
 whether the 7th Special Session of the UN Gen-
 eral Assembly on development and economic
 cooperation-which opens September 1-can
 avoid another open fight between rich and poor
 states. Representatives of some developing states
 and  many industrialized nations have been
 lobbying against possible efforts by other
 developing states such as Algeria to launch an
 offensive against the developed states in Lima
 that will carry through the special session. The
 radical wing of the developing state group is
 seeking a fundamental realignment of the inter-
 national economic system to one more favorable
 to all developing states.
 Although the radicals remain in firm con-
 trol of the nonaligned movement, their victory
 at Lima-which  appeared  likely earlier this
 year-no longer is a foregone conclusion. They
 have dominated the nonaligned movement since
 before  the Algiers nonaligned summit in
 September 1973 and have increasingly pushed
 the group to set the policy for developing states
 on economic issues. Control over the nonaligned
 by extremists has lessened of late, in part be-
 cause their very success in promoting the move-
 ment has led to more competition for leader-
 ship.
 Those developing countries that oppose the
 Algerian stand meanwhile have had some success
 in moderating the stand of the poor-country
 caucus at several international meetings this
 summer. At last month's session in Geneva of
 the UN Economic and Social Council-which
 was almost exclusively devoted to setting an
 agenda for the 7th Special Session-less extreme
 developing states were instrumental in forging
 an agreement with the industrial states on a
 "neutral" agenda. The ECOSOC session thus
 became the only productive forum so far in
 preparation for the special session. Its con-
 ciliatory tone was sustained at the meeting of
 the Trade Development Board of the United
 Nations Conference on Trade and Development
 last week and in this week's meeting of the third
 preparatory conference for the special session.
 Although the Algerians and their allies did
 not impose their will at the summer meetings,
 they made sure their presence was felt. Algeria
 went out of its way during informal talks with
 several EC states to lecture them about their
 "unsatisfactory" policy with respect to  the
 demands of the developing states. Algeria also
 lashed out at a group of African states that
 challenged Algeria's opposition to singling out
 the need for aid to the poorest developing
 states.
 Negotiations in several other forums will
 also have an impact on the deliberations of the
 special session.
 The International Monetary Fund meets at
 the end of August in Washington. If the indus-
 trialized states settle some of the outstanding
 issues on monetary reform, they may get around
 to establishing a special fund to help developing
 states. Such a decision, immediately preceding
 the special session, would strengthen the influ-
 ence of the less extren ~ developing states; fail-
 ure would strengthen radical arguments for con-
 frontation.
 The Commonwealth finance ministers will
 meet in Guyana on August 26 to consider a
 document which reportedly endorses many of
 the fundamental demands of the developing
 states. Although the genesis of the document
 was a speech by British Prime Minister Wilson in
 Jamaica last spring, the paper, as it is currently
 formulated, goes well beyond Wilson's original
 suggestions. If the UK officially endorses the
 paper, those developing states that seek dialogue
 over confrontation would presumably be heart-
 ened-even though Britain could by such en-
 dorsemnrt cause strains among the developed
 countries.
 Should details on calling another confer-
 ence of oil producers and consumers be settled
 before the special session begins, the less ex-
 treme developing states might also be strength-
 ened in their arguments that prospects for a
 meaningful dialogue with the developed states
 should not be stymied by creating an outright
 clash at the New York session.
