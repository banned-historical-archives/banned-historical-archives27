 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE
 ^ 1540
 The          SPEAKER pro tempore  (Mr.
 CHARLES H. WILSON of California). On
 this rollcall 371 Members have recorded
 their presence by electronic device, a
 quorum.
 Under the rule, further proceedings
 under the call are dispensed with.
 rCONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2479,
 TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I call up
 the conference report on the bill (H.R.
 2479) to help maintain peace, security,
 and stability in the Western Pacific and
 to promote continued extensive, close,
 and friendly relations between the people
 of the United States and the people on
 Taiwan, and ask unanimous consent that
 the statement of the managers be read in
 lieu of the report.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 (For conference report and statement,
 see proceedings of the House of March 24,
 1979.)
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the
 rule, clause 2(c), rule XXVIII, the read-
 ing is not required, and the unanimous-
 consent request is not necessary.
 The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
 ZABLOCKI) will be recognized for 30 min-
 utes, and the gentleman from Michigan
 (Mr. BROOTaFIELD) will be recognized for
 30 minutes.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI).
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield
 myself such time as I may consume.
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, the con-
 ference report before us today on H.R.
 2479, the Taiwan Relations Act, is simi-
 lar in all fundamental respects to the
 bill as it passed the House March 13.
 As Members will recall, the basic pur-
 pose of the legislation which we ap-
 proved, by a vote of 345 to 55, is to es-
 tablish a peace and security framework
 for our interests in the Western Pacific
 and for Taiwan and to continue our
 commercial and other relations with Tai-
 wan following the President's action in
 switching official diplomatic recognition
 from the Taiwan Government to Peking.
 When we went into conference with
 the Senate, we found that the principal
 objectives of their bill were rather simi-
 lar to ours. While there were a number
 of secondary differences, the conferees
 were able to reconcile them in two meet-
 ings over a 24-hour-period. We believe
 we have combined the best features of
 both bills. We think the resulting legis-
 lation is just as strong as the measure
 which the House passed, and in some re-
 spects, better. Therefore, we once again
 urge its passage by an overwhelming
 margin.
 The principal features of .the confer-
 ence report and the resolution of differ=
 ences with the Senate may be outlined
 as follows:
 The Senate bill did not include in its
 title the Taiwan security objective of the
 legislation. The House bill listed this pur-
 pose at the start of its title. The con-
 ferees agreed to do this, and we followed
 this in the title with some phrases from
 the Senate title. Likewise, for a short
 title, we use the House term "Relations"
 rather than "Enabling" which was in the
 Senate bill.
 The first part of the conference report,
 as in the House bill, sets forth U.S. pol-
 icy with regard to peace and security in
 the Western Pacific. The wording in es-
 sence is a melding of the provisions of
 the House and Senate bills which were
 quite similar in both bills. Members will
 note that any use of force against Tai-
 wan will, under the conference report,
 be "of grave concern to the United
 States." It will be our policy to provide
 Taiwan with defense arms. Also, we re-
 tained in essence the House provision
 in behalf of the human rights of the 18
 million people on Taiwan.
 For implementation of the policy
 statement the conference report pro-
 vides that we shall make available to
 Taiwan such arms as are needed for her
 self-defense. The President and the Con-
 gress will determine what these arms
 shall be, judging this solely according
 to Taiwan's needs. The determination
 will be reviewed by U.S. military authori-
 ties. The President is to inform Congress
 promptly of any threat to Taiwan's se-
 curity and any danger to U.S. interests
 therefrom. The U.S. response to any such
 danger is to be determined by the Presi-
 dent and the Congress, in accordance
 with constitutional processes.
 The next section of the conference re-
 port is the key one for continuing and
 promoting commercial and other rela-
 tions with Taiwan on a nongovern-
 mental basis. The conferees agreed in
 effect to accept the broad provisions of
 the House bill and to include also the
 more specific Senate provisions which
 dealt with narrower questions. Thus,
 section 4(a) states broadly yet clearly
 that the laws of the United States shall
 continue to apply with respect to Taiwan
 as if derecognition had not taken place.
 Section 4(b) goes on to cite various spe-
 cifics, such as applying U.S. legal refer-
 ences to "foreign countries" to include
 Taiwan, to continue Taiwan's capacity
 to sue and be sued in U.S. courts, to con-
 tinue Taiwan's rights and obligations,
 and so on.
 All treaties and other international
 agreements between the United States
 and Taiwan are continued in force, in-
 cluding multilateral conventions, except
 H 1741
 for the Mutual Defense Treaty. We ac-,
 cepted a Senate provision which also
 makes clear that nothing in this Act
 may be construed as supporting expul-
 sion of Taiwan from any international
 organization.
 Providing for continued Taiwan own-
 ership of the Embassy property here in
 Washington was not an issue; it was in
 both bills and is in the conference report.
 .Also, we had no difficulty agreeing on a
 compromise reflecting the intent of both
 Houses, which requests the President to
 extend to Taiwan's new instrumentality
 here the same number of offices and per-
 sonnel as previously operated in the
 United States before the breakoff in dip-
 lomatic relations. Likewise, we have
 agreed on language providing for privi-
 leges and immunities for the Taiwan in-
 strumentality personnel here, on a recip-
 rocal basis.
 The conference report also includes
 a provision, taken from the Senate bill,
 which waives the Overseas Private In-
 vestment Corporation (OPIC) $1,000 per
 capita limitation with regard to invest-
 ments on Taiwan. The provision is de-
 signed to stimulate confidence in busi-
 ness investments in Taiwan. However,
 we placed a 3-year limit on the waiver
 to avoid Taiwan's receiving this special
 status indefinitely in view of the pros-
 perity of her economy.
 On providing for a new U.S. nongov-
 ernmental entity to succeed the Ameri-
 can Embassy on Taiwan, the conference
 report provides both for "The American
 Institute on 'T'aiwan" as decienated in
 the Senate bill, and for a Presidential
 option to designate some other nongov-
 ernmental entity, which was in the
 House bill.  As a factual matter, the
 United States and Taiwan have already
 reached an agreement on establishing
 these entities, with the U.S. instrumen-
 tality being named "the American In-
 stitute on Taiwan" and that of Taiwan's
 being called the "Coordination Council
 for North American Affairs."
 On definitions of terms in the legisla-
 tion, the conference report adopts the
 House approach 'in defining "Taiwan,"
 rather than focusing on "People on
 Taiwan," which was the Senate ap-
 proach.
 Finally, we agreed to the Senate pro-
 vision for funding to carry out this act
 in fiscal 1980 and to the House pro-
 vision for congressional oversight, with
 an amendment to include "other appro-
 priate committee" as well as the Foreign
 Affairs and Foreign Relations Commit-
 tees in monitoring the provisions under
 this act.
 In sum, Mr. Speaker, ,I believe the
 conference report to be a strong bill
 which is eminently satisfactory from the
 standpoint of the House.
 It is, of course, an absolutely neces-
 sary bill from the standpoint of the
 interests of the United States. It reflects
 our strong desire for Taiwan's continued
 security and for continuing, without in-
 terruption, our commercial, cultural, and
 other  nondiplomatic  relations  with
 Taiwan.
 The conference report is needed to
 achieve these objectives. I urge its over-
 whelming approval by the House.

 IIt 1742
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield for a question?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Maryland.
 Mr. BAUMAN. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. Speaker, some of us have a strong
 feeling that they do not wish to be a
 party to any legislation that terminates
 our diplomatic recognition of the Repub-
 lic of China on Taiwan. For that reason
 I intend to vote against this. I under-
 stand that this is the-best-we-can-get
 syndrome that is presented in the gentle-
 man's argument. But I do have some con-
 cern about the change in the House pro-
 vision on appropriations in an amend-
 ment that was offered by my colleague,
 the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. AsH-
 BROOK), which required appropriations
 and authorization for all expenditures
 of this Institute conducting the affairs
 between these two nations.
 I understand the other body author-
 ized a provision dealing with such sums.
 But is that for only one fiscal year? And
 what assurances do we have that the
 appropriate congressional committees in
 both Houses of Congress will be able to
 control the fiscal affairs of this Agency
 in the future? Is it an open-ended au-
 thorization?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I can
 assure my colleague, the distinguished
 gentleman from Maryland, that it is not
 an open-ended authorization. As the
 gentleman from Maryland knows, the
 Ashbrook amendment, to which he re-
 ferred, which was adopted in the House,
 stated:
 No agency of the United States Govern-
 ment may pay or otherwise make available to
 the designated entity, by contract or other-
 wise, any funds unless the Congress has ex-
 pressly authorized and apprcpriated those
 funds to be made available to and used by
 the designated entity.
 ^ 1550
 The conference report, in section 16,
 adopted the Senate funding provision.
 This authorizes the appropriation to the
 Secretary of State for fiscal year 1980 to
 carry out provisions of this act. The con-
 ference report, in effect, includes the
 main point of the Ashbrook amend-
 ment, which was to have a specific au-
 thorization. No such authorization was
 needed for fiscal year 1979. Those funds
 as the gentleman will recall, and as the
 the gentleman from Wisconsin was ad-
 vised in committee, have already been
 appropriated to the State Department
 for the American Embassy on Taiwan.
 The State Department has asked the
 Appropriations Committee for a repro-
 graming so the moneys can be used for
 the American Institute in Taiwan, so this
 satisfies the need in 1979.
 For fiscal year 1980 and thereafter we
 anticipate, as indicated in the Statement
 of the Managers, that the funding will,
 as usual, be through the annual funding
 process for the State Department and
 that both-authorizing and appropriating
 committee's will be able to maintain full
 control over this funding as before.
 Mr. BAUMAN. So that each year the
 State Department in its authorization
 and appropriation bill must come before
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE           March 28, 1979
 thi: appropriate committee to justify the
 spending and explain what they have
 done about it before.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. That is correct.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Could the gentleman
 answer one last question? That is, what
 is the attitude of the Communist Chinese
 Government toward this legislation?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I am
 very pleased to advise the gentleman that
 the People's Republic of China is furious,
 is very unhappy, and I think this could
 be very convincing to the gentleman
 from Maryland if he had any concerns
 about the legislation that we had passed.
 I would hope that he would now support
 it, because it is displeasing to the Com-
 munist government.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Have they indicated
 they would break relations with the
 United States over this legislation?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I am in no position
 to advise the gentleman from Maryland
 as to what is the thinking of the Com-
 munist in any country, and especially
 the Communist government in Peking.
 I do not believe they would do that.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, it has
 not met my test, I would say to the
 gentleman.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I will be glad to yield
 to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. I think it should be un-
 derstood, however, that the bill that was
 finally arrived at is consistent with the
 negotiations conducted by the President;
 and it does not embody any government-
 to-government relations. Now, the point
 that the People's Republic of China ob-
 jected to was the question of the security
 provisions; however, those security pro-
 visions would not have been necessary
 had the People's Republic of China re-
 nounced the use of force to accomplish
 their political aims.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, it is not
 too often that I include in my remarks a
 quote from the Washington Post, but I
 intend to ask unanimous consent to in-
 clude in my remarks the editorial of the
 Washington Post of March 27, entitled,
 "Peking Political Education." The edi-
 torial says in part:
 The People's Republic of China has now
 pronounced unacceptable the legislation in
 which the Congress sought to strengthen,
 beyond the administration's  measure,  the
 formal assurances the United States is offer-
 ing Taiwan.
 A bit further, it says:
 Although Peking is upset it does not appear
 to be so upset that it will react rashly, least
 of all, say, by denormalizing.
 I think we have served through our
 committee, and the Congress, a lesson to
 the PRC that the Congress is a very im-
 portant body, and that our Government
 is a government of the executive, the
 legislative, and the judiciary: It is a les-
 son that I hope they will keep in mind.
 (The full text of,editorial follows:)
 I From the Washington Post, Mar. 27, 19791
 PEKING'S POLITICAL EDUCATION
 The People's Republic of China has now
 pronounced "unacceptable" the legislation in
 formal assurances the United States is offer-
 ing Taiwan. Most of the congressional incre-
 ments were a good idea; and it's not such a
 bad idea, either, that Peking has been af-
 forded this occasion to deepen its political
 education.
 The increments do not alter the basic
 framework of normalization, and this is to
 the good. But by tone as much as by word,
 they make explicit a certain caution about
 Chinas' ultimate intentions and a consider-
 able degree of sympathy for Taiwan. In other
 words, they make explicit what we take to be
 the feelings of most Americans. It must have
 come as something of a shock to the Chinese
 to discover that the arrangements they had
 laboriously worked out with the executive
 branch were tampered with by the legisla-
 ture. Welcome to America. "Normalization"
 means not merely regularizing official rela-
 tions but opening up those relations to the
 normal buffeting of the American political
 process.
 Although Peking is upset, it does not ap-
 pear to be so upset that it will react rashly,
 least of all, say, by "denormalizing." Only a
 handful of those congressmen who supported
 the new language could have wished to pro-
 voke that result. American diplomats are
 working overtime to limit the damage. But
 we think it can only strengthen Chinese-
 American relations for the long run for the
 two countries to learn that their political
 systems, and not alone their diplomatic es-
 tablishments, must meet and interact.
 The Chinese are not shy about defining
 their  own  national  interest.  Americans
 should be no less forthcoming. This is by
 way of saying that Peking should consider
 the effect its invasion of Vietnam had on
 congressional consideration of the Taiwan
 legislation. The spectacle of China disregard.
 ing American urgings and sending troops
 across a border into a neighboring country
 surely helped spur Congress to strengthen
 the assurances being offered Taiwan. We
 would even go a step further and suggest
 that that spectacle served as a useful brake
 on any incipient American tendency to re-
 gard normalization as a wholly unmixed
 blessing for the United States in its continu-
 ing attempt to "contain" Soviet power. Nor-
 malization is desirable, we believe. but, like
 any other political act, it carries limits and
 risks. It is better that Americans proceed
 with a knowledge of what the risks are.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I am delighted to
 yield.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Based on the knowledge
 I have gleaned recently about the num-
 bers and quality of the Members who will
 be visiting Red China during the Easter
 recess, I am sure the Red Chinese will
 'have a firsthand chance to learn about
 the quality of almost every Member of
 the House of Representatives before the
 year is out.
 ^ 1555
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, my only
 regret is that the gentleman from Mary-
 land (M
 B
 r.
 AUMAN) is not a member of
 that expeditionary force because if he
 were, he could get some idea of the com-
 position of the PRC and of the differ-
 ences of opinion which we have in this
 legislative body.

 March 28, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-H-HOUSE
 Mr. BAUMAN. The gentleman has not
 made up his mind as yet.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
 serve the balance of my time.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
 yield myself such time as I may consume.
 Mr. Speaker, I endorse the comments
 of  my  distinguished  colleague,  Mr.
 ZABLOCKI, and fully support the confer-
 erence report to H.R. 2479, the Taiwan
 Relations Act. The legislation we have
 before us will better provide for the peace
 and security of the more than 17 million
 people on Taiwan. Moreover, the confer-
 ence report not only contains essential
 provisions of the previously passed House
 bill, but also reflects the congressional
 concerns over many of the deficiencies
 of the administration's original legisla-
 tive request-deficiencies which could
 have been corrected at even an earlier
 date given more informed congressional
 consultation by the administration.
 The conference report takes several
 significant steps beyond the administra-
 tion's original bill. An essential security
 amendment, which I offered, stating that
 any economic boycott or embargo to pre-
 vent Taiwan from engaging in trade with
 other nations would be considered a
 threat to the security of Taiwan-is pre-
 served in the conference report. In par-
 ticular, the conference agreement on our
 declaration of policy toward Taiwan pre-
 serves several important House amend-
 ments including the intent of the Con-
 gress to provide Taiwan with arms of a
 defensive character and to maintain Tai-
 wan's capacity to resist any force or other
 coercion which would jeopardize the
 security, or the social or economic sys-
 tem, of Taiwan. Moreover, the preserva-
 tion and the enhancement of the human
 rights of the Taiwan people, as provided
 by a House amendment, are reaffirmed as
 U.S. objectives in the conference report.
 Still other provisions of the conference
 report protect Taiwan's embassy prop-
 erty, Taiwan's position in any interna-
 tional financial institution or organiza-
 tion, as well as the status of nuclear
 export applications.
 As for congressional oversight concern-
 ing the Taiwan Relations Act, a confer-
 ence substitute was adopted. This sub-
 stitute would allow the House Foreign
 Affairs Committee, as well as other ap-
 propriate committees of the Congress to
 monitor the provisions of the conference
 report on H.R. 2479.
 I believe that the conferees have devel-
 oped legislation which is a significant
 improvement over the administration's
 original request. I believe that the con-
 ference provisions in general and the
 security provisions in particular are vital
 to our continuing commitment to the
 people of Taiwan. I therefore urge my
 colleagues to favorably consider the con-
 ference report to H.R. 2479..
 Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  2  minutes
 to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
 DERWINSKI).
 (Mr. DERWINSKI asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
 in support of the conference report. I
 believe our position has been very accu-
 rately and properly stated by the chair-
 man and the ranking minority member.
 I should add, Mr. Speaker, that, as
 we know, at this point in the discussion
 of a conference report it is standard
 procedure for someone to eulogize the
 chairman and ranking minority Member
 and to commend them for heroic jobs in
 conference vis-a-vis the other body.
 Mr. Speaker, I do not think that is
 necessary in this case. I do not think,
 given the limited problems, that they
 were particularly heroic or brilliant.
 But. they were good.
 However, I do wish to say that the
 House committee staff under the leader-
 ship of our chief of staff, Dr. Brady,
 dazzled the staff of the other body. The
 Members would have been proud of the
 House staffers as they totally outmaneu-
 vered the Senate staff on every point.
 I do commend .this measure. I cer-
 tainly do not approve of the policy and
 decision announced on the 15th of
 December, but this measure makes the
 best of what is a bad situation. Whether
 one is pleased or displeased with this
 policy,  I  commend  support  of this
 measure.
 Mr. Speaker, on March 24, the House
 and Senate met in conference to discuss
 the Senate's amendments to H.R. 2479,
 the Taiwan Relations Act.
 I would like to call attention to one
 amendment approved in conference that
 "states that nothing in this act shall
 contravene U.S. interest in the human
 rights of Taiwan's approximately 18 mil-
 lion inhabitants." This provision makes
 clear the intent of Congress that any
 effort by the People's Republic of China
 (PRC) to impose restrictions on Taiwan
 or encroach on its people would consti-
 tute a violation of the human rights of
 the people on Taiwan.
 A further decision of the conference
 committee was that "the President and
 the Congress are to decide the nature
 and quantity of (defense) arms and serv-
 ices solely according to their judgment
 of Taiwan's needs ? ? *" This provision
 is meant to insure that Taiwan's defense
 needs are determined by its authorities
 and those of the United States without
 regard to the views of the PRC. Any at-
 tempt by the PRC to interfere in this
 process would be completely contrary to
 the interests of the United States.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
 yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
 Ohio (Mr. GUYER).
 Mr. GUYER. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to commend
 the work of the conferees on this confer-
 ence report because, like many others, I
 had a lot of apprehension and a lot of
 reservation about what we might do to
 mend some of the damage. I had ques-
 tions, for example, about whether or not
 the PRC would be a successor govern-
 ment. I had questions about bank de-
 posits. I wondered about existing treaties,
 whether they would be honored, things
 such as the Treaty, of Friendship, Com-
 merce, and Navigation, the Air Transport
 Services Agreement, Atomic Energy Co-
 operation for Civil Uses Act, and many'
 others. The thing that astounded me was
 that when the cavalcade of charm swept
 through our country, it dawned on us at
 ' '1H[ 1749
 dawn's early light that in return for total
 diplomatic relations we really had not
 received very much. We still did not
 have a commitment, a concession, a com-
 promise, a guarantee, or a down pay-
 ment. But someplace along the line we
 do want to do something to see that the
 American image is not tarnished, that
 our reputation for being a reliable ally is
 safeguarded, and that these good people.
 do have a sense of security and well be-
 ing together with our friendship.
 I. agree that this is probably the very
 best assurance that we could put to-
 gether, and while I had very little to do
 with it, I intend to support that because
 of the integrity of the people and the
 final form in which they have brought
 this to the floor. I think internationally
 it is good. It is good to help restore our
 integrity, and I want to commend the
 chairman and those who worked on the
 conference committee.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
 reserve the remainder of my time.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield
 2 minutes to the gentleman from New
 York (Mr. WOLFF).
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the chairman
 for yielding.
 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the
 conference report where I do feel that
 it fulfills the responsibility that has been
 given to us as a Congress in seeing to it
 that we carry out the provisions of the
 agreement that were reached by the
 President and at the same time afford it
 the protection that we want it to, to the
 question of the security of Taiwan it-
 self. Therefore, regardless of the posi-
 tion that has been taken by the PRC in
 indicating that this was creating new
 avenues, the final report that was made
 by the conference committee is in com-
 plete agreement and in complete accord
 with the agreement that was reached by
 the President with the Peoples Republic
 of China. I ask*my colleagues to support
 this report.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. WOLFF. I will be delighted to
 yield-to the gentleman from Florida.
 Mr. KELLY. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Does not the conference report just
 quite clearly establish that the Congress
 joins the administration in recognizing
 that the Government of Taiwan is the
 Communist government in Peking?
 Mr. WOLFF. No, it does not.
 Mr. KELLY. Then why do we not
 recognize the government on Taiwan as
 it exists?
 Mr. WOLFF. Because we have recog-
 nized the-government of Peking and de-
 recognized the Government of Taiwan,
 and that has absolutely no relationship
 to the fact that we recognize Peking's
 authority over Taiwan.
 ^ 1605
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. WOLFF. Yes, I would be delighted
 to yield.
 Mr. KELLY. Is it not the situation
 that the government, Communist gov-
 ernment in Peking has announced as a
 result of action of the United States

 ill-advised, single-handed recognition of
 Red China without first arriving at an
 equitable solution to questions surround-
 ing the future of Taiwan and without
 consulting meaningfully ahead of time
 with the Congress.
 Under our Constitution, the President
 is Chief Executive officer, and speaks and
 acts in various ways on behalf of our
 country in international affairs. However,
 Congress too has its vital and important
 constitutional role to play in foreign af-
 fairs. Regrettably, that role has too often,
 under many recent Presidents, been
 slighted,  undermined,  or  overlooked
 altogether.
 Hopefully, the Taiwan Relations Act
 will serve notice on this and future ad-
 ministrations,  and  encourage                          future
 Congresses, that the national legislature
 should not sit idly by and allow its pre-
 rogatives and place in international pol-
 icy-making to be undercut or ill-served.
 This legislation not only helps insure the
 safe and secure future of Taiwan, but
 hopefully also aids in establishing con-
 crete legislative precedents for stronger
 future congressional involvement in for-
 eign affairs. That important message is
 not set forth word for word in the text
 of this bill, but I hope it is, and will be
 seen, and heeded, nevertheless.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
 join with me in voting to adopt this con-
 ference report-as the best possible way
 left for us to salvage the diplomatic re-
 lations we maintained for so many years
 with the Republic of China, prior to un-
 timely, unwise and premature action
 by the President last December, when he
 formally recognized the People's Repub-
 lic of China, and broke diplomatic rela-
 tions with the Republic of China.
 I might add that this legislation is ap-
 proved and requested by our friends, the
 Government of Taiwan, the only free
 China. Like the Congress under the
 laws of our land, they really have no
 other alternative. But again it is a mean-
 ingful alternative-much better than I
 ever anticipated and I am satisfied much
 better  than the Republic of  China
 (Taiwan) ever expected. A vote for this
 legislation is not, and should not be con-
 strued as support for the action taken by
 the President.

 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. FOUNTAIN. I am glad to yield to
 my distinguished friend and former co-
 ambassador to the United Nations.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you very
 much.
 I wish to associate myself with the
 very fine remarks made by the gentle-
 man from North Carolina (Mr. FoUN-
 TAIN). I think that Mr. FOUNTAIN has
 really given a very excellent analysis of
 this bill. If I draw one conclusion of the
 work we have done here we have demon-
 strated our concern for those people
 who live on the island of Taiwan. I 'just
 wish to compliment you on a very fine
 statement.
 Mr. FOUNTAIN. I thank the gentle-
 man for his contribution.
 (Mr. FOUNTAIN asked'and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 ^ 1615
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
 yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
 Florida (Mr. KELLY).
 (Mr. KELLY asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my
 colleagues in the House to vote against
 the conference report.
 Taiwan is important to the western
 Pacific defenses of the United States.
 The conference report surrenders these
 defenses.
 The platitudes in the conference re-
 port are a sham, which attempt to con-
 ceal the surrender of Taiwan to the Com-
 munists. We, by adopting this confer-
 ence report, are simply implementing the
 surrender of Taiwan which was accom-
 plished by the administration. That is all
 that is being done by this conference re-
 port; we are simply implementing what
 the President has done.
 This does not in any way change the
 proposition that the President has sur-
 rendered the sovereignty of Taiwan to
 the Communist government in Peking.
 There is no government on Taiwan by
 the action of adopting this conference
 report; otherwise we would send an am-
 bassador to our friend of 30 years. We
 send no ambassador because by this ac-
 tion we recognize. no government on Tai-
 wan. There is no government there be-
 cause we have sold it out to the Commu-
 nist regime in Peking, and we do that by
 adopting this conference report.
 The supporters will ultimately argue
 that the Taiwan question is an internal
 affair of the PRC and thus attempt to
 deceive the public.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to
 vote against the conference report.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I
 yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
 Illinois (Mr. MCCLORY).
 (Mr. McCLORY asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, I thank
 the gentleman for yielding this time to
 me.
 Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the
 conferees on the development of the
 conference report presented to, us today
 concerning our Nation's continuing rela-
 tionship with the people of Taiwan.
 Mr. Speaker, while I voted against the
 measure which was passed by this House
 a few weeks ago, I am reassured by lan-
 guage in the conference report with
 which the Members of this House and of
 the other body have agreed. It is my hope
 and expectation that the cultural, social,
 and economic relations between the peo-
 ples of our two nation's may be contin-
 ued-even extended in the years ahead.
 Mr. Speaker, I am also satisfied that
 the conference report.contains assur-
 ances that we will help provide defense
 supplies to our friends in Taiwan-and
 we are pledging ourselves to support Tai-
 wan if it is subjected to any military or
 economic attack.
 Mr. Speaker, it appears that we have-
 under very adverse circumstances-pro-
 vided the maximum of support and
 friendship in the language of this con-
 ference report and I intend to vote for
 its adoption.

 Although I can understand why my
 good friend, the chairman of the commit-
 tee, wants to move this along as expedi-
 tiously as possible. A sinking feeling must
 come over the proponents, a little bit like
 having a bone in your throat or a lump
 in your heart. It is something you want to
 forget about quickly and bury it, hoping
 that all your pious platitudes really have
 some truthful ring in the "future.
 it is bad enough to insult a sovereign
 people-and that is what we are doing-
 but the Republic of China is a sovereign
 nation, not an entity, the Taiwanese or

 floor during  the entire debate  and
 watched how careful the sponsors of this
 legislation were not to refer to a "sover-
 eign people" or a "sovereign country" or
 the Republic of China.
 That is a little bit insulting to them,
 but it is worse to find Members of this
 Congress, Members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives, afraid to call long-time
 friends a sovereign nation. It is bad
 enough that we refer to them as "Tai-
 wanese" or "the people on Taiwan." You
 who advocate this travesty have been
 careful not to refer to them as a nation,
 but how much worse it is when we are
 doing this to a country that has been a
 lifelong friend, a friend extending back
 as far as any of us in this Chamber can
 go back and remember, and our minds'
 run not to the contrary.
 Not so with the people on the main-
 land, not so with the People's Republic
 of China. The Communists repressive and
 inhumane rule makes them no friend.
 Why carry water for them.
 It is also bad enough that the President
 would usurp the authority of the Con-
 gress-and indeed I believe he did, and I
 hope a lawsuit will prove that-but it is
 worse that the Congress rolls over and
 ratifies this action.
 How many times have I heard in the
 last 10 years, particularly during the
 Vietnam war and after the Tonkin reso-
 lution, that the Congress ought to stand
 up to the President? Maybe we do not
 stand up to this President, but at any
 rate this was a good time to do it, and the
 Congress failed to do so.
 It is bad enough that we are accepting
 this act in the way we are, but it is worse
 that I keep hearing people say that it is
 for the Taiwanese, that it is to help them,
 and that we are for them. I hear time and
 time again that they have agreed to this
 shameful ploy.
 That is a little bit like the man who
 sits down in the electric chair and allows
 himself to be electrocuted. We might say
 that because the man sits down in the
 chair and allows himself to be strapped
 in, he goes along with it. Of course, that
 assumes the guards standing there did
 not make any difference. But the spon-
 sors say the Taiwanese people 'have ac-
 cepted this they want this, they urgent-
 ly request 3this, that is why it must be
 done. Foolishness, sheer foolishness we
 know what we are doing, whatever you

 I just want to register that on this day
 in March 1979, I am one who believes
 the majority in Congress is going to do
 an unconscionable thing. They are going
 to turn their backs on their friends;
 worse, because it was a demand, a price
 extacted by an enemy. Yes, I think the
 Government of the People's Republic of
 China is an enemy. You can call them
 friends all you want, but they are the un-
 repentant murderers of millions of peo-
 ple on their own mainland. They have
 never repented. The only way they repent
 is to die. Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai
 never repented. They had to die. I think
 a lot died today, including the dignity
 and the word of this country.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield
 myself 30 seconds, merely to advise my
 dear friend and colleague, the gentleman
 from Ohio (Mr. ASHBROOK), for whom
 I have a high regard and esteem, that
 I do not have a lump in my throat and
 I am not swallowing hard or in any way
 remorseful or concerned about this con-
 ference report. Let me advise the gentle-
 man that I have had an opportunity to
 speak to some of .the people who were
 formerly represented here, who are in-
 terested in the Republic of China, and
 they are pleased with this legislation
 and with this report, and only the PRC
 is unhappy with this report. I submit-
 and I might be in error-that those who
 are voting in opposition to the report
 will really be making the PRC happy
 that they have at least that number of
 Members who they will interpret are
 looking out for their interest.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, the
 sterile record of the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD will not show future generations
 what I would like to record.
 My good friend, the gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI), had to grope,
 had to pause to find a way to refer to
 our former friends of the Republic of
 China, and that in itself shows that there'
 must be some small lump in the throat
 of my good friend.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. No, I was not groping.
 I was speaking slowly for emphasis.
 Mr. Speaker, I move the previous
 question on the conference report.
 The previous question was ordered.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques-
 tion is on the conference report.
 The 'question was taken;  and the
 Speaker pro tempore announced that
 the ayes appeared to have it.
 Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I object
 to the vote on the ground that a quorum
 is not present and make the point of
 order that a quorum is not present.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Evidently
 a quorum is not present.
 The Sergeant at Arms will notify ab-
 sent Members.
 The vote was taken by electronic de-
 -vice, and there were-yeas 339, nays 50,
 answered "present" 5, hot voting 38, as
