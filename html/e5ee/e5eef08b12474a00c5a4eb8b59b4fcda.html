 . The long-delayed conclusion of the Soviet-Chinese
 treaty, which has been awaited since Mao Tse-tung went
 to Moscow two months ago, revealed little that was not
 anticipated. Leaving aside the strong likelihood that the
 treaty contains secret and unpublished provisions, the
 announced agreement gives the USSR; iii effect, three
 years in which to make progress toward translating
 Soviet influence in China into Soviet control (see page 9).
 One immediate result of the. treaty announcement will be
 to strengthen the Stalinist faction of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party in its opposition to the nationalistically-
 inclined Chinese Communists.
 The present concern of the Yugoslav Government
 over its foreign. exchange problem has considerable
 validity. Yugoslav dollar resources have dropped so
 low as to cut off the purchase of certain US raw materials,
 a fact which will result in the serious curtailment of some
 Yugoslav industries unless relief is found (see page 5).
 This situation has been created in large part, however, by
 the way in which the Tito regime has spent its foreign ex-
 change, and recurrent foreign exchange crises can be
 expected unless present policy is modified.
 As relations between India and Pakistan continue
 to be seriously strained, an outbreak of hostilities between
 the two countries remains a distinct possibility (see page 8).
 The focal point of tension is currently centered around
 East Pakistan, where communal rioting broke out last week.
 Meanwhile, UN progress toward settlement of the Kashmir
 dispute still looks unlikely, and the other issues dividing
 the two countries remain unresolved.

 Berlin Economy   The intermittent harassment of Berlin
 traffic by the USSR will achieve much
 of the effect of a genuine blockade without the fanfare and
 drama of the original Soviet effort to cut off that city. In-
 dustrial production in Berlin will be gradually depressed,
 and exports from Berlin to West Germany will diminish
 if Soviet interference with transportation continues. Because
 of the general uncertaihty'regarding: the status of Berlin,;fin-
 ancial interests will become increasingly reluctant to invest
 in commercial or capital enterprises. Irregular and time-
 consuming deliveries of raw materials to Berlin and similar
 difficulties in shipping. finished goods from Berlin to West
 Germany will raise production - costs and threaten to cause
 Berlin products to be "priced out" of the West German
 market. In this situation, for which the German Federal
 Government apparently can see no solution, public confidence
 in the viability of the economy of the former German capital
 will be further reduced. Meanwhile, the USSR is building
 a railway around the outskirts. of Berlin which is scheduled
 for completion by May of 1950. When this railroad is finished,
 traffic between the eastern and western parts of the Soviet
 Zone need no longer cross the western sectors of Berlin.
 Thus, rail traffic in the Soviet Zone of Germany will be in-
 vulnerable to allied economic counteraction in the event of
 further Soviet restrictions on Berlin's transportation outlets
 to West Germany.

 Socialist Policy   Socialist withdrawal from the Bidault
 Cabinet poses no immediate threat to
 the present regime, The Socialists are not yet prepared
 for early general elections and consequently are not likely
 to take any action in Parliament which would precipitate a
 crisis leading to the eventual dissolution of the Assembly
 and hence to new elections. On the other hand, the Socialists
 probably believe that the moment has arrived when being
 outside the Government would place them in a stronger posi-
 tion to appeal to labor and build up their electoral strength.
 The Socialists also consider it all the more opportune to
 withdraw from the Government at this time because the
 Communist Party, by adopting a more militant attitude in
 defense of political objectives, has lessened the attraction
 of the General Confederation of Labor. Moreover, an im-
 provement of the Socialist Party's bargaining position would
 strengthen the appeal of the Force Ouvriere as the labor
 confederations take advantage of the return to collective
 bargaining to launch new membership drives.
 ITALY
 Trade Policy   The increasing orientation of Italian trade
 and commercial policies toward Germany,
 rather than France,is reflected in Italy's opposition to
 .Western European economic arrangements which exclude
 Western Germany. This trend toward a return to prewar
 trade alignments with Germany is encouraged by the com-
 plementary nature of the Italian-German economies... Already
 this trend has made the Franco=Italian Customs Union pro-
 posal a dead issue,and Italy is showing reluctance to participate

 Foreign Exchange  The present concern of Yugoslav
 officials over the country's foreign
 exchange situation., pointed up by disclosures that the 1949
 trade balance shows a greater deficit than expected and by
 statements that the Yugoslav standard of living must decline
 if international loans are not soon forthcoming, reflects the
 genuinely difficult problem with which the Tito regime is
 currently confronted. Despite the substantial progress made
 by Yugoslav agriculture and industry since the war and the'
 fact that current production exceeds prewar levels, the
 standard of living is still below prewar. Because Yugoslav
 dollar resources are now so-low as to prevent the purchase
 of certain raw materials which can at present be bought only
 from the US, certain segments of Yugoslav industry face
 serious curtailment, at least temporarily, if the import pro-
 gram is not promptly carried out. To a considerable degree,
 however, this situation has been created by the way in which
 the Yugoslavs have spent their foreign exchange. By con-
 centrating heavily upon the purchase of -production equipment,
 the Tito regime has found itself short of exchange with which
 to buy raw materials. Moreover, this practice has retarded
 the availability of consumers goods in Yugoslavia, thus slowing
 the improvement in living standards. Without modification of
 this policy, Yugoslavia is certain to face recurrent foreign
 exchange crises.
 Even though Tito's political position in Yugoslavia
 appears to be stronger now than ever before, the contin-
 uing strain put upon the country by Soviet harassment is
 considerable, Yugoslav resources must be diverted to

 YUGOSLAVIA
 the maintenance of sizeable security and military forces,
 and the Yugoslav people must be called upon to make
 incessant efforts to support the Government's industrial
 program. Unless Yugoslavia's economic development
 can, relieve this strain, the Tito regime's stability will
 be adversely affected,
 Strategic Canal   In assigning top priority to the con-
 struction of a canal linking the Danube
 with the Black Sea near Constanta, the USSR is less cone
 ce.rned with economic benefits than it is with the strategic
 advantages derived from establishment of a Soviet naval
 installation midway between Odessa and Istanbul. Although
 other canal projects throughout the Satellite area have much
 more economic usefulness, work on them is n.ot being ex-
 pedited, and all available Rumanian earth-moving equipment
 has been concentrated on the Danube project, The ,canal
 would have only such limited economic benefits as: (1) by-
 passing the mouth of the Danube where silting requires
 continuous dredging; (2) irrigation of undeveloped areas of
 the Dobruja; and (3) shortening the distance from the upper
 Danube to the Black Sea by 125 miles, (The canal will not,
 however, shorter the distance to Odessa, the destination of
 most traffic currently originating from the Danube.) On. the
 other hand, the canal would open Lake Tasaul to Soviet naval
 units as a base from which to patrol both the Danube and the
 Black Sea,

 PALESTINE
 Israeli.-Arab Talks   After negotiating for more than two
 months, Israel and Jordan have still
 to reach agreement on any of the issues which divide them,
 even though attempts to obtain a comprehensive peace settle-
 ment have been tacitly dropped in recent weeks in favor of
 discussions on the Jerusalem issue alone. Although both
 states would like to announce a Jerusalem agreement in
 order to forestall the establishment by the UN of an inter-
 national trusteeship over the city, two issues are blocking
 progress in the talks. The first is Israel's continuing demand
 for sovereignty over a corridor leading to Hebrew University
 on Mt. Scopus--a concession which Jordan is extremely re-
 luctant to grant inasmuch as such a corridor would cut across.
 the only satisfactory road between Jordan and north-central
 Palestine. The second major obstruction in the talks is the
 reluctance of Abdullah's Palestinian Arab advisers to grant
 Israel sovereignty over the Jewish section. of the Old City
 now under Jordan's control, Success in the negotiations
 will, consequently, depend largely on Israel's willingness to
 accept something less than full sovereignty over the Mt.
 Scopus corridor and on King Abdullah's willingness to grant
 concessions unpalatable to his recently acquired and increas-
 ingly influential Palestinian officials, The only factor favoring
 success of the negotiations, and possibly the most important
 in the long run, is the obvious reluctance of both Israel and
 Jordan to break them off,

 Tension.Cbntinues   Relations between India and Pakistan
 continue seriously strained, the focal
 point of tension this time being located in the area in and
 about East Pakistan. During the past week, serious com-
 munal rioting, followed by small-scale migrations of
 minority groups across the border, took place in Calcutta
 (India), Dacca (East Pakistan), and elsewhere.. Although
 the provincial and central governments of both countries
 showed considerable energy in combatting lawlessness,
 feeling among many elements of the. populace remains
 high. Other manifestations of hostility between India and
 Pakistan have subsided somewhat as both sides await the
 outcome of UN consideration of the Kashmir dispute.. UN
 progress toward the settlement of that dispute still appears
 'unlikely, however, and the other matters of contention be -
 tween the two countries remain, equally unsolved. An out-
 break of open hostilities between India and Pakistan therefore
 remains a distinct possibility.

 Sino-Soviet Pact   By concluding an ostensibly benevolent
 treaty with the Chinese Communists, the
 USSR has obtained a three-year period of grace in which to
 tighten its grip on?Communist China. The treaty will at
 once confute the "imperialists" outside China and conciliate
 Internal opposition to the Communist regime. By not im-
 mediately relinquishing control over Dairen, Port Arthur;
 and te Manchurian railways, however, the USSR will main-
 tain control of strategic assets in China, while continuing
 to advance the process by which Soviet;.influence in China
 becomes Soviet control. The USSR can be expected to
 gradually strengthen its grip on the Chinese Communist
 Party apparatus, on. the armed forces, on the secret police,
 and on communications and informational media. One im-
 mediate result of the treaty *1.11 be the strengthening of the
 Stalinist faction of the Chinese Communist Party for action
 against the rather sizeable bloc of nationalistic Chinese
 Communists.
 Unification Trends   Less than two months after the birth
 of the United States of Indonesia, five
 of the sixteen member "states" have voted to surrender their
 powers-to the federal government and a similar move is being
 considered by at least four others. As a result of this trend,
 all of the separate states on Java and all but one on Sumatra
 will be liquidated. The reduction in the number of cumbersome
 administrative structures will have several advantages over
 the federal system conceived at the recent Hague conference.
 The limited number of trained administrators in. Indonesia can

 be more efficiently utilized, and the elimination of numerous
 large and expensive local staffs will lessen the Government's
 financial burden, Moreover, such a system would help elimi-
 nate the rivalries between local administrators, thereby re-
 ducing political instability and fostering a growing sense of
 Indonesian national consciousness.
 US Lives in Danger   Americans in. Shanghai may soon be in
 serious danger as.a result of a Com-
 munist decision to dismantle and disperse the greater part
 of the city's power-generating equipment, a move which may
 lead to increased unemployment and widespread public dis -
 orders. The Communists are apparently taking this drastic
 step in order to safeguard valuable equipment which they can
 neither shield from Nationalist air attack nor replace from
 their own resources. This action will further curtail industrial
 activity and result in. a marked deterioration of economic con-
 ditions, which are already critical., This added dislocation,
 particularly if. coupled with further damaging air raids, may
 be disastrous to the city's population. Communist propaganda
 insists that the Nationalist air attacks have been actively sup-
 ported by the US9 and the rising wrath of Shanghai's distressed
 population might be directed against the city's American com-
 munity, now numbering more than 600. This increased risk
 to the personal safety of Americans in Shanghai may soon
 require accelerated efforts for an emergency evacuation.

 Although Italo-Yugoslav arrangements currently
 being made for informal talks on the Trieste question are
 unlikely to lead. to formal negotiations in the early future,
 conditions for a settlement of this controversial issue have
 improved greatly. during the past year.
 .The principal obstacle to early bilateral agreement
 on Trieste remains the necessity for mutual compromises
 which probably neither Italy nor Yugoslavia can afford to
 make at this time. Yugoslavia, for example, has shown no
 indication that it is willing to give up the major portion of-
 the Free Territory's Yugoslav zone. In fact, during the past
 year, Yugoslavia has moved progressively toward de facto
 incorporation of its zone into Yugoslavia and the forthcoming
 Yugoslav zone elections will probably be used by Tito as
 support for Yugoslav claims to the areas
 On the other hand, the Italian Government is virtually
 committed to support the Tripartite Declaration of 20 March
 1948 calling for the return of the entire Free Territory of
 `Trieste to Italy. Nationalist feeling with regard to Trieste
 is so intense, both in Italy and the Italian zone of Trieste,
 that any agreement now which ceded the major part of the
 Yugoslav zone to Yugoslavia might produce a grave political
 crisis in Italy.
 Although neither government can afford to make sub-
 stantial concessions at this time, both countries, particularly
 Yugoslavia, are increasingly anxious to remove Trieste as an
 obstacle to the development of more friendly relations. As
 Cominform pressure on Yugoslavia increases, Tito has for
 practical reasons become more eager to develop closer ties

 believe that such negotiations would enhance the prestige of
 the Tito regime.
 Meanwhile, in Italy official appreciation is growing
 of the value to Italian security of a Titoist rather, than a
 Cominformist Yugoslavia and, ,correspondingly, of the value
 to Italy of making reasonable concessions to Tito to assist
 him in maintaining his position. The Government may, there-
 fore, increase its efforts to educate the Italian people along
 these lines and create an atmosphere which would permit a
 gradual rapprochement with Yugoslavia on the issue of Trieste.
