 PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS
 The most important function of the General Political Department
 (GPD) is that of ensuring the obedience of the military establishment to
 the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. As part of this, the GPD
 focuses loyalty on the Party's Chairman. In this role, the GPD is
 expected to be of considerable value to the newly elected Chairman,
 Hua Kuo-feng, in consolidating his position.
 The GPD'S Place in the Political Structure
 The GPD is at once a Party and a military organization. It is a
 major component of the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA) and is manned by uniformed military personnel. Yet it is also a
 Party body, functioning primarily on behalf of the Party.
 Organizationally, the GPD is directly subordinate to the powerful
 Military Affairs Committee (MAC), the Politburo's subcommittee for
 military matters. The GPD works for the MAC as its political staff.
 Its principal mission is to insure the PLA's loyalty to and support of
 the Party. To do this, the GPD has been given broad powers in the
 fields of Party organization within the PLA, personnel actions,
 propaganda, education, cultural activities, political loyalty, internal
 security, morale, and military justice. The GPD is also authorized to
 oversee strictly military activities, such as planning, training, oper-
 ations, and logistic support, and to make sure that officers and units
 performing these functions are efficient and are carrying out the Party's
 wishes.
 Its supervision of the PLA's "political work" apparatus gives the
 GPD potent levers of influence over military personnel below its level.
 There is no avenue to success except through Party membership and
 cooperation with the system of Party controls. The system seems to
 work; the bulk of the PLA is responsive to the Party.
 Role in Hua's 'Coup'
 It is not yet known (as of mid-November 1976) what role the GPD
 played in the overnight purge of the four Leftist leaders in early
 October. The most important of the Leftists, Chang Chun-chiao, the

 fourth-ranking Party leader, was also the Director of the GPD. The
 organization appears to have survived the purge of its Director, but an
 investigation into its ties with the purged leaders is probably taking
 place.
 Chang's role in the Cultural Revolution, as well as lack of time,
 prevented Chang from expanding his influence in the PLA. Chang and
 the other Leftist leaders were unpopular with senior military officers,
 and during the year or so that Chang had headed the organization, he
 failed to establish a system of controlling it through a set of longtime
 proteges. Consequently, the GPD's potential for becoming an asset in a
 contest for leadership of the Party was not tested. After Hua succeeded
 in becoming Party Chairman, however, the GPD joined his camp at
 once, and in so doing it no doubt represented the political preferences
 of the bulk of the PLA's top leadership.
 Developments Worth Watching
 Two developments have affected the GPD over the past decade in
 ways that are likely to influence its future performance:
 - The first is the gradual but steady strengthening of the
 organization  since  the  Cultural  Revolution.  During that
 campaign, the GPD was heavily purged and sidelined temporar-
 ily as an important body. Now the GPD appears to have its full
 complement of senior personnel and subdepartments, and it is
 once again issuing directives on its own authority. This trend
 points to further strengthening of its organizational structure
 and a closer alignment between the GPD and conservative
 military interests.
 - The other development has been reflected in the professional
 status and Party rank of GPD directors over the last decade. The
 status of the GPD Director has been elevated in the Party from
 that of an ordinary member of the Central Committee to
 Politburo member to Politburo Standing Committee member; at
 the same time the directorship has migrated out of the military's
 political career channel. Of the last two directors, one was a
 lifelong commander and his successor was a senior Party leader
 with no military experience. At this writing, the GPD has no
 Director; the next incumbent will provide a good indicator of
 the balance of political influence between Chairman Hua and
 senior military leaders. Initially, Hua probably will how to the
 PLA and appoint a professional political officer to head the

 GPD. At some point, however, Hua may want his own man in
 that position and might even name another career Party cadre to
 the job,
 Outlook for the GPD
 The outlook for the GPD-as for the regime as a whole-will
 probably be governed by the balance to be struck between Chairman
 Hua and the military. In compensation for their support of Hua,
 military leaders may press for a larger military budget or a greater
 relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union than Hua and other Party
 leaders would favor. Hua needs to be able to resist unacceptable
 demands, and it thus will be to his long-term interest to strengthen his
 control over the military.
 Even if Chairman Hua quickly asserts his leadership over the PLA,
 he can never he fully confident of the undivided loyalty of his military
 subordinates. He will need the indoctrinating and watch-dog services of
 the GPD, which itself will have to be watched and periodically
 reorganized. Whether Hua will in fact be able to control the military is
 still an open question, but the GPD is likely to play an important part
 in his effort to do so.

 DISCUSSION
 1. INTRODUCTION
 This study is part of a larger effort to advance our
 understanding of the political role played by the
 military in China. The military's political influence
 has again been demonstrated. Surely the Party's new
 Chairman, Hua Kuo-feng, could not have risen to the
 chairmanship of both the Party and its Military
 Affairs Committee (MAC) or have destroyed the
 leaders of the Leftists group* so quickly if he had not
 received strong military support.
 For the moment, the broad interests of the career
 Party and civilian leaders like Hua and the profes-
 sional military leaders appear to parallel each other.
 However, it may not be long before they begin to
 diverge. Hua came to power with the late Chairman
 Mao's strong support but without a broad power base
 of his own. His heavy indebtedness to the military for
 its backing will remain. Yet if he is to consolidate his
 position as the principal leader of China, he must re-
 establish the Party's traditional domination of the
 military. Thus, a period of Party-military tension is
 likely to follow the current season of ebullient good-
 will.
 This study will center on the institutional relation-
 ship between the Party and the military as well as take
 into account the interests of the main actors. The
 paper's thesis is that the relationship between the
 Party and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is
 complex and that the military establishment is
 vulnerable to manipulation by Party leaders as well as
 vice versa.
 The General Political Department (GPD) is the core
 of this relationship for three reasons. First, it is an
 important military institution that bridges the divid-
 ing line between the Party and the PLA. Second, it
 performs important functions in the PLA for the
 Party, especially for the Party Chairman. Among these
 are its duties to focus military loyalty on the Party's
 Chairman and to ferret out opposition to his policies
 in the military establishment. Finally, the GPD could
 also help prevent a military coup-or at least prevent
 large numbers from joining it.
 Thus, the GPD could play a key role in consolidat-
 ing or undermining Chairman Hua's position in the
 period of Party-military tension that seems likely to
 face the PRC, *
 II. THE GPD: LINKING PARTY AND MILITARY
 A. Organizational Relationships
 The GPD is a fusion of Party and military
 organizations. The Party's formal definition of the
 GPD states that it is "the highest leadership organ in
 charge of the Party's ideological and organizational
 work in the whole army."** It is an integral
 component of the national headquarters of the PLA,
 and it is manned by professional military officers. Yet
 it is also a Party body; it functions primarily on behalf
 of the Party, and its responsibility is principally to the
 Party.

 The close linkage between the Party's leading
 bodies-the Politburo, the Secretariat, and the
 MAC-and the GPD was personified until recently in
 Chang Chun-chiao, who was Director of the GPD,
 member of the Politburo Standing Committee, de
 facto Secretary-General (head of the Secretariat), and
 a leading member of the MAC, and in these positions
 was Hua Kuo-feng's principal rival for power.
 The MAC is one of the principal organs of the
 Central Committee and is, in reality, the Politburo's
 subcommittee for military matters. The late Chairman
 Mao headed the MAC for four decades; it is now
 headed by Chairman Hua and includes ranking
 members of the Politburo and many senior military
 leaders (some of whom are also Politburo members).
 The MAC sets military policy, makes all major
 military decisions, and controls the PLA's best combat
 forces. The GPD is described in official documents as
 the "political department of the MAC," the GPD has
 maintained this relationship with the MAC since the
 GPD's origin in 1931.* It implements the MAC's
 political decisions and policies, and it wields the
 MAC's coercive instruments of control-the bodies
 which conduct surveillance of the military, supervise
 its internal Party system, and oversee personnel
 decisions below its own level.
 There are other ties between the GPD and the
 Central Committee (meaning the Politburo). The
 GPD is nominally subordinate and in some way
 responsive to the Central Committee Secretariat,
 which is directly subordinate to the Politburo Stand-
 ing Committee.  Although the exact relationship
 between the GPD and the Secretariat is not known,
 presumably the GPD reports in part to and receives
 some direction from this key Party organization. The
 GPD also assists the Central Committee's "political
 security department"
 In the PLA, the GPD is one of three "general
 departments"-the other two being the General Staff
 Department and the General Logistics Department.
 These three, plus the headquarters of the navy, air

 force, service arms, and senior military schools, make
 up the PRC's national military leadership.
 The GPD's relationship to these components of the
 PLA headquarters-and to the rest of the military
 establishment-is primarily to the Party committees
 and other political organizations, such as the Commu-
 nist Youth League, within these bodies. Throughout
 the PLA, as in the government, each organization is
 governed by a Party committee. GPD instructions and
 orders, for instance, are directed to the Party
 committees below its own level (see Figure 2, p. 7).
 The Party committee structure cascades downward
 from the MAC to the lowest level unit-the infantry
 company or its equivalent. These committees are
 normally headed by the unit's first political officer,
 although there are examples of commanders perform-
 ing that role,* Where the commander is first secretary,
 he presumably passes the GPD's directives to the
 political officer.
 In addition to these Party committees, there are
 "political departments" attached to all military unit
 Party committees-except for the two lowest levels,
 the companies and battalions. These political depart-
 ments are mirror-images of the GPD, assisting their
 respective committees in carrying out routine "politi-
 cal work."** This includes not only political work in
 * Among the 11 Military Region (MR) Party committees, the
 three known first secretaries are  MR Commanders (Canton,
 Wuhan, and Tsinan MRs), and a fourth recently died (Com-
 mander of Fuchou MR). This apparent systematic deviation from
 the principle (at other levels) that the first political officer serves as
 first secretary of the committee could be an indication of a shift of
 power away from political officers to commanders. More likely,
 however, it reflects a successful effort by the PLA to keep the
 leadership of MR Party Committees in military hands.
 The nominal first political officers of these four MRs are civilian
 Party leaders. Senior Party leaders in Peking evidently did not want
 these provincial civilian Party chiefs to head, concurrently, regional
 military Party committees. Such an aggregation of power by local
 civilian leaders may have appeared threatening to central Party
 leaders, as did the former regional Party bureaus that were
 abolished in 1966.
 In these four cases, and probably in others, leadership of the MR
 Party committee has been vested in the MR's highest-ranking
 professional military officer, the commander. (The distinction
 between military and civilian Party leader at the MR level becomes
 blurred, in any case, because all MR commanders are important
 Party figures in their own right: three MR commanders are full

 building activities, and surveillance.

 their own unit, but also supervision of political work
 in their subordinate units two echelons down. For
 example, the political department of a regiment
 exercises supervision of political work in its own
 battalions and also in its battalions' companies. The
 GPD itself is responsible for political work in the two
 echelons below its level-in army and division-level
 combat units and in the Military Region and Military
 District (MD) headquarters, which are essentially
 administrative organizations.
 Some ambiguity exists between the hierarchy of
 Party committees and their political departments. It
 might seem that these two kinds of organizations are
 separate entities and would logically have separate
 chains of command or channels of communication.*
 Recent evidence disputes this picture, however,
 supporting a contrary view that the Party committees
 make up the principal line of military as well as
 political authority and that each of these committees
 acts through its three principal components-its staff,
 political, and logistics departments. The political
 department of each unit is simply the political staff of
 its parent Party committee, just as the GPD is
 essentially the MAC's political work staff. When the
 GPD issues orders, these orders are probably received
 by all military bodies below the general department
 level as though they had been issued by the MAC
 itself. * *
 B. Internal Organization
 The GPD is organized internally into 10 or 11
 subdivisions (see Figure 3, p. 9 for details). Although
 the Propaganda Department normally outranks all
 other departments, the Organization and Security
 departments are probably more influential-and more
 feared.
 * The clearest statement of this view can be found in John
 Gittings, The Role of the Chinese Army (Oxford University Press,
 1967), pp. 107, 108, and 306.
 ** If such were not the case, there would be serious deficiencies in
 the system. For instance, the GPD would have difficulty issuing
 orders to MR Party Committees since the first secretary of these
 committees (whether commander or first political officer) is
 probably a member of the MAC, the GPD's parent body. Thus, the
 GPD would be in the position of trying to supervise MR first
 secretaries who were themselves members of a higher-level
 organization. This would be a virtually impossible situation.
 C. Functions
 The main function of the GPD is to insure Party
 control over the armed forces. To do this, the GPD
 enjoys broad powers: it judges the performance of
 senior officers under its jurisdiction and rewards or
 punishes them; it covertly investigates political atti-
 tudes and isolates PLA members suspected of disloy-
 alty; and it indoctrinates, monitors the impact of its
 indoctrination, and carries out a multitude of morale-
 building activities.
 The GPD's work consists mainly of administration
 and policy implementation. The Party system in the
 PLA is too extensive, however, for the GPD to oversee
 in detail. There are, for example, at least 15,000
 "branch" committees (company level) in the ground
 forces alone.
 According to Central Committee documents, the
 GPD is supposed to draw up plans and regulations,
 review PLA activities to ensure that these plans and
 regulations have been carried out; to carry out its own
 investigations and studies; to identify and publicize
 model individuals and units; to coordinate its
 activities with the other two general departments; and
 to cooperate with the political police of the "political
 security department" of the Central Party apparatus
 and with the Ministry of Public Security.
 a. Career Management
 Probably the greatest power of the GPD lies in its
 supervision of personnel actions and career develop-
 ment. The GPD is under orders from the Central
 Committee to implement the Party's cadre policies
 and procedures throughout the PLA.
 There is little detailed information on how the GPD
 carries out this task. Presumably it formulates general
 policy guidelines and monitors their implementation
 at all levels below the general departments.
 Political departments in units below the GPD hold
 the service records and political dossiers of the
 personnel in their units. These political departments
 periodically evaluate each officer's performance and
 recommend his promotion, demotion, or reassign-
 ment. This recommendation is reviewed by the unit's
 Party committee, which makes decisions on personnel
 matters subject to review by the next higher Party
 committee. Following GPD cadre policy, these politi-

 cal departments also recommend rewards and punish-
 ments. The GPD probably reviews the personnel work
 of the 11 MRs, the three Fleet headquarters, and the
 army-level units of the ground and air forces; the GPD
 may also monitor this work at division- and MD-level.
 Thus, by the time an officer becomes the com-
 mander or first political officer of a regiment or
 squadron (equivalent to the rank of colonel in most
 Western military organizations), he has probably
 come to the attention of the GPD. Its influence is
 probably most direct and crucial for the stratum of
 officers from colonel up through the middle-ranking
 general officer. *
 When an officer is promoted to MR commander or
 first political officer (approximately equal to a three-
 star general in the US system), he probably owes his
 new standing primarily to the MAC and to senior
 leaders of the Party. Even though MR leaders are
 members (or candidate members) of the MAC-and
 thus rank above the GPD-they are still nominally
 subordinate to the PLA's general departments includ-
 ing the GPD and must respond to orders of the general
 departments, taking them as coming from the MAC
 itself. A negative report even on an MR leader from
 the GPD could have an adverse effect on his career.
 Beyond supervision of careers, the GPD has controls
 over other personnel matters. The GPD sets leave
 policy and regulates the care of military dependents.
 It also looks after officers after they retire or are
 transferred out of the military. The PLA's political
 workers try to find suitable employment for ex-PLA
 personnel as well as care for their dependents after
 they die. Each former PLA officer's or enlisted man's
 political dossier is turned over to the receiving civilian
 Party committee when he is transferred out of the
 PLA.
 Another potent instrument of influence is the GPD's
 political investigative force, with a system of informers
 that operates covertly throughout the PLA, with
 power to make arrests. This force is supposed to

 protect the ideological purity of the PLA. Its reports
 and assessments go into each PLA member's dossier
 and either help or hurt his career. For severe cases of
 political or other misbehavior, military prosecutors
 and military courts back up the GPD's political
 security system.
 The GPD also cooperates closely with the Party's
 own "central political security department," and
 Central's agents operate covertly within the military
 (as elsewhere in society), report separately to the Party
 leadership, and probably handle the most serious and
 delicate security cases, where actual disloyalty and
 conspiracy are suspected.
 Beyond the controls that affect individuals-control
 of dossiers and careers, and control through fear of
 political spies-much of the GPD's strength lies in its
 mission to supervise the Party committee structure in
 the PLA. From time to time, the Politburo has
 directed that the Party committee system in the
 military be strengthened. These occasions have pro-
 vided opportunities for the GPD to re-examine the
 composition of the PLA's major Party committees and
 to recommend changes in their makeup. Occasionally,
 the MAC has ordered the GPD to strengthen the
 position of the first political officer and raise the
 priority assigned to political work.
 The position of the first political officer relative to
 the commander is the keystone in the Party's (and the
 GPD's) system of control. From its early days, the
 Party has insisted on a system of dual command in its
 armed forces whereby the commander and the first
 political officer share responsibility and command.
 Although this relationship has always been a source of
 tension, it has worked more smoothly in China than in
 the Soviet Union, where it was eventually modified in
 favor of concentrating authority in the commander.
 The Chinese system is deliberately biased in favor
 of the first political officer. In theory, the Party
 declares that authority in each unit rests with the
 collective leadership of the whole Party committee.
 This is supposed to mean that all members of a unit's
 committee are accountable for the performance of
 their unit. In practice, though, this usually means that
 the first secretary of the committee is the unit's
 dominant officer. According to the Party's own
 regulations, the first secretary is normally the unit's

 first political officer, although occasionally the com-
 mander serves in that role. I'ven when the commander
 is the first secretary, however, the first political officer
 has the right, under certain conditions, to counter-
 mand the commander's orders and even to arrest him
 if he is suspected of counterrevolutionary acts.
 Since the early 1960s, the GPD has been under
 orders to pay special attention to the functioning of
 this system, especially at company level, thus assuring
 continuing GPD evaluation of the Party committee
 and political work system down to the lowest
 organizational level.
 The Party's current charter to the GPD orders it to
 put ideology in first place." This is logical, given the
 Party's conception of the PIA as a Party army. It also
 reflects the extreme difficulties the Party experienced
 in the late I 920s when it began to build its own army.
 Then, when the Party's survival depended on weak
 forces made up largely of illiterates, Party leaders
 feared that if their armed units were wiped out by the
 Nationalists, the Communist cause in China would
 fail. Referring to those days, Chu Te, a founder of the
 Chinese Red Army, once told an American journalist
 that, "We aimed so to train our men that even if only
 one escaped alive he would he able to rise up and lead
 the people.-
 Today, indoctrination is still intense. Much effort is
 spent in focusing loyalty on the Party Chairman, the
 "Central Committee," and the MAC. About one-
 third of the average soldier's time is spent in some
 form of indoctrination or other activity tinder the
 political officer's supervision. About one-third of each

 their Party membership after demobilization, and over
 the years, have come to comprise a sizeable portion of
 the total membership of the Party, probably 20 to 25
 percent. This suggests that the GPD speaks to a
 significant audience not only inside the military, but
 in the civilian sector as well.)

 tion. Officers and men are required to listen to
 lectures; they read and discuss the GPD's national
 newspaper, the Chieh-fang Chun Pao (Liberation
 Army Daily); they criticize their own and each other's
 political errors during periodic group confession and
 "struggle" meetings; and their evenings are often
 spent in watching movies or plays heavily laden with
 political messages. The officer corps is made up almost
 entirely of Party members, most of whom have
 received at least some special training in leading
 political work. Many officers can expect to attend, at
 some point in their careers, one of the GPD's political
 work colleges or institutes. Even if they choose not to
 specialize in political work, PLA officers probably
 receive some formal political instruction in every
 military school that they attend. Ultimately, all
 political training comes under GPD supervision.
 3. Morale-Building
 The political work system also monopolizes morale-
 building activities. Sports activities are organized and
 supervised by political work personnel. All cultural
 events are sponsored by the political work system, and
 unit reading rooms are filled with political reading
 matter to be read under the observation of a
 uniformed political worker.
 The GPD is also interested in the material well-
 being of the troops, although primary responsibility in
 this area rests with the General Logistics Department
 and its subordinate supply systems. The Central
 Committee has instructed the GPD, however, that it
 must assist the logistics organizations in improving the
 welfare of military personnel.
 In addition, the GPD, in coordination with local
 civilian authorities, is supposed to take care of
 disabled and discharged servicemen, their dependents,
 and the dependents of "martyrs." The fact that
 political officers can manipulate the material welfare
 of individual PLA members and their dependents
 gives the GPD and its agents additional levers of
 influence.
 Finally, the GPD works continuously on two
 programs that are utopian in their objectives but give
 the GPD additional bureaucratic stature. Both of
 these programs began during the earliest days of the
 Chinese Communist armed forces, and while neither
 is unique to the PLA, both have been given greater
 emphasis in China than in the USSR or Eastern
 Europe.
 One of these programs aims at fostering "revolu-
 tionary unity"  between officers and men. This
 program seeks to prevent elitism in the officer corps.
 Nearly all visible differences between the uniforms of
 soldiers and officers have been eliminated. For
 instance, all ranks and insignia were abolished in 1965
 as part of this program. Officers are instructed to treat
 their men well. Periodically officers are encouraged
 (and sometimes coerced) to perform manual labor
 alongside enlisted personnel and to eat and bunk with
 them. Finally, officers must attend political meetings
 where their men are encouraged to criticize them.
 Most observers and defectors have commented favor-
 ably on the effectiveness of this program in maintain-
 ing high morale among enlisted personnel.
 The other program aims at maintaining the
 tradition of closeness between the armed forces and
 the civilian masses. According to Party doctrine (based
 on Mao's teachings), the military must be so united
 with the civilian population that, if need be, it could
 move among them like fish swimming in water. This
 unity is sustained by frequent directives to soldiers and
 officers to treat civilians kindly and with respect, and
 by constant coordination between military and local
 civilian Party organizations. Civil-military unity is
 also put into practice. Military units stationed in rural
 areas contribute substantial amounts of labor during
 planting and harvest seasons and also aid some local
 capital construction projects.  Because the PLA's
 enlisted troops are mostly young peasants, these
 occasional tours in the fields are probably welcomed
 as a refreshing change from military routine.
 4. Other Functions
 Finally, the GPD's organizational interests extend
 beyond political work per se. The GPD has a general
 responsibility for ensuring the combat-effectiveness of
 the PLA and for making sure that the Party's "army-
 building line and strategy" are followed. Among other
 things, the GPD is supposed to make sure that military
 as well as political discipline is upheld, that the PLA's
 services and combat arms "always maintain sound
 combat-readiness and high morale for training, and
 raise the military training, tactical, and technical
 levels of the troops."* The GPD has also been
 instructed by the Central Committee to see that the
 logistics service fulfills its tasks and that materiel,
 * Central Committee's "Regulations Concerning Political Work
 in the PLA."

 armaments, finance, transportation, health, and pro-
 duction adequately meet the PLA's needs.
 In wartime, the GPD is responsible for handling
 prisoners of war and for carrying out psychological
 warfare. Political officers performed these tasks in the
 Korean war and in the 1962 border war with India.
 This suggests that the GPD had, and probably still
 has, some intelligence capabilities, at least those
 required for psychological warfare planning and
 operations and for collecting information from prison-
 ers of war. More importantly, in wartime the GPD is
 responsible for making sure that the armed forces
 "adhere consistently to the policies of operation of the
 Party Central Committee and its Military Affairs
 Committee."*
 5. In Sum
 The foregoing survey of the GPD's structure and
 functions indicates that it holds potent levers of
 influence over military personnel below its level.
 There is no avenue to success for the junior and
 middle grade officer except through Party member-
 ship and cooperation with the system of Party
 controls. Virtually all activity is carried on under the
 observation of some form of Party authority. Our best
 information shows that the political system adminis-
 tered by the GPD actually works and that the bulk of
 the military establishment is responsive to the Party.
 III. CURRENT STATUS
 A. As of November 1976
 It is not yet known (as of early November 1976)
 what role the GPD played in the overnight purge of
 Leftist leaders that occurred a few weeks after Mao's
 death. The presence of GPD representatives in a
 `victory' parade in Peking on 21 October 1976 and the
 appearance of the senior GPD Deputy Director at a
 diplomatic reception the next day (22 October)
 indicated that the GPD was still active and that
 Chang Chun-chiao's deputies in the GPD were not
 purged with him. An investigation into the GPD's ties
 with the purged Leftists, however, was probably
 begun and may still be going on.
 The political control apparatus below the GPD
 appears to have been functioning normally since the
 October purge. Up until the purge, it had been
 leading a movement in the PLA to vilify former Vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping who, among other things,
 was Chief of the General Staff when he was purged in
 April 1976. Since Mao's death on 9 September,
 attacks on Teng have diminished and increasing stress
 has been placed on loyalty to the Party, now headed
 by Chairman Hua Kuo-feng.
 B. Whose Political Asset?
 The GPD's role, if any, in Hua's "coup" seems to
 have consisted of withholding its support from its own
 Director, Chang Chun-chiao, the most important
 victim of the purge. The ease with which Chang was
 brought down, however, raises a question about the
 GPD's value as an asset in a political power struggle.
 Obviously, being Director of the GPD did not help
 Chang much. But neither did his other, even more
 potent power-bases, the Secretariat and membership
 on the Standing Committee of the Politburo.*
 Circumstantial evidence, however, provides some
 plausible explanations as to why the GPD was of little
 value to Chang.
 First, after becoming Director in January 1975,
 Chang did not, as far as is known, place any of his
 longtime proteges in the GPD. He thus apparently
 forfeited the advantage of controlling the organiza-
 tion-as the Chinese tend to-through long-tested
 subordinates. Instead, in staffing the organization, he
 relied-or was forced by the MAC to rely-almost
 exclusively on men who had been purged from the
 GPD system during the Cultural Revolution and who
 had since been rehabilitated. For example, confirmed
 reports show that Deputy Director Liang Pi-yeh has
 been in charge of the day-to-day administration of the
 GPD for the past year. Liang, a Deputy Director
 before the Cultural Revolution, was one of the first
 casualties of that campaign and was publicly humil-
 iated by Red Guards on several occasions in 1967. It
 seems doubtful that Liang had much in common with
 Chang Chun-chiao, who looked to the Cultural
 Revolution, and his participation in it, to legitimize
 his own rise to power.
 * Reports agree that the four were arrested either at a Party
 meeting or in their homes by small military/security units.
 ** Besides Liang, three other rehabilitees of the Cultural
 Revolution were named to Deputy Director positions under Chang.
 They were Fu Chung, about 80, who had been a Deputy Director
 from 1954 to 1967; Hsu Li-ching, about 70, who had been a
 Deputy Director from 1964 to 1967; and Huang Yu-kun, in his mid-
 50s, who had been a political officer in the headquarters of the air
 force during the 1960s until he was purged in 1967. Of these three,
 Fu may have retired; he has not appeared since January 1976.

 Second, Chang evidently enjoyed little support
 among the majority of military leaders above the GPD
 level. These men were almost certainly apprehensive
 as to how Chang might use the GPD's political and
 security apparatus against them. They could look for
 protection and support to such figures as Defense
 Minister Yeh Chien-ying, who outranked Chang in
 both the MAC and the Politburo, and Chen Hsi-lien,
 the powerful Commander of the Peking MR on whose
 goodwill Chang depended. Chang reportedly made
 overtures to the military leadership in an effort to
 broaden his support. Indeed, his appointment-or
 acceptance--of experienced professional political offi-
 cers within the GPD was probably a gesture to the
 very PLA leaders who were wary of his association
 with the political Left. These efforts failed to convince
 many senior military leaders that he would be
 responsive to their interests, however,
 In any case Hua apparently preempted Chang,
 moving before the latter had time to expand his
 influence in the military establishment or to exploit
 his position in the GPD. Had Chang remained GPD
 head he might have tried to "radicalize" the PLA
 below the GPD's level and thereby drive a wedge
 between the bulk of the military establishment and its
 generally conservative senior leaders. The prospect of
 Cheng pursuing such a course may have figured in
 Ilua's decision to move against him and his Leftist
 colleagues at the earliest appropriate moment after
 Mao's death.
 After Hua succeeded in becoming Party Chairman,
 the GPD apparently joined his camp immediately. In
 so doing, it was no doubt reflecting a clear preference
 for Hua over Chang, and in this sense was represent-
 ing the political views of the military leadership.
 sensitive work was parceled out to new, ad hoc bodies.
 Although it was never terminated as an organization,
 its existence was not officially acknowledged between
 September 1967 and November 1969. The rebuilding
 process began in late 1969 with the appointment of a
 few senior leaders, but there was little indication of
 activity. Positive reconstruction advanced rapidly only
 after Chang Chun-chiao became Director in January
 1975.
 The GPD now appears to have its full complement
 of senior personnel and subdepartments, although
 some of the latter have not yet been publicly
 identified. Moreover, it now issues directives to the
 PLA on its own authority.
 The process of further strengthening its bureaucratic
 structure will probably resume after the review of its
 involvement with the Leftists has been completed.
 This trend points toward a growing concentration
 on organization and, by implication, on order and
 discipline. This would fit well with the apparent
 conservative bent of senior PLA leaders. While these
 leaders accept the subordination of the PLA to the
 Party, they would probably prefer a GPD that would
 supplement, rather than dominate, their efforts to
 strengthen China's defenses. This, in fact, may be part
 of the price that they will seek for supporting Hua,
 and, if so, it seems to be one that he will have to pay,
 at least initially. If this estimate is correct, we should
 see continued strengthening of the GPD and also see it
 align itself more closely with military concerns.
 The other noteworthy development has been in the
 character of the GPD's directors since the Cultural
 Revolution. Since 1967, their Party rank has moved
 steadily higher and their career profile has departed
 increasingly from that of the political officer corps.
 A. Developments
 Two developments have affected the GPD in ways
 that are likely to influence its future performance.
 1. Strengthening the Organization
 The first is the gradual reconstruction that the GPD
 has undergone since 1969. The Cultural Revolution
 severely damaged the GPD-its Director and all his
 deputies were purged in 1967 and most of the GPD's
 The last Director before the Cultural Revolution,
 Hsiao Hua, a member of the Central Committee, was
 indeed a career political officer. However, the next
 incumbent, Li Te-sheng, was an alternate member of
 the Politburo when named Director in September
 1970; he was a life-long troop commander rather than
 a political officer. He played an important part in the
 downfall of his boss, Defense Minister (and Mao's
 designated heir) Lin Piao, and was rewarded in 1973
 by another promotion, this time to the Politburo's all-

 powerful Standing Committee where he became one
 of five newly-created Vice-Chairmen of the Party.
 The third step in this process occurred when Chang
 Chun-chiao was named in January 1975 to replace Li,
 who declined in favor in 1973 and was demoted in
 1974. Chang, like Li, was a member of the Politburo's
 Standing Committee. But Chang was a civilian whose
 background had been concentrated in the Party
 apparatus, especially in propaganda work.
 Thus, over the past decade, incumbent directors
 moved from an ordinary Central Committee member
 to Politburo member and finally to the Politburo
 Standing Committee. At the same time, the director-
 ship migrated out of the military's political career
 channel: from professional political officer to com-
 mander to civilian. This development provides elo-
 quent evidence of the political sensitivity that
 attached itself to the control of the GPD during Mao's
 declining years.
 This precedent, if continued, could lead to prob-
 lems for the GPD. It could also provide a good
 indicator of the level of Party-military tension.
 At present, Hua is probably so beholden to the
 military that he will accept their recommendation
 regarding candidates to head the GPD. If so, Hua will
 probably name a professional PLA political officer,
 such as the senior deputy director. (Even former GPD
 Director Hsiao Hua cannot be ruled out.) However, at
 some point, Chairman Hua may want his own man in
 that position and might even name another career
 Party cadre to the job.
 B. Outlook
 The outlook for the GPD will be governed by the
 balance to be struck between Chairman Hua and the
 military. Senior military leaders may want a number
 of things that Hua will be reluctant to provide. For
 instance, they may want more autonomy from the
 Party in strictly professional military matters such as
 forming new, less-Maoist military doctrines. They
 may press for a larger military budget or for the
 purchase of more Western technology than Hua and
 other Party leaders desire.
 They may also favor a
 greater degree o relaxation of tension with the Soviet
 Union-having a better sense of China's military
 inferiority-than will civilian leaders.
 It will be in Hua's interest to strengthen his control
 over the military, and he will no doubt seek ways to
 do so, While Hua may be willing to grant the
 military more independence in military affairs, he
 probably will eventually want to get the PLA's
 political apparatus under his own control. The GPD
 would be a valuable asset to Hua in consolidating his
 position in the military and in fending off unreason-
 able demands.
 It is too early to predict how the GPD will fare in
 this potentially fateful tug-of-war. Changes in the
 GPD's relations with the Party, appointments to
 leading posts in the GPD, and its behavior as an
 organization will serve as useful indicators to the
 process.
 Even if Chairman Hua quickly asserts his leader-
 ship over the military, he can never be fully confident
 of the undivided loyalty of his military subordinates.
 He will need the indoctrinating and watch-dog
 services of the GPD, which itself will have to be
 watched and periodically reorganized.
 Whether Hua will in fact be able to control the
 military is still an open question. The GPD is likely,
 however, to play an important part in his effort
 to do so.

 ANNEX
 The beginning, 1931-1935, The current GPD traces
 its lineage to 1931. In January of that year, a group of
 young Chinese Communists who had recently re-
 turned from Moscow seized control of the Party and
 set out immediately to strengthen their control over
 the "soviets" scattered about in mountainous regions
 of central and southern China.  This "returned
 student" faction * organized a "Central Bureau of
 Soviet Areas" and under it, a "Central Revolutionary
 Military Committee" to unify their command over
 the military assets of the "soviets." Under this military
 committee, they created a "General Political Depart-
 ment" to centralize the Party's political work in the
 scattered military units. They named Mao Tse-tung,
 who was at the time the chief political officer of the
 largest component of the Red Army, to be the first
 Director of this new Department. * *
 * The faction included other Party leaders who were not returned
 students. Most important was Chou En-lai. Chou had sponsored
 many of the students for study in Moscow and supported their
 leadership of the Party after they returned in 1930. With the aid of
 their Comintern adviser, they gained control of the Party in 1931
 and held on until their control over military affairs was successfully
 challenged by Mao Tse-tung at the Tsun-i Conference of January
 1935.  During  the  1931-1935 period,  Chou's support of the
 "returned students" was an important element in their power
 because Chou headed the Politburo's Military Affairs Committee
 (MAC). First organized in 1925, the MAC was the Party's principal
 policy and decision-making group for military affairs. Chou, who
 was at the time the Party's most experienced military-political
 leader, headed the MAC from 1926 to January 1935.
 ** There had been one earlier "General Political Department."
 At the "Nanchang Uprising," 1-5 August 1927, a "GPD" was
 organized as part of the Revolutionary Committee that led this
 uprising in Kiangsi province. This GPD faded away a month later
 with the defeat of the Uprising forces in another province. This
 short-lived predecessor of today's GPD was thinly staffed and
 accomplished little during the "southern expedition" that followed
 the collapse of the revolt at Nanchang. In the Party's postmortem of
 the Nanchang Uprising, weaknesses in political organization, in
 Party work among the troops, and in contacts with the civilian
 population were strongly criticized as major causes of the failure of
 the Uprising. Thus, the lessons learned from this defeat had a strong
 influence on the priority that the Party gave thereafter to political
 work in the military.
 Mao headed the GPD for nearly a year. During
 1931, the GPD probably amounted to little more than
 his own staff. Mao used the organization to strengthen
 his own position in the Kiangsi Soviet. The GPD
 carried out land reform in the soviet and organized
 the election of pro-Mao delegates to the First National
 Congress of Chinese Soviets held at Juichin, Kiangsi in
 November 1931. Mao and his supporters dominated
 the "government" established by this Congress.
 This demonstration of how the GPD could be used
 was not lost on the central Party leadership. In order
 to weaken Mao's influence in the military, the
 "returned student" faction removed Mao from his
 GPD post shortly after the First Congress and replaced
 him with one of their own, 25 year-old Politburo
 member Wang Chia-hsiang. *
 The returned student group could now go around
 Mao since they controlled key military positions both
 above and below him even though he was left with his
 title of First Political Officer of the Red Army: Chou
 En-lai headed the MAC to which Mao was subordi-
 nate, and now a "returned student" directed Mao's
 political-military staff. It was only a matter of time
 (less than two years) until the "returned students''
 eased Mao out of his job as First Political Officer and
 thus severely weakened him politically.**
 Thus, in its first struggle between local military
 leadership and central political forces, the GPD was
 used as an instrument to undermine a prominent local
 leader (Mao) and strengthen the position of the
 dominant leadership group.
 The  "returned  students"  moved  quickly  to
 strengthen the GPD and, through it, the Party's
 * Mao was 37 years old at the time.
 ** Mao lost his seat on the MAC in August 1932 and was
 replaced by Chou as First Political Officer of the Red Army in May
 1933. Early in 1933 the "returned students" began a thinly
 disguised mass criticism campaign against Mao's military and
 political line.

 control of the Red Army in Kiangsi. They concen-
 trated on building separate military and civil Party
 organizations and reduced military involvement in
 civilian political affairs. They drew up detailed
 regulations that spelled out for the first time the
 relationship between political officer and commander.
 They increased Party membership among soldiers
 from about one-third (under Mao) to nearly one-half
 of the total force.
 By mid-1934, the GPD was strong enough to carry
 out a "red terror" against commanders who were
 falling back before the Nationalists' Fifth Encircle-
 ment Campaign. Sometime during this period, a
 political security network was organized in the Red
 Army. This network was controlled directly by the
 Central Committee and was not subordinated to the
 GPD; but it coordinated its activities with the GPD,
 and some of its operatives probably used affiliation
 with the GPD for "cover."
 The Long March, 1935-1937. The second Director
 of the GPD, Wang Chia-hsiang, was severely injured
 in late 1934 in a Nationalist bombing raid. His wound
 forced him into semiretirement and opium addiction.
 As a consequence, acting directors or senior deputies
 ran the GPD until Wang finally relinquished the GPD
 directorship in 1950. The first of these was Chou En-
 lai, who was concurrently in charge of the MAC. At
 the famous Tsun-i Conference in January 1935, Chou
 turned the GPD over to the just-ousted Secretary
 General of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),
 "returned student" faction leader Chin Pang-hsien.*
 The Tsun-i Conference became the GPD's second
 experience in power struggle. Faced with defeats in
 Kiangsi that had forced the Party to commence its
 Long March, the conference was essentially a crisis of
 confidence in the Party's leadership. The main targets
 of criticism were the military policy and strategy of
 the "returned students" and their Comintern military
 adviser, Otto Braun, who had virtually taken over
 military command in mid-1934.
 At Tsun-i, the Chinese Red Army commanders
 forced the "returned students" to turn over the
 chairmanship of the MAC to Mao Tse-tung. The
 "returned students" retained, however, the secretary-
 generalship of the Party (its highest office at the time)
 * Chin, also known as Poku, was second only to Wang Ming in
 the "returned student" group and had led the Party since Wang's
 return to Moscow around September 1931.
 and the directorship of the GPD. The GPD evidently
 did nothing to oppose the transfer of the Party's senior
 military post from Chou En-lai to Mao Tse-tung.
 Taking its cue from the leaders of the "returned
 student" group, the GPD acquiesced in the conse-
 quences of the obvious failures of their generalship.
 The "returned students" retained nominal leadership
 of the GPD until about 1938 when Mao transferred
 the acting directorship to Tan Cheng, one of his
 closest followers.
 In the course of the Long March, the GPD suffered
 from the split between the forces led by Chang Kuo-
 tao and those led by Mao. The GPD, along with most
 of the General Staff, accompanied Chang while Mao
 took the staff of the MAC with him to Shensi Province
 in mid-1935. Little is known of the GPD in the period
 in which it was with Chang's Fourth Front Army;
 presumably, what was left of it rejoined Mao after
 Chang's troops suffered crushing defeats in western
 China in 1936. Also, it can be safely assumed that the
 work of the GPD was carried out in Mao's First Front
 Army by the staff of the MAC. After the two leaders'
 armies were reunited in 1936, Mao tended to
 centralize command and control of the Red Army in
 the MAC. One observer noted that in 1937 the GPD
 had become little more than the MAC's political work
 staff. *
 The Anti -Japanese and Civil War, 1937-1950.
 During the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945), however,
 the GPD expanded rapidly.** In addition to its
 regular work in the military, it also was given the task
 of building up base areas behind Japanese lines. The
 GPD absorbed thousands of students who migrated to
 Yenan in the late 1930s and used them as political
 workers in these base areas. After World War II, the
 GPD continued to expand as CCP forces grew during
 the second civil war with the Nationalists. Toward the
 end of the civil war, the GPD was particularly active
 in screening and indoctrinating Nationalists forces
 that had been captured or had surrendered.
 In the brief hiatus between the civil war and the
 Korean war, the GPD vigorously supported the

 ** During this war, while the Nationalist and Communist Parties
 joined forces against Japan, the GPD's name was changed to the
 "Political Department of the Eighth Route Army." Its status and
 functions remained unchanged, however, and after the war it
 resumed its traditional name.

 regime's plans to modernize and reduce the size of the
 military, which since 1948 was called the People's
 Liberation Army (PLA). The plan to cut the size of
 the PLA was shelved with the entry of the PRC into
 the Korean war.
 The Korean War. The Korean conflict brought the
 GPD into modern warfare for the first time and
 presented it with novel problems. The GPD enthusias-
 tically supported the war, organizing recruitment
 campaigns  and establishing  many new military
 schools to train new (or retrain old) officers. But on the
 Korean battlefield, fighting the world's strongest
 army, the PLA's political system tended to break
 down, especially after UN forces heat back the
 Chinese offensives in the spring of 1951. Political
 controls at company and battalion level were espe-
 cially vulnerable, as casualties among experienced and
 thoroughly indoctrinated cadres were heaviest there,
 and replacements were difficult to find. The GPD's
 prestige also may have suffered from the fact that,
 although the Chinese succeeded in pushing the UN
 forces out of most of North Korea, they failed to
 validate Mao's dictum that a weak Communist force
 can defeat a strong "imperalist" army. Part of this
 .failure stemmed from the GPD's lack of success in
 generating guerrilla warfare behind UN lines
 Reaction to the Soviet Model. Another threat to the
 GPD's prestige came from an unexpected quarter.
 Through the early and mid-1950s the PLA accepted
 massive amounts of Soviet arms and training. With
 this aid came a different attitude toward the
 relationship between the Party and the military: the
 Soviets de-emphasized the Party and concentrated
 more on the military mission. Although the Soviets
 had altered the status of the political officer (commis-
 sar) from time to time, in the 1950s they favored the
 "unified command" of professional commanders,
 with political officers serving as deputy commanders.
 This approach was well received in the PLA,
 especially by young commanders who had exper-
 ienced modern warfare in Korea. The Soviet model
 threatened the status of the Chinese political officer,
 and, by extension, the status of the whole Party
 structure in the military, including the GPD. Chinese
 political officers had always been co-equal with
 commanders, at least in principle. The Soviets also put
 less emphasis than the Chinese on close relations with
 the civilian population and on using the military as a
 labor force.
 Adverse reaction to the Soviet model began in 1955
 with the GPD playing a leading role. About this time
 Mao himself began expressing dissatisfaction with
 other features of the Soviet model: its pace seemed too
 slow and its methods too bureaucratic. Mao wanted
 faster economic development, quicker social change,
 and greater reliance on the masses.
 In 1956, the GPD initiated a campaign in the
 military to indirectly criticize the political features of
 the Soviet model and strengthen the Chinese Commu-
 nist political work tradition. Attacks were launched on
 "dogmatism," long a code word for uncritical
 imitation of the Soviets; officers (and later the whole
 army) were ordered to study and to be examined on
 Chinese Party history and theory; Party committees in
 the PLA were reorganized and their leading role
 stressed; and commanders were ordered to revive the
 pre-1949 tradition of close, friendly relations between
 officers and enlisted men. To emphasize the last point,
 the GPD in 1957 began a program of forcing all able-
 bodied officers to serve at least one month per year as
 ordinary soldiers. Political officers were given more
 combat training so that they could work more
 effectively with commanders. All these programs were
 merely an overture, however, to the intensive political
 work that was to saturate the PLA from 1958 to 1964.
 In 1958 a fundamental change occurred in PRC
 military policy. This shift held major implications for
 army-Party relations and for the GPD. Until 1958, the
 Chinese had predicated their defense planning on a
 heavy reliance on the Soviet Union for both arms and
 training and for a nuclear umbrella. In early 1958,
 Chinese negotiators failed to get the substantial
 increases in military aid from the Soviet Union that
 they had hoped for, including help in developing
 nuclear weapons, without accepting Soviet controls
 over the PLA. Consequently, Mao and others took a
 decision in mid-1958 to rely no longer on the Soviet
 Union for military support but, instead, to modernize
 the PLA from China's own resources. This basic shift
 meant running a higher risk of a US and Chinese
 Nationalist invasion until PRC heavy industry and
 technology could meet the PLA's needs. But Mao was
 confident that the risks were acceptable and that
 military autarky could be achieved.
 To rationalize the coming period  of relative
 weakness, Mao insisted that his military concepts be
 revived as the heart of the PLA's military strategy and
 doctrine. This meant a revival of tight Party control

 over the military, a shift in emphasis away from
 modern weapons toward highly-indoctrinated troops,*
 and a reassertion of the tactics of protracted, guerrilla-
 type warfare that the Communists had carried out
 against the Japanese. Although Mao and others knew
 that such an army could not prevent an invasion, they
 were confident that it could eventually defeat any
 likely invader and that the prospect of such a defeat
 would deter any major invasion.
 Substantial debate and controversy accompanied
 this decision. In retrospect, the principal issue
 probably was how best to make up for reduced or
 Terminated Russian aid, and how and at what pace
 he Chinese arms modernization programs should be
 developed. Mao and Lin Piao opted for intensive
 politicization and fast-paced military/industrial
 schemes (as part of the Great Leap Forward). Defense
 Minister Peng Te-huai and GPD Director Tan Cheng
 apparently argued for continued development along
 more conventional lines laid down by the Soviet
 model that stressed military professionalism and a
 dower paced industrial program. Other GPD leaders
 may have favored Mao and Lin's initiative since the
 GPD's role in a Soviet-type system would have been
 diminished.
 The 1958-1959 debate presented the GPD with an
 historic opportunity to act as a spokesman for
 professional military interests. Indeed, some top GPD
 officers may have attempted to do so; the GPD
 director was fired in late 1959 soon after Peng was
 dismissed. But the GPD as a whole conformed with
 Mao and Lin's new approach without a detectable
 murmur.
 Politicization of the PLA. From 1960 to 1964, the
 GPD carried out the most vigorous political campaign
 the PLA had ever experienced. Throughout the
 period, the CCP's polemic against the Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union was forcefully reiterated in
 the PLA. "Dogmatism" came under severe attack,
 and the main focus of both political and military work
 shifted from large units (battalions and regiments, as
 stressed by the Soviets) to the smaller, hundred-man
 companies (long emphasized by Mao). Furthermore,
 The shift in emphasis from weapons to men did not mean that
 Mao denigrated the modernization of the PLA. Indeed, he wanted
 faster modernization than most military leaders at the time believed
 could he achieved from China's own resources But for troop morale
 purposes, the human element was stressed and the power of modern
 weapons-not vet available-was belittled.
 Party committees at all levels were strengthened and
 new GPD regulations on political work were promul-
 gated in 1961 and 1963. These codes emphatically
 stated the primacy of the political chain-of-command
 and the precedence of political work over all other
 activities.* Mao's doctrines were trumpeted as appli-
 cable to every phase of military life and the world
 revolution as a whole. Party membership was ex-
 panded; criticism against many commanders took the
 form of struggle sessions and big-character posters
 (anticipating the Cultural Revolution by at least four
 years); model soldier heroes were created; and an
 evaluation system was devised that periodically
 checked the political fitness of each member and
 every unit of the PLA.
 What had started in 1958 as a necessary re-
 orientation of the military away from Soviet influence
 and toward a more traditional Chinese approach
 gradually shifted toward an emphasis on intensive
 ideological indoctrination and purification. The cam-
 paign was successful in maintaining relatively high
 military morale and discipline during the economic
 crisis of 1960-1961. But the GPD's impulse toward
 political overkill was allowed to run virtually un-
 checked during the early 1960s.
 On balance, the results of the GPD's efforts pleased
 Mao, and they probably played a large part in Mao's
 choice of Lin Piao, rather than Liu Shao-chi, to he his
 successor. By December 1963 the whole nation was
 instructed to follow the PLA's political example and
 imitate its practices and loyalty. Three months later,
 all government and commercial organizations were
 ordered to organize PLA-like political departments
 under their party committees in order to help them
 intensify their political work.
 By 1965, a relaxation in the political atmosphere in
 the military occurred, but the Party did not allow it to
 last long. The officer corps soon came under criticism
 for complacency and arrogance and all ranks and
 insignia were abolished in order to diminish officers'
 tendency toward elitism. But the main political event
 of 1965 was the "debate" over how to defend the PRC
 against a feared expansion of the Vietnam war. The
 Party not only set the terms of this discussion, it also
 made estimates of how the invasion would unfold and
 * The new regulations did not increase the amount of time
 allotted to political training, however. Then, as now, the PIA spent
 about one-third of its time on political training and two-thirds on
 military training.

 it dictated to the PLA how Chinese territory would be
 defended. Professional officers were accused of want-
 ing to put up a conventional defense along China's
 frontiers with the PLA's main forces. The Party, on
 the other hand, stressed using the militia and
 promoted a strategy of drawing the US deep into
 China. In this "debate," the GPD acted as a channel
 for Party instructions to the PLA and evidently made
 little effort to communicate professional military
 advice to the Party. GPD Director Hsiao Hua survived
 while Chief-of-Staff Lo Jui-ching was purged; mean-
 while, the "debate" flagged as the US showed no
 intention of attacking China and preparations for the
 Cultural Revolution began to absorb more and more
 of the GPD's attention.
 The Cultural Revolution. In mid-1964 Mao had
 decided to carry out a political campaign of unprec-
 edented force and scope, designed to remold the Party
 and revolutionize the whole country. After more than
 a year of preparation, the Great Proletarian Cultural
 Revolution got underway in late 1965 (officially in
 May 1966). In mid-1966, the "Cultural Revolution
 Group of the PLA" (PLA/CRG) was set up as a
 special body under the GPD; its first chief was a
 Deputy Director of the GPD.* The PLA/CRG was
 created to assist the Politburo's "Central Cultural
 Revolution Group" in carrying out the Cultural
 Revolution in the military, mobilizing the PLA's
 propaganda assets to support the movement through-
 out the country, and purging PLA officers likely to
 resist the Cultural Revolution as it unfolded.
 About three months after the creation of the PLA/
 CRG, Mme. Mao criticized its head for resisting a
 large-scale purge in the PLA, and Lin Piao dismissed
 him. The early efforts of the GPD to channel and
 soften the Cultural Revolution in the military failed
 almost as soon as they had begun.
 The PLA/CRG was reorganized in January 1967
 and was taken away from the GPD. Its nominal new
 director was a Politburo member and one of the 10
 marshals of the PRC named in 1955.** The new
 PLA/CRG director was to work under the "direct
 leadership of the Military Affairs Committee and the
 Central Cultural Revolution Group," the latter being
 * This was Liu Chih-chien, who was also named the senior
 military representative to the  Politburo's Cultural  Revolution
 Group, organized at about the same time.
 ** This was Hsu Hsiang-chien, a prestigious officer and a
 Politburo member before the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.
 Mme.  Mao's center of operations.  The new
 PLA/CRG director did little, so far as is known.
 This arrangement also soon proved unsatisfactory.
 Before the end of January 1967 the new PLA/CRG
 director came under strong Red Guard attack and was
 dismissed in April. He was accused, among other
 things, of trying to block Mme. Mao's efforts to keep
 control of PLA/CRG activities and of being too much
 under the influence of GPD Director Hsiao Hua.
 Next, the PLA/CRG was removed even farther
 from the GPD. It was placed under the direction of a
 triumvirate consisting of the Minister of Public
 Security, the Chief of the General Staff, and GPD
 Director Hsiao. This group lasted until the dramatic
 Wuhan Incident of August 1967 in which the
 Commander of the Wuhan Military Region (MR)
 appeared to be close to rebellion against the central
 government. As a result of the Wuhan Incident, the
 PLA/CRG was split into two separate bodies, and the
 GPD, along with its Director and all its remaining
 officers, dropped from sight.
 For the remainder of the Cultural Revolution, PLA
 political work was supervised by these two groups: one
 used the PLA as an instrument to carry out the
 Cultural Revolution in the rest of society and the
 other approached the military establishment as a
 target of the Cultural Revolution.*
 Rebuilding the GPD and the Purge of Lin Pao,
 When Lin began to slip from Mao's favor in 1969, one
 of the first things that Mao evidently did was to
 rehabilitate the GPD. Wall posters in the summer of
 1969 began to refer again to the GPD; in November
 1969 a new GPD Deputy Director was named, and by
 about mid-1970 a new director *as in place.** Of the
 first two deputy directors identified in the rebuilt
 * The GPD, however, continued to function even though it
 ceased to act in its own name. By 1969 both these groups came to be
 dominated by two of Lin Piao's chief aides.
 ** Li Te-sheng was officially identified in September 1970 as the
 new Director of the GPD. Before the Cultural Revolution Li had
 been a career commander, rising to lead the 12th Army. During the
 Cultural Revolution Li, one of the few PLA leaders known to be a
 "leftist" activist, was promoted to Party and military chief of
 Anhwei Province. He became an alternate member of the Politburo
 at the 9th Party Congress in April 1969 and by late that year had
 become a member of the MAC. In mid-1970 Li moved from
 Anhwei to Peking and probably became GPD Director at that time
 if not earlier. By late 1970, he was probably named Commander of
 the Peking MR concurrently, in one of the first moves taken to
 remove proteges of Lin Piao.

 GPD, one was a protege of Lin but the other was not.
 The new Director, Li Te-sheng, definitely was not a
 Lin protege, and he probably played a role in
 building the case against Lin.
 One may ask why the GPD did not nip Lin's 1971
 "coup" attempt at an early stage. The answer
 probably is that Mao's plans to purge Lin called for
 building an overwhelming case against him. This took
 time.  Furthermore, since only members of Lin's
 immediate family and personal staff were involved in
 his flight, it could have been that the GPD (or the
 Party's political security force) learned of Lin's flight
 plans too late to act. In any case, the GPD performed
 other functions nearly perfectly, preventing any
 military move against Peking during or after the purge
 of the man who had led the PLA since 1959 and who
 seemed destined to succeed Mao. Again, the GPD
 acted as a tool of Mao and the Party's other civilian
 leaders.
 Rebuilding the bureaucracy of the GPD since the
 fall of Lin Piao has proceeded slowly. Li Te-sheng was
 rewarded for his role in the Lin Piao affair with a
 promotion to membership on the Politburo's Standing
 Committee and one of five Party Vice Chairmanships
 created in 1973. But he apparently soon lost favor
 with Mao and was transferred out of Peking in the
 closing days of 1973. The Director of the GPD during
 1974 is still not known. At the Deputy Director level,
 developments also came slowly. Prior to its disappear-
 ance in August 1967, the GPD had had at least four
 principal Deputies; in the 1969-1975 period, only two
 Deputies were identified.* Only a few subordinate
 officials were identified during this period.
 The GPD Under Chang Chun-chiao. In early
 January 1975, Chang Chun-chiao, another member of
 the Politburo's Standing Committee and a career
 Party cadre, was named Director of the GPD. Chang,
 who later in the month became second-ranking Vice
 Premier of the State Council, thus became one of the
 most powerful men in the PRC.**
 * Tien Wei-hsin and Huang Chih-yung were identified as GPD
 Deputies in late 1969; Huang subsequently disappeared along with
 i.in Piao in late 1971 and his place was taken by Wei Po-ting. Wei
 was not officially identified, however, until mid-1974; he was
 transferred to the Chengtu MR sometime in 1976.
 ** From at least 1973 to October 1976, Chang probably acted as
 Secretary General of the Party and thus general supervisor of the
 Party's vast bureaucracy.
 After Chang became Director, the GPD made a
 gradual but steady comeback. During 1975, four
 experienced political officers were named to Deputy
 Director positions: three were Deputies prior to the
 GPD's suspension in 1967, the fourth had been the
 head of the Air Force's Political Department. By early
 1976, 15 subdepartment leaders and about 20 lower-
 ranking GPD figures had reappeared-nearly all had
 held positions in the pre-1967 GPD.*
 Moreover, the GPD has become more active. It
 promoted Mao's political campaign against former
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and resumed issuing
 major policy statements. In November it issued a
 "circular" to the PLA which directed military to
 participate in the "Learn from Ta-chai" campaign.
 This campaign, aimed primarily at the mechanization
 of agriculture by 1985, is a key part of an ambitious
 plan, endorsed by the Fourth National People's
 Congress in January 1975, to completely modernize
 China's economy and military forces by the year 2000.
 Military support for the "Ta-chai" campaign thus
 takes on strategic implications. Reminiscent of two
 similar directives published during the Great Leap
 Forward in 1959, the current "circular" commits the
 military to provide manpower and material support to
 rural communes "when conditions permit," in addi-
 tion to making the PLA's own farms more efficient
 and reclaiming more waste land for agriculture.
 More recently, the GPD has been active in
 discovering and suppressing opposition to the regime
 that exploded during the Tienanmen Incident (riot) of
 5 April 1976. The GPD's Security Department tried to
 prevent the spread of pro-Teng propaganda in the
 PLA, and the Propaganda Department appeared to be
 keeping the PLA in step with the Party's gradual shift
 toward a more "Leftist" line.
 Since the purge of Chang Chun-chiao, Mme. Mao,
 Wang Hung-wen, and Yao Wen-yuan in October
 1976, the PLA's political apparatus has been working
 vigorously to transfer the loyalty that was once
 directed toward Mao to the new Chairman, Hua Kuo-
 feng. In addition, it is marching in step with the Party
 in attacking the Leftists, including Chang Chun-
 chiao, for, among other things, trying to use the PLA
 to overthrow Hua Kuo-feng.

 Conclusion
 The history of the GPD reflects its importance as an
 arm of the Party. So far as we know, it has faithfully
 executed the Party's policies in the PLA, and it has
 succeeded in keeping the bulk of the military obedient
 * That is the GPD's main job: it cannot be expected to discover
 every potential political security case, and the top-level leaders
 implicated in the Lin Piao affair would have been primarily the
 concern of the political security apparatus, not the GPD, which
 lacked authority over them.

 to the Party even during times of dangerous stress,
 such as the 1958-1959 controversy and the purge of
 Lin Piao in 1971.* The GPD's failure to support
 Chang Chun-chiao seems to be the only instance in
 which it has acted in the interest of the military.
 The record indicates that, until now at least, the
 GPD has been brought under ever-tighter Party
 control and has acted as an effective instrument of
 Party control over the PLA rather than as a lever of
 military influence on the Chinese political system.
