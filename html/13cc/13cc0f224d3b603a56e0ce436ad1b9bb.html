 1.  The essential principle of a celestial satellite is
 its dependence on, and control by, the primary center around
 which it circles,  The general acceptance of this astronomical
 term to describe the captive nations of Eastern Europe which
 have made up the Soviet "Orbit" since World War ?I, as well
 as, their actual behavior for a number of years, had led to the
 widespread assumption that, like their heavenly counterparts,
 their course could but follow that of their primary center,
 the USSR.
 2.  The repercussions in the Satellite states of develop-
 ments in the Soviet Union since the death of Stalin have, how-
 ever, revealed that this analogy is subject to qualifications.
 The "monolithic" Soviet system or bloc has shown itself to be
 composed, not of inert bodies, inexorably obeying the law of
 gravitation, but of living nations, differing considerably in
 national temperament, historic tradition, economic develop
 ment, geopolitical interests, and the capacity of the men in
 power.  Their reactions have therefore varied considerably.
 3.  It is the purpose of this paper to retrace the impact
 of post-Stalin developments in the USSR upon the Communist
 regimes in the Satellite countries, to endeavor to discern the
 reasons why some of the Satellites have docilely followed the
 Moscow line while others have rebelled and even revolted,
 and to draw conclusions as to possible future developments
 in the area.
 4.  The study will be divided into three parts.  Part I
 briefly surveys the background, covering the period from
 the death of Stalin to the 20th Congress.  Part. II will deal
 with developments in each Satellite since the 20th Congress;

 Poland is presented as the first section (A), to be followed
 in the near future by Hungary (Section B); and subsequently
 by the other Satellites.  Part III will be devoted to an analysis
 of the divergences among the Satellites and to an estimate of
 the future of Communism in Eastern Europe.

 FROM THE DEATH OF STALIN
 TO THE 20th PARTY CONGRESS
 The Year 1953
 1,  In 1953, immediately after the death of Stalin, a
 "New Course" was initiated in the USSR and its European
 Satellites.  Under the leadership of GeorgiiMalenkov, the
 New Course sought to correct certain aspects of the Stalinist
 system which had become increasingly oppressive and self-
 defeating in the last years of the dictator.  The main features
 of this reorientation -were a revival of the collective leader-
 ship tenets of Lenin, a renunciation of government by terror,
 a more "liberal" domestic policy and a less aggressive
 approach in foreign affairs.
 2.  In the Satellite countries the principle of collective
 leadership found its application mainly in the relinq .i.shment
 of either the premiership or the first party secretaryship by
 those leaders who were holding both posts.  In Czechoslovakia,
 after Gottwald's. death in March 1953, the new president,
 Zapotocky, no longer occupied the positions of president and
 first party secretary, the latter, going to Novotny.  In Hungary,
 Rakosi gave up the premiership to Imre Nagy.  According to
 Malenkov, as quoted by Nagy in his book on Communism
 (written in the latter part of 1955 and the beginning of 1956),
 Soviet comrades had discussed personnel questions with
 Rakosi in May.  Rakosi was asked whom he "recommended"
 as his deputy, but he objected to every name mentioned.
 He claimed he did not want to be premier himself "but he
 wanted a premier who would have no voice in the making
 of decisions. " However, the Soviet leaders were
 adamant.  Khrushchev declared it undesirable that leadership
 of the Party and the state should be concentrated in the hands

 of one manor even of a few men, and on July 4 it was
 announced that Imre Nagy, "recommended" by Malenkov,
 Molotov and Khrushchev, had been appointed premier.  In
 Albania, Enver Hoxha, the party chief, relinquished the
 cabinet portfolios he had held; in Rumania, on the other hand,
 Gheorghiu-Dej retained the premiership.  With the exception
 of Hungary, where the duality of leadership had serious con-
 sequences, the new principle made little difference, for in
 practice one-man rule continued.  Criticism of higher level
 policies or personalities, although constantly stressed as an
 important element of party democracy, continued to be ruled
 out.  The main effect of the new slogan, was to reduce, for a
 time at least, local "bossism" and to make lower level party
 meetings somewhat more frequent.  However, criticism of
 personal leadership in the abstract served the valuable pur-
 pose of providing scapegoats for the mistakes which had
 admittedly been committed in virtually every field.
 3.  One of the first acts of the new Soviet regime,
 following the traditional. practice of new rulers, was to issue
 an amnesty decree (27 March 1953) which included a promise
 to abate the harshness of the Criminal Code, followed by an
 editorial in Pravda (6 April.) promising that henceforth
 legality and the civil rights of citizens would be respected.
 Amnesties, actual or promised, followed in Rumania (4 April),
 Czechoslovakia (4 May), East Germany (10 June), and in.
 Hungary (4 July), where the promise was coupled, as in the
 USSR, with assurances of a reform in police practices.
 4.  In the USSR economic concessions were officially
 announced on 8 August 1953 by Malenkov, who declared,
 "We must insure a more rapid increase in the material and
 cultural levels of the people, force by every means the. devel-
 opment of our light industry." He admitted that greater
 incentives must be provided for the peasants and that, if the
 Communist regime did not produce greater abundance w'ithin,
 two or three years, it would imperil itself.  The lag in

 Soviet agriculture was, exposed with great frankness. by
 Khrushchev (3 September 1953) who promised corrective
 measures, such as higher prices for agricultural products,
 lower compulsory deliveries, higher wages, etc.  These
 developments, fulfilled the general expectations already
 aroused by the larger than usual price reductions for food
 and consumer goods (31 March), the appearance in stores of
 unrationed wheat flour, and a hope-inspiring article in Pravda
 (11 June).
 5.  The Satellite regimes. had their own special
 reasons for. seeking to allay discontent and to increase
 material incentives for greater production.  Long before the
 seizure of power by the Communists, everybody in East
 Central Europe was. in agreement that the problem of rural
 overpopulation in all those countrie's except Czechoslovakia
 could be solved only by industrialization.  But the only argu-
 ment in favor of the excessive rate of industrialization
 advanced by the puppet regimes was Soviet interest.  Soviet
 propaganda could perhaps succeed in convincing Russian
 Communists as well as non-Communists, at first, that they
 could only defend their country against enemy encirclement
 if they became a great industrial power, and later, after
 World War II, that they should aspire to be the leading
 industrial and political power in the world, an aim well worth
 heavy material sacrifices.  But the first argument was
 obsolete and the second carried little weight in the Satellite
 countries.  None but the most fanatic Communists. could
 possibly be eager to endure privations for the glory of a
 foreign nation.  Worse still, while the Russians derived
 material benefits from their preeminence in the Orbit, the
 Satellites had not only to suffer hardships for their own
 rapid industrialization but also to supply the USSR with
 numerous, commodities, first as reparations or in return
 for their "liberation", and later through the exploitation of
 joint companies and under unfavorable trade agreements, as

 exemplified by the recent revaluation of Polish coal deliveries,
 the agreement to refund transit dues, etc.  Even if these
 agreements had not been unfavorable, the important fact is
 that the people in the Satellite countries were convinced they
 were being ruthlessly exploited by the Russians.
 6.  The Krethli.n leadership, one may assume, was
 well aware of the disaffection among the Satellite peoples and
 authorized their governments to anticipate the formal announce-
 ment of the New Course in the USSR.  The East German Corn-
 muhist leaders, possibly impressed by the serious riots which
 the currency reform had provoked in Czechoslovakia, made
 their announcement on 9-10 June 1953?  The rebellion which
 broke out in the following week seemed to confirm the theory
 that half-hearted concessions are likely to be interpreted as
 .signs of weakness and to backfire.  But it also confirmed the
 suspicion that Moscow was fully prepared, if necessary, to
 support its puppets in the People's Democracies with its
 armed forces o
 7.  The most far-reaching changes took place in
 Hungary, at least on paper, for in practice their implerrienta.-
 tion was to a great extent to be nullified by Rakosi and the
 Party apparatus which he continued to control..  If a some-
 what disproportionate amount of space in the following pages
 is allocated to Hungary, this should find its justification in
 the Hungarian Revolution, in the fact that the revelations con-
 tained in Imre Nagy's apologia have supplied an unusual.
 amount of seemingly authentic inside information on condi-
 tions and developments in Hungary and on Soviet-Hungarian
 relations up to the end of 1955 and in the fact that, with due
 allowance for local variations, these may be considered
 typical of conditions in the Soviet Orbit generally.  "The
 shocking situation /-M 195" writes Nagy, "wa.s described

 who declared that the mistakes and crimes of the four-member

 Party leadership in Hungary, headed by Rakosi, drove the
 country to the verge of catastrophe, shaking the people's
 democratic system in its foundation; unless prompt and
 effective measures had been taken the people would have
 turned against them" and, quoting Khrushchev, "we would
 have been booted out summarily:''.,
 8. `Nagy ' claims that, in violation of Lenin's teaching
 that the people's welfare was the highest law of Communism,
 up to June 1953 the development of industry had been pushed
 beyond all reasonable limits and in Hungary furthest of all,
 although it was the poorest in industrial raw materials of
 all the Satellites    But as a result of inefficiency, antiquated
 techniques and poor management, the goods exported to pay
 for imported raw materials.were sold at a loss, leading to
 progressive impoverishment of the country.  Although heavy
 industrial production had increased 500-700% since 1938 and
 the Rakosi regime had promised a 50% rise in the standard
 of living by 1954, the standard had actually been falling up to
 June 1.953.  Only 58% of the national income was spent for
 consumption, as against a "previous 78-80%'." As a result
 of forced collectivization and the refusal to help individual
 farmers, agricultural production was barely at prewar levels.
 Instead of the "promised abundance of consumer goods, the
 regime had created a scarcity unparalleled since Liberation."'
 9.  With regard to political conditions, Nagy writes
 that Rakosi had "made himself independent of the will and
 opinion of the Party membership and of the decisions of the
 "'Industrial development amounted to 159% in Poland from
 1949 to 1955, to 98% in Czechoslovakia, to 92. 3% in the GDR
 from 1950 to 1955, to 144% in Rumania from 1951 to 1955, to
 120% in Bulgaria from 1949 to 1955, and to 2],Q'% in Hungary
 from 1949 to 1953. "

 Party . . . with dictatorial methods, primarily with the aid
 of the AVH  the Secret Poli_e, which became predominant
 over the Party, forced it to execute its wishes. !' Moreover,
 Rakosi "violated the ethical and moral norms of socialism"
 and as a result "shattered the masses' faith in the Party,
 Nagy provides, however, one excuse for Rakosi in the eco-
 nomic field:
 harmful influences [on our trade were not
 only of an internal kind, there were also external
 forces and factors at play, especially in the field
 of foreign trade agreements . . . A considerable
 part of our foreign trade debts derive from expendi-
 tures and investments for security and defense . . .
 the June 1953 Resolution pointed out there were also
 excesses in this field. "
 In another chapter, on national defense, Nagy speaks of
 "Rakosi, who, as he used to say, had already burnt his hands
 once by fulfilling excessive demands. !' Thus the conclusion
 is obvious that Soviet pressure had obliged Rakosi to accept
 this heavy burden on the Hungarian economy.
 10.  This did not prevent Mikoyan from rebuking the
 Hungarians who had been summoned to Moscow for a "con-
 ference " in June 1953, presumably after disorders had
 broken out in Csepel and other industrial centers "at the time
 of the June events in Berlin, Pilsen and Prague", as Nagy
 puts it.   Mikoyan particularly criticized the "excessive
 development of the El3ungaria   iron smelting industry.
 Hungary has no iron ore, no coke . . . There is also extrava-
 gance in some fields of investment'.." Anticipating somewhat,
 it may be added here that, according to Nagy, these criticisms
 were repeated by Mikoyan early in 1954, when he blamed the
 Hungarian regime for having failed to correct the disproportion
 between heavy and light industry sufficiently.  "You have
 wanted to build socialism - a task that has occupied us for 35
 years - too rapidly.  The situation in Russia is entirely
 different . . .  "

 11.  In the agricultural field, the Soviet leaders also
 advised a retreat.
 f'When", Nagy writes, "we expressed some anxiety,
 Comrade Molotov (and not Beria) reassured us as
 follows-   The collectives must not be disbanded by
 fiat but, if they choose to disband voluntarily, they
 should not be hindered.  No harm will come of it."t
 12.  The Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers'
 Party met in Budapest on 27-28 June.  The post of general
 secretary was abolished, Rakosi was appointed a member of
 a three-man secretariat and a resolution was passed embody-
 ing a severe condemnation of past practices and setting forth
 the main principles of the New Course.  Publication of the
 text of the resolution was, however, successfully prevented
 by Rako:si, who was to devote all his energies for the next
 two years to its nullification and to the destruction of Nagy'
 but its main lines can be inferred from Nagy's book and from
 the speech he made on 4 July.
 13.  In the first place, Nagy writes, the relations
 between Party and state were redefined "on the basis of the
 principles worked out at the Qune 19    Moscow conference's'"
 He does not make clear what the new relationship was to be,
 beyond the fact that the powers of the head of the government
 were to be considerably increased - in line with the increased
 stature of Malenkov in the USSR.  But, Nagy writes., "the
 results achieved were soon defeated, because of the resistance
 on the part of Matyas Rakosi"    in line again with the rise of
 Khrushchev at Malenkov's expense.
 14.  With, regard to economic problems, Nagy stated
 frankly in a speech on 4 July that
 "o . . the objectives of our augmented Five-Year
 Plan are beyond our strength.  Its implementation
 is vastly overtaxing our resources . o . The develop-

 ment of a socialist heavy industry cannot be an. end.
 in itself   . . The general direction must be
 modified. "
 The new policy, Nagy said, would reduce the emphasis on
 farm collectivization as well as on heavy industry, members
 of collectives being allowed to withdraw after the harvest.
 It would provide greater assistance to private farmers and
 allow the restoration of private enterprise in retail trade and
 handicrafts.  Amnesty for minor political. offenders, the
 abolition of internment camps, greater religious tolerance
 and greater reliance on Parliament were also promised.
 15.  Under the impact of the immediate breakdown of
 labor discipline and withdrawals of collective farm members,
 Nagy and, much more sharply, Rakosi, were, however,
 obliged to warn the workers a week later that labor discipline
 had to be restored, that farm collectivization was still the
 ultimate aim and that withdrawals from collectives would. not
 be tolerated now, nor would they be entirely painless even in
 October.
 16.  The Rumanian government began releasing stocks
 of food in the cities and granting a number of easements to the
 peasants in the first half of July.  The New Course was formally
 launched by Gheorghiu-Dej on 22 August 1953, Ithe eve of
 "National Liberation Day; ""   He admitted that the proportion
 between the investment and consumption funds had been "un-
 just" and that "the rate of industrialization had been forced,
 especially as regards heavy industry", the result having been
 "an unsatisfactory increase in the living standard'.." He prom-
 ised to reduce the share of the national income allocated to
 investments and to double the share allocated to agriculture
 and consumer goods.  At the same time, Gh.eorghiu-Dej prom-
 ised more state help to private farmers, who still, produced
 75% of the marketable food surplus, as well as an end to the
 persecution of kulaks and to coercion to join collective farms.

 For the. workers he promised higher buying power but he
 conceded this, could only come as a result of higher labor
 productivity and lower production costs.
 17.  The Czechoslovak New Course was announced on
 15 September 1953.  Premier Siroky promised to reduce
 investments in industry, chiefly heavy industry, in favor of
 agriculture and housing and admitted the need of "an increase
 in consumption and the safeguarding of improved living
 standards: '.r
 18.  In Bulgaria the New Course, foreshadowed by a
 reduction in food and consumer goods prices on 1 August
 1953, was formally introduced by Prime Minister Chervenkov
 on 8 September, the Bulgarian. "Liberation: Day.Y He, too,
 promised greater stress on consumer goods and considerable
 help to agricultural collectives.  Two months later this
 announcement was amended to include individual peasants.
 19.  The Poles apparently decided that their delay in
 following the Moscow line was sufficient to set them apart
 from the commonplace Satellites, especially after having
 deliberately flouted the liberalization policy by the trial of
 Bishop Kaczmarek and his associates and the arrest of
 Cardinal Wyszynski on 26 September 1953; Premier Bierut
 launched the "New Course" on 28 October 1953.  Its main
 features were the usual ones of encouragement for agricul-
 tural production, both in the private and in the socialized
 sector - which was. to: be strengthened - and the allocation of
 a larger slice of the investment fund, which was not to be
 reduced, to consumer goods industries.  Characteristically
 dissociating themselves from the Satellite mass, the Polish
 leaders were careful to point out that "a rise in the living
 standard . . . was made possible. . . by our achievements
 in the expansion of industry,.!'
 20.  In Albania, Enver Hoxha promised a higher
 standard of living in August 1953.

 21.  The remaining months of the year were mainly
 devoted in the Soviet Bloc to implementation of the New Course
 economic principles.  East Germany reduced taxes on wages
 and consumer goods prices; Poland also reduced prices;
 Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria took steps. to encourage pro-
 duction, chiefly of livestock, by decreeing higher prices for
 farm produce; Hungary and Bulgaria liberalized labor laws,
 granting greater freedom to workers to change jobs and other
 advantages; Rumania reduced taxes on wages by 30%, revised
 the wages of some categories of workers and took steps to
 make more consumer goods available to the peasants; Albania
 and Czechoslovakia made concessions to small private traders.
 and artisans; and all Satellites reduced in varying degrees the
 compulsory delivery quotas of farm produce.
 22.  A fact worthy of note is that in the summer of
 1953 a number of grandiose plans demanding huge investments,
 such as the Budapest subway, the Danube-Black Sea Canal, etc.
 were tacitly abandoned.  The promised higher ratio of invest-
 ment in consumer goods appears to have been achieved mainly
 by cutting down on unnecessary prestige investment.  More-
 over, Communist spokesmen as exemplified by Gheorghiu-Dej
 admitted frankly that, in the last analysis, the standard of liv-
 ing could rise only if prices could be reduced as a result of
 increased labor productivity.  The alternative possibility,
 granting at least temporary priority to consumer goods, was
 not mentioned publicly. 1 Under the circumstances, a vicious
 circle was created; increased productivity could only be
 attained if the workers were offered greater material, in.cen-
 tives, but these would only become available if labor produc-
 tivity rose..  What the governments obviously counted on. to
 break the circle was constant hammering on the themes of

 greater labor and management efficiency, better use of
 modern machinery, more intelligent planning, and more
 "scientific" piece-work rates, as well as on the fruits of
 previous, investments.  Bierut and Siroky even promised
 15% increases in the 1954 standard. of living.
 23.  In the field of foreign affairs all Satellite govern-
 ments had, by the end of the year, normalized their, diplon- tic
 relations with. Yugoslavia.  They exchanged, or agreed to
 exchange, ambassaadorg, or, in the case of Albania, proceeded
 to resume diplomatic relations.  Between Yugoslavia and her
 neighbors, negotiations were .lso begun for resumption of
 traffic and trade and settlement of border problems; mutual
 hostile propaganda practically ceased.
 The Year 1954
 24.  In the USSR, the most notable event of 1954 was
 Khrushchev's gradual rise to the position of "most collective"
 among the collective leaders.  Meanwhile, "liberalization"
 made little progress.  It is true that the power of the Soviet
 police was reduced by dividing its, authority and making it
 responsible to the Council of Ministers as a whole.  But the
 change was undoubtedly motivated less by solicitude for the
 masses than by the leadership's collective opposition to the
 concentration of all police powers in one man's hands, as
 they had been in those of the recently executed Beria.  More-
 over, the press continued to mention periodically the duty of
 the police to respect "socialist legality" and the duty of the
 Party to keep an eye on the police.
 25.  In the economic sphere, February and March
 1954 witnessed fresh promises to increase the availability
 of housing and consumer goods, particularly food.  But both
 Khrushchev and Malenkov warmed that attention to the further

 development of heavy industry,  "the foundation of Soviet
 economy", would not be "relaxed"; rather it would be developed
 by every means e ."' The chief satisfaction given the consumers
 was the reaffirmation by Party Secretary Pospelov of the 1953
 promise to increase capital investment in light industry in 1954
 by 84%.  But the final. figures for 1954 showed that not even the
 revised production goals set in 1953 had been attained in such
 branches as meat, fish, canned goods, cotton textiles, etc.
 As a matter of fact, by that time it was clear that increased
 "emphasis" on consumer goods had not meant, as many people
 had thought, that they would be given priority over the produc-
 tion industry, the basis of Communist power, but merely that
 the disproportion between the two would be somewhat reduced.
 In the meantime, the agricultural development of the "virgin
 lands" was being vigorously pushed by Khrushchev.  As a pre-
 caution, however, additional incentives were given to farmers
 in June 1954 in the form of reduced delivery quotas for kol -
 khozes, higher prices for state purchases, and the cancella-
 tion of some obligatory deliveries from individual plots.
 26.  Political events in the Satellite countries in 1954
 were practically routine.  In Bulgaria, the ostensible aim of
 power decentralization was pursued by the creation, in Feb-
 ruary 1954, of the post of first party secretary, occuped by
 Todor Zhivkov.  In the following month, Boleslaw Bierut
 relinquished the Polish premiership to the former Social
 Democrat, Jozef Cy:rankiewi.cz, but remained as first party
 secretary.  In April, Gheorghiu-Dej surrendered one of his
 positions in Rumania; he decided to keep the premiership.
 Apparently there was at that time no agreement in the Satel-
 lite Orbit as to whether Malenkov or Khrushchev was the top
 man in the USSR, although, if they had waited until. May the
 fate of a dispatch setit to the New York Times by its Moscow
 correspondent would have provided an unmistakeable clue to
 the impending solution.  This dispatch, which included a
 statement that in a Communist country "the first secretaryship
 of the Communist Party is the biggest job in that ccou.ntry",

 was, first "killed" by the Moscow censors, then released
 unchanged two days later.  Accordingly, in Albania, when
 Enver Hoxha had finally to choose, he kept the first party
 secretaryship and let Mehmet Shehu have the premiership
 (July 1954).
 27.  The more "civilized" aspect of the New Course
 was presumably reflected in the circumstance that, following
 the Soviet example in the case of Beria, trials of party
 traitors. and deviators were no longer held in public and accom-
 panied by abject confessions of guilt.  However, in March,
 Gabor Peter, head of the Hungarian Security Police up to
 January 1953, was given a life sentence "for crimes against
 the state:'.'  In April, Lucretiu Patrascanu, one of the earliest
 and ablest Rumanian Communist leaders, who had been ejected
 from the government in 1948 on the charges of "nationalist
 deviationism" and of having been in the pay of the US, the on31r
 man in Rumania who might have played the role of a Gomulka
 or Imre Nagy, was tried and executed and six of his associates
 were sentenced to long terms. of imprisonment.  In Czecho-
 slovakia several Slovak Communist leaders received long
 prison terms.  In Albania eight men were executed in April
 on the charge of plotting a revolt.
 28.  It is difficult to understand why the Rumanian
 Communists thought fit to mar the comparatively better
 record they (and the Polish Communists) had had so far in
 the matter of bloody intra-Party purges, by the execution. of
 Patrascanu six years after his, alleged crime.  One hesitates
 to credit Gheorghiu-Dej with sufficient farsightedness to have
 planned to forestall the occurrence of a Rumanian October.
 It may well be, however, that Gheorghiu.-Dej had good reasons.
 to nip in the bud growing subversive tendencies by proving
 that he was not too "soft" to deal with them as the Czechs had
 with Slansky, the Bulgarians. with Kostov, and the Hungarians
 with Rajk.

 29.  Presumably satisfied that the Patrascanu lesson
 had sunk in, the Rumanian Party leadership in August
 announced another amnesty which included minor political
 offenders.  It was content to sentence former Finance Minister
 Vasile Luca - purged together with Ana Pauker and Teohari
 Georgescu in 1952 ,- to life imprisonment, although he was
 convicted on the serious charge of economic sabotage and
 was declared responsible for no less than all the country?s
 economic woes.  For the first time too, in Rumania, a num-
 ber of general officers. of the former Royal Army and of non-
 Communist intellectuals and politicians, who had not been
 heard of for years, reappeared at public functions.
 30.  In all. the Satellites, but especially in Poland, where,
 as a result of the Swia.tlo revelations, the secret police were
 rendered almost powerless, a relaxation of police terrorism
 and arbitrariness was noticeable throughout the year.
 31.  Party congresses were held in March 1954 in
 Bulgaria, Poland and East Germany.  Their main task was
 to approve revisions in. the party statutes, as well as the
 organizational, changes in the top leadership mentioned above,
 the chief characteristic of which was closer conformity with
 the Soviet model.  The new Bulgarian Central Committee
 included a number of Kostov adherents purged in. 1950.
 32.  A notable feature of the new Polish party statute
 was the belated institution of centralized control over village
 party organizations, state farms, MTS, etc., accompanied
 by a similar tightening of control in the field of local admin-
 istration, together with the assurance that collectivization
 would henceforth be entirely voluntary.
 33.  The decisions of the 3rd Hungarian Party Con-
 gress, held at the end of May 1954, confirmed the New Course
 adopted by the June 1953 plenum and condemned those who

 oppos:ed'it.  They included revision of the Party statutes
 on the Soviet pattern - with emphasis. on.collective leadership
 as opposed to one-man rule - and reactivation of the long
 dormant Patriotic People's Front, a coalition of parties and
 mass. organizations.  The need for this front organization had
 beenur.ged by Nagy as a. means of enlisting the support of the
 masses for the Communist Party.  In spite of the Congress's
 approval, however, the PPF was, Nagy writes in his book,
 consistently sabotaged by Rakosi and his men, who saw in it
 a potential rival of the Party and a powerful tool in the hands
 of Nagy against whom they continued a relentless but un-
 declared war.
 34.  Nagy, Rakosi, and Rakosi 1s right hand man Gerd,
 agreed at the Congress only on the fact that the economic
 situation continued to be bad.  Gerd asserted that the value
 of per capita production had been 6. 6% lower in the first
 quarter of 1954 than in the same period of 1953, while wages
 had risen lp. 6% and. costs had increased.  Rakosi could not
 yet afford to attack Moscow's nominee openly, so he blamed
 the weakening of Party unity and effectiveness on rightist
 opportunism, meaning excessive liberalization, but, equitably,
 he also attributed part of the responsibility to leftist sectar-
 ianism, .i. e. continued adherence to the old course which he
 admitted had caused much damage.  In the economic field,
 Rakosi announced that the Second Five-Year Plan, to begin
 in 1956, mould continue to follow New Course principles -
 'much greater emphasis on consumer goods and food a key
 feature'.!' Favorable results could also be expected from
 the integration of Orbit economies, which was to be actively
 pursued,  In his book, Nagy, as was to be expected, places
 all the blame for the disappointing results of the New Course
 on its sabotage by the Rakosi forces.  Nevertheless, at the
 October 1954 CC Plenum, Nagy once again succeeded in
 obtaining a reindorsement of the New (Course.
 35.  All Satellite budgets for 1954, except the Polish,
 showed reductions in funds for investments and a shift in
 favor of consumer goods..  The Rumanian budget showed the

 most pronounced changes, the appropriations for agriculture
 and consumer goods increasing by 60 and 67. 7% respectively,
 while defense outlays dropped from 18 to 11% of total expend-
 iture.                       In Hungary, too, the share of defense outlays dropped
 from 14 to 11%, but in the other Satellites they were practi-
 cally unchanged.
 36.  The effort to improve living standards included
 general price reductions in March and April in Czechoslovakia,
 Bulgaria and Poland and wage and pension increases and. a cut
 of meat and fat prices in Hungary - said to have been preceded
 by cattle purchases in Switzerland.  In May, a Bulgarian decree,
 after a preamble repeating very much the same criticisms as
 those voiced at the Hungarian Party Congress, listed a number
 of consumer goods, the production of which "must" increase
 substantially by the end of 1955.
 37   Rumania was the only Satellite that did not hold
 a Party Congress in 1954.  In his customary 22 August
 Liberation Day speech, Gheorghiu-Dej claimed that "the rate
 of increase in the production of consumer goods exceeds the
 rate of increase for capital goods, in accordance with the
 August 1953 Party Plenum decision. ''   By late fall, the
 Rumanian leaders were at long last able to follow the example
 of the other Orbit members and to abolish rationing.  This,
 the December 1954 announcement said, had been made pos-
 sible not only by the good corn harvest, but by the favorable
 prospects for consumer goods production as a result of the
 27% increase in investment in light industry and the 40%
 increase in agricultural investment, which should soon bear
 fruit.  The announcement promised a slight wage increase
 but again made it clear that a real reduction in the cost of
 living could only be achieved by more and better-.work at all
 levels.  Two weeks later, in order to, enhance the peasants'
 material interest in production, the government raised the
 prices of animal products, reduced grain delivery quotas and
 granted credits to individual farmers.

 38.  In September 1954, the Rumanian government
 announced the cession by the USSR, on.what were claimed
 to be very favorable terms, of its shares in twelve of the
 fourteen joint Rumanian-Soviet enterprises; in October, the
 Bulgarian government made a similar announcement with
 regard to three out of the four Bulgarian-Soviet enterprises
 and in November Hungary announced the cession.of all four
 joint enterprises in that country.  The intent was to remove
 an all too obvious source of popular resentment but, as the
 allegedly favorable terms: were not made public, it is doubt-
 ful whether that. aim was achieved.
 39.  Hungary's economic troubles were underlined in
 September 1954 by the belated admission that some long-term
 capital investments had been abandoned and the completion. of
 others, such as. the Stalin Steel Works, postponed.  The state-
 ment in the declaration issued at the end of the People's
 Patriotic Front Congress (October 23-24) that a "consistent
 fight must be waged against any distortion, departure or
 deviation" from the New Course policies was interpreted as
 a confirmation of the general belief that the Party continued
 to be sharply split on the subject.  Even if the New Course
 did prevail, it was a paper victory, its actual implementation
 being successfully sabotaged by its opponents.  Bela Szalai
 revealed, for example, that by the end of September actual
 agricultural investments had amounted to only half the sums
 allocated.
 40.  The result was to put Hungary at the bottom of
 the list when the final figures. on industrial output in the
 Satellites for 1954 were published..  The increase claimed
 over 1953 was barely 3. 1% as against 4.4% by Czecho-
 slovakia, 6. 6% by Rumania, 8. 7% by Bulgaria, 10% by East
 Germany, and 11% by Poland.  In 1953, the first year of the
 New Course, increases had still ranged between 10%
 (Czechoslovakia) and 17% (Poland).    Even more remarkable
 was, the fact that Hungary admitted an actual decrease in

 heavy industry output.  The other Satellites claimed larger
 rates of increase #br: consumer than for capital goods, with
 the exception of Poland, which reported equal rates of
 increase.  Czechoslovakia blamed its poor showing chiefly
 on the "declining tendency in the development of labor
 productivity! !'
 41. In the land collectivization sector, only Poland
 reported any significant progress, although at a slower rate
 than in 1953.  Hungary had not recouped the heavy losses of
 1953 and Czechoslovakia admitted a reduction of about 10%a.
 Rumania, after having pushed permanent agricultural associa-
 tions rather than collectives during the first part of the year,
 shifted to encouragement of a still less advanced form of
 "socialist" agriculture, temporary "production associations",
 on the theory that if children were first encouraged to crawl
 they might be more easily persuaded to walk.
 42.  In the field of foreign relations, peaceful co-
 existence was furthered by a show of cordiality toward
 Western diplomats at official receptions in Warsaw in July
 and in Bucharest in August and by friendly gestures to Greece
 on the part of Hungary, Rumania, and, to a lesser extent,
 Bulgaria.  Rumania and Czechoslovakia exchanged ambassadors
 with Yugoslavia, which left Poland as the only Orbit country
 not to have "normalized" diplomatic or trade relations with
 Tito.

 43.        By this time, the majority, if not all, of the
 Communist leaders in the USSR had satisfied themselves that
 the critical period of transition after the death of the dictator
 had been successfully weathered and that there was, there-
 fore, no more reason to pander to the popular wish for higher

 standards of living at the price of retarding Russia's and their
 own achievement of world primacy.  The ambiguities and
 pretenses in the matter of consumer goods priority w-ere
 definitely abandoned on 25 January 1955, when Khrushchev
 in a speech to the Party Central Committee unequivocally
 reaffirmed the priority of heavy industry.  The new line was
 to the effect that this was the correct long-term method of
 increasing the people's welfare.  The shortages of food, the
 one element in the standard of living the regime could not
 disregard without impairing industrial production itself, and
 the shortages of equally indispensable agricultural raw
 materials, were to be soled by a further large expansion of
 the virgin land tillage program in the East and a great
 increase in corn planting for livestock feed.  Khrushchev's
 speech was followed on 8 February by the "resignation" of
 Premier Malenkov.  It was therefore hardly accidental that
 the final figures for 1955 revealed that production of consumer
 goods had increased one-third less than the four-year average,
 While that of heavy industry had increased at the same rate.
 At the same time, the increase in the people's purchasing
 power in 1953 and 1954 was nullified by doubling the amount
 of the annual loan "subscription" and by higher taxes.
 44.  In the Satellite countries, the only significant
 developments reflecting Communist Party troubles - and the
 fall of Malenkov - occurred in Hungary.  According to Na,gy's
 somewhat sketchy account, the fact that the Central Committee
 had in Octqbeii' 1954 "unanimously" decided to support the
 "June policy" and to eliminate opposition had convinced Rakosi
 and his adherents that, if the right wing were allowed to carry
 out the October resolutions, "there would be no hope of a
 return to the extreme left wing policy:"!  They therefore
 "began openly attacking the October resolutions" and Nagy
 found it "impossible to break down the opposition through
 purely party methods, to which I had always adhered . . .
 without the help and support of the Party apparatus", which
 was controlled by Rakosi.  Then, in the winter of 1954-1955,

 building of socialism", had been "entirely correct. '.'  Never-
 theless, as the drop in ixzdustrial productivity, the rise in
 production costs, the 1"ity of work discipline, the decline
 in agricultural production and especially in agricultural
 deliveries, which had temporarily been masked by inroads
 in the state reserves and reductions in investments, could
 not be denied, the resolution asserted that the reasons were
 "primarily to be sought in the anti-Marxist, anti-Party and
 opportunist views which of late - since June 1953 - have
 spread in the Party, the state apparatus and other spheres
 The result has been that industrial development has been
 halted, Socialist accumulation decreased. and state and civic
 discipline have deteriorated." "These rightist views", the
 resolution continued., "were able to become so dangerous
 because Comrade Nagy supported Lhe    in his speeches
 and articles.  He advocated them in the first place." They
 had manifested themselves "first of all in the distortion of
 the correct policy of Socialist industrialization" and in the
 "spreading of an atmosphere of complacency in the working
 class. '.'
 46. Nagy was further accused specifically of having
 neglected "widespread political, economic and organizational
 work in the interests of the consolidation and enlargement of
 the kalkhoz movement", of failing to stress the importance of
 produce collection and of having tolerated right-wing tenden-
 cies "aimed at reducing the leading role and importance of
 the Party in order to make the Patriotic People's Front the

 authority for controlling the State organizations and councils."!
 The Resolution concluded with a reaffirmation of the Party's
 fundamental aim of raising the people's standard of living.
 To that end it directed the Political Committee to work out
 the principle s. of the Second Five-Year Plan, which were
 listed, presumably in the order of their importance, as "the
 priority'of heavy industry and within it, that of the means of
 production, the further development and modernization of
 agriculture, the laying of the foundations of Socialism in agri-
 culture `and further increase in the production of consumer
 goods . .   " At the same time "an uncompromising ideo-
 logical struggle must be waged against every deviation from
 the Party's. policy - in the present case, primarily against
 right-wing deviation. ''
 47. The Resolution prescribed for 1955 a 5.7% in-
 crease over 1954 in industrial production, a 7. 3% increase
 in agricultural production and a "considerable increase in
 consumer goods production';?'  During the succeeding weeks,
 Rakosi endeavored to "clarify" the revised agrarian. policy
 in a number of speeches..  The clarification boiled down to
 the conclusion that pending the achievement by "political
 enlightenment" of full collectivization by 1960, the regime
 would continue to assist the independent peasants who still
 farmed 70%a of the land.
 48.  As was. to be expected after the March resolution
 of the Central Committee, Imre Nagy was relieved of the
 premiership and also dismissed from the Political Bureau
 and Central Committee (14 April 1955).  Nagy's successor
 in the premiership was his, first deputy, Andres Hegedus,
 and Rakosi was once again the undisputed boss..  Writing in
 the winter of 1955-1956, Nagy described the situation which
 developed after his' ouster as one in which "terrorism and
 fear of reprisal killed the sincerity 6f Party members" and
 "the gravity of which has had no equal since the liberation'.'"

 Moreover, he charged that the Party was no longer under the
 leadership of the elected body, the Political Committee, but
 of the Party apparatus, and collective leadership was a myth.
 49.  In spite of the renewed emphasis on heavy indus-
 try, echoing the Moscow line, all Satellite plans for 1955
 actually betrayed the physical and moral impossibility of per-
 severing on the road of high pressure industrialization and
 disregard of consumer demands.  Total investment plans were
 substantially reduced, while the shares of agriculture and light
 industry were increased.  In Poland and Hungary the usual pro-
 portion between the rate of growth of light and heavy industry
 was allegedly reversed, the former being scheduled to grow
 twice as fast,  but a Warsaw, broadcast of 18 February 1955
 took pains to explain that this was an exceptional measure,
 "only warranted by the need to remove the disproportion
 created in the past..'  In Czechoslovakia and Albania, approx-
 imately equal rates of growth were scheduled.  Only the GDR
 retained the old proportion. 2  The chief interest of these planned
 figures is to be found in the implicit admissirn by the Communist
 regimes themselves of the low prevailing standards of living
 and the consequent disaffection of the population.  For promise
 and fulfillment are two different things.  Gheorghiu-Dej's state-
 ment to the Rumanian Second Party Congress in December 1955
 provides a good illustration:
 ". . . No proper attention was paid to the development
 of light and food industries.  In recent years investment
 1
 In Hungary the allocation to agriculture was, according to Imre
 Nagy, reduced by 30% and only 8. 7% of industrial investments
 went to light industry.  In Poland also it has been calculated
 that the share of heavy industry would still be about eleven
 times as large.

 The Rumanian and :Bulgarian figures did not reveal the rela-
 tive share;;of light and heavy industry.

 used. '{
 50.  Czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania and Bulgaria
 announced further price reductions in April 1955, and Rumania.
 repeated the performance in December.  Czechoslovakia
 reduced farm delivery quotas, Bulgaria granted further con-
 cessions to collective farms but not to individual farmers,
 while Hungary issued a series of decrees embodying a return
 to a:;har'.si  policy toward individual farmers,
 51.  Throughout the area 1955 turned out to be a com-
 paratively good year from the economic point of view,
 e*pecially in the southern Satellites.  Albania, Bulgaria,
 Rumania and Hungary were favored by better than average
 weather and by the circumstance that the wet summer be ne -
 fitted corn, which, in deference to Khrushchev, had been
 planted much more extensively than in the previous years.
 The Rumanian leaders could triumphantly announce that pre-
 war grain production had at last not only been. equalled but
 even surpassed.
 52.  As in the USSR, a notable feature of 1955 in the
 Satellites was the crescendo in Party propaganda emphasis
 on the need to decentralize controls, to increase management
 efficiency, labor productivity and the care and utilization of
 expensive machinery, to save raw materials, to stop paying
 unauthorized and exaggerated wages, etc., shortcomings
 which were growing increasingly serious instead of decreas.
 ing as time went on.  The Party leaders realized that the
 pre-1953 rate of industrial investment in new machinery,
 buildings, etc. could not be restored without grave political
 danger and that even if it could, there was no advantage in
 producing machines. which lay, idle, raw materials which went
 to waste and shoddy goods which no one wanted to buy.  On

 the other hand, labor reserves were by now exhausted and
 could no longer be drawn upon to increase production.
 53.  Although none of the Satellites found it necessary
 to publish a breakdown of the industrial output figures for
 1955, they all claimed a general improvement in the economic
 situation.     The economic crisis which hit them in 1953, forc-
 ing them to adopt the New Course, and the slow recovery in
 1954 and 1955, are clearly reflected even in the official rates
 of increase in total industrial production claimed for the
 period 1952-1955:

 54.  The Satellite regimes showed reluctance to
 revive the collectivization drive in 1955, on the theory pre-
 sumably that it was best to let well enough alone pending a
 consolidation of the situation. At the end of 1955, Hungary
 claimed,that collective farms and permanent farming asso-
 ciations  comprised 22.4% of the arable land, as against
 26% in 1953 and 18% in 1954; Bulgaria claimed a slightly
 over 50% ratio of collectivization; Rumania about 15%;
 Albania about 13%; Czechoslovakia about 30% (as against 35%
 in 1953); East Germany about 20%; and Poland about 13%. An
 interesting development occurred in Hungary where a decree
 legalized the setting aside of 10% of the collective income to
 be distributed as land rent - a practice which Marx would
 hardly have approved.  Shortly afterwards, the Rumanian
 regime went one step further and gave its blessing to the

 Gheorgbiu-Dej decided to conform to the prevailing Orbit
 pattern 4nd resumed the first secretaryship of the Rumanian
 Party, Cehivu Stoica being appointed premier.  The promotion
 of Josif Chi.sinevski,, who had been in eclipse under the New
 Course, to the position of Party secretary, was widely inter-
 preted as a victory of the Stalinist wing of the Party.  This
 reshuffle was followed in December by the meeting of the
 long deferred Congress: of the Rumanian Workers' Party,
 marking the demise, rather than the birth, as in the other
 Satellites, of the New Course.  Gheorghiu-Dej gave no ink-
 ling of any intention to countenance greater freedom of ex-
 pression or of nationalism in his satrapy.  Rather, he signi-
 fied that the threat to Party unity had to be combatted with
 unflagging vigilance, although he implied that the most danger-
 ous elements, the right-wing deviationists. Pauker, Luca, and.
 Teohari Georgescu, had happily already been purged (in 1.951).
 More specifically, Miron Constantinescu spoke of the "more
 damaging effect of the appearance in some books . . . of
 certain bourgeois nationalist manifestations which must be
 unmasked and unsparingly eliminated
 56.  Similar strictures and warnings were voiced in
 Hungary by Rakosi, mainly referring to literary production
 during the Nagy premiership.  Although Cardinal Mindszenty
 was "promoted" from prison to house arrest in July and
 another amnesty, for "war criminals" was announced in
 Rumania in September, liberalization made but little headway
 in the Satellites in 1955 with the one exception of Poland.

 even more sensational, the poet was not molested by the
 authorities.  In September, the release of the Catholic priests
 held on political grounds was announced, and the general relax-
 ation in the accustomed atmosphere of coercion became so
 marked that it became known as the "Thaw".
 57.  Summing up the internal situation in the Satel-
 lite countries in 1955, it may be saidjiriat by the end of the
 year the same leaders who had held power under Stalin had
 once again consolidated their positions, Poland being the
 only country in which they manifested a new and puzzling
 spirit of tolerance.  The Communist regimes had been greatly
 helped by the better harvest, which, together with lower prices,
 somewhat greater availability of consumer goods and higher
 wages, made possible by the reduced investments in heavy
 industry, accounted for a modest improvement in living stand-
 ards.  The country- showing the least economic improvement
 *as Hungary, chiefly as a result of the conflict between the
 Nagy and Rakosi factions.  But Nagy, writing at the turn of
 the year 1955-1956, is authority for the view that the political
 tension was even more serious than the economic situation.
 It was caused by
 "    . the fact that a leadership stratum, foreign to
 the Hungarian people, is opposing the ideals of
 national independence, sovereignty, equality, as well
 as national feelings and progressive traditions . . .
 The policy based on the March and April_d952 CC
 resolutions evoked passivity and resistance of the
 Party member . .       "
 The policy, he concluded with remarkable foresight, was
 "driving the people into the arms of reaction and bringing
 the country to the brink of an unprecedentedly grave political
 and economic crisis."

 the New Course went furthest in 1955.  In May the USSR

 submitted a disarmament plan embodying a number of Western
 demands, signed a treaty providing for the end of the Austrian
 occupation. and sent a large delegation headed by Khrushchev
 to Belgrade, where an attempt was made to reestablish the
 former ties between the Soviet and Yugoslav Communist
 partie:s to prepare the return. of Yugoslavia.to the Communist
 Bloc.  In this Ih.rushchev was. unsuccessful, in spite of his,
 sensational admission of Soviet responsibility for the rift,
 thinly disguised under a reference to the "provocative role"
 of Beria.  Of unsuspected. significance at the time was the
 mention in the joint communique of the admissibility of "dif-
 ferent. forms of Socialism,"  In its 3 June 1955 issue, Pravda
 explained that "Soviet-Yugoslav consolidation would be facil-
 itated by the condition, contained in the declaration, that ques-
 tions of internal structure, differences in social systems and
 differences. in the concrete forms of the development of social-
 ism are exclusively a matter for the peoples of the respective
 countries'.'!  On the other hand, the East-West j4rift was under-
 lined by the conclusion on 14 May 1955 of the Warsaw Pact,
 which provided a convenient cover of legality for the mainte_?

 tion of Austria, as well as in Poland.
 59.        The preliminaries of the Geneva "Summit" Con-
 ference had encouraged the belief among the Satellite peoples
 that it might bring about some sort of improvement of their
 status.  However, the Soviet press quickly killed these hopes -
 and reassured the Satellite regimes., by declaring that the
 USSR would never admit a discussion of a "non-existent East
 European problem" # and the conference ended in an atmosphere
 of general good will, without mention of the Satellites.  Coupled
 with Molotov$s boast in February of Soviet atomic superiority,
 the Geneva meetings: were generally represented.in the Orbit
 as proofs of the declining power of the West, and the Western
 proposals concerning Germany were cited as threats to Poland's
 and Czechoslovakians territorial integrity.  The admission in

 December 1955 of Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Albania
 to UN membership without any visible improvement in their
 qualifications was a further asset to the Satellite regimes
 and a corresponding disappointment for their opponents.
 60.  In spite of the spectacular USSR-Yugoslav
 rapprochement,  Satellite relations with Yugoslavia did not
 becox      perceptibly more cordial in 1955, being limited to
 the conclusion of technical and trade agreements.  The main
 hurdle, but not the only one, was presumably Soviet lack of
 encouragement for closer relations between them before the
 future relationship between the Soviet and Yugoslav Commis--
 nist parties had been clarified to Moscow's own satisfaction.
 The 20th Congress of the CPSU
 61.  Although the main accomplishment of the 20th
 Congress of the CPSU, which met from February 14-25.,  1956,
 consisted in approving measures and policies long since put
 into effect by the Party leaders, still the facts that a radical
 change in the methods of government applied for twenty years
 was solemnly sanctioned, that it was accompanied by Khrush-
 chev's staggering denunciation of Stalin and followed by the
 first open rebellion among the captive nations, endow the Con-
 gress with peculiar importance.  In the following pages, those
 aspects of the 20th Congress which may be considered to have
 particularly affected the Communist parties in the Satellite
 countries will be briefly reviewed.
 62.  Under the impact of Khrushchev's sensational
 charges and the implicit repudiation of Stalinist methods,. it
 is frequently overlooked that the first act of the 20th Congress
 was to reaffirm Stalin's basic aim to achieve within the fore-
 seeable future world hegemony for the USSR.  To achieve this
 aim, the rapid expansion of the Orbit's heavy industry was an

 indispensable condition which had been implicitly shelved
 during Malenkov`s ascendency in 1953-54.  For the New
 Course's strong emphasis on consumer goods ruled out the
 degree of austerity needed for rapid industrialization, which
 was limited only by human docility and capacity for heavy work.
 The formal re-adoption of Stalin's basic aim found its expres-
 sion in the ratification by the Congress of the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan, which set even higher production targets for heavy indus-
 try by 1960 than Stalin himself had contemplated in his 1946
 program and restored the 1950-55 capital and consumer goods
 output ratio, 1 merely increasing within the latter the share of
 agriculture and housing at the expense of other light industries.
 The final resolution of the Congress called for "an advanced
 growth of heavy industry" and added lamely, "At the same
 time, the Congress thinks that the level of production achieved
 at present makes possible a rapid development of the produc-
 tion not only of the means of production but also of consumer
 goods. "  This reaffirmation of Stalinism's essential aim,
 coupled with the repudiation of its methods, was further em-
 phasized in the Resolution by the statement:  "The Congress
 notes that the Central Committee opposed in good time the
 attempts to abandon the general line of the Party for the pref-
 erential development of heavy industry, as well as. the con-
 fusion in the question of the building of socialism in our
 country . . .  "
 63.  Prominent among the themes on the agenda
 1The failure of Soviet industry to fulfill the 1956 production
 plan forced the leadership in February 1957 to reduce the
 growth rate planned for the year from 11%6 to 7. 1%, the lowest
 since the war.  But the priority of producer aver consumer
 goods was even slightly increased.  The concomitant reorgan-
 ization of the Soviet economy would indicate, however, that
 the setback is viewed merely as the result of growing pains
 which the  eform is expected to cure.

 affecting developments in the Satellites, either directly or
 indirectly, were the "cult of personality" and collective
 leadership, approval of the "strengthening of Communist
 legality, " suppression of "arbitrariness" - somewhat counter-
 balanced, however, by the appeal to "high political vigilance"
 - and promises of higher wages and pensions, of improved
 living conditions and shorter work days, the need of improve-
 ments in the Soviet :Party organization and decentralization
 of the economy.
 64.  The numerous passages in the Resolution devoted
 to foreign relations, in particular to peaceful coexistence, to
 the non-inevitability of war and to the allegedly novel possi-
 bility of Communist victories in capitalist countries by non-
 violent, parliamentary means, were of little concern to the
 Satellite countries.  On the other hand, the paragraphs deal-
 ing with the subject of "different roads to socialism" certainly
 had strong repercussions.  The Resolution quoted Lenin's
 dictum: "All nations will come to socialism but all of them
 will not arrive there in a similar way; each will make its own
 contribution to one or another form of democracy . . . ,
 which could be used as a justification of "national" Commun-
 ism.                                 However, there is no doubt that the framers of the
 Resolution had not meant it that way.  For the next paragraph
 stated:
 "Now, parallel to the Soviet form of transforma-
 tion of society onto socialist foundations, there is
 also the form of people's democracy.  It has under-
 gone an all-around testing during ten years and fully
 proved itself.  In the people's democracies, there are
 quite a few nuances and differences in accordance with
 the conditions of each country . . . It is fully in accord-
 ance with the laws of development that the forms of
 transition of countries to socialism will in the future
 differ -increasingly.  At the same time it is not neces-
 sary that the . . . transition . . . should be connected
 with civil war. "

 The real intent of the paragraph was obviously to reassure
 squeamish near-Communists in capitalist countries but
 certainly not to signify advance approval of changes in the
 countries of people's democracy, a form which had "fully
 proved itself" and in which the differences called for by vary-
 ing conditions had allegedly already been taken into account. 1
 65.  In the light of subsequent Soviet actions, in Poland
 and particularly in Hungary, Khrushchev's views on. Stalin's
 reign of terror, as he expressed them in his "secret" speech,
 are of special interest.
 a.  Khrushchev accused Stalin of having, since
 ..1935, "practiced brutal violence, not only toward
 everything which opposed him but also toward that
 which seemed, to his capricious and despotic char-
 acter, contrary to his concepts" and of having
 "absolutely not tolerated collegiality in leadership
 and in work, " instead of working through "persuasion,
 explanation and patient coope ration with people. "
 Ignoring the French Revolution, Khrushchev alleged
 that Stalin had originated the "enemy of the people"
 concept which made it unnecessary to prove ideo-
 logical error and had "made possible the usage of the
 most cruel repression, violating all norms of revol-
 utionary legality against anyone who disagreed with
 Stalin .   . "  ''Arbitrary behavior by one person
 encouraged and permitted arbitrariness in others.
 The strictly practical reasons why Khrushchev con-

 the remote Chinese People's Republic were mentioned in. this
 context, those of Yugoslavia were not, although it had been

 dictum on the subject had first been reaffirmed.

 demned Stalin's brutal methods appear from the
 following statements:  "Mass arrests and deportations"
 and "execution without trial and without normal. inves-
 tigation created conditions of insecurity, fear and
 even despair.  This of course did not contribute toward
 unity of the Party ranks and of all strata of the working
 people but on the contrary, brought about annihilation
 and the expulsion from the Party of workers who were
 loyal but inconvenient to Stalin" and "who were wasted
 rather than being drawn to our side. "
 Contrasting Stalin's "brutal" with Lenin's
 "educational" method, Khrushchev defended the latter
 against any charge of softness:
 "Vladimir Ilyich demanded uncompromising deal-
 ings with the enemies of the Revolution and of the
 working class and when necessary resorted ruthlessly
 to such methods . . . You will recall only Lenin's
 fight with the Socialist Revolutionary anti-Soviet
 uprising, with the counterrevolutionary kulaks in 1918
 and with others . . . when he used the most extreme
 methods . . . However he used them only against
 actual class enemies and not against those who
 blunder, who err, and whom it was possible to lead
 through ideological influence. "
 Furthermore, Khrushchev pointed out, Lenin
 had used severe methods only "in the most necessary
 cases, when the exploiting classes were still in
 existence and were vigorously opposing the Revolu-
 tion . . . " while Stalin had used them "when the
 Revolution was already victorious, when the Soviet
 state was strengthened . . . " and not only against
 actual enemies but also against "individuals who had
 not committed any crimes against the Party and the
 Soviet government.  Here we see no wisdom, but
 only brutal force . . .

 b.  ' Khr shchev's charges: against Stalin included
 "grave pertr"ersion of party principles, party democ-
 racy and revolutionary legality . . .. violation of the
 principles of collective leadership and the accumula-
 tion of immense and limitless power in the hands of

 in 1951 and 1952, Khrushchev asked sarcastically:
 "Could it be possible .     that nationalist tendencies
 grew so much that there was a danger of Georgia
 leaving the Soviet Union?   . . This was. of course
 nonsense .   . Everybody knows how Georgia had
 developed economically and culturally under Soviet
 rule .       er
 d.  Speaking of the break with Tito, Khrushchev
 charged that the Yugoslav leader's mistakes and
 shortcomings "were magnified in a monstrous manner
 by Stalin, which resulted in a breach of relations
 with a friendly country. " There were "no problems
 which could not have been solved through Party dis-
 cussions among comrades. " Recalling Stalin's
 "delusions of grandeur" which led him to boast:
 "I will shake my little finger   and the re will be no
 more Tito, " Khrushchev commented that they had
 paid dearly for those delusions.  For no matter what
 else Stalin shook, "Tito did not fall.  Why?  The red,-
 son was that . . . Tito had behind him a state and a
 people who had gone through a severe school of fight-
 ing for liberty and independence, a people which gave
 support to its leaders. "

 e,  On the other hand, speaking of Stalin's crimes
 and errors which he had described, Khrushchev denied
 that these were the deeds of a giddy despot.  He
 considered that this should be done in the interest of
 the Party, of the working masses, in the name of the
 defense of the revolution's gains.  In this lies the
 whole tragedyl " In other words, Stalin had been.
 animated by the best intentions.  If he had made mis-
 takes, it was mainly due to his lack of the modesty
 considered by Lenin essential "for a real Bolshevism. "
 As a result, he had been corrupted by those who had
 "excessively extolled" him and resorted to excesses
 of cruelty which did more harm than good to the cause.
 66.  The conclusions to be drawn from Khrushchevis
 "secret" speech and the other proceedings. of the Congress,
 insofar as they are relevant to the subject matter of this
 paper, can be briefly stated as follows:  The Khrushchev
 "line" was neo-Stalinist, not anti-Stalinist.  There was to be
 no change in the chief Party aim set by Stalin.  His hard
 methods, too, had been basically correct but he had applied
 them without proper discrimination and carried them to
 extremes.  "We must affirm, " Khrushchev said, "that the
 Party fought a serious fight against the Trotskyites, the
 Rightists and Bourgeois Nationalists" - an allusion to the
 Georgian and Ukrainian "national committees; '" of the early
 twentied. "This ideological fight was carried out success-
 fully .   . Here Stalin played a positive role. " If in 1928-29,
 Khrushchev continued, the Rightists, had prevailed "and we
 had been oriented toward 'cotton-dress' industrialization or
 the kulak, etc., we would not have now a powerful heavy
 industry or the kolkhozes, we would find ourselves dis-
 armed . . . " It follows that he had no objection to the
 methods employed by Stalin against the peasants to impose
 collectivization, to forced labor, and in general to the suffer-
 ings imposed by forced industrialization, but he did reprove
 brutality and terror against Party members and workers -

 unless they proved obdurate - because such methods weakened,
 the Party and aroused hostility.  Furthermore, while he
 objected .to the concept of "enemy of the people; '' he approved
 the concept of "class enemy" and presumably when.that term
 did not fit, of "traitor to the working class." Khrushchev was
 especially critical of Stalin's abuse of "extreme methods"
 when the Party's power was not threatened, but he approved
 of Lenin's "ruthless resort" to such methods when dealing
 with "the enemies of the Revolution. " And these could
 obviously appear in the Satellite countries too.
 67.  Khrushchev himself justified his indictment of
 Stalin on the ground that "not all as yet fully realize the
 practical consequences resulting from the cult of the individual
 What he undoubtedly meant was that, as many top
 Communists - certainly Molotov for example - still did not
 agree that Communism would benefit from a less brutal policy
 and were not reconciled to the abandonment of terror as the
 surest and proven means of safeguarding the Soviet empire
 on the theory o.derint, dum metuant, 1 the most ruthless
 revelation of the truth was needed to silence the opposition.
 68.  Among other reasons for Khrushchev's action
 was probably the fact that, in view of the nuclear stalemate,
 the safest way to extend Moscow's realm was for the Com-
 munists to seize power in other countries with the help of
 left-wing parties, and for that it seemed expedient to convince
 the voters. that Communism did not necessarily imply bloody
 revolution and terror.  Stalin's despotic excesses were a
 perversion, not a result of true Leninism, which prescribed
 collective leadership as. a preventive.  After all, no foolproof
 system of government had ever yet been devised,  Khrushchev
 realized that the best way to persuade the world that the new
 regime really meant to turn over a new leaf was to hold a
 symbolic autodafe.  In the West, some Communist eyebrows
 were indeed raised, when the full text was published in the
 New York Times of 4 June 1956, but they were soon dropped

 PART II
 POLAND
 Conditions in Poland at the Beginning of 1956
 1.  The economic situation in Poland at the beginning
 of 1956 appears to have been bad,  This was revealed, inter
 alia, by the fact that in spite of the official claim that the
 industrial production plan for 1955 had been overfulfilled, the,
 1956 plan scheduled a reduction.   As for the entire Six-Year
 Plan, Radio Warsaw broadcast a listener's letter which read
 in part:  "Why gild reality with nice speeches if it is obvious
 that the Six-Year Plan failed?  . . . And what about the much
 publicized increase in the living standard?  Everyone can find
 that out best for himself. " (22 January 1956).
 2.  In spite of good weather in 1955, it was- officially
 admitted by the Central Statistical Bureau that the agricultural
 plan had been under-fulfilled (allegedly 97%) and that a short-
 age of meat, fats, flour, butter, etc. had developed.  But
 there is no doubt that the economic situation in general, not
 only with regard to food, was worse than was officially
 admitted at the time.  First party secretary Ochab himself,
 who had no reason to exaggerate his own responsibility, at
 the Eighth Plenum in October 1956 confessed with shame that
 after the Seventh Plenum in June 1956,
 "I spoke, thinking I had a right to speak thus, about
 the practicability of the outlines of the Five-Year
 plan decided upon at the Plenum.  Now we know that
 the figures supplied by the ministries and the State
 Planning Commission were not checked well enough
 and that things were much worse than we thought . . .
 The deficit in our trade and payment balance is much
 bigger than we assumed. "

 3.  The picture of the Polish economy drawn by
 Gomulka at the Eighth Plenum was equally gloomy:
 "Generally speaking, (he said) after the conclusion
 of the Six-Year Plan, which according to its promises
 was meant to raise high the standard of living of the
 working class and of the entire nation, we are faced
 today, in the first year of the Five-Year Plan, with
 immense difficulties which are growing from day to
 day . . . We found ourselves in the situation of an
 insolvent bankrupt. "
 Gomulka then proceeded to give a number of striking exam-
 ples of short-sighted, piecemeal planning, fictitious account-
 ing and incompetent economic management.  The agricultural
 policy had resulted in the creation of collective farms which
 produced less per hectare than the individual farms and only
 subsisted thanks to state subsidies.  Other examples were
 the management of the coal mines in which productivity per
 worker had dropped 36% since 1938, the utter neglect of
 housing, etc.  In short, the Six-Year Plan, Gomulka declared,
 which had been
 "advertised in the past with great energy as. a new
 stage of the high growth of the living standards, dis-
 appointed the hopes of the broad working masses.
 The juggling with figures which showed a Z7% rise
 in real wages during the Six-Year Plan proved a
 failure. It only exasperated the people even more,
 and it was necessary to withdraw from the position
 taken by poor statisticians.  The inflammable
 materials had been accumulating for years."
 4.  The political system prevailing at the time is
 described as one under which
 "party and state policy were mapped out by the
 supreme leading circle of the Party, within the
 bounds of subordination to the 'Supreme Cult' and
 that policy was implemented by a party and state

 apparatus not subject to the democratic control of
 the masses.  This was bound to result in estrangement
 of the party and state apparatus from the peoples'
 ..masses . . . and in a loss of the masses' sense of
 responsibility for their local affairs.  Nobody is
 infallible, and this also applies to a.workers' party.
 But its mistakes really assume dangerous propor-
 tions when the masses of the members are excluded
 from influence and the masses of the working people
 cannot identify themselves with the Party's policy
 .        ,    . What happened .      was that the Party did not
 care about the reaction of the masses: and became
 quite callous in the face of their essential needs.. "
 (Nowe Drogi, No. 1/1957).
 5.            Ochab too, in his self-critical speech to the
 October Plenum, spoke of the "errors and perversions in
 our policy . . . which led to a kind of rift between the leader-
 ship . .                       and the broad Party aktiv? which, generally speak-
 ing, seen in perspective today, rightly criticized the Party
 leadership. " Ochab mentioned a Party meeting in November
 1954, the Third Plenum, "when the leadership was: practically
 isolated, " and a crisis. in the Politburo "when the so-called
 trial of Comrade Spychalski was under discussion. "  One of
 the reasons the crisis could not be solved was, according to
 Ochab, the death of Bierut.  Another was the difficulty
 '''even of the comrades. who opposed the greatest stupidities
 and our continued entanglement in errors" - including him-
 self, presumably   to revise "their old points of view . . .
 based on major mistakes in the assessment of the overall
 situation in the country. "
 6.  Ochab thought that one of the chief causes of the
 major lags in political decisions was. "the poor state of our
 ideological front" primarily resulting from "the leadership's
 weakness in this respect, " And this, he explained, was due

 to the fact "that for many years we had practically foregone
 any independent ideological work and depended on our being
 able to transfer creatively, as the saying went, all the exper-
 ience of the USSR.  However, of that creativeness there was
 not much evidence . . . if
 7.  So much for conditions within the Party.  As for
 the masses, Gomulka in his speech to the Eighth Plenum on
 20 October 1956 testified to the "profound dissatisfaction of
 the entire working class stemming largely from its living
 standards " The unpopularity of the Party among the
 peasantry can be gauged from the statement made on 23
 March 1957 by Stefan Ignar, chairman of the Central Com-
 mittee of the United Peasant Party and deputy premier:
 "Probably not everybody knows   although it was men-
 tioned several times and particularly at the Fifth
 Plenum of the Central Committee - that, beginning
 in 1953, from the beginning of the breakdown of the
 worker-peasant alliance owing to Draconian methods
 of purchase and collectivization, a protest was felt
 Lsi J even more strongly within our Party against
 the system of the alliance between town and country
 and against the ordering about of the peasants by the
 bureaucracy."
 8.  Another noteworthy fact - suspected, but hitherto
 undocumented - about Communist Party relations with the
 peasantry, was revealed by Politburo member Zambrowski.
 He admitted that they had miscalculated when they thought
 they could win over the poor peasants by pitting them against
 the kulaks.  "On the contrary, we aroused the solidarity of
 the peasants.  Often. a small-holder said:  'Why do we ruin
 the kulak? He is a good farmer, is he not? "' (Zycie Partii
 16 March 1957).
 9.  Two other major causes of resentment were
 shared by the vast majority of Poles, with the exception of
 some party stalwarts:  the police terror, which had apparent-
 ly persisted in a milder form, and Soviet domination, for

 which in his 20 October 1956 speech Gomulka diplomatically
 blamed the "cult of personality".  He began by describing
 the acknowledged principles of relations between socialist
 countries, which he asserted had been recognized but not
 always respected by Stalin, since they could not fit within
 the framework of the "cult of personality".  This cult could
 not be confined solely to the person of Stalin; rather, it was
 a certain system which had prevailed in the Soviet Union and
 was grafted to "probably all Communist parties". . Moreover,
 Gomulka clearly implied that the system had not died with
 Stalin.. The essence of the system, as he described it, was
 "the fact that an individual, hierarchic ladder of cults was
 created, " at the top of which in the bloc of socialist states
 stood Stalin, and at the bottom the first secretaries of Com-
 munist parties.  Under this system which crushed every
 independent socialist thought, relations between parties and
 states c1adrly'_coulcg not be based on equality.  Under such
 conditions, no party leader could work normally even when
 he worked collectively.  But the situation was worse, Gomulka
 continued, presumably alluding to Bierut,  "when the honors
 of power . . . were seized by a mediocre man, an obtuse
 executive, or a rotten climber. "
 10.  Another evil consequence of the system condemned
 by Gomulka was the violation of democratic principles and the
 rule of law.
 ,,The characters and consciences of men were broken,
 people were trampled under foot and their honor was
 besmirched . . . We have our own domestic variety
 of Beriaism . . . A page full of provocation, blood,
 prisons, and the sufferings of innocent people. "
 11.  To complete the above sketch of the psychological
 background of the Polish October, the rebellion of the intelli-
 gentsia against intellectual conformism, which had been
 steadily growing since 1954, must be mentioned, particularly

 as it reflected itself increasingly in the press, dominated
 though it was by the Communist Party.  Curiously enough, it
 was mentioned by neither Gomulka nor Ochab.
 Developments from the 20th CPSU Congress to the Seventh
 Plenum
 12.  Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin - parts of
 which were first published in Trybuna Ludu of 23 March 1956
 - was fore shadowed in Poland by the rehabilitation on 19
 February of the pre-war Polish Communist Party which had
 been officially dissolved in 1938 after the liquidation of its
 leaders by Stalin's security apparatus.
 13.  A fortuitous event, the death of the ailing Bierut
 on 12 March 1956, very soon gave the Poles an opportunity
 to test the sincerity of the 20th Congress principles of non-
 interference in the affairs of other countries and of de-
 Stalinization.  Khrushchev, who had come to Warsaw for the
 funeral, stayed a week and happened to be still there when
 the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party desig-
 nated, as Bierut's successor in the first party secretaryship,
 Edward Ochab, a man of whom Stalin himself had expressed
 complete approval.
 14.  The effect in Poland of the 20th Congress - and,
 one may add, of Khrushchev's secret speech,  100, 000 copies
 of which were reportedly secretly printed and circulated in
 Poland'- was described by Gomulka in his October speech
 as follows:
 "rIt] stimulated a turn in the political life of the
 country.  An. animating, sound current went through
 the party masses, the working class, the entire
 society.  People began to straighten their backs.
 The silent, enslaved minds began to shake off the
 poison of mendacity, falsehood and hypocrisy.  The

 stiff cliches previously predominant . . . began to
 give place to creative, living words . . . There came
 a powerful wave of criticism of the past - the criticism
 of violence, distortions, and errors . ,   Everywhere,
 above all at party and general meetings in work estab-
 lishments, the demand was raised for an explanation
 of the causes of evil and for appropriate measures to
 be taken with regard to the people mainly responsible
 for the distortions in economic and political life.
 Above all, the working people wanted to know all the
 truth, without any embellishments and omissions   . ..
 In the situation, . . . when it was necessary to act
 quickly and consistently,  . . . to go to the masses
 with all frankness and to tell them the whole truth
 about the economic situation, the causes and sources
 of distortions in political life - the party leadership
 failed to work out quickly a line of contcrete action.
 The fact that the Seventh Plenum was several times
 delayed is one proof of it. "
 15.  The reason for this failure is not far to seek; it
 was supplied by Ochab in his apologetic speech to the October
 Plenum, mentioned above.  "It is no easy matter," he said,
 "to cast off one's old spectacles through which one has been
 looking at things, believing in them . . . when afterwards
 one confronts one's views with the facts and seeks a way out
 of the emerging contradictions. "
 16.  It must be said in Ochab's defense that the
 situation he had inherited and was expected to dominate was
 certainly difficult,  Revisionism had already acquired such
 momentum, not only in the masses, but among Party members
 and intellectuals, that only by ruthless Stalinist methods could
 he have controlled it; but that was ruled out so soon after
 their repudiation by Moscow.   By the end of March, it became
 widely known that. Gomulka, General Spychalski, and General

 Komar, arrested in 1951, had been free for some months.
 Meetings of intellectuals, artists, trade unions, factory
 workers, etc. and the press protested with increasing vigor
 against censorship, dogmatism, centralism, and inefficiency
 and demanded the speedy rehabilitation of the former mem-
 bers of the "Home Army".  Ochab himself, perhaps hoping
 to control the movement by placing himself at its head,
 attacked the former leadership for its slowness in rehabili-
 tating the victims of "Beri,aism" (Trybuna Ludu, 4 April 1956).
 He condemned the arrest of Gomulka in 1949 as unjustified,
 although the latter had been guilty of "opportunistic and nation-
 alistic deviation" in opposing too rapid industrialization and
 collectivization.  A .few days earlier, Jerzy Morawski, a new
 member of the Central Committee Secretariat, had also con-
 demned the "Gomulka group. " Their error consisted, not in
 advocating a "Polish road to socialism, " but in failing to see
 that the true distinction between the Polish and the Soviet
 road was that in Poland such problems as state-church rela-
 tions and farm collectivization were actually being solved
 differently, and in thus retarding in practice the necessary
 changes.
 17.  On 6 April Ochab found it necessary to draw the
 attention of a meeting of Party activists to the fact
 "that some comrades seem to be losing their senses
 of balance and proportion between justified criticism
 and actions from positions which cannot be of advan-
 tage to the Party . . . This shows an unhealthy
 anarchistic tendency, the loss of a feeling of Party
 responsibility, and a confusion of ideas."
 Five days later, Ochab is reported to have even threatened,
 at a meeting of the Polish Literary Association, to bring
 tanks into the streets of Warsaw.  Instead, there was a.
 sudden reversal.
 18.  On 21 April, it was announced that the hated
 Radkiewicz, Minister of Public Security up to February 1955

 and since then Minister of State Farms, had been dismissed;
 his two most notorious subordinates, Romkowski and Feygin,
 had been arrested, and the Ministers of Justice and Culture,
 the Prosecutor General, and others, relieved of their posts.
 At the opening session of the Sejm two days later, Premier
 Cyrankiewicz, after acknowledging "the unusually accelerated
 pulsation of political life in Poland, " developed a comprehen-
 sive program of reforms.  These included a greater role for
 the Sejm, strict observance of "socialist legality, " a broad
 amnesty for political prisoners, greater availability of
 information, more freedomtto criticize bureaucracy, decen-
 tralization of government, and streamlining of the govern-.
 ment apparatus.  In the economic field, he promised priority
 in the improvement of living standards by raising wages,
 abolition of overtime, reduction of grain deliveries, increased
 prices for. cattle, substantial jn:creases in agricultural and
 housing investments, to be offset by reduced industrial invest-
 ment, and the encouragement of private enterprise by crafts-
 men .and service establishments.
 19.  But the trouble lay deeper than the ruling clique
 had apparently suspected.  No promiseon their part could
 solve the crise de confiance which had developed, not least
 among the Party members, and which the top men seemed
 unwilling or unable to check either by resolute implementa-
 tion of their promises or by drastic repression.  Five days
 after the Premier's speech, at. a meeting of the Writers'
 Association, chiefly composed of Party activists, Jerzy
 Putrament, the chairman, was shouted down.  The writers
 demanded nothing less than the immediate resignation of the
 Central Committee and. of the Politburo, new elections, an
 opportunity for Gomulka to present his present view's and
 opinions, and the prompt improvement of the "dreadful"
 economic situation.
 20.  The trouble was, as Przeglad Kulturalny put i

 overcome everywhere. " Po Prostu declared:  "People still
 do not believe in the sincerity of present reforms and changes.
 It is doubtful whether under the circumstances a placatory
 article by Ochab (published in the Moscow Pravda of 29 April,
 apparently in reply Ito that paper's invectives in its 5 April
 issue against those who were trying "under the guise of con-
 demning the cult of the individual       to question the cor-
 rectness of Party policy'-" and in which Ochacb boasted that
 Poland knew how to deal with. "slanderers and opportunists"
 and "certain groups" of Party members guilty of ideological
 instability), carried much conviction with the Russians.  But
 as for the Poles, it served to confirm the opinion that Ochab
 was Khrushchev's puppet, which hardly increased his popu-
 larity.  It was not until Berman, member of the Politburo and
 Bierut's grey eminence, who had been in charge of political,
 cultural and security matters, was dismissed on charges of
 "errors and distortions" (6 May), that the ferment abated
 somewhat, although. Ochab's threats - carried out in the case
 of Roman Werfel, ousted as chief editor of Trybuna Ludu -
 probably had some effect too.
 21.  But this turned out to be merely the lull before
 the storm.   Behind the scenes a struggle for supremacy was
 being waged in the Central Committee of the party between the
 "Stalinists" or Natolin group, as they were to be called. in
 Poland, and the "anti-Stalinists" or Pulawy group.  The most
 prominent members of the former group, led by Ochab, were
 said to be Zenon Nowak, Klosiewicz, Witaszewski, Mazur,
 Mijal and Albrecht; of the latter, under Cyrankiewicz's leader-
 ship, Zambrowski, Zawadski, Rapacki, Rybicki, and Szyr.
 A number of newer members elected in March, most prom-
 inent among whom were Morawski, Matwin, and Gierek, had
 not quite made up their minds.  Negotiations with Gomulka for
 his reinstatement were said to be in progress during this
 period, but failed when he refused to agree to any restrictive
 conditions.

 22.  Opinions even within each of the two groups appear
 to have differed considerably.  Ochab himself was believed
 to favor only such reforms as might be agreeable to Khrush-
 chev, while some of his followers inclined to the view,
 attributed to Molotov, that Khrushchev himself had made the
 mistake of going too far on the road to relaxation.  Within the
 Pulawy faction, Cyrankiewicz was thought to have favored a
 "Polish road to socialism" diverging moderately from the
 Moscow line; while others advocated more far-reaching
 changes, ranging from Gomulka's to Djilas's programs,  The
 Pulawy faction also gained considerable strength from the
 accession of the majority of the Jewish Communists as a
 result of the anti-semitism of their rivals, who had, it is
 alleged, taken their cue from Khrushchev's jibe, uttered dur-
 ing his March visit to the Polish Central Committee, that it
 had "too many Abramowiczes'. "
 23.  The respite was not long.  Hardly had the intel-
 lectual front quieted somewhat when signs of trouble began to
 appear on the labor front.  Rumors of unrest and strike
 threats in a number of factories became increasingly persist-
 ent, presumably owing to the workers' disappointment with
 the inadequacy of the wage increases.    On 18 June Ochab had
 to reveal that, as a result partly of larger coal allocations to
 private consumers, partly,of a deterioration of labor disci-
 pline, the quantity of coal available for export, the principal
 source of foreignexchange, had dropped sharply.  Ten days
 later, a street demonstration of metal workers in Poznan,
 .demanding higher wages and lower taxes, soon turned into a
 political demonstration in which the population joined, shout-
 ing first ''We want bread" and "We want freedom, " and in the
 later stages, anti-Soviet and anti-security police, and pro-
 Western and pro-Catholic slogans.  Many members of the
 security police were mobbed, and people were killed or
 wounded by the security troops brought up by the authorities
 to quell the riot<

 24.  The instinctive reflex of the Polish regime was
 to blame "the imperialist centers hostile to Poland and the
 reactionary underground" as Premier Cyrankiewicz declared
 over the radio the next day.  "Let every provocateur or mad-
 man be certain that if he is bold enough to raise his hand
 against the people's authority, it will be cut off . , . " But,
 reversing their supposed roles, Ochab told the Seventh
 Plenum on 18 July that
 " . . . it would be erroneous to concentrate attention
 above all on the machinations of provocateurs and
 imperialist agents.  It is necessary to look first for
 the evil roots of these incidents, which have become
 for the whole! of our party a signal of warning, testify-
 ing to the existence of serious disturbances in the
 relations between the Party and varie-i s sections of
 the working class . . . The bureaucratic distortions
 . . . gave birth to a callous attitude toward the people
 and their often justified demV.nds. "
 But Moscow flatly contradicted its nominee:  Bulganin, who
 happened to be visiting Warsaw on the eve of the Seventh
 Plenum, asserted on 21 July that "the recent events in Poz-
 nan, provoked by hostile agents, prove again that interna-
 tional reaction has not yet discarded its plans for the restor-
 ation of capitalism in the socialist countries. " It had to be
 realized, he warned, that while each nation was building its
 own socialism, the enemy was endeavoring to weaken the ties
 of international socialism, using slogans of "national char-
 acteristics" and "extension of democracy. "
 25.  Bulganin had also been commissioned "by the
 Soviet people . . . to convey their brotherly greetings to the
 people of the newly acquired Polish western provinces. "
 Delivery of this message provided him with the opportunity
 to remind the Poles that the guarantee of the permanence of
 the frontier was "the friendship of the nations of the Socialist
 camp, the friendship of the Polish and Soviet nations. "

 26.  The Ochab regime obviously staked all its hopes
 of allaying the continuing discontent among the people and
 party members on the Seventh Plenum which was to. spell out
 and formalize the reforms outlined in April.  In their addresses
 to the Plenum, which met from 18-28 July 1956, -Ochab and
 Cyrankiewicz covered very much the same ground and did
 little more' than offer variations on, and slight amplifications
 of, the program they had expounded in April, which were sub-
 sequently embodied in the final resolution.                             The main differ-
 ence between the two was Ochab?s warning that much of the
 recent criticism had gone too far,. that "criticism from the
 position of the enemy" or outbursts. against the Party in the
 press would not be tolerated.  He further declared that in the
 future the Party should not exercise authority directly, but
 only give general political direction, thus eliminating bureaijc-
 racy; it should further collective leadership, and party democ-
 racy.  The Party should also stop hampering the activities of
 other parties (the Democratic and the Peasant Parties) which
 were important allies.  Both speakers once again freely con-
 ceded past errors, such as excessive investments in industry
 - which Cyrankiewicz, apparently forgetting peaceful co-
 existence and the Geneva spirit, blamed in part at least on
 the necessity, stemming from the. international situation, of
 building up the defense industry".- and false statements on
 the rise in living standards, which had actually hardly
 improved at all, especially for the lowest paid workers.
 There followed the usual list of panaceas and promises:
 Greater emphasis. on consumer goods, more intelligent plan-
 ning, better management, greater participation of workers
 in management, decentralization, socialist legality, etc.  But,
 Cyrankiewicz emphasized,
 . . . one of the main sources of our present difficulties,
 both economic and political,    . . is the still too weak
 participation of the political and social initiative of the
 broadest masses in our life . . . What is needed is an
 active and creative attitude, an attitude full of initiative

 and enthusiasm for his work on the part of the worker,
 the peasant, and the intellectual.  We cannot achieve
 this through methods of ordering about, of pressure,
 of compulsion . . . but only when the masses are more
 active politically, when there is a strong increase in
 their active participation in governing the country and
 its economy . . . We must once and for all put an end
 to the period. in which the vwo rker, the peasant, or
 intellectual was often looked upon with suspicion,
 surrounded by thousands of regulations., his freedom
 was limited, his criticism stifled, when he was often
 exposed to illegality and abuse of power, when his
 wrongs and grievances, his needs. and troubles, were
 treated lightly. "
 The people, especially the young, had to be molded into
 "political activeness" which, according to Cyrankiewicz, was
 to be achieved by further democratization.  But, he added,
 "this process must be guided.  This is precisely the mission
 of our party . . . "
 27.  Cyranki.ewicz conceded that the task was not an
 easy one.     On the one hand "the conservatism of a part of
 our Party and state apparatus is hampering the process of
 democratization;" on the other, "the class enemy is acting
 and attempti7 to orient it in a direction advantageous for
 him. "   This was tantamount to an admission that part of the
 Party apparatus was firmly convinced that if the masses were
 indeed granted freedom and everything that was done "hap-
 pened in accordance with their will,"' it would be the end of
 Communism.  Cyra:nkiewicz made no attempt to argue that
 they were wrong.
 28.  Like everything else, self-criticism has its
 advantages and its disadvantages.  When Cyrankiewicz con-
 fessed:  "It is necessary to state that the rate and depth of
 the political changes effected by us and the efficacy of the
 measures employed did not fully correspond to the require-

 ments of the situation, " and when Ochab admitted that "the
 Poznan incidents prove how little we have done toward
 effectively overcoming bureaucratic deviations in our country
 and especially in socialist enterprises, " they were inviting
 the obvious retort that they stood self-condemned for bad
 faith or incapacity to govern.
 a9.  "It is easier to lead by command than to win over
 and persuade, " Cyrankiewicz had also said.  But both he and
 Ochab were apparently incapable of either.   They had exhausted
 their credit, and, as Gornulka was to put it in his speech to
 the October Plenum:  "The loss of the credit of the working
 class means the loss of the moral basis of power. " There
 was no question as to who was to assume the Party leadership,
 for in the words of a veteran Polish Communist:  "We are
 left with only one political change of clothes, and that is
 Gomulka. " If complete freedom was an unattainable dream,
 the least the people wanted was a new man rather than a new
 program, for there was not much difference left between the
 programs of Gomulka and Ochab.  There was, however, a
 great difference between the two personalities.  Gomulka had
 remained in Poland during the German occupation, and he had
 openly opposed a slavish subservience to Moscow in such
 matters as the break with Tito, I forced industrialization, and
 rigid centralism.  Possibly others had shared these opinions,
 but the difference was that Gornulka had had the courage to
 voice his convictions.
 1He recanted, indeed, in September 1949 after the break.
 But his article in Trybuna Ludu, in which he spoke of his
 recent "clear condemnation of the treacherous Tito" did not
 save him from expulsion from the Party in November 1949.

 30.  Whatever their reasons or motivations, the fact
 is that the Seventh Plenum reinstated Gomulka in his Party
 membership despite the fact that Pravda had just published
 two editorials (on 16 and 24 July 1956, that is, only a month
 after the announcement of the agreement with Tito) which were
 clearly aimed at him.  They spoke of the existence within the
 Communist parties in the "camp of socialism" of "propagators
 of chaos, adventure, and opportunists" who threatened that
 ideological unity of the camp which must be the overriding
 consideration.  What Pravda seemed to mean was that, while
 theoretically separate roads to socialism were conceivable
 and admissible, in practice, no country could do better than
 the USSR with its long experience.  Countries of the "socialist
 camp" must therefore stop wasting time on the secondary
 matter of separateness and concentrate on the paramount
 question of unity, and strengthen their ties with fellow members,
 headed, of course, by the USSR.
 31.  On the surface, things seemed to quiet down in
 Poland white the liberalization program was being implemented.
 Gomulka?s readmission to Party membership was followed by
 those of Generals Spychalski and Komar, the latter being;
 appointed Chief of the Security Police, an appointment which
 turned out in October to have been of crucial importance,.
 Ochab ,).nnounced another substantial cut in the industrial
 investment program and in the strength of the Army;
 other decrees aiming at the improvement of economic condi-
 tions were set forth..  The confidential letter sent by the CPSU
 to the Communist parties in the satellite countries on 3
 September 1956, warning them that Yugoslavia was not the
 example to follow, seemed to make little impression in Poland.
 The heads of two delegations returning from a visit to Yugo-
 slavia praised the "independence" of views shown by the Yugo-
 slavs in their socialist experiment and the degree of economic,
 if not political, democratization they had achieved.  Indeed,
 the impact of the Yugoslav example on other Satellite Co:m-

 munist parties must have been stronger than appeared on the
 surface, judging from Khrushchev's sudden visit to Belgrade
 and Tito's return visit to Yalta at the end of September, an
 account of which was given by the latter in his Pula speech
 of 11 November 1956.
 32.  Everything appeared to be going smoothly in
 Poland.  Rather unexpectedly, the trials of the Poznan rioters
 were conducted fairly.  The Sejm heard for the first time in
 many years some genuinely critical speeches, and revision
 of the electoral law to allow greater freedom of choice was
 seriously discussed.  But behind the scenes, the struggle for
 power between the Natolin and the Pulawy factions was grow-
 ing in intensity.  This struggle had far-reaching effects;
 sabotage of many of the liberal reforms by the paid Party
 apparatus, a majority of which favored the Natolin faction,
 led to a further deterioration of the economy and of adminis-
 tration in general.
 33.  Under the circumstances, the firm and purpose-
 ful leadership indispensable in a Communist state was com-
 pletely lacking.  The Politburo was too badly split to exercise
 collective leadership.  Neither section seemed to be able to
 dominate the other and to impose Party discipline, each being
 backed by powerful forces - the Soviets on one side and the
 majority of Poles, both Party and non-Party, on the other.
 It is true that the Polish masses were overwhelmingly opposed
 to Communists of any shade, but for the time being the major-
 ity supported the liberal wing, perhaps not so much for fear
 of Russia as on account of the Polish raison d'btat.  For the
 public was being constantly reminded that Poland needed
 Soviet friendship if it were to keep the Oder-Neisse frontier,
 a friendship it could expect to enjoy only if it remained Com-
 munist, and one may assume that Moscow's comparatively
 mild reaction to developments between Bierut's death and the
 Eighth Plenum was mainly due to the fact that the Soviet

 leaders were equally aware of this decisive limitation on
 Poland's freedom of action.  The Poles might loosen their
 bonds more than the Kremlin would like but they could never
 sever them.  It is also true that the Soviet leaders certainly
 never expected the Poles to dare disregard the warnings
 delivered by Bulganin in July and by Khrushchev in one of
 the speeches he made in Belgrade during his September visit.
 34.  Firm guidance by a leader, whether first secre-
 tary of the Party or prime minister, was also conspicuously
 lacking.  Cyrankiewicz, it is true, was always considered a
 moderate, but Ochab, the man approved by Stalin and Khrush-
 chev, was believed to be a conservative or Stalinist.  What
 game he was actually playing, or why and when he switched
 to the liberals, is impossible to tell.  The fact is, however,
 that the liberal faction and Cyrankiewicz carried on secret
 negotiations 1 with Gomulka all during the summer and Ochab
 did nothing to prevent them, and, according to well informed
 sources, he even participated in these from September
 onwards.
 35.  Very probably, judging from his self-condemnatory
 speech to the Eighth Plenum, Ochab gradually changed his mind
 and at the same time increasingly realized his own incapacity
 to dominate the situation, which might easily lead to a violent
 revolution against the Communist Party.  Speaking of "the
 so-called trend of democratization, " he said, inter alia,
 "It shows the concern of millions of people with
 People's Poland . . . which largely gathered strength
 spontaneously, not because there was resistance in
 1These negotiations were common knowledge, as proved by
 the resolution passed in September by the Warsaw Board of
 the Polish Youth Union, demanding publication of a recent
 interview between Party representatives and Gomulka.

 the Party leadership against new departures . . . but
 because we often sought to apply our old yardstick toL
 that mighty, huge, and spontaneous surge . . . We
 saw a difficult situation, and we made efforts to
 master it, but were not equal to the job which life
 presented us.  This is no doubt the fault of the whole
 leadership, but it goes without saying that a particular
 responsibility rests with me as the first secretary of
 the Central Committee . . . I submitted my resigna-
 tion which the Politburo rightly accepted. "
 36.  What exactly was being negotiated during
 September and the first half of October, between Cyrankiewicz
 and Ochab on one side and Gomulka on the other, is not known.
 Piecing together various accounts from local sources, one may
 assume that the former had fully made up their minds that .
 Gomulka was the only man with a sufficiently strong person-
 ality and enough authority to control the warring factions
 within the Party and with enough popularity to quiet the people.
 Whether the Stalinist or the liberal extremists emerged vic-
 torious, the consequences could not but be disastrous for
 Poland, for the end could only be violence and a tightening of
 the Russian grip.  Cyrankiewicz and Ochab were, however,
 endeavoring, but in vain, to induce Gomulka to agree in
 advance to collaborate with a number of leaders of the Natolin
 faction and to accept a step-by-step promotion in the Party
 hierarchy, in the hope, according to some observers, of
 effecting the transfer of power as smoothly as possible,
 according to others, of hobbling him.
 37.  In the meantime both factions were not idle.  The
 tactics of the Natolin faction consisted in stirring up the anti-
 semitic feelings of the Poles, in inciting the workers against
 the intellectuals, and in trying to gain popularity by reckless
 promises of wage increases and other material benefits
 regardless of the catastrophic consequences for the Polish

 economy.  Gomulka and his followers were keeping in close
 contact with factory workers and student groups and listening
 sympathetically to their complaints and suggestions, while
 avoiding embarrassing commitments.  In spite of. Gomulka's
 refusal, during conversations with Cyrankiewicz and Ochab
 in the last days of September, to commit himself to keeping
 the Stalinists in the Politburo, an agreement was finally
 reached.  Meetings 'between Gomulka and the liberal members
 of the Politburo, including Rapacki, Morawski, Albrecht,
 Jarosinski, Matvin, and Gierek, were held almost daily dur-
 ing the next two weeks and it was only then that the Natolin
 men learned what was in store for them.  On 16 October 1956,
 a party communique announced that a meeting of the Politburo
 had taken place the day before, that Gomulka had participated,
 and that the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee would
 convene on the 19th.  It appears that Gomulka's elevation to
 the first secretaryship of the Party had also been decided but
 not made public yet.
 The Eighth Plenum
 38.  To forestall the obvious outcome of the Plenum,
 Marshal Rokossowski and General Witaszewski, acting for
 the Natolin group, took steps, according to the account broad-
 cast:by,radios Szczecin and Gdansk on 26 October, to organize
 a putsch.  The army was alerted and a list of 700 prominent
 liberals who were to be arrested was handed to the UB
 (secret police).  However, the UB refused to make the arrests
 and one of its chiefs, Alster, forwarded the list to GDm.ulka
 and Gozdzik, party secretary of the Zeran Works, who, with
 Stanislas Staszewski, first secretary of the Warsaw Party
 Committee, was one of the leaders of the liberal movement
 among the Warsaw workers.  Armed combat groups of a few
 hundred men, composed of the plant Party aktivs, were formed
 in 16 of Warsaw's largest factories.  The main force remained
 on the alert in the plants during the critical days, 19-21.
 October, while small detachments of workers and students,

 together with KBW (Internal Security Force) detachments, on
 General Komar's orders, patrolled key points and protected
 the most prominent Gomulka followers.
 39.  On 19 October, Soviet Ambassador Ponomarenko
 returned from Moscow and delivered an invitation to the
 Politburo and Gomulka to come to Moscow for conversations
 but the invitation was politely declined in view of the prox-
 imity of the Plenum.  At the same time Warsaw heard rumors
 of suspicious movements of Polish troops, followed by news
 that Soviet troops too were on the march.
 40.  Nevertheless, the Eighth Plenum met on schedule
 on Friday,    19 October, and listened to a motion by Ochab for
 the election of Gomulka and three of his principal lieutenants,
 Spychalski, Kliszko, and Loga-Sowinski, to the Central Com-
 mittee, but not to the Politburo.  They also heard the reading
 of a letter from Berman, disclaiming any responsibility of the
 secret police for Gomulkats arrest in 1951, and a letter from
 Minc, who claimed he had been forced by Moscow, under
 threat of death, to revise his 1950 Six-Year industrialization
 plan sharply upward and asserted that everything done in
 Poland had been ordered by Bierut.  At that moment, to the
 surprise of the liberals at any rate, the arrival at the Warsaw
 airport of Khrushchev, Molotov, Mikoyan, Koniev and a group
 of generals, was announced and the Plenum was recessed.
 41.  The conversations between the Polish Politburo
 and the Russian "guests" were preceded by a sharp warning
 from Khrushchev tot the effect that the Poles could not hope
 "to get away with this sort of treason," followed by a prelim-
 inary demand from Ochab that the Soviet troops be ordered
 to turn back.  Khrushchev promised to give the order.  He
 then proceeded to offer the Poles substantial economic aid,
 on condition they became reasonable and abandoned their cur-
 rent policy which would lead socialism toward a catastrophe.

 An earnest of their good intentions would be the retention of
 Rokossowski and a number of other Politburo members, and
 a more moderate liberalization program.  Gomulka, however,
 insisted upon the right of every Communist Party to select
 its Politburo, and when Khrushchev threatened to use force,
 he countered by the threat to reveal the Soviet demands to
 the Polish people over the radio.  Khrushchev immediately
 changed his tone and thereafter listened to Gomulka's expose
 of his program with outward signs of approval, although it
 included a 50% wage increase over the next five years, the
 money therefor to be obtained from a sharp reduction in mil-
 itary forces and from compensation by the USSR for under-
 valued coal deliveries and for the dismantling of plants in
 the western provinces; it also stipulated complete equality
 between Communist  arties, further democratization, etc.
 On the other hand, Gomulka emphatically denied any anti-
 Soviet tendencies or personal resentment.  However, no
 definite agreements were reached.  Further negotiations
 were to be concluded in Moscow, mainly, it appears, because
 of rising public unrest at the news of further Soviet troop
 movements, including the crossing of the border by units
 from East Germany.  The publication in Pravda of an editor-
 ial violently criticizing alleged "anti-national and anti-
 socialist declarations in the Polish press" did not help to
 allay resentment.
 42.  The Soviet delegation took the broad hints that
 its continued presence would only inflame Polish public
 opinion still more and departed in a friendly atmosphere.
 The Poles attributed their success to Khrushchev's failure
 to intimidate them by threats and to disrupt the solidarity of
 the Gomulka-Ochab-Cyrankiewicz triumvirate, as well as to
 the information he was receiving from the Soviet ambassador
 concerning the attitude of the Polish army, security troops,
 workers, and students, who were being rapidly mobilized.

 43.  However, the Natolin group was apparently not
 ready to concede defeat.  On the following day, 20 October,
 Soviet troop movements continued, and naval units appeared
 before Gdansk; there were reports of clashes between Polish
 units, the great majority of which had sided with Gomulka.
 A tank column, advancing from Lodz, had to be intercepted
 at Sochaszew by Internal Security troops.
 44.  The Plenum meeting on 20 October began with
 violent attacks on Rokossowski, who could find no better
 explanation than that the Soviet and Polish troops had been
 only carrying out their usual autumn maneuvers.  Gomulka
 then addressed the gathering at great length; he was followed
 by a number of speakers for both factions, the Natolin group
 apparently still counting on the deterrent effect of the Soviet
 troop movements and on the propagandistic activities of its
 adherents, in the Party apparatus to bolster its position.  But
 whatever influence the overhanging threat of Soviet interven-
 tion might have had, it was far outweighed by the mass demon-
 strations and rallies of students and workers in continuous
 progress in the city of Warsaw, protestiflg against Rokossowski,
 the visit of the Soviet delegation, the Natolin faction, the inter-
 ference by Polish troops which should rather turn their arms
 against the common enemy, etc.  The scene of the biggest
 rally was the Warsaw Polytechnikum, from which over 50, 000
 demonstrators marched to the Council of State Building where
 the Eighth Plenum received a delegation of workers and stu-
 dents.  One of its leaders, Eligiusz Lasota, chief editor of
 Po Prostu, the student newspaper which had been probably the
 most courageous critic of the regime, read'.:Gothulka's :pro-
 .grarh to the dernohstrat rs   and conveyed his request that
 the people show coolness and restraint and his assurance that
 all was going well.  Further appeals to refrain from violent
 actions which would give their opponents the opportunity to
 suppress them by force were made by the mayor of Warsaw,
 Zarzycki, and by Helena Yaworska; with the help of the

 restraining influence: of Staszewski and Grozdzik, they suc-
 ceeded in preventing acts of violence.  It is true that inviting
 targets were lacking.  The seats of power were for all prac-
 tica'1 purposes already in the hands of the "liberals"; even the
 secret police, the greatest object of hatred in Communist-
 dominated countries, was on their side, and there were no
 Soviet troops in Warsaw.  On the other hand, the Oder-Neisse
 problem was always invisibly present, and the Communist
 leaders of the movement had faith in Gomulka.
 45.  What might have happened, if the leadership crisis
 and the concomitant power vacuum had lasted a little longer,
 and if the Natolin faction had put up a more determined fight,
 may be inferred from the raid on the Soviet-Polish Friend-
 ship Society headquarters in Wroclaw on 22 October and the
 anti-Soviet and anti-Communist demonstrations in Warsaw
 and Legnica on the 24th.  As it was, they were easily subdued,
 and the strong underlying anti-Communist feelings of the
 population were not allowed to gain momentum.  The Eighth
 Plenum ended on 21 October with. a complete victory for the
 liberals.  To the Politburo, reduced to nine members, were
 elected Gomulka, Ochab, Cyrankiewicz, Loga-Sowinski,
 Morawski, Jedrychowski, Zambrowski, Rapacki, and
 Zawadski, the last named the only one whose position was
 still doubtful.  The relative strength of the two factions may
 be gauged from tb.e 74 votes received by Gomulka, compared
 with the 23 votes for a motion by Ruminski, spokesman for
 the Natolin faction, for the nomination of Rokossowski.
 46.  Gomulka was then elected by acclamation first
 secretary of the Communist Party.  As mentioned above, the
 program Gomulka outlined to the Eighth Plenum on 20 October
 represented in the main a reiteration and amplification of the
 Seventh Plenum program.  The only new points were his pro-
 posals to allow inefficient collective farms to disband whale
 maintaining voluntary collectivization as the long-range goal,

 to liquidate State Machine Stations, to abolish gradually the
 compulsory deliveries of farm produce, to free kulak farms
 from restrictions, and to introduce worker council manage-
 ment in some branches of industry, being careful however
 not to disrupt production.
 47.  In the political field, Gomulka advocated further
 democratization, but, echoing Ochab, he warned that criticism
 must remain within bounds, for "we shall not allow anyone to
 use the process of democratization to undermine socialism.
 He recommended that the Sejm be allowed to fulfill the role,
 assigned to it by the Constitution, of "supreme organ of state
 power, " exercising the "highest legislative and controlling
 power,  without prejudice, of course, to the Party, which
 would fulfill its role as guide all the better for being relieved
 of the task of governing.  Finally, Gomulka endorsed the new
 electoral law which "allowed the people to elect, not only to
 vote. "
 48. With regard to "the problem . .   of development
 of inter-Party and interstate relations with our great fraternal
 neighbor, " Gomulka said nothing that had not also been said by
 the Soviet spokesman, with the only difference that he meant
 what he said.
 "What is immutable in socialism can be reduced to the
 abolition of exploitation of man by man,  The roads of
 achieving this goal can be, and are, different.  They
 are determined by various circumstances of time and
 place.  The model of socialism can also vary.    It can
 be such as that created in the Soviet Union; it can be
 shaped in a manner as we see it in Yugoslavia; it can
 be different still. '"
 With regard to inter-Party and interstate relations, Gomulka
 claimed that within the framework of international working
 class solidarity, mutual assistance, friendly criticism, if
 necessary, and rational solutions of controversial matters,
 '"each country should have full independence, and the rights
 of each nation to a sovereign government in an independent
 country should be fully and mutually respected. "

 "Stalin,    om.ulka continu7, formally recognized
 that all the principles enumerated above should
 characterize the relations between the countries of
 the camp of socialism.  Not only did he recognize
 them, but he himself proclaimed them.  In fact,
 however, these principles could not fit within the
 framework of what makes up the cult of personality."
 49.  Speaking only a few hours after the intervention
 in Polish affairs of the Soviet leaders, Gomulka - and, for
 that matter, Khrushchev - must have been well aware of the
 fact that all that was needed to make the last sentence fit
 present conditions was to substitute the words "the Presidium"
 for "Stalin, " and "cult of proletarian internationalism" for
 "cult of personality. " But the next move was up to the Krem-
 lin.  Gomulka, for his part, was determined to prevent "harm
 to the vital interests of the Polish state and the cause of build-
 ing socialism in Poland Lfrom7 anti-Soviet moves in Poland, "
 and Khrushchev could not have forgotten his recent criticism
 of Stalin for having foolishly and unnecessarily broken with
 Tito. Both men were content to wait and see, and in the mean-
 time to prevent any "provocations. "
 50,  During the next few days, the situation was
 extremely delicate.  As previously mentioned, anti-Soviet
 manifestations occurred in a number of cities.  On 23 October,
 Gomulka had to appeal to the "Workers and Youth" to "resist
 with determination all attempts at provocation." of the USSR.
 On the next day, Tyr ~buna Ludu crossed the t and dotted the i
 in an editorial stressing the fact that "Soviet-Polish arms
 had won the return of the oldest Polish lands, " and that "the
 Polish-Soviet alliance is an iron shield which guards Poland
 " On 24 October Gomulka reaffirmed before a crowd
 of demonstrators his conviction that the "Soviet Union . . .
 which constitutes the backbone of the alliance of all socialist
 states would respect the principle of equality. " He further

 revealed that he had received assurances from Khrushchev
 that all Soviet troops would be back in their bases "within
 the framework of the Warsaw pact, " explaining that as long
 as Poland's frontiers were threatened by Western Germany,
 the "presence of the Soviet Army in Germany will correspond
 to our highest state interest"; this was of course closely con-
 nected with the presence of Soviet troops in Poland under the
 pact.  Khrushchev had further assured him that "all concrete
 matters pertaining to our internal affairs would be solved in
 accordance with the estimate of the Party and the govern-
 ment" and that he accepted the principles adopted by the
 Eighth Plenum as a basis for their mutual relations.  Report-
 edly, these assurances were given by Khrushchev by tele-
 phone on 23 October to Gomulka, who told the other Party
 leaders that Khrushchev had also apologized for his attitude
 on the 20th and had assured him that he now completely
 approved of his (Gomulka's) actions.  Poland was to decide
 whether, or how long, Soviet specialists and advisers were
 needed.
 51.  A few days later it became known that Marshal
 Rokossowski had departed on leave, that a number of generals,
 most of them ethnically Poles but considered more Russian
 than Polish, had been dismissed; that a number of personnel
 changes had been made in the cabinet - among them the
 appointment of Stefan Ignar, leader of the United Peasant
 Party, to a deputy premiership, but also that of Zenon Nowak,
 one of the leaders of the Natolin faction - that a far-reaching
 turnover in Party apparatus personnel was being carried out,
 that Cardinal Wyszynski had been reinstated in his Warsaw
 see, and that the Poznan trials had been quashed.
 52.  The Polish regime certainly needed every ounce
 of the combination of that "decisively patriotic attitude with
 calmness, discipline, and a sense of Polish raison d'ett"
 which, according to Trybuna Ludu of 1 November, had char-
 acterized the Polish people during the recent events, when

 the Hungarian revolt began to gather momentum, and students
 demonstrated on 29 October in Warsaw shouting anti-Soviet
 slogans.  Ironically, the occasion for the Party organ's
 editorial was Moscow's statement of 30 October concerning
 the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Budapest and its willing-
 ness to discuss the question of Soviet troops and advisers
 with other people's democracies, which the paper seized upon
 as an added argument for Polish restraint.  The editorial
 recognized the dilemma posed in. the case of Poland by the
 conflict between the Polish national interest and the strong
 opposition to the continued presence of Soviet forces on
 Polish soil.  It assured its readers that a satisfactory solu-
 tion would be worked out on the basis of an agreement subor-
 dinating Soviet troop movements to Polish consent.
 53.  Somewhat less satisfactory to the Kremlin
 leaders must have been the 2 November appeal addressed by
 the Polish Central Party Committee to the people.  Although
 its main purpose was to combat demands for the withdrawal
 of Soviet units from Poland, on the plea that this would be
 "contrary to the most vital interest of the nation and the
 Polish raison d'etat, " it did state that "from the bottom of
 our hearts we have always been on the side of the Hungarian
 workers and of all those who fought together with them for
 socialist democratization, against the forces wanting at any
 price to maintain in Hungary the old manner of governing,
 hated by the people. " It described as tragic the consequences
 of the decision of the former Communist leadership to call
 for the assistance of Soviet troops, "instead of entering
 immediately and consistently on the road of solutions in. con-
 formity with the interests of socialism, with the will of the
 working class and the majority of the nation. " The Central
 Committee expressed its convictions that the Hungarian.
 workers would "succeed in uniting and repelling the attacks
 of the reaction" and that the problems of the defense of
 socialism could "be solved by the forces of the Hungarian
 people . . . and not by intervention from without. "

 54.  This did not prevent Gomulka from stating, in a
 programmatic address to Party activists on 4 November,
 that the Party leadership gave "first priority in political work
 to the problem of consolidating in the consciousness of the
 whole nation the importance of friendship between Poland and
 the Soviet Union. " He even went so far as to declare his
 willingness to discuss matters with the political opponents of
 socialism, but not with those who opposed Polish-Soviet
 friendship.  The latter "must be ruthlessly driven away
 hbong ovati    for they harm the interests of the Polish state
 and the Polish nation . . . Poland should never find herself
 in the situation in which Hungary found herself. "
 55.          In general, Gomulka seemed inclined to deal much
 more sternly with nationalist and "hostile elements, " appar-
 ently those who wanted to go still further in the direction of
 liberalization and who presumably favored what he described
 as "anti-Polish revisionist trends . . . sponsored by the
 forces of international reaction, " than with the Stalinist or
 Natolin wing.  The very terms "Natolin" and "Pulawy" group
 should, he declared, be eliminated from the Polish language,
 and Party members should be judged solely on the basis of
 their present, not their past attitude toward the policy adopted
 by the Eighth Plenum, for the Party must remain monolithic.
 He conceded, however, that those comrades who were as yet
 unable to understand that the struggle for democratization and
 sovereignty did not weaken, but on the contrary strengthened
 socialism and friendship with the CPSU, must "at present" be
 removed from influence on Party organs.
 56.  Gomulka described at some length the general
 principles which were to govern the forthcoming Sejm elec-
 tions, featuring joint lists including Communist, United
 Peasant Party, Democratic Party, and Catholic group candi-
 dates.                           But he devoted even more space to a defense of the
 security apparatus, now cleansed of its evil elements, and

 whose competence would be limited to "fighting espionage,
 terror, avid other hostile actions aimed against the rule of
 the people and the interests of the state. " They had proved
 that they were "ready to prevent any attempts aimed against
 the political line mapped out by the leadership of the Party.
 In other words, democratization was the watchword, but it
 had strict limitations.
 57.  Understandably, especially after the second.
 Soviet intervention in Hungary, and on the eve of negotiations
 with Moscow, Gomulka's chief worry was the still threaten-
 ing possibility of further anti-Soviet outbreaks.  That this
 worry was not unjustified was later proved by the Bydgoszcz
 and Stettin riots on 28 November and 10 December, the latter
 culminating in an attack on the Soviet Consulate. On the other
 hand, there was no immediate danger of a Natolin counter-
 offensive, provided the activities of the extreme revisionists
 did not invite Soviet armed intervention.
 58.  Particularly after the Budapest experience, which
 had shown that the mere appearance of Soviet tanks was not
 sufficient to cow a nation into submission, the Russian lead-
 ers were prepared to concede a certain amount, provided a
 regime continued to bear the Communist label, remained
 within the Communist camp - specifically, the Warsaw pact -
 acknowledged, as Gomulka had, that the USSR was, if not the
 head, at least the "backbone" of the camp, and avoided the
 term "National Communism" which had become anathema
 since it had been approved by the West.  After all, Moscow
 risked little, for the Polish raison d'etat guaranteed the
 continuation of its Satellite status de facto, if not de jure
 Circumstances have changed greatly since the days of Brest-
 Litowsk when the leaders of proletarian internationalism
 considered national frontiers as of minor importance.
 59.  Formal Soviet recognition of the "Polish road
 to socialism" was effected by the conclusion of the Moscow

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100070001-0
 agreement of 18 November.  On paper, the USSR made sub-
 stantial financial concessions by the cancellation of virtually
 all Polish debts, but an uncollectible debt has no value, and,
 at any rate, the amount was less than the sums owed by the
 USSR on account of Poland's share in German reparations
 and the undervaluation of coal deliveries.  What was of
 greater significance was the implicit admission of the charges
 that the USSR had been ruthlessly exploiting the Satellites.
 The clauses of the status of forces agreement, spelled out
 in greater detail a month later, giving Poland a say in the
 matter of Soviet troop locations and movements in the coun-
 try, presumably soothed Polish amour propre, but were of
 little practical importance.  The same can be said of the re-
 affirmation of the Oder-Neis.se frontier.  The most valuable
 concession made by Moscow was the supply on credit of 1.4
 million tons of grain, but it hardly could have been refused
 if further Poznans were to be avoided.
 60.  The main victims of the October events in Poland
 were Soviet prestige, Soviet propaganda in neutral countries,
 and Communist doctrine.  Soviet prestige suffered by the
 demonstration, sparked by the Poles and enhanced by the
 Hungarians, that Russia's might was not ?sufficient to cow
 nations into complete submission and to a certain extent could
 even be successfully challenged.  Soviet propaganda suffered
 from the palpable demonstration that even the workers in
 Communist-ruled countries, far from welcoming, did not
 even acquiesce in Communism, and that it was rejected with
 particular decisiveness by the younger generation.  Commun-
 ist economic doctrine suffered by the admission that after
 12 years of application, the standard of living of the people
 was, if anything, lower than before, and by the virtual
 abandonment of the forced industrialization program.  Per-
 haps even more serious was the elevation to the realm of
 distant ideal of the agricultural collectivization program,
 the abolition of discriminatory taxation of kulaks and the
 legalization of private sales of land, in spite of the dogma

 that a Communist state cannot be half socialist and half
 capitalist, and that individual ownership of land spontaneously
 generates capitalism.    Other deviations from the orthodox
 Party line which the new Polish leadership undertook to
 implement included the encouragement of small craftsmen,
 private stores and service enterprises, the granting of con-
 siderable powers to workers' councils in industrial enter-
 prises, the sanctioning of private initiative in the production
 of building materials, etc.
 62.  Nevertheless, Gomulka, addressing on 23 Nov-
 ember 1956 the meeting of first regional Party secretaries,
 called for the purpose of providing some guidance to the
 utterly confused Party apparatus, could argue that these
 decisions represented "a change in the methods of our work
 and a change in the model of socialism, " but remained
 "within the framework of socialism. "
 63.  The Party activists who thought that the revision
 of the Polish party line had gone too far, or that, after the
 settlement with the USSR, the standard of living could be
 improved overnight, were silenced by Gomulka with the
 crushing retort that under the old regime Poland had reached
 the point where in 1957 it faced a gap of 12 billion zloty worth
 of goods, while coal exports were expected to drop by 10
 million tons, and that even then the Lodz textile industry
 would probably have to shut down for the winter to save coal
 and also for lack of cotton.  The only exception he envisaged
 to the rule that no wage increases were possible in the im-
 mediate future was in favor of the coal miners.
 64.  Those who thought that the revisions did not go

 far enough - the so-called enrag6s - or, as Gomulka admitted,
 those "reactionary elements" which were convinced that this
 was ''only a stage on the way to something else, " were silenced
 by the frank statement:
 "Any other program is not realistic and would lead
 only to recklessness . ~ . in one way or another to
 the Hungarian situation.  This should be said boldly
 to our comrades; it should be said openly to the patriots
 who propose this or other theories; it should also be
 said to other enemies of ours who are opposing our
 Party organizations.  "
 65.  Gomulka laid part of the blame for the widespread
 disorientation in Party ranks on the false concepts. of democ-
 ratization voiced, alas, even by journalists and. writers who
 were Party members.  He warned them that they were not to
 imagine that they were above the Party leadership; unless
 they mended their ways, the Party would have to "draw organ-
 izational consequences;," that is, to tighten the censorship.
 In this respect Gomulka was in an embarrassing position,
 for it was largely to the intellectuals that he owed his suc-
 cess - and they were as conscious of the fact as he was.
 66.  Gomulka's dilemma was perhaps even more
 apparent when he spoke of collaboration with other political
 parties.  This he justified by the statement that he and his
 supporters were "creating a new form of cooperation"; they
 were building a "socialism as seen from the viewpoint of
 humanitarianism and freedom of broad masses of workers. "
 Their aim was to form one front with other "real" parties,
 the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party.  However, this
 did not mean, he said, that "the workers' class will lose its
 hegemony and that our Party will cease to be the chief leader.
 The solution he envisaged was to let the members of the other
 Parties occupy many posts in the economy, in the social
 organizations, and even in the government, "provided, how-

 ever, they supported the common program and were tech-
 nically qualified. " But, he reassured the Party secretaries,
 he would be "much more cautious when it comes to the crea-
 tion of the possibility for activity in the political sphere, "
 for, he claimed, the truth was that the anti-Communist
 elements, the followers of Mikolajczik, were "not interested
 in the economic problems but only in the fight for power. Moreover,
 " . .   a wide wave has spread over the country, a wave
 to restore al.l sorts of organizations and forms, with
 the intent of using them . . . to undermine everything
 developing in Poland.  One of them was the Union of
 Fighters, which included former Peasant Party lead-
 ers, who have in mind a bourgeois democracy. ""
 The degree of cooperation,  Gomulka concluded, would be
 determined by experience.   And he candidly admitted that he
 expected no difficulties from the Peasant Party leaders, but
 rather  from below. "  These difficulties would have to be
 overcome by intensive party work, although he did not deny
 the truth of the comrades' statements that "it is in the vil-
 lages that the situation of our Party organization is the worst.
 He thus inferentially admitted that it was bad in the cities also,
 and furthermore that the "leaders" of the allied Parties were
 actually stooges of the regime.
 67.  To bolster their sagging morale, Gomulka
 reminded the Party secretaries that all the accomplishments
 of the last few months were solely
 the result of the work of the Party.  We initiated
 it and can be proud of it . . . We did it, and no one
 else . . . And why . . . are we incapable of utilizing
 the great gains of our Party before the Party organi-
 zations, before the workers, and before the whole
 nation? "
 68.  But when he became specific, the only achieve-
 ment he mentioned was. the solution of "the question of equality
 -70-            CONFIDENTIAL

 of our relations with the Soviet Union, the question of
 sovereignty, etc. , of the liquidation of all forms of interfer-
 ences in our internal affairs . . . "  Yet only a few moments
 earlier, speaking of the line "separating us as a Party and
 those elements of political and social groups which collaborate
 with us from those, on the other hand, who want to consider
 the present situation as a stage which will lead to the restor-
 ation of capitalism, " he admitted that "when it was a matter
 of our sovereignty and our independence   . . these reaction-
 ary elements did support us. "
 69.  Whether the Party would have achieved what it
 did, or its liberal wing even have gained control of the Party
 without these "reactionary" elements, is a question Gomulka
 of course did not raise.  On the other hand, one would have
 expected him to credit the Party for another achievement, the
 resurrection of the humanitarian viewpoint in socialism.  For,
 as Przeglad Kulturalny, paraphrasing Marx, had written on
 7 November 1956, it was no small matter:  "A specter is now
 haunting Eastern Europe . . . the specter of humane social-
 ism                  and it frightens not only the capitalists, but the Stalin-
 ists too.''
 70.  The need for the Party aktiv to "rid itself of a
 certain type of doubt or disorientation . . . to acquire more
 Party, militant, and Communist courage" - a remarkable
 admission after its alleged recent triumph - was all the
 greater since Gomulka was pledged to grant the people some-
 what wider freedom of choice in the impending elections to
 the Sejm.  And he seemed particularly worried about the
 situation in the industrial establishments.  The chief task of
 the Party was now to strengthen its organization in the fac-
 tories, he said.  But the method he recommended seemed
 hardly the most likely to secure enthusiastic propagandists.
 Although he admitted that Party functionaries who were being
 dismissed under a ruling to reduce the Party apparatus

 showed great reluctance to return to the factories, he
 appealed to them to do just that in order to prove their
 "understanding of the present situation. "
 71.  After the achievement of an uneasy modus
 vivendi with the USSR, the next milestone on the "Polish road
 to socialism" was the elections to the Sejm.  The problem was
 to reconcile the promise to give the people a greater voice in
 the affairs of the nation with the necessity of assuring the
 permanence of the decidedly shaky Party dictatorship.  For
 this purpose a system was worked out under which a United
 Front, composed of the Communist Party (PZPR), the United
 Peasant Party (ZSL), the Democratic Party (SD) and Catholic
 Groups, was to agree on a common list in each constituency,
 with seven candidates for every four seats, in the order of
 their "official" preference - in other words, of their relia-
 bility as supporters of the regime - the voters having the
 right to cross out any names they rejected.  Although the dice
 were healvily loaded in favor of the Communist Party and its
 stooges,  it still remained possible to vote only for the
 minority of unreliable but popular candidates which it had not
 been deemed advisable to reject, 2 or to abstain altogether.
 The indications that this might well happen were so strong
 that Gomulka made a desperate appeal to the voters on 19 Jan-
 dacies agreed upon were as follows:
 PZPR                   50 percent
 ZSL                    25 percent
 SD                     10 percent
 Non party and          15 percent
 Catholic
 2Osubka-Morawski, a Social Democrat and former premier,
 was rejected among others for his "discordant" attitude.

 uary 1957 to vote "without deletions" for the "so-called
 central candidates, because they are the leaders of the gov-
 ernment, our Party and the other political parties, and the
 mass workers and peasants associations. " He particularly
 implored them not to delete PZPR candidates, because the
 Party was a "guarantor of neighborly, brotherly Polish-Soviet
 relations, which are the most vital interest of the Polish nation
 . . . The German Wehrmacht 50 threatening our territories
 . . . the deletion of PZPR candidates is synonymous with the
 deletion of Poland from the map of Europe. "
 72.  This straightforward recognition of the geo-
 political facts, together with the quiet but very effective
 assistance of the Catholic clergy, had the desired effect.
 The National Unity Front got 98% of the votes cast. 1  51% of
 the elected deputies were Communists, although, with the
 exception of Gomulka and Spychalski, all the Communist
 leaders ran behind non-Communist candidates, and, among
 the Communists themselves, the liberals came consistently
 ahead of Stalinists, such as Pawlak, Titkow, Musialowa, etc.
 73.  The result of the elections was of course exceed-
 ingly satisfactory for the prestige of the Gomulka regime,
 although, as Trybuna Ludu of 20 February made clear, as
 long as the central candidates had not been deleted, the Party
 leadership would not have been endangered even if the Party
 had been in the minority,  "because PZPR leadership cannot
 depend on a formal majority in the Seim. " It depended, the
 paper explained, on the fact that the Communist Party was
 "the most consistent Party of the Polish revolution" and on
 its ability "to persuade" other Sejm deputies.  Although the
 other parties were indeed "independent political movements, it
 they did "not constitute a structural opposition, " but on the
 contrary were "also fostering socialist development. 11

 74.  Gomulka's electoral success, however, was far
 from ending his difficulties.  Some were inherent in political
 and economic changeovers such as had occurred in October,
 some were inheritances from the past, others were peculiar
 to his regime.
 75.  Whatever its relative degree of liberalism, it is
 obvious that, for the time being at any rate, no Communist
 regime can function successfully, even within the limited
 possibilities of Communism, without a strong central author-
 ity, be it exercised individually or collectively.  Gomulka
 was in the curious position of having been chosen on the basis
 of his personal mythos as the compromise candidate to lead
 the nation, yet being unable to play the role effectively.  On
 the one hand, he could hardly exercise personal dictatorship
 so soon; on the other, he lacked a cohesive moderate group
 of his own within the Party Central Committee.  As usual
 after violent political upheavals, most Party leaders seemed
 to be extremists, either extreme revisionists, or extreme
 conservatives (Stalinists).  As Trybuna Ludu stated, what
 was needed was neither "the administrative monolith . . . or
 a discussion club or a coalition of mutually incessantly fight-
 ing trends, but a party rallied around a common program on
 the principles of democratic centralism. " (5 April).  And
 quoting Kolakowski, the article described as the chief weak-
 ness of the left (revisionist) wing "the fact that its negation
 only reached the level of a moral protest and not that of
 practical thought. "
 76.  The confusion at the top Party levels was natur-
 ally compounded at the lower levels.  Party officials not only
 were confused as to the correct Party line, still in the pro-
 cess of trial and error in many respects, but were demoral-
 ized owing to the uncertainty of their fate while the reduction

 of the Party apparatus and the replacement of the unreliable
 were still in progress. 1
 77.  Another inevitable consequence of the changes in
 the local party apparatus and of the emancipation of the state
 administration was a very general impairment of public
 administration and law enforcement.  Most of the administra-
 tive officials and police officers had been mere rubber stamps
 and were helpless on their own, while many of the old
 apparatchiks had been efficient, whatever their other faults.
 78.  Willy-nilly, Gomulka had to rely increasingly on
 the old Party officials who were used to discipline, in order
 to restore the effectiveness of the Party machinery, with the
 hope, by splitting the Stalinist group, of being better able to
 control those occupying official positions.
 79.  A further revealing symptom of the disorganized
 state of the Polish Communist Party, considering the impor-
 tance attached by Communists to the indoctrination of youth,
 is the weakness of the Socialist (Communist) Youth Union.
 It had acquired a membership of only 60, 000 by the end of
 April 1957, which practically leaves the field to its rivals,
 the recently created Rural Youth Union, the Polish Scouts'
 Union, and'` the Polish Students' Union.  Marian Renke, first
 secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth
 Union, writing in Trybune Ludu of 7 August, complained that
 the Union was developing under very complex and difficult
 conditions 11as the effects of past errors are very strongly
 felt by youth. " If, as Renke admits, the union could only

 develop by renouncing "its basic ideological and political
 principles" - something it obviously cannot do - its prospects
 would not appear bright.
 80.  Revisionism, spearheaded by writers and jour-
 nalists, calling for greater freedom to voice opinions con-
 sidered dangerous by the Kremlin, was of course particularly
 resented in Moscow..  Setting a harmful example was bad
 enough, even if it had to be tolerated, but propagandizing
 was worse. I Although naturally reluctant to muzzle his early
 supporters among the intellectuals, Gomulka was obliged to
 do so in order to ward off Soviet retaliation.  This could
 easily begin by taking the form of economic reprisals, as it
 did in the case of Yugoslavia.  In the absence of the hoped-
 for substantial American credits, it could be well nigh
 catastrophic, since Poland depends almost entirely on the
 USSR for such indispensable raw materials as iron ore,
 cotton and oil, quite apart from the grain needed to make up
 the 1956 and possibly future deficits. 2

 Cf. the article appearing in the March 1957 issue of the
 Rumanian Party magazine Lupta de Clasa, stating, in a clear
 allusion to Polish writers, that "certain ideologists abroad
 have a tendency to negate the necessity of forming and develop-
 ing the socialist masses finder the conditions of the dictator-
 ship of the proletariat . . . They allege that once social
 ownership is established over the means of production, this
 process unfolds itself spontaneously. " The Party periodical
 called this "a profoundly damaging revisionist thesis.
 2Under the Polish-Soviet trade agreement concluded in April
 1957, the USSR is to supply 96% of Poland's oil needs, 66%
 of her iron ore, 72% of her cotton, and 100% of her nickel
 needs.  On the other hand, the USSR agreed to import far
 more Polish machinery and less raw materials than hereto-
 fore, according to a Warsaw broadcast of 22 April 1957.

 81.  Some time in February, a behind-the-scene
 agreement had reportedly been reached between Gomulka and
 Moscow to take steps toward ending the exchange of recrim-
 ination in the press.  The editors of the principal party papers,
 Zycie Warszawy and Trybuna Ludu, were replaced, in the
 latter case by Leon Kasman, who had once held the position
 under Bierut.  K. Draczkowski, an avowed Stalinist, was
 appointed assistant editor of Sztandar Ludu, and all Polish
 editors were strongly admonished by Gomulka to moderate
 their "irresponsible" campaign, for otherwise Moscow would
 be at his throat.  Foreign Minister Rapacki's. hurried trip to
 Moscow in March, ostensibly to sign a minor frontier treaty,
 was generally interpreted as proof that, as Education Minis-
 ter Bienkowski privately stated,  "the situation was very grave.
 82.  In a further attempt to placate the Kremlin,
 Gomulka agreed for the first time (in a statement to a Hungar-
 ian journalist on 15 March 1957) that "counter-revolutionary
 forces launched a mad attempt to overthrow the socialist
 system . . . just when Hungary had stepped onto the road of
 the correction of past mistakes. " What Moscow wanted,
 however, was not an obviously opportunistic official state-
 ment but an end to the dangerous airing of unorthodox views
 in the Polish press.  This was made perfectly clear in a
 Pravda article of 6 April, which quoted approvingly publica-
 tions such as Zycie Partii, Nowe Drogi and Trybuna Robot-
 nitza,  These had criticized articles in Po Prostu, Sztandar
 Mlodych, and other papers for their "revisionist, r" "liquida-
 tionist" and "anti.-Marxist" tendencies, specifically:
 "incorrect" evaluation of the Hungarian revolution, advocacy
 of greater freedofn of expression and "renunciation of the
 leading role of the Party, " criticism of the "apparatus of
 authority in general, " incorrect views on the relationship
 between socialism and capitalism, and frequent manifesta-
 tions of nationalism and attacks on Soviet practices.  Pravda
 did not have to specify that it agreed with "certain papers
 and journals" which considered

 "that the struggle against forces hostile to socialism
 must at the present time become the main aspect of
 the ideologic struggle of Party organizations . . .
 Revisionism . . . has grown into liquidationism and
 has attempted to force the Party to capitulate in the
 face of the reactionary forces."
 'Less than a week later, on 12 April, Trybuna Ludu came out
 with a strong condemnation of revisionism which produced
 immediate results.
 The Ninth Plenum,  15-18 May 1957
 83.  Having apparently realized that there was nothing
 to be gained by further postponement, Gomulka convened. the
 overdue Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party on
 15 May 1957.  Its tasks, as stated by Gomulka in his opening
 speech, were to
 " tell the party and the working class what they must do
 and how they must proceed to build socialism in our
 country in accordance with the new directions mapped
 out by the Eighth Plenum . . . and to draw the appro-
 priate conclusions from various phenomena we observe
 in our life . . . The essential meaning of the Eighth
 Plenum was that it broke away from the bad methods
 of socialist construction, from the bad ways and
 means of exercising power and that it corrected the
 party policy in such a way as to make socialist con-
 struction the living creative work of the working
 masses . .    if
 84.  Workers wanted socialism, Gomulka claimed,
 not only to feel free from exploitation but also because "they
 connect with socialism their hope for a speedy improvement
 of their existence. " But he had to concede that this hope
 conflicted with the need to expand productive forces rapidly
 and that "the socialization of the means of production and the

 transition to a planned economy alone" might not "in given
 conditions, exert any great influence on changes in the mode
 of thought of the working class. "  To achieve the necessary
 "socialist consciousness, " one had to increase the workers'
 participation "in the every-day management of the national
 economy and the local administration of the state. " As the
 chief factors influencing the consciousness of workers were
 "the specific, national conditions in the development of the
 proletariat in each country, "  Gomulka seemed to argue that
 in Poland at any rate this participation was necessary.
 Furthermore, it was perfectly permissible, inasmuch as,
 "although socialism is universal, the forms of its construc-
 tion are shaped by the concrete conditions prevailing in a
 given time and place" . . . and it was necessary "on the basis
 of one's own and other nations' experiences . . . to look for
 new forms or to improve the old forms
 85.  The three new forms outlined by the Eighth
 Plenum "in order to unify the working class with socialism
 . . . and to bring the peasants closer to socialism" were:
 workers' councils, expansion of the powers of people's coun-
 cils, and the development of various forms of peasant self-
 management.  At this point Gomulka felt the need to define
 the meaning of the expression "national road to socialism.
 His involved explanation can be boiled down to the assertion
 that although the essence of socialism lay in its international
 character, its aims embracing all mankind, "the road - in
 other words, the ways of construction of socialism - in a
 given country and the road followed by the Soviet Union" could
 be different.  To prove it, Gomulka, after covering himself
 by quoting the relevant thesis of the 20th Congress, repeated
 the familiar explanation that the historical conditions under
 which socialism had to be built in the .USSR and Poland, as
 well. as the national characteristics of the two peoples, were
 different.  Mechanical imitation of the USSR might have been
 justified when other countries lacked direct experience and
 relations were unequal during the cult of personality period,
 but it was no longer so.

 86.  But, Gomulka continued,
 i'. . . the stress on the national characteristics and on
 the historical differences in socialist construction
 must not mean the denial of the general regularity of
 the universal principles deduced from the experiences
 of socialist construction in the Soviet Union   . . The
 under-estimating or negating of the general regularities
 in socialist construction which have been experienced
 in the Soviet Union is nationalist revisionism.  It must
 be combatted .   . for it has nothing in common with
 socialism. 'I,
 87.  It followed, according to Gomulka, that the
 "road to socialism" should be based on general fundamental
 and common principles, and in this sense was international,
 but it also presupposed a national understructure peculiar to
 each country, and in this sense was national.  To justify this
 view, Gomulka recalled Lenin's oft-quoted dictum on the sub-
 ject.                                For the misguided "contemporary scientific theorists"
 who parroted bourgeois politicians and called the Polish road
 to socialism "national Communism" Gomulka had nothing but
 scorn and sarcasm.
 88.  Gomulka then attempted to answer the obvious
 question:  what were the general fundamental principles which
 had to be followed in every country in order to establish
 socialism?    There were four:
 a.  Organization of a Marxist-Leninist party of
 the working masses, observing the principles of
 democratic centralism and of alliance between the
 workers and peasants.
 b.  After the overthrow of the bourgeois ruling
 class, the establishment of the. proletarian dictator-
 ship over the former exploiters.

 c.  Socialization of the capitalist means of
 production, gradual transformation of rural produc-
 tion relations, and central planning and management
 of the entire economy.
 d.  Observance of the principles of proletarian
 internationalism, of the equality and sovereignty of
 all states. and nations, and of unity to oppose imperial-
 ist aggression.
 A further essential condition was the direction of these pro-
 cesses by the Marxist- Leniniot workers' party, which had
 therefore to be strengthened by every means.
 89.  Having thus disposed of his critics both on the
 right and on the left, Gomulka proceeded to discuss the
 "three important elements of the Polish road to socialism"
 he had already mentioned.  Considering what Gomulka had to
 say with regard to the workers' councils, it seems difficult
 to consider them an important element of anything.  For while
 he admitted that "the pattern of workers' councils had been
 developed in accordance with the will of the working class
 . as an instrument for the administration of its enter-
 prises and the national economy, " he contended that trade
 unions and works councils could serve just as well. In this
 he was undoubtedly correct, if the workers' councils are
 granted no more than the limited "rights" he enumerated,
 which practically boiled down to the right to do everything
 possible to increase production and reduce costs.  In other
 words, the popular workers' councils were to act as pinch-
 hitters for the discredited trade unions.  This was a far cry
 from the Yugoslav model from which he agreed the Polish
 concept had stemmed, but which had to be developed along
 a different line, for, he claimed, if the factories became
 cooperative enterprises of workers it would mean the adop-
 tion of a capitalist organization, with additional disadvantages.

 90.  Obviously realizing that it would be dangerous to
 discard the workers' councils altogether, Gomulka outlined a
 program which would in fact reduce them to mere auxiliaries
 of the trade unions.  The councils were to take over many of
 the unions' duties and depend on them for their financial needs.
 Even then he stressed the requirement that the local party
 organization "point out to the workers . . .ose candidate
 whose election would be the best guarantee of successful work
 He practically admitted that the workers could not be
 trusted:
 The working class is not monolithic . . . it partly
 consists of new workers, of youths who came to town
 from the villages .     partly of people who were
 forced to leave other social strata.  This variety of
 our working class, in the conditions of general weak-
 ening of its devotion to its ideals as a result of the
 upheavals recently experienced by the working move-
 ment, forms a favorable ground for the penetration
 into its ranks of alien, in the class sense, and fre-
 quently hostile influences, for the spreading of all
 kinds of demagogy . . . Among the members of the
 councils there are ideologically alien elements, brought
 up on the crest of the wave of October.  These elements
 should be kept out . . .   "
 91.  Having thus disposed of his fellow-riders on the
 October wave, Gomulka turned to the second important
 element in the Polish road to socialism, the powers of the
 local people's councils.  In essence, what Gomulka recom-
 mended was the implementation of the decisions of 1950 and
 1955 and their supplementation in the sense of increasing the
 powers and financial resources of the councils and reorgan-
 izing their administrative apparatus to make them more
 efficient.  One of their important duties would be to manage
 some local industries which had previously been run -
 inefficiently - from the center.  Precautions should be taken,
 however, "to insure that councils on the higher level have
 precedence over councils on the lower levels. "

 92.  The third element of the Polish road to socialism,
 described by Gomulka as. "the radical turning point in the
 policy of the Party" taken by the Eighth Plenum, and as "the
 most difficult task of socialist construction, " was the "social-
 ist reconstruction. of the countryside" on new lines.  The
 difficulty stemmed from the fact that the socialist form of
 agriculture, the producers' cooperatives, had for the most
 part "not withstood the tests of life. " The solution Gomulka
 recommended was, besides continuing to encourage producers'
 cooperatives by granting them the cheapest rates for MTS
 services, the lowest taxes and the most favorable credit terms,
 to develop as. extensively as possible lower forms of collective
 activity, such as producers' associations and agricultural
 circles, by offering them financial advantages denied to
 individual farmers.
 93.  The qualms of the Natolin critics who pointed to
 ZSL collaboration in the agricultural legislation and predicted
 the resurgence of capitalism in the form of rich peasants. were
 allayed by the assurance that "the government not only can,
 but if need be, will, effectively counteract the excessive
 enrichment of a small stratum of exploiters in the country-
 side. " Gomulka also reminded these critics that they had no
 other program, for the simple reason. that no better one could
 be devised, and he assured them that they could safely trust
 the ZSL.  In fact, he practically let the cat out of the bag by
 complaining that the former error of the Party in "dominat-
 ing" instead of "leading" the ZSL had greatly reduced its
 influence among the peasants and had therefore harmed the
 Party.  Now, Gomulka said, "we do not violate its party
 sovereignty . . . We consider   he ZSL an ally and there-
 fore want its ranks to grow. " But at the same time he uttered
 a stern warning-  The Party was greatly worried by the
 "accidental penetration Lof the ZS   by elements alien and
 even hostile to socialism" to which certain ZSL. leaders
 showed tolerance and leniencyp. Adherents of the "bankrupt"

 Mikolajczyk and other emigr&s were "beginning to raise their
 heads ever more boldly . . . This cannot be tolerated . . .
 The alliance between the Party and the ZSL and the SD,
 Gomulka stated emphatically, was based on the principle of
 strengthening and developing socialism in Poland.  This made
 it perfectly clear that Gomulka's idea was to exploit the
 popularity of the old ZSL and SD party labels for the sole
 benefit of the Communists, while sternly repressing their
 authentic ideologies.
 94.  Toward the Church, Gomulka's attitude was
 realistic. He admitted that the Party's agreement with the
 Church was "not in accordance with its world outlook, " but
 he claimed that it could not use "administrative pressure
 toward believers" and that the "old quarrel . . . pushed
 millions of believers away from socialism. " The only solu-
 tion was therefore coexistence:  the state would not interfere
 with Church in matters of faith, and expected the Church. to
 "recognize" the change in Poland's social system.
 95.  From a review of ways of improving the mariag-
 ment of the state and of the country's economy, Gomulka
 proceeded to the discussion of what he termed the most
 important problem:  the Party, on whose "strength, stability,
 ideological position, and influence on the masses" everything
 else depended.  To make a long, confused, and contradictory
 Marxist story short, the gist of what Goniulka had to say on
 the subject was that it was "impossible . . . to pretend that
 one cannot see the political influences of the bourgeoisie on
 the non-bourgeois strata of the population, " that the Party
 was the main obstacle preventing the bourgeoisie and re-
 action from abusing democratic freedoms" and that therefore
 the greater the strength of the Party . . . the broader
 democratic freedoms will be. "
 96.  The strength of the Party depended mainly,
 Gomulka continued, on the unity of its ranks, which could

 only be based on "democratic centralism." Discussion and
 criticism were of course permissible and desirable, but they
 had to be "creative, " and no Party member had the right
 "to express outside. the Party his convictions not conforming
 to the convictions of the majority . . . , to the policy out-
 lined by the Party organs .    . " Those who did not agree
 had to resign or be excluded.
 97.  To underline that necessity, Gomulka recalled
 that prior to the Eighth Plenum, the violation of the democratic
 centralism principle, combined with great policy mistakes,
 had produced "mistrust of Party organizations in the leader-
 ship, ideological chaos in the Party, the emergence of various
 mutually opposed groups - which in sum amounted to a split in
 Party unity. "  The crisis came about "to no small extent" as
 a result of an external event, the "exposure of the cult of the
 individual, " intensified by the Poznan events.  The Seventh
 Plenums decisions were correct, in Gomulka's opinion, but
 did not succeed in improving the situation.  "In the circum-
 stances existing at that time it was impossible to overcome
 the political crisis except by means of internal struggle"
 between "forces striving for renascence of the Party" and
 the "real and sometimes imaginary representatives of con-
 servative ossification. " Apparently Gomulka considered this
 to have been a special case in which an exception to the rule
 of settling differences of opinion by a simple majority vote
 had been justified.
 98.  Fortunately, Gomulka continued, the Eighth
 Plenum put the Party back on the right road and the re-
 organized Politburo "is already acting as a monolith".  But,
 he admitted, "the Party is still weak, like a convalescent
 after a grave illness, " a weakness, he added cryptically,
 which "does not allow the Party to exploit fully the cause of
 socialism, internationaliram, and the strengthening of Polish-
 Soviet friendship and the great and most important achieve-
 ments of the Eighth Plenum which found their expression in
 the Polish-Soviet declaration of 18 November 1956. "

 99.  The weakness of the Party, Gomulka said, encour-
 aged the activity of reactionary, petit-bourgeois, and rebellious
 forces, which, under the cover of the Eighth Plenum, attacked
 the Party and "honest and active members under the false
 slogan of struggle against Stalinists. " Unfortunately, in spite
 of the successful Sejm elections, the Party still was confronted
 with ideological confusion, "the efficiency of various false
 theories, " i. e. revisionism, and a tendency to deny democratic
 centralism, by accepting democracy but rejecting centralism.
 There were even Party members who had lost socialism in the
 search for new roads to it and who even "unambiguously express
 their longing for capitalism.
 100.  To illustrate the extremes to which revisionism
 could go, Gomulka then launched into a violent diatribe against
 Kolakowski, who wanted "integral democracy, " also now
 referred to as "the free play of political forces. " But, he
 contended, Kolakowski could not deny that this would create
 the threat of a revival of capitalism and of civil war.  Could
 anyone believe this would consolidate Poland's western
 frontiers?  No responsible Pole, Gomulka concluded, could
 "subject the fate of Poland and the Polish nation to a lottery
 called internal democracy. " There was no need to evaluate
 the theories of other revisionists like Zimand and Woroszylski.
 All derived "from the same bourgeois ideology under whose
 influence social democratic ideology was formed.
 101.  Here Gomulka felt himself obliged to define
 "revisionism." According to him,  "revisionism is a dis-
 tortion of Marxism by the introduction into its teachings of
 erroneous and false theses which do not correctly define
 social reality . . . " and "do not correspond to the laws
 governing the development of society . . . ER evisionists
 do not recognize the leading role of the Party, do not recog-
 nize democratic centralism, and dispute the essence of the
 class struggle. " It was true, Gomulka agreed, that Lenin

 had."revised and developed Marxism" and that "some prin-
 ciples of Marxism were also revised by the 20th.CPSU .
 Congress, " but nobody called them revisionist "because
 amendments to Marxism reflecting actual life or a changed
 life do not constitute revisionism. " Later on, when the bour-
 geois class forces became unable to threaten the socialist
 system, one might well imagine that there would be freedom
 for all political opinions.  But that was not true today, and
 revisionism was "the ideology of capitulation.before the dif-
 ficulties of socialist conjstruction, before the class enemy
 "  In its essence, revisionism aimed t"at a return to
 the past while pretending to pave the way for the future. "

 "in the face of its class opponent" were, Gomulka continued,
 dogmatism and conservatism.  Dogmatism was "a kind of
 collection. of obdurate conceptions which were created under
 definite historic conditions"' - in other words, dogmatism
 was. the rejection of the revisions deemed desirable. by Gomulka.
 There were, he said, quite a few "ideological dogmatists" in
 the Party, who created confusion but, even so, were not
 dangerous. for Party life.  Really dangerous. for the Party,
 Gomulka asserted, were the conservatives.  The conservative
 group included the dogmatists, but was chiefly made up of the
 "wide-scale party membership, " which was unable "to make
 use of the political methods of work. "  The overwhelming
 majority of the Party aktiv was in complete agreement. with
 the Eighth Plenum decisions, but still could not work in the
 new way, and sought refuge in p .s sivity.  What Gomulka
 feared was a "revival of tendencies to solve all kinds of con-
 flicts by force instead of by persuasion .                          .. "" Experience
 taught that a policy "divorced from reality, dogmatic and
 sectarian, can be pursued only by applying force and compul-
 sion .. ... including towards one's own class.  1117 is a 11
 serious mistake . . .

 103.  Gomulka conceded that "a considerable per-
 centage" of the Party membership consisted of people who
 were "only formally members, " took no part in Party work,
 failed to attend meetings or to pay their dues.  If efforts to
 turn them into "real members" failed, they should be dropped,
 for quality was more important than quantity.   He clearly
 implied, however, that the Party membership included too
 few workers and peasants.  He demanded greater attention
 to its "social composition" and urged "greatest caution . . .
 in dealing with workers and peasants" when dropping "formal
 members, " except in enterprises where they constituted a
 considerable percentage.  It was apparently better to have
 "formal" worker and peasant members than none at all.
 104.  Party unity, although indispensable, was of
 course not enough, Gomulka continued, and he proceeded to
 enumerate the familiar requirements of a good and efficient
 party apparatus, closely tied to the masses.  Gomulka
 demanded from the Party no less than that it should "con-
 vince the working people on every issue which causes them
 to have any doubts . . . "   After that, it is difficult to blame
 the "conservatives" who either used "administrative work
 methods" or "remained passive. "
 105.  Gomulka then made some brief remarks con-
 cerning the economic situation.  He stressed the impossibility
 of further wage increases in the near future and the difficulties
 being experienced in balancing foreign trade as a result of the
 increased demand for consumer goods which had to be imported.
 With regard to strikes, he said that the Party was against them
 but would not use administrative methods against them.  The
 differences were to be solved by discussions.
 106.  In the concluding part of his speech Gomulka
 reverted to the theme of inter-Party relations.  He reaffirmed
 his contention that differences of opinion were natural and
 inevitable, but could be settled by friendly discussions "on a

 platform of recognition of the common laws" which must be
 applied "in the struggle for the overthrow of the capitalist
 order." He promised to Iplace in the forefront everything
 which unites us .   . putting aside whatever divides us, and
 letting time furnish a solution,"
 107.  Gomulka energetically repudiated any attempts
 to sow discord between Poland and the USSR.
 " Our Party most resolutely condemns everything
 directed against the unity of the camp of socialist
 states, everything that undermines Polish-Soviet
 friendship and alliance, or that violates the prin-
 ciples. of /proletariat internationalism     . The
 prospects for our country's Lconomi~~ development
 are also based on the prospects of the development
 of the Soviet Union.
 108..  Gomulka made another bow in the direction of
 Moscow, declaring that differences from other parties   in
 our appreciation of events in Hungary 2id7 not change the
 common point of view  hat thT Soviet Army's help in sup-
 pressing counterrevolution was a regrettable but unavoidable
 necessity. " Moscow may, however, have been less pleased
 with his reference to the development of the creative teach-
 ing of Marxism-Leninism by the Chinese Communist Party
 and "its profound link with the people . . . The thesis of the
 hundred blooming flowers also constitutes a bold step which
 had until now been unknown in the practice of the construction
 of socialism in other countries. "
 109.  Gomulka summed up his policy by reasserting
 Polish solidarity with the "entire revolutionary movement of
 the working class throughout the world . . . We reject . . .
 all attempts to distort our ideology with any form of national-
 ism or revisionism, or to distort it by stagnant dogmatism.
 We reject . . . all the absurd attempts to seek 'national Com-
 munism' in our party . .   "

 110.  Although Gomulka had made it abundantly clear
 that he would not go along with the revisionists, and it was
 generally expected that this would satisfy the conservatives,
 the next day's debates revealed that they actually wanted a
 return to the status quo ante. According to newspaper reportsl
 the right-wing leaders Mijal, Klosiewicz, Lapot, Ruminski,
 Dworakowski, 2 etc. argued in effect that there could be no
 Polish road to socialism, that the agricultural policy was
 wrong, that Gomulka's "road is a return to capitalism [and-7
 capitulation to the Roman Catholic Church. " They demanded,
 among other things, that the press be muzzled even more
 tightly than heretofore, that the final resolution contain a
 specific recognition of Soviet leadership of the Communist
 bloc and an outright condemnation of the Hungarian "counter-
 revolution, " etc.
 111.  Apparently surprised and angered by the fierce-
 ness of the right-wing attack, Gomulka, supported by Zam-
 browski, Ochab, and others, counter-attacked strongly.
 Zambrowski suddenly discovered that the revisionists, although
 still representing the greatest overall danger, were only an
 ideological danger, while in practice the greatest present
 threat came from the "conservatives., " Ochab defended the
 freedom of the press.
 112.  Gomulka is reported to have declared the debate
 had convinced him that dogmatism and revisionism were equal
 dangers, and proceeded to answer Mijal point by point.  He
 appeared particularly aroused by Mijal's charge that his
 policy violated proletarian internationalism, meaning that it
 denied Soviet leadership.  Gomulka asked whether true inter-

 nationalism consisted in blind obedience to the Soviet Union
 and whether the liquidation of the old Polish Communists in
 1937, the devastation of the Western provinces, the lies
 spread about Yugoslavia, anti-semitism, etc. were the
 proper manifestations of internationalism.  He even went so
 far as to remark that in Budapest the "leading" position had
 been occupied by Soviet tanks .and to imply that the last thing
 he wanted to see in Poland was Communism fighting reaction
 with..the support of Russian forces.  Finally he defied Mijal
 to go to a_ factory. and speak to the workers about "Soviet
 leadership in the Socialist camp. " He would see the sort of
 reception he would get.  Gomulka 'ended by threatening to
 publish the full record of the speeches.  Thereupon Mijal
 capitulated, withdrawing all his charges and urging that his
 own speech be suppressed.  One may ask, however, how
 Gomulka's threat could be reconciled with the rule he had
 laid down in his first speech, that all discussions between
 Communists should remain private.
 113.  Mijal's capitulation apparently mollified
 Gomulka and his followers, for the final resolution adopted
 by the Ninth. Plenum stated inter alias
 "In the present situation, revisionism constitutes the
 main ideological danger in the Party, for it undermine
 the ideological and political unity of the Party, and
 sows, disbelief in the correctness and advisability of
 .socialist construction among the party ranks and the
 working class.  While continuing the struggle against
 manifestations: of dogmatism and paying the road for
 creative Marxism, it is imperative to oppose with
 full strength any manifestations of departure. from our
 own ideology; it is necessary to combat them in Party
 propaganda, in the press, at universities and at
 research institutions.
 114.  Although in the above passage, "revisionism"
 is declared the main danger, the rest of the resolution makes

 it clear that revisionists and reactionaries are now inter-
 changeable words.  "Reactionary elements" are accused of
 having, after the Eighth Plenum, "let loose a witch-hunt
 against Party activists, under the slogan of the fight against
 so-called Stalinists, " the aim of these attacks being "to slow
 up the framework L:,5 i_7 of the people's democracy in order
 to go on to 'the next stage' - to undermine the socialist
 achievements of the working people, to change the direction
 of Poland's development back toward bourgeois power, toward
 capitalism. " The Resolution also made it clear that "all
 attempts to reestablish bourgeois parties and organizations,
 as well as attempts by forces hostile to socialism to infiltrate
 into our allied parties" would be opposed.
 115.  With regard to relations with other members
 of the Bloc, the Resolution reaffirmed the "demand for full
 respect of the sovereignty of People's Poland, and choosing
 the road of the construction of a new socialist system cor-
 responding to Polish conditions. " However, it "'linked up
 this attitude inseparably with proletarian internationalism"
 and "determinedly opposed the national interpretation of the
 idea of sovereignty, as being contrary to the international
 solidarity of socialist states and to the Polish-Soviet alliance."
 116.  Significant for conditions within the Party were
 the following passages:
 "The Party must overcome the organizational inertia
 that has crept into many Party organizations.  It is
 impossible to condone a state of affairs in which they
 do not hold meetings for whole months at a time, in
 which their members are not executing any Party
 tasks, in which many Party bodies do not refer to
 these organizations or to their activists, in which they
 are given no guidance and no concrete directives, in
 which no ideological schooling is conducted and Party
 members are not encouraged to take part in political
 life .

 "A situation cannot be tolerated in which the most
 valuable activists of the Party stand aloof from Party
 life. . . Only with the assistance of these activists
 . . , can the Party bodies and their apparatus estab-
 lish close ties with the work establishments, with the
 workers - the principal base of the Party."
 117.  The Resolution warned
 "'.       all. those who, against the appeal of the Party
 leadership, would choose any forms of group and
 factional activity, that sanctions will be taken against
 them, reaching as far as exclusion from Party ranks.
 The Party cannot tolerate: its members publicly pro-
 claiming views. opposed to its political line, or appeals
 to public opinion against the resolution of the Party."
 118.  The rest of the Resolution was a restatement,
 in slightly modified form, of the recommendations made by
 Gomulkai in his initial speech.  Noteworthy was the admission
 that speculation, corruption, bribery, thefts, and waste,
 which had spread recently "as a result of the relaxation of
 control and discipline, as well as because they can be done
 with impunity and are tolerated by the organs called upon to
 combat all kinds of abuses" - in other words, by the Party
 organizations too - had become "acute social plagues. "
 119.  Two significant decisions were taken: by the
 Plenum-. Berman and Radkiewicz got off with a three-year
 exclusion from the Party.  The special investigating com-
 mittee found that "they were not aware of the system of
 criminal methods of investigation and of foreign evidences
 practiced in the 10th Department of the Ministry of Public
 Security" but that they had failed to discharge their duties
 "in the field of political supervision and guidance over the
 work of the security organs. "

 120.  The other decision was to appoint Morawski and
 Kliszko, two of Gomulka's most devoted followers, to the
 Central Committee secretariat.  Although Ochab was
 "released" from the secretariat, Gomulka's influence over
 the Party machinery was considerably strengthened.
 Relations with other Communist Countries
 121.  The peaceful revolution in Poland affected not
 only the relations between that country and the USSR but
 relations with other Communist countries as well.
 122.  Tito, in his Pula speech on 11 November 1956,
 is authority for the statement that the Polish. events were the
 cause of the untimely end of the second Soviet-Yugoslav
 honeymoon.      "When the Poznan affair happened, there occurred
 among the Soviet people a sudden change of attitude toward us.
 They started to prove colder.  They thought that we, the Yugo-
 slavs, were to blame.  Yes, we are to blame .   . because
 /Yugoslavia's7 acts reverberate even beyond our country. .   "
 123.   Conversely, Polish-Yugoslav relations had been
 extremely cordial although Gomulka was careful to avoid
 provoking Moscow by emphasizing them, and Tito of course
 understood his position.  Any public manifestations which
 might have provoked suspicion in Moscow were carefully
 avoided until Gomulka's September 1957 visit to Belgrade.
 It was hardly a coincidence that it followed closely upon Tito's
 Bucharest meeting with Khrushchev and therefore no surprise
 that the speeches, particularly Gomulka's, betrayed an
 extreme anxiety to reassure the Kremlin that -no anti-Moscow
 faction was being set up which would violate the agreement
 presumably reached in Bucharest.
 124.  As for Polish relations with the other Satellites,
 Tito was undoubtedly right when he declared at Pula that he
 could not say "that this positive development in Poland has

 met with much.joy in the remaining countries of the 'socialist
 camp'.  No, they criticize it secretly, but to some extent
 openly as well. " Tito was of course referring to the Com-
 munist leaders, not to the people of those countries.
 125.    Some students of Communist affairs believe
 that China played an important role in the Polish developments.
 The New York Times, in an editorial of 18 April 1957, went
 so far as to claim that
 'last September, the seeds of October's peaceful
 revolution were fertilized in Peiping when Mao Tse-
 tung and Chou En-lai told Edward Ochab they would
 support Polish independence of the Soviet Union.
 Without that support it is unlikely that Ochab and his
 colleagues would have dared to stand up to Khrush-
 chev .      "
 The editorial then mentioned Chou En-lai's visit to Warsaw
 in January 1957 and the endorsement of the Polish changes
 given on 11 April to Premier Cyrankiewicz at the close of
 his visit to Peiping.  It added that the Poles were assured
 they could count on Peiping's continued support but were
 asked only not to talk so much and to take care "to make
 obeisance before Moscow's verbal formulae. "  The editorial
 expressed doubt that the Soviet leaders were pleased by these
 developments, yet believed they had had to accept them to
 avoid destroying the public image of unity.
 126.  It may be pointed out, however, that on the very
 same day, Chou En-lai also expressed to a Nepszab.adsag
 correspondent his "great satisfaction that       the Hungarian
 people have succeeded in defeating the insurrection led by the
 imperialist and counterrevolutionary forces." While the
 Polish-Chinese communique failed to mention Soviet leader-
 ship, Chou En-lai referred to "the solidarity of the socialist
 camp, guided by the USSR" in his interview with the Hungar-
 ian journalist.  Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that
 the Chinese would have been prepared to break with Moscow
 for the sake of the liberalization of Poland, or that anything
 less would have been of decisive influence in Moscow or

 Warsaw.  It may also be noted that, while according to
 Philippe Ben in Le Monde of 2 March 1957 Chou En-lai
 encouraged the Poles to assert greater independence from
 Moscow and offered advice on the best way to proceed, he
 mentioned no promise of assistance, either direct or indirect,
 presumably for the very good reason that China could not
 supply either food, raw materials, or military assistance
 against Germany, and would have no reason to break with the
 USSR over Poland after having swallowed the repression in
 Hungary.  But that does not mean that the Chinese leaders do
 not sympathize with the "different roads to socialism" prin-
 ciple, as implied by their statement of 1 November 1956 and
 Mao Tse-tung's "100 flowers" principle, nor that they do not
 exert themselves to mediate between Warsaw and Moscow,
 nor that their views do not carry considerable weight in Mos-
 cow.  The Chinese appear to have influenced developments in
 Poland, chiefly by the fact that until June 1957 when the
 "counter-criticism" campaign started in earnest in China:
 the Polish liberals derived great encouragement from their
 illusions as to the support they were getting and could expect
 to get from Peiping.

 a.  The Polish Road to Socialism
 The chief characteristics of the Polish road to social-
 ism,, as they emerge from Gomulka's speech of 15 May 1957
 and other authoritative sources, can be listed as follows:
 respect for Polish sovereignty; peace with the Church; a new
 agricultural policy; greater freedom of expression; workers'
 councils; increased powers for local councils; legalization of
 small private trade and crafts  -  and, above all, humaneness,
 With regard to Polish sovereignty, it is obvious that
 a nation which is not free to change its basic political and
 social institutions or its foreign policy, as Gomulka himself
 repeatedly admitted, enjoys only the trappings, but not the
 substance of sovereignty.    What the Poles have gained since
 October 1956 is freedom from the cruder forms of Russian
 interference and toleration of a limited latitude in the inter-
 pretation. of Marxist-Leninist principles.  The change is un-
 doubtedly a. sop to Polish pride and susceptibilities, but it is
 the form of Russian domination which has changed, not the
 substance.
 A more profound. change has come about in the economic
 relations between the Soviet Union and Poland.  Instead of
 being an object of exploitation, Poland has become a recipient
 of Soviet assistance   However, this reversal was not peculiar
 to the relations of Poland with the Soviet Union; rather, it
 occurred in all the Satellites except relatively prosperous
 Czechoslovakia.  The USSR would be compelled to do the same
 for any of its component republics if economic hardships pro-
 duced a dangerous degree of disaffection.  While it is of course
 more agreeable for a country to be assisted than to be exploited,
 nevertheless the net effect of Poland's reliance on Soviet raw
 materials, supplied on credit, increases its dependence on
 Moscow and may well outweigh the formal gains achieved in the
 matter of sovereignty.

 In making peace with the Church, Gomulka could
 invoke a precedent set by the Kremlin itself when it gave up
 militant anticlericalism during the war.  But, taking specific
 Polish conditions into account, notably the much stronger
 hold exercised over its faithful by the Catholic Church than
 the Orthodox, he carried the policy considerably further.
 Gomulka recognized, like many rulers before him, that one
 cannot eradicate strong religious beliefs by force, and that
 the fight against religion, instead of smoothing the path, of
 Communism, had increased the hostility of the population
 and sapped the indispensable foundation of morality, which,
 as Nowe Drogi of May 1957 recognized, Communism was
 unable to supply.  The periodical wisely agreed that Com-
 munism could hope to supplant religion only by making man
 happier:
 'The more man's life is secure from the economic
 angle and the less he has to fear from authorities
 whom he feels to be alien and un-understanding, the
 less he will turn to divine intercession . . . We must
 question religion from a scientific, rational, mater-
 ialistic angle . . . The opposition of one fanaticism
 to another has never done any good. "
 The Catholic Church, on the other hand, has in modern
 times quite consistently followed the principle "Give unto
 Caesar . .    " So long as the state does not interfere with
 religion and the clergy, the Church has no cause to oppose
 the state actively.  There is no reason for the Church to
 reject the coexistence offered by Gomulka, which seems to
 grant it a better situation than it enjoys in some non-Commun-
 ist countries.
 The new Polish agricultural policy is a serious devia-
 tion from the Soviet model, but not from Leninism.  As a
 matter of fact, it does not differ as radically as might seem
 at first sight from the policy followed since Stalin's death in

 other Communist countries. (Rumania, for instance) which
 have never claimed to follow their own road to socialism.
 Favoring "simpler forms of peasants' association, " as a step-
 ping stone to the higher forms, and assisting individual peas ants,
 have been official policy in Rumania since 1954; Poland goes a
 little further by encouraging the growth of individual farms and
 the private acquisition of farm machinery.  On the other hand,
 the Polish government has so far only reduced compulsory
 deliveries while the Rumanian government, not to mention the
 Hungarian, actually abolished them in December 1956.  The
 official policy of both governments remains to offer financial
 inducements to peasants joining collective farms, but it is true
 that the Poles have encouraged the dissolution of uneconomic
 collectives, while the Rumanians have made this exceedingly
 difficult.  The Rumanian Communist press, however, has
 admitted that many farms classified as belonging to "the
 socialized sector of agriculture" are socialized on paper only,
 and it may well be that the proportion of real collective farms
 is not much greater today in Rumania than in Poland
 It is true that private economy in agriculture does not
 fit very well into the Communist pattern, but Gomulka took
 his stand on Communist realism:  coercion of the peasants
 failed to produce food, food was indispensable, and coercion
 had therefore to be abandoned.  The regime would still encour-
 age voluntary cooperation and collectivization, continue its
 educational work, and trust that in time most of the peasants
 would join.  If not, it could not be helped, and the "dictator-
 ship of the proletariat" would, if need be,  "effectively counter-
 act the excessive enrichment of a small stratum of exploiters
 in the countryside. " In other words, even if the regime could
 not force Communism on the villages, it felt confident that it
 could keep capitalism within narrow limits.
 Gomulka can argue that his farm policy does not run
 counter to any of Lenin's rules, and that besides, it continues
 to offer every inducement to collectivization.  There is

 nothing more he can be asked to do, for the abandonment of
 forcible collectivization in the Satellites had been sanctioned,
 in theory at any rate, by the Kremlin itself in 1953.  The
 peasants, although they never will embrace Communism, can
 be expected in the foreseeable future to get along with its
 dominance in the cities, provided their economic interests
 are satisfied and they are otherwise left alone, free to farm
 cooperatively or individually at their choice.
 As has been pointed out above, the workers' councils
 are, for the time being, at any rate, prevented from playing
 any important part in the economy.  The increased powers for
 local councils are in line with the trend in other Satellite
 countries and are therefore not peculiar to Poland.  The same
 is true of the legalization of small private trade, of small
 service enterprises, and of handicrafts.  Poland seems to have
 gone further than most other Satellites with regard to private
 trade, but it still lags behind the GDR.
 In spite of the recent limitation of the freedom of the
 press and of debate in the Sejm, the Poles certainly enjoy
 considerably greater freedom of expression, both in the press
 and in parliament, than any other satellite nation.
 To sum up, the "Polish road to socialism" does not
 really deviate very sharply from the road followed by the other
 Satellites claiming no such originality.  The greatest differ-
 ence between them lies not in their policies, but in their spirit
 and in the assertion by Poland of the right to differ, and to be
 treated with the respect due to anybody enjoying that right.
 b.  The Political Situation after the Ninth Plenum
 Gomulka's basic internal difficulties stem from the
 fact that events in Poland were not allowed to follow their
 natural course.  Revolutions usually end either with the com-
 plete victory of one of the opposing factions or with the pendulum

 coming to rest naturally somewhere in the middle.  But in
 Poland in October 1956, the swing of the pendulum was arti-
 ficially arrested by an external factor, the USSR, with the
 result that neither the right nor the left felt they had been
 beaten.  Consequently, the struggle goes on. Gomulka's only
 asset, but a powerful one, is that he is the makeweight on the
 balance. Whatever his popularity in the summer and sutumn
 of 1956, there is no doubt that his followers are in a distinct
 minority today, both in the country at large and in the Party.
 The Gomulka group in the Central Committee of the Party,
 numbering about eighty members, is reportedly only fifteen-
 man strong, as against twenty-three members of the Natolin:.
 group and only four or five members of the revisionist left.
 The rest belong to the right or left center but they support
 Gomulka because they have no choice.  The left center cannot
 support the revisionists for fear of a break with the USSR, and
 the right center cannot support the Natolin group for fear of a
 popular revolt.  As a matter of fact, the Natolin bark seems to
 be worse than its bite, and judging by the tone of the Soviet
 press during these last months, coupled with the unexpected
 intervention of Mazur fresh from a trip to Moscow in Gomulka's
 support at the Ninth Plenum, the Kremlin appears to prefer to
 put up with the present situation in Poland for the time being,
 rather than to set off some more fireworks.
 The Kremlin cannot but realize, as does the Polish
 leadership, "the true state . . . of the feelings of the popula-
 tion, " now that they have rejected "the r se-colored glasses
 which we used to put on when assessing   aem
 7, " (Polityka
 No. 13, May 1957).  "There are probably only a few Commun-
 ists who are not aware nowadays, " the periodical continued,
 "what tremendous political work is in store for them regard-
 ing the consolidation of Polish-Soviet friendship.  We do not
 hide the fact anti-Soviet feelings exist in various centers . . . "
 As for the popularity of Communism in Poland, a striking
 testimonial was supplied by Piasecki, the chairman of the Pax
 Association, who declared on 7 May 1957: 'it is an objective
 statement to say that opinion in Poland shows signs of an anti-

 socialist neurosis.  It is also an objective statement to say
 that this neurosis has to be allowed for in practical politics. "
 Nowa Kultura of 20 May 1957, while bitterly attacking Piasecki
 on a number of grounds, had to admit that he is of course right
 "where he refers to the harm done by the anti-socialist
 neurosis . . . " Particularly serious is the fact that disaffec-
 tion seems strongest among the workers, disillusioned with
 Communism in general and Gomulkaism in particular, as
 evidenced by widespread unrest and strikes, any one of which
 is a potential Poznan.  If Zambrowski found it necessary to
 appeal to the Party organizations to "develop the socialist
 consciousness and activeness of the working class . . . and to
 unite with their vanguard, the basic party organizations"
 (Trybuna Ludu, 26 May 1957),   it was obviously because the
 workers and the Party are still "out of touch" with each other.
 It is in vain that Gomulka can argue that, ever since
 October, he has consistently stressed the impossibility of rais-
 ing wages further before productivity had risen considerably.
 Most workers apparently only remember that he promised a
 radical improvement of conditions which has not materialized,
 and find cold comfort in the fact that the wages of workers in
 key industries have been raised.  "Things are hard for people
 in Poland, " Warsaw Radio conceded on 15 August 1957 after
 the Lodz transport workers' strike.  "There are many groups
 of workers whose salaries are inadequate. " The next day,
 Warsaw Radio frankly explained absenteeism:  The allegedly
 sick worker works two or three days a week in private work-
 shops, where he earns 100 to 150 zloty daily, while. drawing
 sickness benefits from the State.  One worker admitted "with
 naive honesty" that it did not pay to work in the factory.  The
 only reason he did not quit was not to lose his rights to family
 allowances, medical treatment, etc.
 Naturally enough, especially in a Communist state, the
 people blame the government.  And the government is Gomulka.

 According to Trybuna Ludul , Party members have now been
 urged to launch a "persuasion campaign. " But, as the paper
 also laments, the increasing apathy in Party ranks - whose
 membership is estimated to have dropped to a maximum of
 one-half the pre-October figure of 1.4 million - is such that
 Gomulka can hardly hope to regain much of his popularity by
 this method.  This is particularly true in the light of the new
 and more severe labor regulations which Gomulka, apparently
 none too optimistic himself, found necessary to announce on
 11 August 1957 in an effort to curb absenteeism and to enforce
 work discipline.
 Under the circumstances it is understandable that
 Gomulka considers "revisionism" a greater. danger than con-
 servatism of recent memory.  "Revisionism" is but a euphem-
 ism for "reaction,  "  as he himself declared.  As "reaction" is
 but another name for "anti- Communism; " Gomulka himself, a
 sincere, albeit liberal, Communist, must fear anything that
 might fan the embers into flames.  Bf-sides, regardless of his
 own inclinations, he is convinced that the Kremlin would not
 tolerate a really free and non-Communist Poland.  The Krem-
 lin, on the other hand, has been able to convince itself since
 last October that the soup is not eaten as hot as it is cooked,
 as the German proverb has it, and has every reason to put up
 with the Gomulka regime rather than to have to repeat its
 Budapest exploit.  After all, the Polish road to socialism
 remains well within the limits set down in Pravda of 2 June
 1956 on the occasion of Tito's visit, and remote control can
 be just as effective as open interference.  Moreover, today,
 for all we know, the Russians themselves would not advise
 the Polish Communists to collectivize agriculture by the same
 means Stalin used in the USSR in the 1930s for they cannot be
 anxious to go on feeding the Poles indefinitely nor can they let
 them starve.  As for the Polish agreement with the Catholic
 Church, Marxism has always boasted of its realism and flex-
 ibility,. and if the Kremlin can accept peaceful coexistence

 with capitalism, it can equally well coexist peacefully with the
 Church - with the same mental reservations, of course.
 But the fact: that the Russians have decided to tolerate
 the present situation in Poland does not mean that they are
 reconciled with it, if for no better reason than the urge to
 efface the October setback and to gratify the human domineer-
 ing instinct; or, as Lenin called it,  "great nation chauvinism,
 of which the Ruasians have more than their fair share.  Moscow
 presumably calculates that if only Gomulka is given enough rope,
 he will surely hang himself.
 The defeat by Khrushchev of the Molotov-Malenkov-
 Kaganovich group should not have anything but a superficial
 effect on the political situation in Poland.  Inasmuch as the
 June 1957 resolution of the CPSU Plenum represented a slap
 for the conservatives, it naturally gave great satisfaction to
 the revisionists, and inasmuch as it reduced the danger of
 forceful Soviet intervention in Polish affairs it gave equal
 satisfaction to the government and to all Poles except the
 conservatives.  It is, however, difficult to see that the Moscow
 purge made much practical difference in Poland.  There is no
 reason to assume that the Soviet attitude toward Poland had not
 always been the one decided upon by Khrushchev, nor did the
 policies for which his opponents were indicted have their coun-
 terpart in Poland.  There is, therefore, no incompatibility
 between approval of the Natolin and condemnation of the Molo-
 tov factions.  Nevertheless, the June Resolution can be effec
 tively represented as a disavowal of Natolinism, and the net
 effect is likely to be a temporary chastening of Natolin trucu-
 lence which would give Gomulka a freer hand to combat the
 revisionists. In the words of Sokorski, chairman of the Polish
 Radio Committee, broadcast over the Warsaw Radio on 5 July
 1957, "we were always fully conscious of the fact that . . . the
 victorious repelling of revisionist tendencies must take place
 on the basis of overcoming dogmatism and sectarianism . . . "

 Gomulka remains confronted with two serious problems:
 How to ensure efficient administration and a healthy economy?
 And the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the two problems
 are closely intertwined yet demand ideologically conflicting
 solutions,  A firm administration helps the economy, and a
 materially satisfied population is easier to govern.  Yet it is
 very doubtful whether a strongly anti-Communist population
 can be governed without the use, or the ever-overhanging
 threat, of force, i. e. without Stalinism minus its psychopathic
 excesses . On the other hand, the Polish and other satellite
 standards of living   with the possible exception of Czecho-
 slovakia - can improve only if consumer goods are given a
 high priority over heavy industry and the economy is allowed
 much greater freedom, i. e. the opposite of Stalinism.
 Gomulka's weakest point is not his failure to control
 the majority of the Central Committee of the Party.  The fact
 that his group holds the balance of power and that both the left
 and the right have moderate wings prepared to go along with a
 middle of the road policy would enable him to secure in that
 body the necessary support for his policies and remain in power
 for a long time.  The greater weakness of the Gomulka regime
 comes not from the 23 Natolin adherents in the Central Com-
 mittee, but from the fact that the majority of the Party appara-
 tus are conservatives, controlling all but three voivodships,
 even though most Party secretaries are Gomulka men. 1 And
 the explanation why most of the apparatchik.i are conservatives
 is to be found in the speeches of the regime leaders themselves:
 they simply cannot see how they can impose their authority on a
 recalcitrant population without the use of "administrative, " i. e.
 forcible, methods.  One must agree that they have a strong
 case, for if the explanation and persuasion recommended by
 Gomulka fail and force is ruled out, passivity seems the only

 solution left.  The inevitable consequence is administrative
 anarchy and disrespect for authority as exemplified dramati-
 cally by the Jaroslaw riot in early May, and the defiance of
 the police in October by the Warsaw students protesting against
 the suppression of Po Prostu, who were joined by numerous
 "hooligans. "
 The breakdown of authority naturally has a bad effect
 on the country's already shaky economy.  Whether the economic
 situation is actually worse in Poland than in the other Satellites -
 and in that case, why? - or whether the Poles simply have more
 freedom to grumble about it, is hard to tell.  But the fact is that
 great discontent on that score is reported from Poland, even
 though the national income is claimed to have increased 7% in
 1956 over 1955.  As a result of the reduction of total industrial
 investments and their reallocation in favor of consumer goods
 and a sharp drop in military expenditures, the share of individ-
 ual consumption has increased by almost 12%, according to a
 Warsaw broadcast of 18 February 1957.  But this was the result,
 Leon Kasman admitted to an economic conference of the PZPR
 Central Committee on 17 April 1957,  not only of planned regu-
 lations but also of a loosening of wage discipline, spontaneity,
 and arbitrariness in this field. " Warsaw Radio conceded that
 the wage increases "were necessary and justified . . . But for
 the development of the economy such a state of affairs is unten
 able. " And, as of 2 June 1957, Warsaw Radio admitted further
 that the increases had been very uneven, that the general pay
 level was still low, and that it was difficult for the workers to
 make ends meet.  Many prices, including food prices, had
 already risen, and although the major part of the raises ob-
 tained by the favored groups in basic industries had not yet
 been absorbed, "inflation threatens, and if it occurs it will
 eat up the new raises and produce lower standards of living. "
 Kasman conceded that even the limited success in
 holding prices down had only been achieved by dipping into
 reserves of goods and raw materials.  The Minister of Foreign
 Trade admitted that the increased imports had been financed

 by credits granted mainly by the USSR, but also by Czecho-_
 slovakia, the GDR, Britain and France, 1 which would leave
 a deficit of about a billion rubles in the. 1957 balance of trade.
 Finally Gomulka completed the picture by his statement to :the
 Ninth Plenum that the rapid pace in wage increases had been.,
 achieved "through the reduction of planned expenditure for
 national defence.  We cannot repeat the operation.
 The symptomatic increase in black market operations
 was described by Trybuna Ludu of 19 April 1957 as the result
 of "utter administrative confusion and the corruption existing
 in people's. councils. "  Loga-Sowinski, chairman of the Trade
 Union Council, on 15 July complained of the further intensifi.-
 cation of speculation - read inflation. - and other economic
 abuses, and of the serious relaxation of wage discipline.
 Nowe Drogi. for September 1957 explained the seriousness of
 the prevailing "social evils'.' by the circumstance that "many
 of the old principles of bourgeois morality have.broken. down,
 but the principles of socialist morality are by no means suf-
 ficiently consolidated .      '"
 The Ninth Plenum Resolution of 18 May bluntly warned
 the people that "the limit of our possibilities to counterbalance,
 the increased income of the population by an adequate volume
 of -goods and services ,has now been reached, as proved by the
 manifestations of speculation, the rise of certain prices and
 the difficulties encountered in satisfying the demand for butter
 and some other articles. "  Yet, Yedrychowsk}, chairman of
 the Planning Commission, conceded in a Warsaw, broadcast
 of Z4 July that even in the last six months, "the increase in
 wages was greater than in labor productivity" and "absentee-
 ism has reached frightful proportions, considerably higher

 in foreign trade . . . and also on the house market .
 The one bright spot in the Polish economic picture is
 the success of the 1957 harvest, presumably as a result both
 of good weather and the new agricultural policy, under which
 grain deliveries have been reduced by one-third and the price
 doubled.
 Bad as Poland's economic situation.. is, it would
 obviously be much -worse but for the foreign credits she has
 obtained, chiefly from the USSR. 1 But, with the exception
 of some Americancoal mining machinery, the money goes
 to pay for consumable goods.  Even if repayment of the credits
 is not due to start for some years, Polish productivity, espe-
 cially in agriculture, will have to increase sharply indeed, if
 similar shortages are not to develop next year and further
 appeals to Moscow are to be avoided.  The Russians would be
 superhuman if they did not seize the opportunity to exact a
 gradual and unobtrusive swing toward the Natolin line.  Go-
 mulka's switch in the matter of the interpretation of the Hun-
 garian uprising and the severe limitation of the powers of
 workers' councils are signs pointing in that direction. The
 sharp curtailment of the freedom of the press is certainly in
 part at least also due to Russian pressure.  It is, moreover,
 significant that although Moscow agreed to supply Poland a
 considerable amount of grain for 1957, the amount fell short
 of the quantity needed to form a reserve permitting complete
 abolition of forced deliveries, a step Moscow has made it
 possible for Rumania to take.
 The ultimate success or failure of the Gomulka exper-
 iment in relative liberalism seems therefore to depend

 primarily on economic developments.  If it provides suffi-
 cient incentives to raise management, labor, and farm
 productivity; as well as the means to enforce wage discipline
 and compulsory deliveries, the chances of the Gomulka
 regime maintaining itself in power and pursuing its present
 policy line seem good.  However, its economic problems
 are formidable.  The Polish peasants are probably faixly
 satisfied now   for all practical purposes they are hardly
 affected by Communism - but the politically active segment
 of the population is the city people, and. if their standard of
 living fails to improve with reasonable speed, the most likely
 development in Poland is a reversion to neo-Stalinism.  This
 might happen gradually as a result of the inner.:logic of Soviet
 style Communism coupled with Soviet economic pressure, or
 violently, if popular discontent erupts,. for, in the words of a
 high Polish official, "a little flare-up in some small place
 can lead to a big explosion in a big place. " Should the Gomulka
 regime prove unable to quell such disturbances unaided, the
 Russians would certainly intervene as in Hungary.  This knowl-
 edge is actually Gomulka.?s greatest asset. against both the
 Party extremists and the Polish people.
 Theoretically, there could of course be another sdiu-
 tion which would go far toward solving P=oland's problems,
 over the next few years at any rate:  massive economic assist-
 ance from the United States.  This, however, is not considered
 likely, since the overriding fact is that Poland's possession of
 the former German territories binds her politically and mili-
 tarily.to the USSR and precludes the possibility of her align-
 ment with the West or even of neutrality & la Tito.  Giving
 anything but token or moral support to any Polish regime be-
 fore the territorial problem is solved in a manner tolerable
 to both Poles and Germans could only mean strengthening an
 ally of the USSR.

 c.  Prospects
 We have said above that the fate of the Gomulka exper-
 iment depends primarily on economic developments.  The
 prospects do not seem favorable, and to achieve a real im-
 provement a far more fundamental change may be required.
 Probably the most penetrating and frank avowal. of
 this problem yet made by a Communist in good standing is to
 be found in an address delivered to the Association of Polish
 Journalists by Wladyslaw Bienkowski, Minister of Education
 and reputedly one of the men closest to Gomulka. I
 Taking as his text Mao Tse-tung's metaphor of the
 "hundred flowers, " Bienkowski examined its applicability to
 "the Polish garden. " He started by pointing out the great
 difference between Marx and Lenin's concept of the building
 of socialism and Stalin's'  the former imagined that after the
 seizure of power by the workers, socialism would develop
 naturally in its new constitutional framework, while Stalin
 evolved the "concept of the artificial creation of a socialist
 society on purely fabricated, doctrinaire lines, without any
 regard for natural laws and objective reality. " Poland
 rejected this Stalinist concept in October 1956 and the ques-
 tion now was: what were the flowers suited to the Polish
 garden?  In plain language, the problem to be solved was
 "the pattern of social forces, of the ways and means, the
 meaning and the form of the class struggle and the way power
 is wielded by the working class after the victory of the revol-
 ution. "
 Assumption of power by the people, Bienkowski con-
 tinued, could only mean democracy.  Spurning the usual Com-

 munist arguments, Bienkowski claimed that the dictatorship
 of the proletariat was as compatible with democracy as was
 the curtailment of liberties effected automatically in a bour-
 geois; society when "EJ is rocked .. .. by a sharp class
 struggle o .   " He was even willing to admit that those who
 would say:  "This is how it always starts;. democracy is cur-
 tailed because there happen to be some economic difficulties,
 some trouble, and there develops a. dictatorship of a party,
 then of a clique, then of an individual, " were right, for his-
 tory taught that the danger had not been eliminated in the
 socialist system.
 "The situation has. changed now, EBknkowski sai~p but
 the tragedy of the past. Lpre - Octobe   period lay in
 the fact that we. gradually paralyzed socialism . - .
 What we are up against Eow that we are reverting to
 a broad social initiatives is a universal paralysis
 which outwardly assumes the forms of anarchy, of
 extreme lack of discipline and economy.  And we so
 want, after all, to render this society active some-
 how.  We want the peasant to sow and plow- as best he
 can . . . We want the craftsman or the worker to give
 of his best.  We want the factory to have the best
 organization.  We want everyone to feel responsible
 for his sector."
 And here, Bienkowski admitted, the Party stumbled
 over the first big stone-  The Party was the leading force and
 must remain so for. an indefinite period.  What method must
 it use to discharge its role?  Stalinism had led to paralysis
 and had failed.  Yet, he asked,
 "what will happen if somewhere in the countryside five
 peasants get together and decide jointly to buy a
 machine, or somewhere else a club is formed for
 some economic or cultural purpose., and as bad luck
 would have it, there is not a single party man among
 the initiators or else the party men are in a minority?

 'Then the party committees will raise a hue and cry,
 because something is happening outside the scope and
 control of the Party, and it assumes the semblance
 of some counterrevolutionary scheme in the eyes of
 people accustomed to vigilance.  For you see, the day
 after tomorrow these people may come out with some
 political program, then they will ask for something
 else, and eventually they will demand the restoration
 of capitalism in Poland."
 "To fear or not to fear the masses, because the
 masses, you see, are an awful force, " that was the question,
 Bienkowski stated :frankly.
 "And the main problem is the extent to which the Party
 can or should allow these initiatives, which are, above
 all, economic, but may also be anything else, to
 develop . . . Does party guidance mean that the Party
 decides on everything that happens in Poland through
 its executives and that there must be its initiative
 behind everything? "
 Whether, as some people held, the counterrevolutionary
 forces in Poland were so large that extraordinary vigilance
 was needed to prevent the restoration of capitalism, what were
 the real chances of social forces threatening socialism making
 their appearance?  These were questions requiring an unequiv-
 ocal reply, Bienkowski conceded. i- On the answer, he implied,
 depended the solution of the "big issue at the present moment,
 the still insufficiently analyzed problem of the ways and means,
 the sort of internal-constitutional methods by which socialism
 is to be built. "
 Further confirmation of the serious consideration bein g
 given this problem was supplied by the visit to Yugoslavia of
 Finance Minister Tadeusz Dietrich, who made no secret of the
 fact that he had come "to make an all-round examination of

 expression, primarily in enterprises.
 Rarely, if ever, have the magnitude of the. dilemma
 facing a Communist regime and its own ineptness been
 revealed:'with such frankness by its high officials.  The facts
 that in a "liberated" society, the last thing to develop natur-
 ally and freely would be Communism, but that close "guidance"
 by the Party led to economic and every other kind of stagna-
 tion, have been obvious for some time.  But this seems to be
 the first time that a high Party authority admits that they
 have no solution for this "antinomy, " as Bienkowski.called it,
 for the ,validity of the Khrushchev solutions, more collective
 leadership or decentralization, are rejected by preterition.
 No wonder therefore that Warsaw Radio complained
 (6 June) that although the Party had the "support of a.much
 greater part of the`nation71 than a year ago, the tendency to.
 indecision and to the avoidance of responsibilities" in the
 Party was increasing rather than diminishing.  Marian
 Naczkowski wrote that "threatening features such as passivity
 of the party branches, lack of unity and discipline in the Party
 and ideological laxity" had increased recently and that the
 "licentiousness of revisionist and liberal-bourgeois tendencies
 in many settings, including, unfortunately, also parts of the
 Party, has brought home to us how strong is the impact and
 pressure. of bourgeois elements on the weaker links of the
 working masses, especially the youth, and partly even of the
 working class.." (Nowe Drogi, June 1957).

 the Polish Communist regime itself admits that it has not

 nomic stagnation, accompanied by the constant threat of revolt,
 or adequate freedom of enterprise, possibly leading to the
 restoration of capitalism - and that the steps taken so far in
 the direction of liberalization have been insi4fficient.
 The Gomulka regime is certainly more popular than
 its predecessor, but that is not saying very much, and it is
 noteworthy that even the official sources no longer enter the
 standard denial that the "counterrevolutionary" forces are in
 the majority.  Silence means consent.  All that one can say is
 that Gomulka has not yet exhausted the relative popularity he
 enjoyed as the lesser of two evils.  But he is paying the price
 of not being able to fulfill the expectations he raised, or rather,
 which were raised by the revisionists, and he is expected to
 fulfill.  Gomulka himself has asserted that leaders whose
 credit is exhausted have to go, and his capital seems to be
 dwindling rapidly; his attempted compromise, like many
 hybrid solutions, does not seem to work in practice.
 It is, of course, possible that the economic situation
 will improve somewhat and that the Polish raison d'etat on
 one hand, and the Catholic Church on the other, will be suf-
 ficiently strong to keep the Polish people quiet and allow
 Gomulka to carry on along the present lines.  But Nato:Linism,
 whether the result of repression of revolts, of covert Soviet
 pressure, or of the simple fact that an unpopular system can
 only be made to work by forceful methods, cannot be excluded.
 Gomulka himself has said that only a strong Party could grant
 extensive freedoms;, and the PZPR is admittedly weak.
 There is, however, another possibility, implied in
 Bienkowski's address, which cannot be ignored.  Proceeding
 from the recognition that the key problem is stronger economic
 incentives, Gomulka could follow the Yugoslav example and
 even extend it to include ownership of the factories. by the
 workers, a free market economy, and, of course, private

 ownership of land, as was advocated by Roman Jurys.
 (Zycie Warszawy, 23 November 1956).  That, in his opinion,
 would be real Marxism, for, it would fulfill its essential
 postulate, social control of the means' of production, and
 would satisfy the demands of the working people.
 The fact that Gomulka in his speech to the Ninth
 Plenum found it necessary to marshal arguments against
 ownership of the factories by the workerswould indicate that
 the idea: does.. command support in Poland, and Bienkowski
 could hardly have spoken as he did if Gomulka absolutely ruled
 out any radical changes.  His main objection is probably that
 such a step might set off a process which would be difficult to
 control and might end by depriving the Communist Party chiefs
 of their dictatorial powers - a very unattrajetive prospect for
 even the most loyal Marxist - or even end in something closer
 to a "bourgeois" welfare state than to a Communist society.
 Even if Gomulka were to change his mind, there would
 still remain Moscow to be convinced.  At first sight it would
 seem most unlikely that Moscow would countenance such a
 development going beyond Yugoslav lines, and quite certain
 that Gomulka is determined not to break with Moscow.  But
 although a Polish initiative of that sort would obviously be
 highly distasteful to the Kremlin leaders, history shows that
 they have more than once surprised the world by their readi-
 ness to swallow their principles and pride whenever necessity
 or interest dictated such a course.  Not to go too far back,
 one may mention the alliance with Hitler, the toleration of a
 western democratic regime in Finland since the Second World
 War, the repudiation of Stalin, the reconciliation with Tito in
 1955, the "reinterpretation" of Marxism-Leninism by the 20th
 Congress, and last but not least, the acceptance of the Gomulka
 regime itself in October 1956.  Furthermore, they must be
 already reconciled to the prospect of further deviations from
 the Soviet pattern in China, deviations which.:they will perforce
 have to accept.

 Faced with a choice between the necessity of support-
 ing Poland economically for an indefinite number of years -
 and such a Poland would be a poor advertisement for Com-
 munism and always a potential Hungary - and stretching the
 "different roads to socialism" concept further, the Kremlin
 could conceivably choose the lesser of the two evils.  Indeed,
 it might be argued that on balance, Moscow would gain more
 than it would lose.  As Poland is inextricably bound to Russia
 by an overriding raison d'etat, the problem of her Western
 frontiers, no ideological differences can affect their alliance,
 and the greater the economic prosperity of, and the better
 the relations with, an ally, the greater his value.  We believe
 that the masters of the Kremlin are and will remain, in spite
 of Marx, first and foremost "Great Russian Chauvinists, "
 and in case of conflict between Marxism and the Russian raison
 d'etat, would sacrifice the former.
 If, in January 1957, the Soviet Kommunist could
 single out Yugoslavia, along with Poland, in an extensive
 denunciation of "national Communism, " yet on 2 June 1957,
 theMoscow Radio could praise Yugoslavia's "contribution to
 socialist construction" and note her "concrete and original
 forms of management of the economy"; if, speaking of the
 Finns who have rejected Communism in toto and have refused
 to be allied to the Soviets, Bulganin could say after his visit
 to Finland in June 11957 that "the friendly relations between
 the USSR and Finland which have been established in recent
 years are developing on principles of equality, mutual res-
 pect of state sovereignty and independence, non-interference
 in internal affairs, and mutually profitable, peaceful collabor-
 ation"; if Pravda, in its 16 June 1957 editorial could write:
 "there can be no doubt that similar good-neighborly relations
 can exist between our state and all the countries without
 exception bordering on the Soviet Union, " there is no reason
 why Moscow should not adopt the same tolerant attitude
 toward Poland, so long as the country gave lip service to

 socialism and remained bound by the Warsaw Pact.  That
 would be considerably more than Yugoslavia, not to mention
 Finland.  Unless Moscow were prepared to face a further
 deterioration of conditions, with the likelihood of violent up-
 heavals, it might have to choose between. continued economic
 assistance coupled with a revival of "conservative" methods,
 and toleration of still greater "creativeness" in the building
 of socialism in Poland.
 As it is safe to assume that the Russian Communists
 are not very eager to support instead of to._ exploit: their
 Satellites in the future, the chances of their accepting the
 alternative solution depend on the answer to the question,
 what do they most want from Poland?  It would seem that it
 is more important for them to have a valuable, because more
 prosperous and friendly, ally, than an expensive and hostile
 Satellite, even at the price of tolerating further variations
 from the Moscow pattern of socialism.  If it be true that the
 reconciliation with Tito was somewhat less than sincere, the
 chief reason is undoubtedly Tito?s political independence
 which, unlike his social innovations, was never described
 as a "valuable contribution" to socialism.  And Poland hap-
 pens to be the one Satellite which Moscow can politically
 trust,  Nevertheless, Moscow would. certainly draw the line
 at open repudiation. of Communism in Poland, for it would
 obviously encourage similar movements in the other Satel-
 lite countries, which, with the possible exception of Czecho-
 slovakia, can only be kept in the Russian camp through the
 medium of Moscow controlled Communist regimes.
 Summary
 128.  The only firm conclusion to be reached from a
 study of the situation in Poland almost a year after the blood-
 less. October revolution is that it is extremely labile.  The
 Gomulka program has removed a number of serious griev-

 ances of the population, notably in the spheres of religion,
 national susceptibilities, and agricultural collectivization,
 but has failed to reconcile the basic contradiction between
 Communist Party leadership and individual initiative, to
 establish, in Bienkowski's words,  the sort of internal-
 constitutional methods by which socialism is. to be built.
 129. The result is ideological confusion within the Party,
 administrative inefficiency, a critical economic situation,
 and general discontent.  An anti-Communist and traditionally
 indocile population obviously cannot be made to submit to
 Communist regimentation otherwise than by coercion, yet
 Gomulka is attempting to perpetuate the basic features of the
 Soviet system without "administrative" constraint, allegedly
 relying on persuasion, but actually on the fear of Soviet inter
 vention.  The Party, which must at the very least be mono-
 lithic to carry out its difficult task with any degree of success,
 is notoriously split between the conservatives, enjoying the
 moral support of the USSR and the backing of the Party
 apparatus, and the revisionists backed by the masses and
 the intellectuals, and is practically paralyzed.  In the mean-
 time, the country is run on sufferance by a small group of
 middle-of-the-roaders gathered around Gomulka.  He remains
 in power mainly because he is, aside from Cardinal Wyczinski,
 the only man in Poland enjoying a degree of personal popularity,
 even if he has disappointed the irrational hopes put in his
 ability to find a way out of the impasse in which history and
 geography have placed Poland.
 130.  Politically, the Gomulka minority government
 might last for some time, as have such governments in many
 other countries, but economic improvement cannot wait and
 palliatives cannot put off the day of reckoning indefinitely.
 Except in the case of a noticeable and early change for the
 better, it will be u:p to Moscow to choose between the burden
 of continued economic assistance, for which Poland would

 have to pay with a revival of Natolin (conservative) influence,
 and toleration of more far-reaching deviations from the Soviet
 interpretation of Marxism.  The Third Party Congress,
 scheduled for December 1957, was generally looked forward
 to as the opportunity for Gomulka to give some indications of
 his views on the course he proposed to steer.  But as of
 October 1957, it seems more likely that the Congress will be
 postponed, thus deferring the date when Gomulka will have
 to give a formal account of his stewardship, face his critics
 from the right and the left, and perhaps be 'forced to commit
 himself prematurely to something more positive than the
 middle way, which so far has not proved a short cut to general
 well-being and contentment.
