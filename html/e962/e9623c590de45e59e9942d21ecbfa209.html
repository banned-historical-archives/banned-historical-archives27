 ISRAEL-LEBANON:   Israeli aircraft attacked Pales-
 tinian refugee camps in Lebanon twice yesterday in
 reprisal for the terrorist incident at Maalot.   Tel
 Aviv denied the attacks were against civilian targets,
 asserting that they were "purely military operations"
 conducted against guerrilla concentrations and train-
 ing camps.
 Lebanese officials announced that at least seven
 refugee camps were attacked, including one at Ayn Al
 Hulwah near Sidon--the largest Palestinian camp in
 Lebanon.   Press reports from Beirut claim that the
 main hospital at this camp was hit.   Initial casualty
 reports from Lebanon indicate that over 50 people
 were killed in the attacks and perhaps 250 wounded.
 A large number of Lebanese reportedly were among the
 casualties.
 25X1
 25X1
 It is not yet clear whether the air raids rep-
 resent a deliberate change in the past Israeli prac-
 tice of hitting military targets and avoiding, inso-
 far as possible,  civilian installations.   Tel Aviv
 is claiming that the attacks were against "terrorist
 positions" in southeast Lebanon from which Arab
 guerrillas operate.
 The methods and announced objectives of the
 Israeli air strikes resemble the post-Munich Israeli
 reprisals in September 1972.   At that time,  fedayeen
 installations, including those in the immediate
 vicinity of refugee camps,  in Syria and Lebanon were
 hit.   Foreign Minister Eban said at that time that
 Israel would "take all necessary measures to strike
 at the perpetrators of the murders" and would "fight
 the terrorists wherever we find them."   This is still
 the Israeli position.

 SOUTH VIETNAM:   The Communists have launched
 new attacks in widespread areas of South Vietnam.
 In addition to capturing the South Vietnamese Ranger
 outpost and town of Dak Pekin northwestern Kontum
 Province yesterday,  the Communists forced the gov-
 ernment to abandon several outposts and villages in
 Binh Duong Province north of Saigon.
 So far, the bulk of the action has been directed
 against government positions near Route 13 and along
 the Saigon River corridor.   Some of the fighting ap-
 pears heavy and tanks reportedly have been observed
 in at least one of the attacks. Government commanders
 report that units from at least two of the Communists'
 main force divisions in the region--the 7th and 9th--
 have been involved, suggesting to them that the North
 Vietnamese are planning to wage a fairly intensive
 local campaign.
 Documents captured and defectors taken during
 the new fighting north of Saigon have labeled that
 effort as the "Nguyen Hue 3" campaign.   They indicate
 that the campaign in this sector is to be of short
 duration and targeted primarily against South Viet-
 namese bases and outposts in northern MR 3.

 USSR-EGYPT:   The suspension of Soviet arms ship-

 reduction in Soviet economic programs in Egypt.
 Nevertheless, both sides remain cautious in assuming
 new undertakings.

 25X1
 The USSR,  on the other hand, appears to be hon-
 oring existing economic aid commitments.   Soviet
 shipments of commercial cargo continue at a normal
 level.   About 1,500 Soviet technicians remain at work
 in Egypt.   Moreover,  an Egyptian economic delegation
 went to Moscow last month to discuss the expansion
 of the Hulwan iron and steel complex and the Naja
 Hamadi aluminum plant,  two major ongoing Soviet aid
 projects.   A contract to enlarge the capacity of the
 Soviet-built Alexandria shipyard is also under nego-
 tiation.   Terms still must be ironed out because
 Cairo has objected to the price of some items.   Some
 35 small tankers and cargo ships are to be built for
 the USSR.in repayment for aid to the shipyard.   So-
 viet engineers and technical personnel are directing
 repair work at the facility on Soviet merchant marine
 and naval ships.   Moscow also continues to be in-
 volved in Egypt's fishing industry,  as well as in
 irrigation, rural electrification, and other projects.
 The Soviets initially were interested in playing
 a significant role in clearing the Suez Canal and in
 rehabilitating war-damaged industries in the canal
 area.   Moscow, however, was stung by the Egyptian
 decision to turn to the US and the UK for aid in
 canal clearance,  and the USSR apparently has offered
 only small amounts of assistance for rehabilitation
 projects.

 existing economic programs as a means of maintaining
 a modest presence during a period of marked chill in

 political relations,  the Soviets have privately taken
 the line that Moscow will keep a tight rein on any
 new economic and military assistance.   The USSR, in
 fact, has not extended any new economic aid to Egypt
 since early 1971, when it provided some $195 million
 in credits.   Its position as Egypt's principal source
 of economic aid ended after the 1967 war when the
 Arab states agreed to underwrite the Egyptian economy
 with $250 million annually in grants.   Egypt has used
 about 70 percent of the nearly $1.2 billion in credits
 extended by the USSR since 1957.
 Although President Sadat,  as part of his policy
 of "positive neutrality" in relations with the US and
 the USSR,  clearly intends to reduce Egypt's dependence
 on Soviet economic assistance,   he has not extended
 his public attacks on Moscow's military assistance
 policy to include Soviet economic programs.

 WEST GERMANY:   The election yesterday of Helmut
 Schmidt as West German Chancellor brought ten days of
 intense political activity in Bonn to a close on a
 more optimistic note than many had believed possible
 Last week.
 Although Schmidt will not officially announce
 his cabinet until he takes the oath of office later
 today, most of the details of the past week's tough
 cabinet negotiations with the coalition Free Democrats
 are already widely known.   Aside from dropping some
 of the less effective Social Democratic ministers,
 Schmidt has brought several former close associates
 .into positions of authority, either as cabinet minis-
 ter:s or as state secretaries.   Even more important
 :nor the future of his government, Schmidt's inclusion
 of the new Free Democratic Party leader, Hans-Dietrich
 Genscher, as vice chancellor and foreign minister,
 rafects agreement among leading Social Democrats to
 :swallow their resentment of Genscher's role in the
 Guillaume affair in the interests of coalition coop-
 eration..
 Anticipating his major policy speech today,
 Schmidt has already stressed his intention to continue
 t_.he coalition program adopted in 1972.   Despite this
 pledge,  Schmidt may introduce changes of emphasis as
 well as a marked change in style of leadership.   Al-
 though he lacks the personal warmth and the aura of
 international statesman imparted by his predecessor,
 Schmidt will provide greater capacity for decision,
 firmer control, and more hard-headed pragmatism.
 Schmidt will undoubtedly give first priority to
 domestic problems.   Like other Social Democrats, he
 had long been impatient with Brandt for not having
 provided more decisive and forceful leadership in re-
 st.oting public confidence in the party's ability to
 govern.   With only three weeks remaining before the
 first of two major state elections this year, Schmidt's
 i-,rst aim will be to halt the steady erosion of public
 rapport tor the party by allaying public concern over
 signs of economic and political instability.

 Now that the shock of Brandt's departure from
 the government has begun to wear off, leading Social
 Democrats are becoming more optimistic about the
 change of leadership.   They feel that undiminished
 public sympathy for Brandt, together with the more
 effective Bove: ?nment leadership that Schmidt may pro-
 vide, could result in decided advantages for the
 party.   What is more, conservative Christian Democrats
 are beginning to fear that Schmidt could prove a more
 formidable opponent than Brandt.

 *PORTUGAL:   The junta has made it clear that the
 military will be the ultimate authority in Portugal
 during the life of the provisional government.
 A constitutional decree issued on May 15 makes
 the armed forces completely independent of the pro-
 visional government and the chief of staff of the
 armed forces equal in status to the prime minister.
 Prior to the swearing in of the provisional gov-
 ernment yesterday, the junta released a statement of
 basic principles and guidelines that are to govern
 the provisional government's future decisions.   In
 effect, the government has been given the authority
 to overhaul virtually every aspect of Portuguese
 society within carefully defined limitations.   The
 new government was also encouraged to allow debate
 on fundamental problems, but not to tolerate extrem-
 ists of any stripe.
 The foreign policy section of the guidelines re-
 affirms Portugal's traditional friendship with the US
 and calls for an intensification of relations with
 countries in the European Community.   Relations with
 the Arab world are to be renewed, and a call to es-
 tablish relations with all countries suggests that
 Lisbon will seek ties with Communist Europe.
 The government is directed to institute measures
 whereby the inhabitants of the overseas provinces can
 decide their own fate.   In the interim, defensive
 operations will be continued to protect the life and
 property of all citizens in those areas.
 Progress in all the areas outlined by the junta
 will require strong leadership, a significant amount
 of financing, and considerable restraint on the part
 of the long-deprived Portuguese lower classes.

 MEXICO:   President Echeverria has successfully
 beaten back a challenge to his control in the eastern
 state of Veracruz.
 As in the case of similar challenges in the
 states of Nuevo Leon and Sonora in late 1972, Eche-
 verria personally intervened last month to quash a
 plan by the conservative wing of the Institutional
 Revolutionary Party  (PRI)  to secure the state gover-
 ciorship for itself.   The conservatives' tactic was
 simply to announce their candidate for the state elec-
 tion this July without receiving the official party
 blessing.   in effect, this means announcing who shall
 be governor, since the PRI always wins.   The conserva-
 tives apparently were hoping that Echeverria and his
 advisers would give in rather than divide the "revo-
 lutionary family," and possibly cause a damaging pub-
 'ic debate.   But in order to defend his policy of
 social and economic reform,Echeverria has shown a
 willingness to risk party discord on key occasions
 rather than allow conservative opponents to assume
 important posts like state governorships.
 Acceptance of the right-wing candidate would
 have alienated the working class and student groups
 in Veracruz--the very people Echeverria has been
 working to win over for the past three-and-a-half
 'rears.   Echeverria may also have been thinking ahead
 o 1976 when his successor will take over.   His re-
 ormist policies have greatly alarmed the private
 sector and its conservative allies within his party,
 and they will seek to ensure a successor to Echeverria
 who will swing the pendulum back to the right.   Eche-
 verria will want his successor to carry on his poli-
 cies.   To this end, he is lining up support among key
 ;tare governors.

 CHINA-PAKISTAN:   The visit of Prime Minister
 Bhutto to Peking this week is likely to mark the
 beginning of a more active Chinese policy on the
 Indian subcontinent.
 25X1
 Chinese statements strongly implied that Peking
 is prepared to improve its own relations on the sub-
 continent, particularly with Bangladesh.   Vice Pre-
 mier Teng Hsiao-ping praised the agreements on the
 withdrawal of forces from occupied territories and on
 prisoner repatriation, which have satisfied Peking's
 long-standing condition; for warmer relations.   A
 Peoples Daily editorial underscored China's interest
 in closer ties with Dacca by pointing out that a pat-
 tern of normal relation; on the subcontinent worked
 to Moscow's disadvantage.  With no major obstacles
 remaining, early Chinese recognition of Bangladesh
 appears likely.
 The restoration of normal Sino-Indian ties is
 a more complicated matter.   Both Bhutto and the Chi-
 nese treated India gingerly during the visit and re-
 frained from attacking New Delhi for past subconti-
 nental turmoil.   Such restraint was more than offset,
 however, by explicit Chinese endorsement of Kashmiri
 self-determination, which was both offensive to India
 and prejudicial to improved Peking-Delhi relations.
 Such Chinese statements reinforce Indian arguments--

 relationship with the USSR particularly troubles
 Peking,  and the Chinese may hope that New Delhi will
 eventually make some gesture suggesting its ties with
 Moscow have been loosened.
 The final communique and speeches by both sides
 made clear that the special China-Pakistan relation-
 ship would endure even as a new pattern of relation-
 ships in the area develops.   The Pakistani press re-
 ported that Bhutto discussed ways of utilizing a
 $100-million commodity assistance loan pledged by
 China;  the composition of the delegations suggests
 that the two sides also discussed military coopera-
 tion.                             By stressing that Pakistan can now stand on
 its own feet as a result of past Chinese support,
 however, a Peoples Daily editorial appeared to signal
 that increased Chinese attention to its own interests
 and less to Pakistan's might develop over time and
 that this should result in looser ties.

 JAPAN:  A marked slowdown in the growth of Japan's
 purchases of raw materials could cause downward pres-
 sure on international commodity prices during the next
 several months,
 The volume of Japans raw material imports in
 January and February rose only 1 percent compared with
 the same period last year; demand will remain sluggish
 for at least the next several months.   Such imports
 swelled by 20 percent last year and were a major fac-
 tor in the upward pressure on world commodity prices.
 Last year, Japan accounted for roughly half the
 increase in world copper consumption and a substantial
 part of the rise in demand for steel scrap, iron ore,
 bauxite, rubber, and other industrial materials.   Un-
 derlying this demand was a 17-percent increase in
 Japanese industrial production.
 With industrial output falling in recent months,
 Japanese demand for certain products supplied largely
 by the US--e0go, steel scrap, wood products, and
 hides and skins--has fallen sharply.   Japan's pur-
 chases of US materials in January and February were
 still 10-percent higher than for these months in 1973,
 largely because imports of US coal and corn were up
 67 and 30 percent, respectively.
 Higher prices have raised Japan's raw material
 import bill markedly, even though volume has increased
 little.   Oil imports are running at about the early
 1973 level of 5o3 million barrels per day, but prices
 of crude oil have quadrupled.   Prices of copper, rub-
 bery tin  and scrap have doubled since early last
 year 0
