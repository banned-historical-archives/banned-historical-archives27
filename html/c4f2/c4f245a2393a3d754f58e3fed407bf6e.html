H.R. 3822, TO STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF 
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF INTELLI-
GENCE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED STATES 
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1988 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION, 
PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, 
Washington, DC. 
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:00 a.m., in room 
2203, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Matthew F. McHugh 
(Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. 
Present: Representatives McHugh, Stokes, Livingston, Shuster, 
Richardson, Glickman, Hyde and McEwen. 
Staff present: Thomas K. Latimer, Staff Director; Michael J. 
O'Neil, Chief Counsel; Thomas R. Smeeton, Associate Counsel; Ber-
nard Raimo, Jr., and Stephen D. Nelson, Counsel; Jeanne M. 
McNally, Clerk; Karen W. Schindler; Angel R. Torres; and Merritt 
R. Clark. 
Chairman McHuGH. The Committee will please come to order. 
Today the Subcommittee continues its hearings on legislative 
proposals designed to improve congressional oversight of covert op-
erations. These hearings were initiated last April following disclo-
sure that the Reagan administration had covertly sold arms to 
Iran, and that profits from the sale of those arms had been divert-
ed to finance the operations of the Nicaraguan contras. 
While that disclosure raised many questions that have been ad-
dressed elsewhere, our hearings have focused primarily on whether 
this secret operation was consistent with current law governing 
covert activities and what changes may be needed to avoid similar 
mistakes in the future. 
The responsibility for formulating U.S. foreign policy is shared 
by the Executive and Legislative Branches of our government, and 
generally policy decisions are debated openly. However, in excep-
tional circumstances the security interests of the United States re-
quire that foreign policy be formulated and conducted in secret; in 
those cases, special procedures apply. 
Currently, the law provides that the Intelligence Committees of 
Congress must be kept "fully and currently informed of all intelli-
gence activities . . . including any significant anticipated intelli-
gence activity." This provision establishes a general requirement 
that the Intelligence Committees must be given prior notice of any 
covert operation. However, the law allows two exceptions to this 
general rule.

First, "if the President determines it is essential . . . to meet ex-
traordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United 
States," he may restrict prior notice to the House and Senate lead-
ership and to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the 
two Intelligence Committees, the so-called "Gang of Eight." 
Second, the law also recognizes that in certain undefined cases 
the President may withhold prior notice entirely, but in such cases 
he is required to "fully inform the Intelligence Committees in a 
timely fashion." 
In the case of the arms transfer to Iran, the President signed his 
finding authorizing the transfers in January, 1986, well after the 
operation had begun. The President never provided notice of this 
operation. Indeed, it was not until November of 1986, a full 10-plus 
months after the President signed his finding, that anyone in Con-
gress learned of the operation, and then only because it was dis-
closed in a foreign publication. 
No one who testified before this Subcommittee last year argued 
that Congress had received timely notice of the sale of arms to 
Iran. However, in a letter and legal memorandum submitted to 
this Subcommittee and made a part of the record, the Justice De-
partment took the position that notice "in a timely fashion" means 
whatever the President in his sole discretion says it means. As the 
Iran arms case clearly demonstrates, if the Justice Department's 
position is allowed to stand, it could effectively deny the Intelli-
gence Committees pertinent information about significant policy 
decisions for very long periods of time. 
To many of us in Congress, the administration's position is incon-
sistent with the clear intent of existing law and would preclude the 
Intelligence Committees from meeting their responsibility to exer-
cise meaningful oversight. 
Moreover, the requirement for timely notice and consultation is 
designed not simply to protect prerogatives of Congress, but to give 
the President the benefit of independent counsel on important 
policy decisions. If the President had told the Intelligence Commit-
tees that he contemplated selling arms to Iran, strong objections 
would surely have been expressed. Members on both sides of the 
aisle have so stated in these hearings. While their objections would 
have been advisory only, they might have helped the President 
avoid embarking on a policy that was flawed in both its conception 
and implementation. And that, in short, is what the oversight proc-
ess is all about: helping to ensure that covert actions advance 
rather than damage the national security interests of the United 
States. 
The purpose of our hearing today is not to condemn past mis-
takes but to determine whether the oversight process can be 
strengthened so that we avoid similar mistakes in the future. The 
specific focus of our hearing is H.R. 3822, which represents a re-
finement of legislation introduced last February. It incorporates 
many of the recommendations of the select committees that inves-
tigated the Iran-contra affair. 
This bill requires that the Intelligence Committees, or the so-
called "Gang of Eight," be given prior notice of covert actions. In 
rare cases, where "time is of the essence" and the President deter-
mines it is important to the national security interests of the

United States, the President may initiate a covert operation with-
out giving prior notice, but in such cases he would be required to 
notify the Committees within 48 hours. 
H.R. 3822 would also do the following. 
It would require that a Presidential finding initiating a covert 
action be in writing, that it specify each agency, department or 
entity authorized to fund or participate in the activity, and that it 
state whether non-governmental third parties will participate in 
the action. 
It would permit an oral finding when immediate action is neces-
sary but require that a contemporaneous record be made and that 
the finding be committed to writing within 48 hours. 
It would prohibit retroactive findings and prohibit findings from 
authorizing an action that violates any law of the United States. 
It would define covert operation to include requests made by the 
U.S. Government to other countries or private citizens to conduct a 
special activity on behalf of the United States. 
And it would prohibit the expenditure of funds on covert actions 
until a finding has been made. 
A similar bill was reported favorably by the Senate Intelligence 
Committee on January 27th of this year by a vote of 13 to 2. 
Currently, this Committee is engaged in discussions with repre-
sentatives of the Intelligence Community, the Department of Jus-
tice, and the National Security Council to perfect the bill. I trust 
that we can continue to work together on these issues, and I very 
much appreciate the suggestions and advice the Intelligence Com-
munity has already provided. 
In prior hearings the administration representatives have been 
strongly opposed to any change in existing law. Of course, they 
have every right to do so, but I would hope that we can arrive at a 
constructive accommodation. 
As I said earlier, our purpose here is not to replow the ground of 
the select committees that investigated the Iran-contra episode. 
Yet, it would be a mistake to ignore their findings and recommen-
dations. 
In their final report, a bipartisan majority found as follows: 
The common ingredients of the Iran and contra policies were secrecy, deception, 
and disdain for the law. A small group of senior officials believed that they alone 
knew what was right. They viewed knowledge of their actions by others in the Gov-
ernment as a threat to their objectives. They told neither the Secretary of State, the 
Congress nor the American people of their actions. When exposure was threatened, 
they destroyed official documents and lied to Cabinet officials, to the public, and to 
elected representatives in Congress. They testified that they even withheld key facts 
from the President. 
The report then concluded as follows: 
Congress cannot legislate good judgment, honesty, or fidelity to law. But there are 
some changes in law, particularly relating to oversight of covert operations, that 
would make our processes function better in the future. 
Many of those ..recommendations are contained in H.R. 3822. The 
question we now face is whether we are, content to let the recom-
mendations of the select committees gather dust, or whether we 
are going to enact the kinds of changes they recommended. We 
have a distinguished group of witnesses to help us address that 
question today, and I look forward 'to their testimony.

Before calling upon our first distinguished witness, however, I 
would like to recognize the Chairman of our full Committee, the 
Hon. Louis Stokes from Ohio. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I join this morning with Chairman McHugh in welcoming today's 
witnesses as we continue hearings on intelligence oversight legisla-
tion. Each of them brings a distinct and useful perspective based on 
many years of experience to the important issues with which the 
Committees must deal. 
The prior notice provision of this bill and of the Senate bill S. 
1721 has caused a great deal of controversy, but as has been point-
ed out, there are other important provisions. None of them are cast 
in concrete, and we have and we will work with the administration 
to accommodate as best we can traditional intelligence interests 
and to correct drafting mistakes or omissions. 
I think I speak for all of us when I state that we are not seeking 
confrontation or endeavoring to criticize the administration for the 
sake of criticism or partisan advantage. Some of us?I think most 
of us?see a problem and are trying to correct it. There is no ulteri-
or motive. 
Part of the problem is the apparent ambiguity of the current 
statute. In this regard, I would note that in 1980, during the Carter 
administration, a majority of the Intelligence Committee preferred 
a more clear and concise version of the prior notice provision than 
was enacted. At that time, however, the Committee deferred to a 
Democratic Senate and a Democratic President and compromised 
on the vague language of the timely notice provision. 
The arguments made at that time in the Committee were that, 
considering the fate of the Nixon administration, no President 
would ever in the future withhold notice of a covert action from 
the Congress. The Committee was also told it was better to proceed 
on the basis of an expectation of trust, rather than pursuant to a 
strict statute. 
Well, the Intelligence Committee, of which I was not then a 
Member, and the House of which I was a Member, were persuaded. 
And now I am here today, and, as Yogi Berra said, "It's deja vu all 
over again." We are told that the law should not be changed be-
cause of an aberration like Iran-contra and that it is better to avoid 
strict reporting requirements that offend the Executive Branch. 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fine work that you have done on 
these hearings and on the bills we have introduced. I would also 
like to publicly commend Senators Boren and Cohen for the leader-
ship they provided on these issues. 
As you know, in January S. 1721, a bill substantially the same as 
H.R. 3822, was reported favorably by the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee by a vote of 13 to 2. While we may not be able to match 
these numbers, I think we should try. In any case, we hope to 
report an equally worthy bill very shortly. 
As I noted when Mr. McHugh and I testified on S. 1721 before 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
Although S. 1721 would revise the structure of the Intelligence Oversight Act, its 
substantive changes in law are few. Indeed, they are more in the nature of refine-
ments of a statute now seven years old than they are structural changes in congres-
sional oversight. They are, nonetheless, essential revisions.

Congress established its Intelligence Committees to act as surro-
gates for the House and the Senate in reviewing covert actions. 
Since those operations, in effect, are secret foreign policy initia-
tives, prior notice?prior consultation?takes the place that exten-
sive debate plays with respect to other foreign policy decisions. 
Congress plays an important constitutional role in U.S. foreign 
policy debate. It cannot perform that role at all with -respect to 
covert action if it is denied, through its surrogate committees, the 
most basic knowledge of such covert actions. 
I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for yielding to me. 
Chairman, McHuGH. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and 
thank you for your leadership on this issue. 
It is my pleasure now to introduce our Ranking Republican 
Member for any opening remarks he would like to make, Mr. Liv-
ingston of Louisiana. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I appreciate the opportunity to make a statement. I will not 
make a formal statement at this time, although I would like to 
-make some comments. I would like to reserve the right to submit a 
formal statement for the record later on. 
I would like to say that in my view, the laws on the books with 
respect to intelligence activities are indeed sufficient to provide 
adequate congressional _oversight of intelligence activities, and in 
fact they have permitted us to provide a great deal of oversight 
over the facts at hand, the facts which prempted this hearing and 
the bill that is before us. 
Iran was an extraordinary situation. It was extraordinary for the 
administration. It was extraordinary for the country. But the fact 
remains that Congress has looked extensively at the facts of that 
entire episode, and those who have stepped beyond the bounds of 
propriety have been dealt with and perhaps have paid dearly for 
whatever mistakes they have made. I happen to think that all of 
the people involved in that episode were well-intentioned and had 
nothing but the best interests of the country at heart. But be that 
as it may, they have paid dearly, primarily because Congress has 
acted and acted severely. 
I think that it would be .a great mistake for us to use the facts of 
the Iran-contra episode to jump in and pass, willy-nilly, legislation 
to avoid a recurrence of similar activities. There is an old saying in 
the courtroom that "bad facts make bad law," and I think the 
same can be said with respect to legislation and our activities here 
in Congress. We have an unusual situation with Iran-contra, but 
we have laws on the books which deal with oversight. They have 
been appropriate in the past and they will be in the future. If any-
body .abuses those laws, they will, as has been done in the past, be 
dealt with severely. 
But the bill before us is bad law, and it should not under any 
circumstances, in my opinion, be passed. There are various exam-
ples of its deficiencies.- Those have been testified to in- two previous 
hearings by the vast majority of witnesses that have appeared 
before this committee. The most glaring example of problems pre-
sented by this bill occur in the requirements for prior notice by the 
President to consult with Congress in advance of any covert activi-
ties or to provide them notice, at the very latest, after only a 48-

6 
hour leeway, to consult with at least the "Gang of Eight," if you 
will, the leaders of Congress and of the Intelligence Committees. 
The vast majority of the witnesses have testified against that 48-
hour provision. They have said it is unwarranted, and it is a dan-
gerous intrusion into the powers of the Chief Executive of the 
United States. 
The Minority report of the Iran Committees?you quoted from 
the Majority Report, Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote from the 
Minority Report?which talks about that. Nearly all of the Minori-
ty Members of the Iran-contra hearings concluded and said they 
are convinced, that this approach would be unconstitutional. Equal-
ly important, we think it is not needed. The Members who think 
they need new legislation underestimate the political leverage they 
now have to ensure that a President will not abuse his inherent 
power. 
That is not the only evidence we have that this could be a bad 
bill and a bad provision. Previously at one of these hearings, Mr. 
Ray Cline, former Assistant to the Director of the CIA, said, in his 
view, that "new amendments regarding the 48-hour notice provi-
sion prescribed an unwarranted rigidity with respect to timely noti-
fication. They are also counterproductive in the micromanagerial 
congressional intrusion into the Executive authority of the Presi-
dent to conduct sensitive national security operations. . . . [M]y 
belief, based on running clandestine and covert operations, is that 
there would be a chilling effect from such close supervision by the 
Congress." ? 
And Admiral Stansfield Turner, former Director of the CIA 
under President Carter, said, "I would have found it very difficult 
to look such an individual in the eyes"?speaking about people who 
were jeopardized while undertaking foreign operations, such as the 
rescue of the people who took refuge in the Canadian Embassy 
during the Iran hostage situation, and were hiding from the Irani-
ans in Iran?"I would have found it very difficult to look such an 
individual in the eye and tell him or her that I was going to discuss 
this life-threatening mission with half a dozen people in the CIA 
who did not absolutely have to know, who were not involved in 
supporting this activity," implying of course that if we consulted 
the Members of Congress, the hazard to those people under life-
threatening situations would be all the greater. 
So we have various people, most of the witnesses who have ap-
peared before us, who have said that this is a very dangerous provi-
sion and that the bill, if passed, would tie the hands of the Chief 
Executive and would virtually halt all critical and reasonable intel-
ligence and defense activities through unnecessary congressional 
interference and micromanagement. It would destroy the remarka-
ble gains the United States has made in world relations and unnec-
essarily jeopardize our security on the world front, and leave our 
citizens around the globe open to a vastly increased threat of ter-
rorism and mayhem. 
So, Mr. Chairman, for this reason and for others which I think 
will be elaborated on by Judge Webster, a number of which are 
critical to performance of the duties of the CIA to protect our secu-
rity and to conduct intelligence activities, I think this is a bad bill.

I would urge this Committee drop it right away and just to forget it 
ever existed. 
Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Livingston. 
We are very pleased this morning to have as our first witness the 
distinguished Director of Central Intelligence, the Hon. William H. 
Webster. Director Webster has been in his present position since 
May of last year, and prior to that he served as Director of the FBI, 
as Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir-
cuit, and as a U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. 
Judge Webster, we appreciate your indulgence in listening care-
fully to our opening remarks, and we are delighted you are with us 
this morning. Please proceed. 
TESTIMONY OF HON. WILLIAM H. WEBSTER, DIRECTOR OF CEN-
TRAL INTELLIGENCE, ACCOMPANIED BY RUSSELL BRUEMMER, 
GENERAL COUNSEL; DAVID PEARLINE, OFFICE OF CONGRES-
SIONAL AFFAIRS; JOHN HELGERSON, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF 
CONGRESSIONAL AFFAIRS; AND GEORGE JAMESON, OFFICE OF 
GENERAL COUNSEL 
Judge WEBSTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I am pleased to be here today to share some of my thoughts on 
H.R. 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1987. The views ex-
pressed in this statement also reflect the position of the adminis-
tration, with respect to the issues my statement addresses. Other 
administration witnesses have discussed, or will do so, the signifi-
cant constitutional problems that this bill raises as well as the 
impact it may have on the activities and programs of other agen-
cies. 
I will also draw your attention to the administration's position as 
conveyed to the Congress in the President's legislative message last 
month that a bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and author-
ity the President needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively 
will not be acceptable to the President. 
The bill being considered by the Committee today is similar in 
many respects to a bill reported out of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee last month. During its consideration of that bill, the 
Senate Intelligence Committee invited me to provide my views. I 
testified at that time on two issues: whether legislation was neces-
sary, and what practical impact the Senate bill would have on the 
Intelligence Community. I intend to address both points in my tes-
timony today on the House bill. 
As you are probably now aware, in my remarks before the 
Senate Intelligence Committee I questioned the need for this type 
of legislation. Although the Senate Intelligence Committee subse-
quently decided to recommend approval of the legislation, I still 
strongly doubt that this legislation is a necessary response to the 
concerns Members of Congress have expressed about the oversight 
of special activities. 
As you know, the President recognized last spring that there was 
room for improvement in the way the two branches were meeting 
their responsibilities, and he took concrete, substantial steps to es-
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1? 8 
tablish improved procedures to ensure that Congress is given the 
opportunity to play its appropriate oversight role. 
These new procedures in the form of a new National Security 
Decision Directive on Special Activities (NSDD 286), which this 
Committee has had for review in full and much of which was re-
cently declassified, clarify the rules by which special activities are 
reviewed, approved, and reported to the Congress. In fact, many of 
the proposals contained in H.R. 3822 are already contained in 
NSDD 286. That is not surprising, because the procedures the 
President has installed were developed following close and pro-
longed consultation with Members and staffs of the Intelligence 
Committees. 
While a Presidential directive is not the same as legislation, I ani 
not persuaded that new legislation at this time is the best way to 
address the concerns that Members have with the congressional 
role regarding special activities. In my view, a legislative remedy 
should, be employed only if it is clear that there is a basic deficien-
cy in the oversight process. That is doubly the case when the legis-
lative remedy proposed raises constitutional issues which threaten 
to divide the two branches in an area where effective work places a 
premium on cooperation. 
The Iran-contra matter, while extremely serious, has not in ? my 
view demonstrated that the system of congressional oversight of 
the Intelligence Community established under current statutes is 
seriously flawed. Many of the problems exposed in connection with 
that unfortunate period were the rest of officials failing to follow 
existing procedures and rules. 
As the Committee is aware, I have taken steps within the CIA to 
discipline those employees who failed to follow CIA procedures and 
meet the standards of conduct expected of CIA employees or who 
testified to Congress in a manner that was not candid or forthcom-
ing. Those actions, taken in light of the requirements defined by 
current statute, in my view have adequately addressed the prob-
lems we found. 
Similarly, to the extent that there were any procedural short-
comings demonstrated by the Iran-contra matter, they have al-
ready been addressed by the new Presidential directive within the 
present statutory framework. 
I would like, to emphasize that any legislation that is enacted 
must not adversely affect the Intelligence Community's ability to 
do its job. 
In this connection, Mr. Chairman, the bill you introduced, and 
the bill reported out of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have 
sought to address constructively some of the important concerns I 
and other administration officials raised before the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee when it considered its original bill. That bill, for 
example, recognizes the need to report on special activities and in-
telligence collection in a manner consistent with due regard for the 
protection of sensitive intelligence Sources and methods. 
I am also pleased that neither the House nor the Senate bills re-
quire that the finding specify the identity of foreign countries as-
sisting the Agency in the conduct of special activities. The proviso 
on protection of sources and methods, and the ability to protect the 
identity of fOreign countries assisting us, will go a long way in as-

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
suring friendly services and potential agents that source identify-
ing information will not be widely disseminated and possibly com-
promised. 
While the House bill addresses several concerns previously raised 
in my testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, there 
are four areas of the bill that are troublesome. The first area of 
difficulty involves the provision of the bill that requires notifica-
tion of a special activity to Congress, without exception, within 48 
hours after the signing of a finding. 
Last summer you received the views of the Department of Jus-
tice about the constitutionality of such a provision, so I will not ad-
dress that issue here. I have two concerns about this provision. 
First, the fact that there is a sharp difference of interpretation 
between the view of the Department of Justice and the position 
embodied in this bill regarding this provision's constitutional valid-
ity will promote tension between the Executive and Legislative 
Branches for years to come. In the intelligence area such tension 
has the potential to disrupt the kind of cooperation and trust effec-
tive national policy requires. 
Second, I believe that some allowance must be made for that 
rare case where a limited delay in congressional notification is crit-
ical to preserve the absolute security of an operation when, for ex-
ample, lives are at stake. 
Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that any concerns about 
excessive delay in congressional notification of a special activity 
have already been addressed by NSDD 286. That directive requires 
the National Security Planning Group to reevaluate at least every 
10 days a decision to delay congressional notification of a given 
finding. This will ensure that when a delay in notification is neces-
sary, the reason for that decision will be continually reassessed so 
that the delay will be as short as possible. I repeat, however, that I 
can think of few circumstances that Would ever necessitate such 
extraordinary steps. 
My second area of concern is with the definition of "special ac-
? tivities." This term is used to describe covert action operations. 
There currently is no definition of the term "special activities" in 
the law. The bill creates a special activities definition, but singles 
out and applies to CIA a standard that is different from that ap-
plied to all other departments and agencies of the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
For CIA, the bill defines a special activity to cover any operation 
in a foreign country other than activities intended solely for ob-
taining necessary intelligence. This definition is the same as that 
set forth in the Hughes-Ryan Amendment (22 U.S. Code Section 
2422), which provides the existing statutory framework for deter-
mining whether an activity of the CIA in a foreign country re-
quires a finding. 
By contrast, for all other departments and agencies, a special ac-
tivity is described as any activity conducted in support of a nation-
al foreign policy objective abroad which is planned and executed so 
that the role of the U.S. Government is not apparent or acknowl-
edged publicly, and functions in support of such activity, but does 
not include activities to collect necessary intelligence, or diplomatic 
activities carried out by the Department of State or persons other-

wise acting pursuant to the authority of the President. This defini-
tion is similar to that set forth in Section 3.4(h) of Executive Order 
12333, issued by President Reagan on December 4, 1981. 
I understand that in crafting these definitions of special activi-
ties in the bill, it was not your intention, Mr. Chairman, to change 
in any way the current standard by which CIA determines whether 
to obtain a finding to authorize a particular activity. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, my general counsel, Russell 
Bruemmer, who is seated behind me, has advised me that this defi-
nition, if adopted, may cause confusion about the standard used to 
determine whether a finding is necessary to authorize an activity. 
We have also requested the Department of Justice to examine this 
issue, and they have reached a similar conclusion. 
The proposed definition of special activities in the bill could alter 
current practice. The Executive Branch, as the Committee knows, 
has interpreted the Hughes-Ryan Amendment in a manner that we 
believe is consistent with its legislative intent. 
The Hughes-Ryan Amendment, if given an overly restrictive in-
terpretation, would require Presidential authorization for even the 
most minor, or routine activities of the CIA overseas if they were 
not related solely to intelligence collection. In my judgment, that is 
not a proper interpretation and was never the intent of Congress in 
enacting Hughes-Ryan. 
The legislative history to Hughes-Ryan and the Oversight Act of 
1980 contemplate a finding for those activities that truly can be 
considered covert action operations. In this connection, the defini-
tion of special activities contained in the Executive Order gives 
meaning to the language and intent of the Hughes-Ryan Amend-
ment in determining whether that law would require a finding to 
authorize a particular activity. 
Enacting H.R. 3822 as drafted would make it extremely difficult 
to continue such an interpretation because the Executive Order 
definition would by terms of the statute not apply to CIA. The 
clear implication would be that Congress intends that the language 
of Hughes-Ryan be given a more restrictive interpretation. 
This could be construed to mean the following types of activities, 
for which findings are not obtained today, would henceforth re-
quire specific Presidential authorization in every case no matter 
how minor the CIA role: counterintelligence activities; support 
given to the Department of State in the conduct of diplomatic ac-
tivities (this would include, for example, having the Chief of Sta-
tion present the U.S. Government position on a particular matter 
to the Foreign Minister because of his close relationship with the 
Foreign Minister, or arranging for secure transportation or a meet-
ing site for an ambassador or a diplomatic official); minor support 
to the Department of Defense or Department of State in the evacu-
ation of Americans from foreign countries; minor support provided 
to the DoD and ?other agencies through the purchase of equipment 
or the provision of services under the Economy Act. 
If we are in agreement not to alter the current practice within 
CIA on whether to obtain a Presidential finding to govern a par-
ticular activity, I would urge the Committee to modify the defini-
tion of special activities contained in the bill.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1,1 
One approach would be to repeal the Hughes-Ryan definition and 
use the Executive Order definition, of special activities to cover 
every department or agency, including CIA. There are other possi-
ble ways to resolve our concern, and I have instructed my staff to 
work with the Committee to come up with mutually acceptable lan-
guage. The key, again, I think we can agree, is formulating lan-
guage that will maintain the status quo. 
I must add as a final note, moreover, that the definition proposed 
in the bill today, as well as that in the Senate bill, are different 
from that which I addressed when I testified before the Senate In-
telligence Committee. For that reason, I did not have the opportu-
nity then to express these concerns at the time of my previous tes-
timony. 
My third area of specific concern is with Section 4 of the bill, 
which amends Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947. 
Section 502(a) of the National Security Act limits the use of appro-
priated funds. 
Currently, appropriated funds available to an intelligence agency 
may be spent only if, one, funding for the activity has been author-
ized by Congress; two, in the case of release from the reserve for 
contingencies, notice of the intent to release such funds is given to 
the Intelligence and Appropriations Committees; or, three, in the 
case of reprogrammings or transfers, the activity to be funded is a 
higher priority intelligence activity, the need for funds for such ac-
tivity is based on unforeseen requirements, and notice is given to 
the Intelligence and Appropriations Committees of the intent to 
make funds available for the activity. 
The bill would amend Section 502(a) of the National Security Act 
to restrict expenditure of all funds, and not just appropriated 
funds. I am concerned that this amendment would jeopardize our 
authority to conduct certain activities which Congress has support-
ed in the past. Specifically, the amendment would restrict our abili-
ty to use income generated by proprietaries for certain expenses 
necessary to make the proprietary appear as a commercial entity. 
This would make it extremely difficult to operate our proprietaries 
in a secure manner. 
The amendment would also eliminate the authority of several 
agencies in the Intelligence Community to make certain accommo-
dation purchases for other countries. 
Finally, the amendment would eliminate our authority to receive 
funds donated by other countries to finance special activities for 
which a finding has been obtained. 
I should emphasize that I have no objection to keeping the Com-
mittee generally informed of our activities in these three areas. 
However, there has been no stated rationale for the need' for this 
change, and in my view adoption of this provision would have a 
very serious and detrimental effect on our continuing ability to 
conduct special activities, liaison activities with foreign govern-
ments, and operations of proprietaries. 
The fourth area of concern is with the provision of the bill 
amendment Section 503 of the National Security Act, which cur-
rently provides for the reporting to the Intelligence Committees of 
the transfer of defense articles or services in excess of $1 million by 
an intelligence agency. The section would be ,amended to require 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
12 
? 
the reporting of defense articles or services which are individually 
worth less than $1 million but which aggregate to a figure more 
than $1 million. 
I do not believe it is necessary to change the current standard for 
reporting the transfer of defense articles and services. Further-
more, I note that the provision does not provide standards to deter-
mine when defense articles or services should be aggregated. 
Accordingly, if this provision remains in the bill in its current 
form, I would urge the Committee to consider statutory language 
or legislative history that would provide clear guidance on how the 
Intelligence community should aggregate defense articles or serv-
ices for purposes of reporting to the Intelligence Committees. 
There also are several other provisions in the bill that, while not 
as worrisome as the ones I have touched on, would, as written, pose 
problems for the Intelligence Community. My staff has already had 
useful discussions with the Committee staff on these provisions. 
In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to reemphasize to each of 
you my personal commitment to making the oversight process 
work. It has always been clear, and recent experience has again 
demonstrated, that the implementation of the foreign policy of our 
government, including special activities, can only be successful 
when the Executive and Legislative Branches of Government work 
together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. This spirit 
of cooperation can only occur if the Intelligence Committees re-
ceive the appropriate information needed to review and make in-
formed judgments on special activities, while at the same time en-
suring that this information is protected from unauthorized disclo-
sure. 
The law should reflect not only the need for cooperation, but also 
the President's responsibility for the conduct and management of 
our intelligence and the importance to the Nation of ensuring that 
the President has the necessary flexibility and authority to employ 
our intelligence capability effectively. 
As I have noted, the President has taken corrective steps to im-
prove the oversight system through a Presidential directive. At 
CIA, I have approved a number of measures which will help to pre-
vent a repetition of the shortcomings in the Agency's performance 
in the Iran-contra matter. In short, significant changes have been 
made. I would respectfully submit that they should be given a 
chance to work. 
I am convinced that the current framework, and not new laws, 
represents the most appropriate and effective means to achieve our 
shared commitment to have Congress play an active, effective role 
in the oversight of United States intelligence activities. 
Mr. Chairman, that now concludes my statement. I would be 
more than pleased to respond to your questions. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much, Judge Webster. 
The Committee will proceed with questions, as usual, under the 
five-minute rule. 
I do appreciate the fact that you are here today and, more impor-
tantly, your personal commitment to making the oversight process 
work. As you said in your testimony, if more than policy implemen-
tation is going to be effective, we have to have a spirit of coopera-
tion and trust between the two branches. And one of your state-

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 13 
ments was particularly relevant: This spirit of cooperation can only 
occur if the Intelligence Committees receive the proper information 
needed to review and make informed judgments on special activi-
ties, while at the same time ensuring that this information is pro-
tected from unauthorized disclosure. 
I think we all agree with that. The problem is that in the Iran-
contra affair, this clearly did not happen. I realize that some Mem-
bers would dismiss that episode as an aberration, and I hope it is. 
Nonetheless, it is a real-life case; it happened. And the facts are 
well known. 
The substance is that the President signed a finding authorizing 
sale of arms to Iran in January, 1986, and never provided notice to 
the Congress until after the sales were disclosed by a foreign publi-
cation, more than 10 months later. 
The law as presently written provides that in most cases there 
will be prior notice, and I am sure you would agree there was no 
prior notice to the Intelligence Committees or the 'Gang of Eight." 
It then says that essentially in the President's discretion, he may 
withhold prior notice but must given timely notice to the Intelli-
gence Committees. I will ask you if you think that was timely 
notice. 
In any event, the Justice Department, has said that whether or 
not it was good policy, it was legal and that the President was 
within his authority not to provide prior notice and not to provide 
indeed any notice to the Intelligence Committees or the leadership 
for more than 10 months after the authorization was signed. For 
me at least, that poses the major problem. 
You have indicated that the President has signed an Executive 
Order which in essence says that the President voluntarily, at his 
own discretion, will not do this again. He will in most cases at least 
provide much more timely notice than that. But that can be with-
drawn any time this or another President chooses, and it is some-
thing solely within his discretion. From a congressional perspec-
tive, where we have certain responsibilities for oversight, this is 
very problematic. 
I would like to get your reaction to that observation, and com-
ment, if you will, on whether or not you believe this was timely 
notice, and if not, can you give us any better definition of what 
timely notice would be? We have said in our bill a period of 48 
hours. That admittedly is an artificial period. There is no sacro-
sanct quality to that time. But certainly 10 months is unacceptable 
to at least a majority of us on this Subcommittee. 
And so, therefore, I would appreciate your observation first as to 
whether or not the President's actions in the Iran arms sales case 
were consistent with current law. Was it timely notice, and if not, 
what is your conception of timely notice? 
Judge -WEBSTER. Mr. Chairman, I won't presume to give the legal 
opinions. They have been conveyed to you by other means. My own 
sense is that in that situation, 10 months was not timely. Timely 
does not have a definition unless you choose to give it one, but I 
believe stimely means as soon as can reasonably be done, given the 
factual Circumstances. 
I would like to make clear in answering your question that the 
CIA can for all circumstances I foresee provide that notice within 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
48 hours if it comes through us, or make certain that it is made 
available to the Committee provided that the requisite Committee 
Members designated to receive that have not put themselves out of 
the reach of secure communication, given that it is not a mechani-
cal process. It can be done in very short order, and most of the 
findings are now being delivered well within that 48-hour period. 
Historically, it is my understanding that ever since these laws 
were in place there have been only three occasions when Congress 
was not given very timely notice of findings, all of which ironically 
involved Iran. My understanding is that those were the Canadian 
situation to which reference was made, the planning for the rescue 
attempt, and more recently, the Iran-contra issue. 
My concern with the necessity for putting 48 hours into a statute 
has to do with a tension that arises whenever you face this kind of 
confrontational issue. In the past, the Congress and the President 
have always been able to find some means to accommodate that 
tension and provide some minor looseness in the joints. 
In this case, the President has asserted that he will voluntarily 
provide that notice within 48 hours except in the very rare circum-
stance that requires him to delay it. He has also publicly commit-
ted himself under the National Decision Directive to reassess that 
decision, cause it to be reassessed by the National Security Council 
Planning Group every 10 days. This is one of the approaches that I 
advocated early on, because it was the making of an initial decision 
not followed by any review of that decision that caused it to go up 
on the shelf. 
The National Security Planning Group, which is normally 
chaired by the President and consists of the major Cabinet officers 
involved with national security?the Secretary of State, the Secre-
tary of Defense, the Attorney General, Secretary of the Treasury, 
with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Director of Central In-
telligence participating as advisers?it would be very difficult in 
my view for this group to continue to review every 10 days a de-
ferred finding and not quickly come to the conclusion that the ex-
traordinary reasons had expired and to give you proper notice. 
There are a few circumstances that I could think of where that 
potential for exception would be exercised by the President, and 
survive a 10-day review test again. Nevertheless, it is my view that 
we don't need to build that kind of tension and raise a constitution-
al issue if we have a system that works. 
And given the very few times that the President has not provid-
ed the notice and his additional commitment now to do it within 48 
hours or to review it every 10 days with his full National Security 
Council is a very important and significant public commitment 
from which I do not see how he could recede.

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE, I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF 
MY THOUGHTS ON H.R. 3E22, THE INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF. 
1957. THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS STATEMENT ALSO REFLECT THE 
POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES MY 
STATEMENT ADDRESSES. OTHER ADMINISTRATION WITNESSES HAVE 
DISCUSSED, OR WILL DO SO, THE SIGNIFICANT CONSTITLTIONAL 
PROBLEMS THIS BILL RAISES AS WELL AS THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON 
THE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS OF OTHER AGENCIES. I WOULD ALSO 
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION, AS 
CONVEYED TO CONGRESS IN. THE PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATIVE MESSAGE 
LAST MONTH, THAT A BILL WHICH FAILS TO PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY 
AND AUTHORITY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO CONDUCT INTELLIGENCE 
ACTIVITIES EFFECTIVELY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PRESIDENT. 
THE BILL BEING CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS SIMILAR 
IN MANY RESPECTS TO A DILL REPORTED OUT OF THE SENATE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE LAST MONTH. DURING ITS CONSIDERATION OF 
THAT BILL, THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE INVITED' ME TO 
PROVIDE MY VIEWS. I TESTIFIED AT THAT TIME ON TWO ISSUES: 
WHETHER LEGISLATION WAS NECESSARY; AND WHAT PRACTICAL IMPACT 
THE SENATE BILL WOULD HAVE ON THE INTELLIGENCE .COMMUNITY. I 
INTEND TO ADDRESS BOTH POINTS IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY ON THE 
HOUSE BILL.

THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION  
AS YOU ARE PROBABLY NOW AWARE, IN MY REMARKS BEFORE THE 
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE I QUESTIONED THE-NEED F6R THIS 
TYPE :OF LEGISLATION ALTHOUGH THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE SUESEQUENTLY DECIDED TO RECOMENC APPRCVAL OF THE 
LEGISLATION, I STILL STRONGLY DOUBT THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS A 
NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS MEMBERS OF *CONGRESS HAVE 
EXPRESSED ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES.' As YOL 
KNOW, THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZED LAST SPRING THAT THERE WAS Rcor 
FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY THE Two BRANCHES WERE MEETING THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITIES, AND HE TOOK CONCRETE, SUBSTANTIAL STEPS TO 
ESTABLISH 1MPROVED-PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT CONGRESS IS GIVEN 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY ITS APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT ROLE. THESE 
NEW PROCEDURES IN THE FORMOF A NEW NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION 
DIRECTIVE ON SPECIAL AOTIVITIES (NSED 2EiG), WHICL THIS 
COMMITTEE HAS HAD FOR REVIEW IN FULL AND MUCH OF WHICH WAS 
RECENTLY DECLASSIFIED, CLARIFY THE RULES BY WHICH SPECIAL 
ACTIVITIES ARE REVIEWED, APPROVED', AND REPORTED TO CONGRESS. 
IN FACT, MANY OF THE-PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN H.R. 3822 ARE 
ALREADY CONTAINED IN NSDD 286. THAT IS NOT SURPRISING, BECAUSE 
THE PROCEDURES THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTALLED MERE DEVELOPED 
FOLLOWING CLOSE AND PROLONGED CONSULTATION WITH MEMBERS AND 
STAFFS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES.

WHILE A PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE IS NOT THE SAME AS 
LEGISLATION, I AM NOT PERSUADED THAT NEW LEGISLATION AT THIS 
TIME IS THE BEST WAY .TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT MEMBERS HAVE 
?WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL ROLE REGARDING SPECIAL ACTIVITIES. IN 
MY VIEW, A LEGISLATIVE REMEDY SHLULD EE EMPLOYED ONLY IF IT IS-
CLEAR THAT THERE IS A BASIC DEFICIENCY IN THE OVERSIGHT 
PROCESS. THAT IS DOUBLY THE CASE WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE REMEDY, 
PROPOSED RAISES _CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES WHICH THREATEN TO DIVIDE 
ThE TWO BRANCHES IN AN AREA WHERE EFFECTIVE WORK .PLACES A 
pREvIum ON COOPERATION. 
THE IRAN/CONTRA MATTER, WHILE EXTREMELY SERIOUS, HAS NOT IN 
MY VIEW DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SYSTEM OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT 
OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ESTABLISHED UNDER CURRENT 
STATUTES. IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED.- MANY OF THE PROBLEMS EXPOSED IN 
CONNECTICk WITH THAT UNFORTUNATE PERIOD WERE THE RESLLT OF 
OFFICIALS FAILING TO FOLLOW EXISTING PROCEDURES ? AND RULES. As 
THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE, I HAVE TAKEN STEPS WITHIN THE CIA TO 
DISCIPLINE THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO FAILED TO FOLLOW CIA PROCEDURES 
AND MEET THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT, EXPECTED OF CIA EMPLOYEES OR 
WHO TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS INA MANNER THAT ?WAS:NOT CANDID OR : 
FORTHCOMING. THOSE ACTIONS, .TAKEN IN.-LIGHT OF THE REQUIREMENTS 
DEFINED BY CURRENT STATUTE, IN MY VIEW HAVE ADEQUATELY

ABILITY TO-DO ITS JOE. IN THIS CONNECTION; MR. CHAIRMAN, THE 
BILL YOU INTRODUCED, ANL THE DILL REPORTED OUT OF THE SENATE

SOME OF THE IMPORTANT CONCERNS I AND CTHEP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS,RAISED BEFORE THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WHEN 
IT CONSIDERED ITS ORIGINAL SILL, THAT BILL, FOR EXAMPLE, . 
RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO REPORT ON SPECIAL ACTIVITIES AND 
INTELLIGENCE 'COLLECTION IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH DUE REGARD 
FOR THE PROTECTION OP SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE -SOURCES AND 
METHODS. I AN ALSO PLEASED THAT NEITHER THE HOUSE NCR THE 
SENATE BILLS REQUIRE THAT THE FINDING SPECIFY THE IDENTITY OF 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES ASSISTING THE AGENCY IN THE CONDUCT OF- 
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES. THE PROVISO ON PROTECTION OF SOURCES AND 
METHODS, AND THE ,ABILITY TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES.ASSISTING US WILL GO ,A LONG WAY IN ASSURING FRIENDLY 
SERVICES AND POTENTIAL AGENTS THAT SOURCE IDENTIFYING ? 
INFORMATION WILL NOT BE WIDELY DISSEMINATED AND POSSIBLY

PRIOR NOTICE OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES' 
_WHILE THE 'HOUSE BILL ADDRESSES SEVERAL ,CONCERNS PREVIOUSLY 
RAISED IN MY TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, THERE ARE FOUR AREAS OF THE BILL THAT ARE 
'TROUBLESOME. THE FIRST AREA.OF DIFFICULTY INVOLVES THE 
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT REQUIRES NOTIFICATION OF A SPECIAL 
ACTIVITY TO, CONGRESS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WITHIN 48 HOURS AFTER 
THE SIGNING OF A FINDING. LAST SUMMER YOU RECEIVED THE VIEWS 
OF THE. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 
SUCH A PROVISION, SO I- WILL NOT.ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HERE. I 
HAVE TWO CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROVISION. FIRST, THE FACT THAT 
THERE IS A SHARP DIFFERENCE OF INTERPRETATION BETWEEN THE VIEW 
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE POSITION EMBODIED WTHIS ? 
BILL REGARDING THIS PROVISION'S CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY WILL 
PROMOTE TENSION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES. 
FOR YEARS TO COME. IN THE INTELLIGENCE AREA SUCH TENSION HAS 
THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THE KIND OF COOPERATION AND TRUST 
EFFECTIVE NATIONAL POLICY REQUIRES., SECOND, I BELIEVE THAT 
SOME ALLOWANCE MUST EE MADE FOR THAT RARE CASE WHERE A?LIMITED 
DELAY IN CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO PRESERVE THE 
ABSOLUTE SECURITY OF AN OPERATION WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, LIVES ARE 
AT STAKE. FURTHERMORE, IT AS WORTHWHILE TO NOTE THAT ANY . 
CONCERNS ABOUT EXCESSIVE DELAY IN CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF

.01A-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 21 
A SPECIAL ACTIVITY HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY NSEL 266. 
THAT DIRECTIVE REQUIRES THE NATIONAL SECURITY PLAW.ING GROUP TO 
REEVALUATE AT LEAST EVERY 15 DAYS A DECISION TO DELAY 
.CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF A GIVEN FINDING. THIS WILL 
ENSURE THAT WHEN A DELAY IN NOTIFICATION IS NECESSARY, THE 
REASON FOR THAT DECISION WILL BE CONTINUALLY REAS cF"FD SO THAT. 
THE DELAY WILL BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. 1 REPEAT, HOWEVER, 
THAT 1 CAN THINK OF FEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD EVER 
NECESSITATE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY. STEPS-. 
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES EEFIf.1101., 
MY SECOND AREA OF CONCERN IS WITH THE DEFINITION OF 
"SPECIAL ACTIVITIES." THIS TERM IS USED TO DESCRIBE COVERT 
ACTION OPERATIONS. THERE CURRENTLY IS NC DEFINITION OF THE 
TERM "SPECIAL ACTIVITIES" IN THE LAW. THE BILL CREATES A 
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES DEFINITION, BUT SINGLES OUT AND APPLIES TO 
CIA A STANDARD THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT APPLIED TO ALL OTHER 
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. FOR CIA, THE 
BILL DEFINES A SPECIAL ACTIVITY TO COVER ANY OPERATION IN A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY OTHER THAN ACTIVITIES INTENDED SOLELY FOR 
OBTAINING NECESSARY INTELLIGENCE. THIS DEFINITION IS THE SAME 
AS THAT SET FORTH IN THE HUGHES/RYAN AMENDMENT (22 U.S.0 ?2422) 
WHICH PROVIDES THE EXISTING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING

WHETHER AN ACTIVITY OF THE CIA. IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY REQUIRES A 
FINDING. BY CONTRAST, FOR ALL. OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, 
A SPECIAL ACTIVITY IS DESCRIBED AS ANY ACTIVITY CONDUCTED IN 
SUPPORT CF A NATIONAL FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVE ABROAD WHICH IS 
PLANNED AND EXECUTED SC THAT THE ROLE CF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS 
NOT APPARENT. CR ACKNOLEDOEL PUBLICLY, AND FUNCTIONS IN SUPPORT 
OF SUCH ACTIVITY, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE ACTIVITIES TO COLLECT 
NECESSARY INTELLIGENCE, OR DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT EY' 
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE OR PERSONS OTHERWISE, ACTING PURSUANT TO 
THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT. THIS DEFINITION IS SIMILAR TO 
THAT SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.4(H) OF EXECUTIVE ,ORCER 123, 
ISSUED BY PRESIDENT REAGAW ON EECEMBER 4, 1551. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT IN CRAFTING THESE bEFINITIONS OF SPECIAL 
ACTIVITIES IN .THE BILL, IT WAS NOT YOUR INTENTION, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, TO CHANGE IN ANY WAY THE CURRENT STANDARD BY WHICH 
CIA DETERMINES WHETHER TO OBTAIN A FINDING TO AUTHORIZE A 
PARTICULAR ACTIVITY. UNFORTUNATELY, MR. CHAIRMAN, MY GENERAL 
COUNSEL, RUSSELL BRUEMMER, WHO IS SEATED BEHIND ME, HAS ADVISED 
ME THAT THIS DEFINITION, IF ADOPTED, MAY CAUSE CONFUSION ABOUT 
THE STANDARD USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A FINDING IS NECESSARY 
TO AUTHORIZE AN ACTIVITY; WE HAVE ALSO REQUESTED THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE', AND THEY HAVE 
REACHED A SIMILAR CONCLUSION,

.01A-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 23 
THE PROPOSED DEFINITION OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, IN THE DILL 
COULD ALTER CURRENT PRACTICE. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH', AS THE 
COMMITTEE KNOWS, HAS INTERPRETED THE HUGHES/RYAN AMENDMENT IN A 
MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS LEGISLATIVE 
INTENT. THE HUGHES/RYAN AMENDMENT, IF GIVEN -AN OVERLY 
RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION, WOULD REQUIRE PRESIDENTIAL 
AUTHORIZATION FOR EVEN THE MOST MINOR OR ROUTINE ACTIVITIES OF 
THE CIA OVERSEAS IF THEY WERE NOT RELATED SOLELY TO 
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION, IN MY JUDGMENT, THAT IS NOT A PROPER 
INTERPRETATION AND WAS NEWER THE INTENT OF CONGRESS IN ENACTING 
HUGHES/RYAN. 
THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY TO HUGHES/RYAN AND THE OVERSIGHT 
ACT OF 1980, CONTEMPLATE A FINDING FOR. THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT 
TRULY CAN BE CONSIDERED COVERT ACTION CPERATIONS IN THIS 
CONNECTION, THE DEFINITION, OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONTAINED IN 
THE EXECUTIVE CkDER GIVES MEANING TO THE LANGUAGE AND INTENT OF 
THE HUGHES/RYAN AMENDMENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THAT LAW WOULD 
REQUIRE A FINDING TO AUTHORIZE A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY. 
ENACTING .H.R.. 3822 AS DRAFTED'WOULD'MAKE IT EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BECAUSE THE 
EXECUTIVE ORDER DEFINITION WOULD BY TERMS 0F THE NOT

APPLY TO CIA,- THE CLEAR 'IMPLICATION WOULD BE THAT CONGRESS 
INTENDS THAT THE LANGUAGE OF HUGHES/RYA. BE GIVEN k MORE 
RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION. 
THIS COULD EE CONSTRUES TO MEAN THE FOLLOING TYRES CF 
ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICH FINDINGS ARE. NOT OBTAINED-TODAY, WOULD 
HENCEFORTh REQUIRE SPECIFIC PRESIENUAL AUTHORIZATION IN EVERY 
CASE NO MATTER HOW MINOR THE CIA ROLE:

CONDUCT OF DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES. THIS WOULD INCLUDE, 
FOR EXAMPLE, HAVING THE CHIEF OF STATION PRESENT THE

FOREIGN MINISTER BECAUSE OF HIS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE FpREIGN EINISTER, OR ARRANGING FOR SECURE 
TRANSPORTATION OR A MEETING SITE FOR AN?AMEASSADOR OR

IF WE ARE It: AGREEMENT NCT TO ALTER THE CURRENT PRACTICE

? GOVERN A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY, I WOULD URGE THECOMITTEE TO 
MODIFY THE DEFINITION OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONTAINED IN THE 
BILL. ONE APPROACH .WOULD BE TO REPEAL THE HUGHES/RYAN 
DEFINITION AN: USE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER DEFINITION CF SPECIAL 
ACTIVITIES TO COVER EVLRY DEPARTMENT CR AGENCY;' INCLUDING CIA., 
THERE ARE OTHER POSSIBLE WAYS TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERN, AND I 
HAVE INSTRUCTED MY STAFF TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO COME UP 
WITH MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE. THE ?KEY, AGAIN, I THINK WE 
CAN AGREE, IS FORMULATING LANGUAGE THAT WILL-MAINTAIN THE 
STATUS QUO. I MUST ADD AS A FINAL NOTE, MOREOVER, THAT THE 
DEFINITION PROPOSED IN ?THE BILL TODAY, AS WELL AS THAT IN THE 
- SENATE BILL, ARE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH I ADDRESSED WHEN I 
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. FOR THAT 
REASON, I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THESE 
CONCERNS AT THE TIME OF MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY.

FUNDING OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES  
MY THIRD-AREA,OF SPECIFIC CONCERN IS WITH SECTION 4 OF THE 
DILL, WHICH AMENDS SECTION 502 OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 
1947. SECTION 502(A) OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT- LIMITS THE 
USE OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS. CURRENTLY, APPROPRIATED FUNDS 
AVAILABLE TO AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY -MAY BE SPENT ONLY IF (1) 
FUNDING FOR THE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS; (2) 
IN THE CASE OF RELEASE FROM THE RESERVE FOR CONTINGENCIES, 
NOTICE CF THE INTENT TO RELEASE SUCH FUNDS IS GIVEN TO THE 
INTELLIGENCE AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES; OR (3) IN THE CASE 
OF REPROGRAMMINGS OK TRANSFERS, THE ACTIVITY TO BE FUNDED_ IS A 
HIGHER PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY, THE _NEED FOR FUNDS FOR 
_SUCK'. ACTIVITY IS BASED,ON'UNFORSEEN'REOUIREMENTS,'AND NOTICE IS 
GIVEN TO THE INTELLIGENCE AND APPROPRIATIOK COMMITTEES OF THE 
INTENT TO MAKE FUND& AVAILABLE FOR THE ACTIVITY. THE BILL 
WOULD AMEND SECTION 502(A) OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT TO 
RESTRICT EXPENDITURE OF ALL FUNDS, AND NOT JUST APPROPRIATED 
FUNDS. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD JEOPARDIZE OUR 
AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES WHICH CONGRESS HAS 
SUPPORTED IN THE PAST. SPECIFICALLY, THE AMENDMENT WOULD 
RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO USE INCOME GENERATED BY PROPRIETARIES 
FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES NECESSARY TO MAKE THE PROPRIETARY APPEAR 
AS A COMMERCIAL ENTITY. THIS WOULD MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
-12-

IA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
TO OPERATE OUR PROPRIETARIES IN A SECURE MANNER. THE AMENDMENT 
WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE AUTHORITY OF SEVERAL AGENCIES IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO MAKE CERTAIN ACCOMMODATION PURCHASES 
FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. FINALLY, THE AMENDMENT WOULD ELIMINATE 
OUR AUTHORITY TO RECEIVE FUNDS DONATED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO 
FINANCE SPECIAL ACTIVITIES FOR WHICHA FINDING HAS BEEN 
OBTAINED. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO 
KEEPING THE COMMITTEE GENERALLY INFORMED OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN 
THESE THREE AREAS. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO STATED RATIONALE 
FCR THE NEED FOR THIS CHANGE, tND IN MY VIEW ADOPTION OF THIS 
PROVISION WOULD HAVE A VERY SERIOUS AND DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON 
OUR CONTINUING ABILITY TO CONDUCT SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, LIAISON 
ACTIVITIES WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND OPERATIONS OF 
PROPRIETARIES. 
TRANSFER OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES 
THE FOURTH AREA OF CONCERN IS WITH THE PROVISION OF THE 
BILL AMENDING SECTION 503 OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT, WHICH 
CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR THE REPCRTING TO THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEES OF THE TRANSFER OF DEFENSE ARTICLES OR SERVICES IN 
EXCESS OF $1,000,000 BY AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. THE SECTION 
WOULD BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF DEFENSE ARTICLES 
OR SERVICES WHICH ARE INDIVIDUALLY WORTH LESS THAN $1,000,000 
BUT WHICH AGGREGATE TO A FIGURE MORE THAN $1,000,000. I DO NOT

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
BELIEVE IT IS NECECESSARY TO CHANGE THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR 
REPORTING THE TRANSFER OF ,DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES.' 
FURTHERMORE, I NOTE THAT THE. PROVISION DOES NOT PROVIDE 
STANDARDS TO DETERMINE_WHEN'DEFENSE ARTICLES OR SERVICES SHOULD 
BE AGGREGATED. ACCORDINGLY, IF THIS PROVISION REMAINS IN THE 
EILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM, I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO 
CONSIDER STATUTORY LANGUAGE OR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY THAT WOULD 
PROVIDE CLEAR. GUIDANCE ON HON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SHOULD 
AGGREGATE DEFENSE ARTICLES OR SERVICES FOR PURPOSES OF. 
REPORTING TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES. 
? 
THERE ALSO ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT, 
WHILE NOT AS WORRISOME AS THE ONES I HAVE. TOUCHED ON, WOULD AS ' 
WRITTEN POSE PROBLEMS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. MY STAFF-, 
HAS ALREADY HAD USEFUL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON 
THESE PROVISIONS. 
IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE TOEACH OF YOU. MY 
PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO, MAKING THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS WORK. IT 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR, AND RECENT EXPERIENCE HAS AGAIN 
DEMONSTRATED, THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOREIGN POLICY OF 
OUR GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, CAN ONLY BE 
SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF 
GOVERNMENT WORK TOGETHER IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND

TRUST. THIS SPIRIT OF COOPERATION CAN ONLY OCCUR IF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION 
NEEDED TO REVIEW AND MAKE INFORMED JUDGMENTS ON SPECIAL 
ACTIVITIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT THIS 
INFORMATION IS PROTECTED FROM UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE. .THE LAW 
SHOULD REFLECT NOT ONLY THE NEED FOR COOPERATION, BUT ALSO THE 
PRESIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT AND MANAGEMENT OF 
OUR INTELLIGENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE TO THE NATION OF ENSURING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY AND AUTHORITY 
TO EMPLOY OUR INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY EFFECTIVELY. 
As I HAVE NOTED, THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN CORRECTIVE STEPS 
TO IMPROVE THE OVERSIGHT SYSTEM THROUGH A PRESIDENTIAL 
DIRECTIVE. AT CIA, I HAVE APPROVED A NUMBER OF MEASURES WHICH 
WILL HELP TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE 
AGENCY'S PERFORMANCE IN THE IRAN/CONTRA MATTER. IN SHORT, 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY 
SUBMIT THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE TC WORK, I AM 
CONVINCED THAT THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK, AND NOT NEW LAWS, 
REPRESENTS THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ACHIEVE 
OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO HAVE CONGRESS PLAY AN ACTIVE, 
EFFECTIVE ROLE IN THE OVERSIGHT OF UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE 
ACTIVITIES.

Chairman _McHum'. Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
If H.R. 3822 were adopted, Judge Webster, do you see any cir-
cumstances under which it might be unlikely that the CIA might 
take action to help rescue people or save the lives of threatened in-
dividuals or protect the security of the U.S. if they were bound by 
the sweeping provisions of this particular bill? 
Judge WEBSTER. I think the Central Intelligence Agency would 
undertake to do whatever the President would authorize us to do 
on a finding made after a presentation to the National Security 
Council. The more practical questions would come up in terms of 
whether or not we could do this effectively and successfully consist-
ent with commitments that we might have to others. 
One small example?the other intelligence agencies of friendly 
countries with whom we work are far more sensitive to the matter 
of dissemination of information affecting their assets and their 
agents acting abroad than we have seemed to appear in the past. 
If, for example, we were to receive?they were to provide us with 
information, and I use this purely hypothetically, the location of a 
hostage somewhere in the world, but would want the opportunity 
to extradite their own asset from the scene, which normally takes 
place to protect that asset, and declined to give us the information 
without assurances that that information would go no further, we 
would be put in a very heavy dilemma. We could not make that 
commitment to our foreign service if we were compelled in that un-
usual circumstance to tell the Congress. 
I use that as a kind of example to show that it is possible to come 
up with something that would present us with very real problems. 
But we would not back away from doing our job if we could do it 
and protect the lives of our sources. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. But in fact, this legislation might inhibit you 
from doing your job? 
Judge WEBSTER. I could see circumstances under which it would 
raise serious questions of whether we could get and utilize the in-
formation, if there were not a possibility?we have been successful 
in backing some of our friends off of their positions on disclosure, 
but we need that little bit of breathing room. The President needs 
it. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. You mentioned the provision in the bill requir-
ing all expenditures of funds by the CIA to be both authorized and 
appropriated. Can you tell me whether that would go too far to in-
clude your jurisdiction or ability to expend funds coming from 
third countries, for example? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is my understanding, that the definition is 
more restrictive than the one we currently operate under and I 
would hope Congress would address it, because Congress has sup-
ported that activity in the past. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. So in fact if a country wanted to pay for activi-
ties which would suppress terrorism or activities threatening both 
their country and ours, and they were prepared to foot the bill, we 
would practically have to go through an Act of Congress to accept 
that money, is that correct? 
Judge WEBSTER. With the language in the current bill I think 
you would have to do something very special. It has been my expe-

32 
rience that again the countries which assist us in this way are 
often very sensitive about having their assistance publicly adver-
tised. We have been very careful to keep the committees fully in-
formed of the fact that foreign countries have given us assistance, 
and it is not an attempt to have foreign countries do something in-
consistent with the foreign policy of this country, but one where 
their assistance has been vital and appreciated. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. You touched on changing the definition of spe-
cial activity. I understood what you meant was that by the chang-
ing of that definition in this bill that it ultimately would require?
why don't you explain it for me? 
Judge WEBSTER. I listed a number of circumstances in my state-
ment that I think would be adversely affected by making the dis-
tinction between CIA special activities under the Hughes-Ryan 
amendment and other agency special activities which would be de-
fined consistent with the existing executive order 12333. 
One of the most important of these is counterintelligence activi-
ties. Surely Congress ?did not intend that these activities require 
special findings in order to keep track of the hostile intelligence of-
ficers operating around the world targeted at us and at our agen-
cies of government. We give considerable support to our State De-
partment. The contacts that we make, the liaison efforts developed 
through the years, have been extraordinarily useful to the State 
Department. 
The CIA does not have a foreign policy, a separate policy, it is 
implementing with the knowledge and approval of the State De-
partment the foreign policy of this country. 
We do other things?a number of recent elections where there 
was some possibility of violence in another country, preparations 
were underway to consider whether the CIA could assist US citi-
zens in getting out of that country. Certainly Congress didn't 
intend that type of activity--
Mr. LIVINGSTON. My time has expired, but isn't it fair to say that 
if this bill were passed that your flexibility to carry out the oper-
ations in the interest of American citizens and in the security in-
terests of the U.S. would be gravely curtailed? 
Judge WEBSTER. I think that is correct. Particularly with respect 
to the last three of the four issues that I mentioned, I think that 
those need adjusting. 
The other one is more of a judgment call in terms of our ability 
and the frequency with which it would be implicated. But the last 
three, certainly that is true. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much,-Mr. Chairman. 
Judge Webster, you mentioned in your testimony at page 4 that 
you have taken steps within the CIA to discipline those employees 
who fail to follow CIA procedures and meet the standards of con-
duct expected of CIA employees who have testified to Congress in a 
manner that is not forthcoming and candid. You have done that 
and I want to take this opportunity to publicly commend you for 
the forthright action you have taken with reference to instituting 
procedures to insure that CIA employees will comply with the law 
and that in their testimony before the Congress they will be forth-

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-103 
right and candid. You dealt adequately, I think, with those who 
have not done so in the past. And so you are commended for that. 
The problem that we see here is that, unfortunately, you are not 
speaking for the entire Administration. You would have no control 
whatsoever over people like Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North or 
Admiral Poindexter, people who arrogated unto themselves powers 
not constitutionally given to them. 
So, there is a very real problem here, notwithstanding the confi-
dence, faith and trust we place in a person of your high integrity 
and capability. 
A part of the problem here is when you speak of placing a premi-
um on cooperation. The essence of our foreign policy initiatives 
being able to work under our intelligence laws is cooperation be-
tween the Administrative and the Congressional Branches. 
But what we have seen is a breakdown of that policy. I do not 
think the Iran-contra situation would have occurred had the Presi-
dent just complied with the law, had he given the Congress notice 
as we have been given notice of so many other covert actions. 
You speak, in fact, of the new Presidential Directive. There are a 
couple of things I think we ought to talk about in conjunction with 
that. That new Presidential Directive was the response of the 
President to the Iran-contra hearings conducted by the House and 
Senate. In fact, it came about as a result of an initiative through 
Senator Boren and contact with the White House. 
There were many meetings held. In fact, we, our committee, also 
attended a couple of those meetings. Finally, the President worked 
out, executed, and issued the Directive. 
I served on the Iran-Contra Committee. During the course of 
those hearings, we -found a covert action policy approval and co-
ordination procedure, National Service NSDD 159, in which the 
President had made his findings and talked of what he would do 
with reference to complying with the law. 
The problem was that the President did not follow his own 
NSDD. I don't know how you would avoid that situation now with 
this new Presidential finding. Obviously, the Senate Intelligence 
Committee did not have much faith in it, because it reported S. 
1721 in spite of the Directive having been issued. 
Could you respond to that for us? 
Judge WEBSTER. Well, I see my responsibility to make sure that 
that finding is communicated to the Congress within 48 hours, as 
the NSDD currently requires. It would take a specific order by the 
President to in any way defer my getting that information to you 
within 48 hours, and it would?I would personally, as well as other 
members who have that responsibility, require the National Securi-
ty Planning Group to reassess that decision every 10 days. 
I agree with the chairman that there were many things that hap-
pened in Iran-contra that would not have happened had existing 
procedures in place been followed. The-most egregious, of course, 
was allowing the process to be dictated by?in an operational way 
by the National Security Council, whose employees had no real un-
derstanding or experience with the requirements of notification 
and cooperation with the Congressional oversight committees. 
I think it is very clear that that must never happen again. The 
commitments are publicly made that there will be no operational

responsibility out of the National Security Council; and the only 
other assurance that I can give you is that I personally?and I be-
lieve it is the requirement of every subsequent Director of Central 
Intelligence to see that those procedures are followed. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much, Judge Webster. 
Chairman McHuGii. Mr. Shuster? 
Mr. SHUSTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
We certainly appreciate your testimony today, Judge Webster. 
One of my deep concerns about this legislation is that I think we 
have to put it in the context of the kind of world in which we live, 
which is a very dangerous world in which there are many govern-
ments and many people who would like to put the United States 
and American citizens in harm's way. 
I have read this?tried to read this proposed legislation through 
the eyes of intelligence directors, your counterparts, from friendly 
countries. I would be interested in your observation, your views on 
how you think your counterparts in foreign governments, friendly 
foreign governments, would interpret this, and what changes, if 
any, would they make in their dealing with the United States and 
with you? 
Judge WEBSTER. I have already had some experience with that. 
When the initial discussions that Chairman Stokes referred to took 
place between Senator Boren and others in an effort to work out 
an accommodation with the President, the President wrote a letter 
to the Congress expressing his intentions to notify the Congress of 
various things. 
That letter had been put together on fairly short notice. We had 
not had an opportunity to point out what we expected would be the 
concerns of other intelligence services. They really lined up, some 
in writing, delivering written letters, messages from Chiefs of Intel-
ligence to me, wanting to know precisely what that meant in terms 
of our current relationship and expressing their alarm and concern 
that the sacrosanct third agency rule, which is understood through-
out the intelligence world, might be breached in the process. 
I think that the National Security Decision Directive appropri-
ately deals with that issue and the language, the current language 
of the bill that you are considering minimizes that risk somewhat. 
From language that was originally suggested, I believe, in the 
Senate bill. But there is anxiety whenever another government be-
lieves that we lack the capacity to protect as to their information, 
their information, from becoming a part of the general, widely dis-
seminated intelligence information. We have that obligation not to 
pass it along without their expressed approval. 
So, I think it does present some problems for us, but they have 
been largely minimized by the negotiations between our represent-
atives and staff. 
Mr. SHUSTER. IS it fair to say that we are significantly dependent 
upon other intelligence agencies of other countries for information, 
that we rely on them on an ongoing basis? As they rely on us? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is certainly true. If it were not for the fact 
that they are very significantly dependent on us for places?infor-
mation for places in the world where they have no coverage, I sus-
pect the kinds of things we do in terms of spreading information 
around would cause them to break off relations with us entirely.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
We take that view with intelligence agencies with whom we 
work. We do, in fact?without getting into anything in a public 
hearing?I recently had to take steps where I thought information 
that was of a very sensitive nature had not been properly handled 
by people to whom it was properly disseminated, but got out. 
It is a sensitive area. We need to build the assurance of the ca-
pacity to protect information. 
Mr. SHUSTER. In our general provisions, we say that the commit-
tees are to be kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence 
activities of the United States, including any significant anticipat-
ed intelligence activities. 
Then we modify that to some extent over on page 6 by saying to 
the extent consistent with due regard for the protection from unau-
thorized- disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive in-
telligence sources and methods. 
The question of sources and methods. Is this modifying language 
clear enough to give you what you need to withhold sources and 
methods when you feel lives may be jeopardized or other intelli-
gence activities may be adversely affected, or is this language too 
vague? 
Judge WEBSTER. Well, I would rather not be the last word on the 
technical aspects of that language. It is the kind of language we 
have worked with in the past, and it is the kind of language that is 
sort of the counterpart to giving the President a little bit of breath-
ing room. 
We will try to keep Congress fully informed, recognizing that in 
the area of sources and methods, we need extra protection, and the 
Congressional committees, I think, have in most instances been 
very cooperative with us in not pressing for that kind of informa-
tion. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Thank you very much. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Hyde? 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Good morning, Judge Webster. 
Judge WEBSTER. Good morning, Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. HYDE. It just seems to me this legislation is a response to the 
old adage, "Don't just stand there, do something, even if it is 
wrong." We had a situation involving Iran-contra where the laws 
may well have been violated, bent, ignored, or circumvented. So, in-
stead of focusing on the people whose misfeasance, or malfeasance 
contributed to that situation, we rushed to change the law, as 
though it were inadequate. 
Now, overhanging this whole issue, it seems to me, is something 
we do not talk about in this committee. That is, the total criminal, 
obscene inability of Congress and government people in general to 
keep a secret. 
If sensitive information cannot be held closely, cannot be kept 
confidential, our country has a real problem. We don't address that 
here. In fact, I do not know of any real serious legislative efforts on 
the part of the Majority to address that problem. Since I have been 
on the committee, I can think of three major leaks that occurred to 
the press that involved people's lives and sensitive operations. 
One most recently, Judge Webster, involved a defector; and infor-
mation was developed about him that was so closely held by this

committee that I did not know about it, as the ranking Republican. 
I heard about it from a Washington Post newspaper reporter who 
asked me some questions about it. I had never heard about it 
before. 
It is damaging to our national security, to our entire counterin-
telligence operation. I guess we are conducting an investigation of 
that, but I will not hold my breath waiting for any results, because 
those things just never seem to produce any results. 
We also have the phenomenon of Members of Congress believing 
it is their duty to leak information if they do not agree with the 
policy. I have citations on that. So, I guess until we deal with the 
problem of keeping senstitive information confidential, you are 
always going to have poor intelligence people and government 
people who have to communicate wondering whether they will be 
signing the death warrants of people. 
Once it gets to us, it gets in the paper. I don't want to give a 
commercial for Woodward's book, but it seems to me if you read 
that, you ought to wonder whether we are equipped to survive in 
the world today with information of a highly sensitive nature just 
common knowledge on the street. 
The Canadian cooperation in Iran, where for three months, Con-
gress was not notified simply because the Canadians said, "Don't 
you do it, our people's lives are at stake. We will help you get your 
people out of Iran. They can stay at our Embassy. We will cooper-
ate with the passports and everything, but don't tell Congress, be-
cause our people's lives are at stake." 
You just could not enlist their cooperation if this bill was the 
law; is that correct? 
Judge WEBSTER. They would not, in a situation such as you de-
scribed, they might very well decline to supply the information or 
to take the action that exposed their own people to risk if we could 
not assure them that it would go no further. 
It is not a reflection on the Congress as it is an effort to limit to 
absolute need-to-know and the fewest number of people as a proc-
ess of protecting lives. I think Congress?other countries and?I 
must say in candor, Canada faces similar problems in current 
pending legislation. So, we might be reluctant to give them some 
information now if they could not give us the appropriate assur-
ances that would protect our people. 
Mr. HYDE. In other words, six lives would probably not have been 
saved at least in the way they were and gotten out of that country, 
because you would not guarantee?you could not live up to the con-
ditions set by Canada, namely don't tell anybody, if this were the 
law; is that correct? 
Judge WEBSTER. Well, I think that is correct, Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. HYDE. Okay. Do you live for the day Congress will address 
the problem of leaks and how we deal with them? Or do you think 
that is too Utopian? I do, I must say. 
Judge WEBSTER. It is a problem I have been observing for about 
10 years. I have no quick fix for it, other than a recognition that 
the possibility of public dissemination grows exponentially with the 
number of people in government who have the information. 
Mr. HYDE. It would be reassuring, though, if we address the prob-
lem, would it not?

Judge WEBSTER. It would be very helpful if everyone involved 
took it seriously and took serious action against known leakers. 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you. 
Chairman McHum" Mr. McEwen? 
Mr. McEwEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Judge Webster, thank you for your excellent testimony. I believe 
most of my questions have been answered. Something I would like 
for you to address, if you could, in particular, is as we are consider-
ing this legislation, an additional recommendation is being made. 
Keeping in mind, as you know, people who hold information on 
covert activities have a virtual veto power over the success of those 
covert operations. 
If they chose in many instances to use that information improp-
erly, they can subvert the operation. We are going to be advised 
after your testimony, that is given a proposal, that the legislation 
should also include a provision that any government officer or em-
ployee who knowingly or willingly conspired to violate the prohibi-
tion of expenditure of funds for covert activity would face criminal 
penalties. 
In other words, if the President did not notify in what was deter-
mined to be a timely manner, the 48 hours, then anyone in the 
government could be held criminally liable, and thereby a sense of 
responsibility to take self-protective action on their own would be 
created. 
If the 48-hour notification isn't sufficiently troublesome, what 
would be your reaction to this? ? 
Judge WEBSTER. I want to be sure that I understand the provi-
sion. Would you mind going through it again? If it becomes a crimi-
nal offense to conspire to use--
Mr. McEwEN. It says not only must the President notify within 
48 hours, but if he doesn't and proceeds to implement a covert ac-
tivity, any government official?let me say any government officer 
or employee who then knowingly and willfully conspires to violate 
that prohibition against the expenditure of funds would face crimi-
nal penalties. 
In other words, a carrot to the bureaucracy to say if you feel that 
the President has not acted properly, that in your interests, you 
had better do something? Any reaction to that at all? 
Judge WEBSTER. You are really catching me cold on it. I would 
like to think through the implications. I have far less concern 
about the people who are charged with knowledge of the failure of 
compliance than someone who has been given an order out in the 
field to carry something out that he has every right to assume has 
been properly authorized. 
I certainly -would not want to hold that kind of person accounta-
ble for doing something that would otherwise be entirely reasona-
ble. If you are suggesting penalties for people who violate laws, I 
think there is a lot to be said for putting penalties on prohibitions. 
Prohibitions without penalties are not always very useful. 
Mr. McEwEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Richardson? 
Mr. RICHARDSON. Thank you very much. 
Judge Webster, first of all, I want to thank you for a series of 
excellent briefings I received at the Agency the other day. I think

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
you have an excellent staff I appreciate the work you did to see 
that as a new Member, I got that exposure to the Agency. 
Let me just put forth a little aside before I ask you a couple of 
questions. My colleague from Illinois mentioned the issue of leaks 
in the Congress. I think many of us would be willing to join in ad-
dressing the issue of leaks with a recognition and understanding 
that leaks come from every agency of the government. 
I think the gentleman from Illinois mentioned the book, "Veil." 
If he reads that book once again, one of the major sources of Bob 
Woodward were agency officials, including the head of the CIA. 
Mr. HYDE. That is a given. We all know that. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. Yes. I just want to emphasize that I think leaks 
have been a problem, but they come from everybody. They come 
from the Executive Branch. As long as we have that understand-
ing. 
Judge, I guess my question on the 48-hour issue is this: Apart 
from the constitutional issue of notification, that obviously has to 
be formulated in the White House legal office, you mentioned this 
Canadian example. But are there any other sufficient reasons why 
this provision, this 48-hour provision messes up our intelligence op-
erations? 
What is the disadvantage of having this provision in pure, stark 
intelligence terms? 
Judge WEBSTER. Well, I have given you the one example that 
comes to mind when the President's options are limited because of 
the involvement of necessary assistance from outside the United 
States, where the authorities of that country will not allow the in-
formation to be used other than inside the intelligence community. 
Beyond that, I am frank to admit that my mind does not raise 
many hypothetical situations; and I feel a little better about it, be-
cause as I said earlier, there have only been three situations in the 
history of this legislation where information was withheld. 
So, it is not mechanically a tough thing to handle. We can do the 
48 hours. I would expect that we would do the 48 hours?I really 
would be surprised if, in my tenure, we ever had a situation where 
the President would invoke that privilege, executive privilege; but 
it also seems to me that it forecloses the possibility of that situa-
tion at a time when we would most need it, when lives would be 
involved. As long as the President has made the accommodation 
with Congress to publicly acknowledge his commitment to deliver 
and to reassess any decision not to deliver. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. Then, Judge, I take it that you prefer that the 
definition of timely notification not be changed? I guess my ques-
tion to that is how would you at this juncture define "timely"? 
Judge WEBS'TER. I view "timely" to mean as soon as you can rea-
sonably get the information to the Congress. I either ought to 
decide that it is too sensitive to further disseminate, in which case 
the President has to make that finding in writing, order in writing, 
which is reviewed in ten days, or if he does not do that, everything 
should get up here? as quickly as possible, considering that you 
would view 48 hours and he views 48 hours as leaving enough room 
for us to find you, get all the documentation, information, and so 
on to you. Less than 48 hours in almost every situation.

Mr. RICHARDSON. In the "extraordinary cases" language, you 
really are talking about only eight senior Members of Congress 
that are notified. I attended a briefing the other day where there 
was a small amount?there wasn't an extraordinary case situation. 
But there were Department of Defense, State liaison people, 
there were 20 people in the room. I guess in the face of such num-
bers, is it realistic to contend that telling eight congressional lead-
ers under that Senate bill is enough of a risk to override the Con-
gress' prerogatives in this area? 
I just fail to see how that--
Judge WEBSTER. I understand your position. As I repeatedly said, 
I can foresee very few circumstances where?scenarios where the 
risk would warrant it. The one that comes repeatedly to mind to 
me is a situation in which the information was not generated from 
within our own community, but was offered to us on a commitment 
not to further disseminate that kind of information because of the 
life-threatening characteristics of the information, as it relates to 
the citizens or agents of the country providing us with the informa-
tion. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. Judge, my time is up. I just want to point out 
the only time when prior notification was not given was this recent 
decision which was opposed by the Secretary of State, the Secre-
tary of Defense, was done by mid-level NSC personnel, and was not 
properly staffed out even in the agency. I do think that this legisla-
tion on the early face of it is needed. 
I thank you, Judge. Once again, I thank you for what appears to 
be very high morale at the agency and very fine officers. 
Judge WEBSTER. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Glickman. 
Mr. GLICKMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I, too, as a new member want to thank you and the agency for 
your help. Your number-two man is a contemporary of mine from 
my home town. His brother is the principal of the high school I 
went to. So I have a stake in his success, as well as your success. 
I was also pleased with your nomination. I think the agency has 
become too politicized, and you bring a depoliticized aura to this 
agency. I would like to see it so we have a CIA Director that we all 
could trust that could retain that position in successive administra-
tions, kind of like we did a little bit with the FBI. 
Let me pursue a different line of questioning. It looks to me like 
covert activities on occasion are necessary. But we may be taking 
the focus away from the gathering of information, which is the 
most significant part of your job, by what I consider to be a rather 
free-wheeling and routine reliance on covert activities. 
Knowledge is power. If we overly focus on things other than 
gathering information, we are not as smart as the their side, and, 
therefore, we do not know what kind of foreign policy actions to 
take, and I guess what concerns me about all of this is we are jeop-
ardizing the chief function of your agency: the collection of infor-
mation. 
I would like to ask you as Director of this agency: what is your 
personal philosophy on the use of covert actions vis-a-vis gathering 
of information, and how do you see your personal role in this proc-
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

40 
ess? Are you just carrying out whatever the President and the Na-
tional Security Advisor want to do? 
Do you see yourself as kind of an independent operator, not only 
doing what is right within the law, but making an input to the 
process itself? Notwithstanding what we do in the law right here, 
you guys are going to be chiefly responsible for deciding if these 
things are carried out or not. 
I do not want to see a CIA so focused on intervention and unfo-
cused on intelligence and collection of information. 
Judge WEBSTER. I will be glad to respond to that question. I think 
it is a very important one. 
I think it is somewhat ironic that we are looking?we are dis-
cussing the tension between the executive and the congressional 
branches over the issue of 48-hour notification in covert action 
where, at least I have said, I have difficulty in seeing any kinds of 
situations where 48 hours cannot be complied with, but I would un-
derstand why the President wants to have that room. 
Then we look and say, okay, we are talking about almost a non-
existent problem as it applies to covert action. We look at covert 
action and we find that it represents about three percent of the 
total resources of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
So it is a very small activity in relation to what we do. Yet if we 
do not do it well, or if we do it other than by prescribed procedures, 
it becomes a matter of enormous, and legitimately so, public inter-
est. 
So our main mission is to obtain information, as you point out, 
which will be useful in the form in which it is printed?I am talk-
ing about analytical capability?to the policy makers of this coun-
try to make wise decision. 
That information is shared full with the oversight committees as 
well because they have a role in policy making efforts. 
But I do not think that we are ever going to be in a position 
where this country can sacrifice its ability to engage in covert 
action where appropriate. Covert action is not a separate thing, as 
I see it. 
I think I am responding to your question. It is to implement the 
foreign policy of this country. It usually comes as a result of the 
State Department or others with the State Department asking us 
to deal with a problem that cannot be handled through convention-
al diplomatic means or diplomatic personnel, and where the United 
States would want, if possible, to be in a position not to acknowl-
edge its role. 
Again, there are many reasons why this can happen and does 
happen, not the least of which is that the country with whom we 
are dealing or assisting may not wish our role known, and there 
are other diplomatic reasons for not wanting it to be publicly 
known. 
So they come to the one agency with worldwide bases and con-
nections capable of engaging in covert action. 
Most of that action is in the effort of getting a United States 
message across through various forms of communication. It does 
have some paramilitary- capability to assist organizations, either 
existing governments that we favor or insurgencies that are fight-
ing for democracy, to have a capability to succeed.

41 
So when we are asked to do that, we comply, but in devising a 
covert action program, and understanding the procedures that I am 
satisfied are fully now in place, we review those scenarios internal-
ly through the different directorates, and then it comes to a cross 
directorate organization called the CARG, the Covert Action 
Review Group, in which all considerations are tested against such 
questions as is this consistent with the overt foreign policy of this 
country? 
That would have wiped out the Iran-contra activity had we been 
doing it instead of the National Security Council. 
We ask ourselves is it consistent as we understand it with Ameri-
can values? 
If it becomes public, as so many of these do, will it make sense to 
the American people? 
Having crossed all of those bridges, we take the program to the 
National Security Council, where it is fully vetted with the cabinet 
officers involved sitting on the National Security Planning Group. 
Most often, I think every time since I have been doing this, 
chaired by the President. Everyone has an opportunity to have 
their say before the presidential finding approving the covert 
action is made. 
So, truly, it is not something the CIA goes off and does by itself. 
It is something that has been fully thought through and authorized 
at the highest levels of our government with the knowledge of the 
President. 
Those are pretty good protections for the future, and to the three 
percent of our funds that are used for this purpose, the very limit-
ed possibility that Congress will be deferred in knowing, I think we 
are on the right track. 
Mr. GIACKMAN. Thank you. My time has expired. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Glickman. 
At this point, we will see if any other Members have questions. 
I just have one or two. 
Judge Webster, we have understandably focused on the 48-hour 
provision which is, I think, the most controversial of the proposals, 
but in doing so, I want to be clear that we are all in agreement as 
to what the current law is. 
The general rule, as I understand it, is that in virtually all cases, 
the Administration will notify the Intelligence Committees at the 
beginning before a covert action commences. That is, the prior noti-
fication is the general rule. You have no disagreement with that, 
do you? 
Judge WEBSTER. No, I don't. 
Chairman McHum." And the reason for that?I appreciate that 
answer?the reason for that is that not only does the Congress 
have the right to know about fundamental policy decisions, but 
that the President might just benefit from the feedback he gets 
from members of the Intelligence Committees or the leadership. 
As other Members have said before, if the President had shared 
with us the idea of selling arms to Iran, I am sure Members on 
both sides of the aisle would have raised strong objections. It is pos-
sible the President could have been dissuaded from what I think 
most of us now agree was a mistake.

You have very honestly, I think, plumbed your line to determine 
if there are particular cases where 48 hours would be a problem for 
notification after an action commenced. And you have come up 
with at least one situation where I think all of us would agree we 
don't want to impede the intelligence community, and thus, I hope 
in drafting this legislation, working with your people, we can avoid 
that. 
Contrast that with our concern of what we think?many of us 
think at least is not a trivial problem for Congress. That is that on 
a fundamental policy decision for the United States of America, no 
one in the Congress was told for a long period of time. 
Now, our problem is not just that that happened in the Iran case, 
which it did, but that the Justice Department and as I understand 
it, the Administration generally, takes the position it is legally 
okay. I understand and appreciate the fact that you say we will not 
do that, but the position of the Administration is that "we have the 
right to do it. It is our constitutional lawful prerogative to withhold 
this information." 
That is what concerns me. Let me try to explore briefly the con-
stitutional issue. I know you prefer to defer that to the lawyers, al-
though you are a distinguished judge. 
I presume you would agree that Congress has the lawful author-
ity to provide no funds for CIA activities? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is correct. That is an admission against in-
terest, but it is correct. 
Chairman McHuGH. There is nobody on this committee that 
would do that, but we are talking here about lawful authority. 
Therefore, I assume it follows that we would have the lawful au-
thority to provide no funds for your contingency fund and, there-
fore, for covert activity? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is also correct. 
Chairman McHuGH. I have a difficult time, therefore, ? under-
standing why, when we do provide funds we do not have the right 
to say, "as a condition for these funds, we need to be told what is 
happening on fundamental policy decisions." 
The position of the Administration is, yes, you have the author-
ity not to fund us, but you don't have the authority to ask us to tell 
you what we are doing with those funds unless we choose to tell 
you. 
That is what bothers me. I have a difficult time understanding 
that legal proposition and in practice it has led, at least in this one 
case, to a situation where, in fact, the Administration has withheld 
fundamental information about a policy decision affecting the 
people of the United States and the Administration takes the posi-
tion to this day that that was okay legally, even though it might 
have been bad judgment. 
Mr. HYDE. Would the gentleman yield? 
Chairman McHuGH. I will be happy to yield. 
Mr. HYDE. Just to add a little addendum to your question. I sug-
gest the problem of constitutionality is very complicated and in-
volved here. I do not believe Congress would have the right to with-
hold salaries from the Supreme Court even though no one can take 
a gun to our head and say you must appropriate money for sala-
ries.

43 
But if we were to pass a law saying unless the court reverses Roe 
versus Wade, no funds appropriated may be used for salaries for 
the Supreme Court, clearly that would be unconstitutional. In fact, 
I know there is case law that we may not abuse the power of the 
purse to achieve certain policy decisions. 
I am far from capable or competent to outline the parameters of 
that, but I guess what I am saying is the power of the purse is not 
unlimited. We cannot force certain policy decisions through the use 
of the power of the purse. 
I simply throw that out as a qualifier to the general statement 
that we have the power of the purse, therefore, we can require any 
sort of information that Congress sees fit. 
Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. I appreciate the gentleman's comment. I 
simply wanted to express to you, Judge Webster, the concern which 
at least some of us have about the practical implications as well as 
the legal implications of the position which I think the Administra-
tion is taking. 
Again, I appreciate also the fact that you and the Administration 
in your judgment are prepared to abide by what we all think are 
reasonable rules. The question is, for us, in the future can we 
depend upon that? I do not know there is any way you can guaran-
tee us in the absence of the law being clarified that this would not 
happen again. 
Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I think you stated your position well. I want to commend Mr. 
Hyde for responding to you. 
Basically, you are right. We do appropriate the funds for the 
CIA, and we should expect that they should notify us in all reason-
able situations. But the Director in his definition of what "timely" 
means, in his response to Mr. Richardson, said that "timely" 
meant that he would bring any information about covert activities 
to us as soon as you can reasonably get to Congress. In most in-
stances, he said in response to your question, that that would be 
before the covert activity even took place. 
I think that that is reasonable. But it is also reasonable to under-
stand that there are times when it is not possible to come to Con-
gress before the covert activity takes place. It is not possible to 
come within a provisional 48 hours, or even perhaps 48 days. 
In fact, it has happened three times. One time in the Iran situa-
tion, the contra situation we are dealing with here, and we may 
quarrel that ten months is not timely. Another time, three months 
was timely for President Carter. It happened one other time. 
My point is that by simply arbitrarily passing legislation which 
binds the President's hands, which compels the CIA to live within 
certain defined restrictions eliminates any possibility that unfore-
seeable circumstances might happen and which might ultimately 
endanger the lives of innocent people or threaten the security in-
terests of the United States. 
When the Director says that he would get here as soon as he rea-
sonably can, obviously that means that there may be circumstances 
when he cannot do so right away. I want to state for the record to 
Mr. Richardson that "timely" was defined by Admiral Stansfield

Turner in a committee meeting here just a few months ago. He 
said that, "The timeliness is not measured by a clock. Timeliness 
should be measured by the risk. . . . [W]e were three months get-
ting the six people out of the Canadian Embassy. We were six 
months doing the other two operations. . . . So I don't think we 
should focus on hours and days. I think we should focus on the 
diminution of the risk. It could be that as an operation goes along 
the risk to human life drops off. . . . When that risk to human life 
is diminished sufficiently is when it is timely to notify the Con-
gress. . . ." 
End quotes. I might say former Directors Colby and Ray Cline 
agreed with that fundamental proposition. If there is an endanger-
ment to human life, it seems to me we are just taking an extraordi-
nary move in ignoring that possibility by binding the President and 
binding the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to an arbi-
trary rule which might one day, in your term, Mr. Director, or in 
some other President's or Director's term, force you or them to 
take action which endangers the people or the security interests of 
our country. 
I would be happy to yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. I really do not necessarily quarrel with what 
the gentleman has just said. Adding to this troublesome situation?
and I think Mr. McHugh made the point?is the Justice Depart-
ment's December 1986 memorandum supporting the President's po-
sition in delaying notification for ten months. That new, novel 
theory was that the President may determine what is timely now 
based on the sensitivity of the covert activity. If you follow this 
theory, the President would never have to inform Congress of a 
particularly sensitive activity. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. If I may reclaim my time, I would just respond 
to the gentleman by saying that the President and the Administra-
tion have paid dearly for that decision. That was an interpretation 
which I sincerely doubt any future Administration would apply to 
this work. 
Let us not jump into the fray and pass legislation to cure a prob-
lem that probably will not ever exist again. 
Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, may I make just one more comment, 
please? 
Chairman McHuGH. Briefly, Mr. Hyde. 
I want to be sure we move on in order. 
Mr. HYDE. I think there was more than failure to notify Con-
gress. I don't want to let the Administration off the hook or be re-
corded as totally defending what they did. They did more than fail-
ure to notify. They should have notified some in Congress. There 
ought to be somebody trustworthy up here that they could notify. 
But they misled Congress. There was testimony before our com-
mittees that actually, actively misled us. I have always resented 
that. I think it was far more than a failure to notify. 
I want to go on record as saying that. But also, to fill in the 
mosaic, I want to point out something concerning two of the gang 
of eight, a previous chairman and vice-chairman of the other body's 
committee. The vice chairman has resigned from the committee 
over a release of a transcript to one of the networks which the 
committee voted to keep confidential. He gracefully resigned.

The Chairman of that Committee is still under investigation by 
the Ethics Committee of the other body for having revealed some-
thing about the Pollard spy case. So it is not a simple problem. And 
it involves trust, trust from the Administration, trust in Congress, 
and you cannot legislate that. That is all I am saying. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGh. Thank you, Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I just want to respond for a moment to Mr. Livingston's com-
ment that we ought not try to create the impression a problem 
exists where one does not exist. The United States Congress has 
just spent several million dollars conducting an investigation of 
Iran-contra, the American people have sat in front of their T.V. 
sets and radios for three months listening to what went wrong in 
their government. It seems to me that the Congress has a responsi-
bility pursuant to the expenditure of millions of dollars to try and 
shore up what went wrong in this government and correct that 
problem, not ignore it. 
It seems to me we ought to admit in this context we are not 
tying the hands of the President or the hands of the CIA. Firstly, 
Mr. Webster, I am sure you would agree with me that under cur-
rent law whenever the President signs a finding, you then come up 
before the Intelligence Committees of the House and Senate and 
advise us of the finding. 
We have no power to stop that finding, do we? The President is 
free to do what he pleases? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman, as long as some-
one does not go public with it or do something like that. 
Mr. STOKES. That is right. Now, under this law which we are at-
tempting to enact here, we do not tie the President's hands. We do 
not prohibit him from taking that action. All we say is that 48 
hours after you have taken that action, you must notify the Con-
gress. 
Isn't that correct? 
Judge WEBSTER. That is correct. 
Mr. STOKES. So we are not tying hands. There is an additional 
problem here that I think that the American people would want us 
to take into account. That is that if we do not do something here 
with reference to this third party situation where foreign countries 
can say to our President we will only cooperate with you provided 
that you do not tell your government, we are right back to Iran-
contra again, where the Iranians knew, other foreigners knew 
about this problem, but Members of the United States Congress, 
representing the American people in this forum, had no knowledge. 
Iranians were running all over the White House at midnight 
taking tours and things of that sort while Members of the United 
States Congress sat downstairs in Mr. Poindexter's office and were 
being lied to. 
That is why it is important for us to say simply that the Presi-
dent can take whatever action he deems necessary in defense of 
this country in terms of a foreign policy initiative, but you must 
within 48 hours notify the elected representatives of the Congress

for being with us. We appreciate your testimony. We look forward 
to working with you and your staff on trying to accommodate the 
legitimate interests which have been expressed. 
Judge WEBSTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Our next witness is the Honorable Clark 
Clifford. Mr. Clifford was present at the creation of the National 
Security Act of 1947 while serving as Counsel to President Truman 
and later served as Secretary of Defense during the Johnson Ad-
ministration. 
He was also a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board. I think all of us are very familiar with his long 
record of distinguished public service, and his wise counsel to this 
Nation's leaders is well documented. 
Mr. Clifford, it is an honor to have you with us today. Let me 
express, on behalf of the committee, our appreciation not only for 
your presence, but for your patience, as we went two rounds of 
questions with Judge Webster. Thank you very much for being 
with us. We would be delighted to hear your testimony this morn-
ing. 
STATEMENT OF HON. CLARK M. CLIFFORD, FORMER SECRETARY 
OF DEFENSE 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Judge Webster and I have been friends for a great many years. I 
respect him. I admire him. I honor him for his service to our coun-
try. Through all those years, I would say that he and I have been 
in substantial agreement on matters of public concern. 
This time, I differ with him profoundly. I think the reason must 
be the dramatic difference in our backgrounds in the field of intel-
ligence. 
One of my first assignments when I served as counsel in the 
White House in the Truman Administration was to start the study 
which led to the creation of the CIA. That was 42 years ago. I have 
been in the field in different capacities all through these years. 
This is possibly why he and I differ, and with that brief introduc-
tion, I have a short statement, and because I think it does high-
light the differences between him and me, I would like your per-
mission to read it. 
Chairman McHuGH. By all means, go right ahead.

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 47 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Chairman Stokes, Chairman McHugh, members of 
the committee, I am pleased to appear before you today to offer my 
views on the subject of covert activities, and in particular, the legis-
lation under your consideration for improving the process whereby 
these activities are approved by the President and made known to 
the Congress. 
This is a subject of great significance to our Nation's foreign 
policy and our system of government. It is also, as we have recently 
seen, a subject of serious potential abuse. Therefore, the commit-
tee's efforts are both timely and vital. 
As the committee knows, covert activities have become numerous 
and widespread, practically constituting a routine component of 
our foreign policy; and with these activities have come repeated in-
stances of embarrassing failure?where the goals of the operations 
themselves were not fulfilled, and unforeseen setbacks occurred in-
stead. 
I believe that, on balance, covert activities have harmed this 
country more than they have helped us. Certainly, efforts to con-
trol these activities, to keep them within their intended scope and 
purpose have failed. 
We have reached the point now where we must reassess the very 
idea of conducting covert activities. If we are to continue and gain 
any benefit from them, we must find a way to keep them consist-
ent with the principles and institutions of the Constitution and our 
foreign policy. 
If we determine that this cannot be done, then I say we are 
better off without covert activities entirely than with them out of 
control. 
On this score, we must keep in mind what is meant by covert ac-
tivities. These are only part, a very small part, perhaps 2 or 3 per-
cent, of the intelligence activities of our government. Covert activi-
ties, in my definition, are active efforts to alter political conditions 
in foreign countries through financial, paramilitary, and other 
means. That the government should want to disavow responsibility 
for such activities is understandable. 
Over the last year or so, the cost that covert activities can inflict 
on our system of government also has been clear. Whatever the 
specific actions or individual responsibility, the sale of arms to Iran 
and the diversion of profits from those sales to the contras in Nica-
ragua caused severe damage to our government and the institution 
of the Presidency. The President's credibility suffered drastically 
and with it the integrity of the Nation's foreign policy. 
One of the principal shortcomings of the Iran-contra affair was 
the failure of the President to notify the intelligence committees of 
the government's activities. The oversight process could have 
served a significant, salutary purpose: Giving the President the 
benefit of the wisdom of those who are not beholden to him, but 
beholden like him directly to the people, and prepared to speak 
frankly to him based on their wide, varied experience. 
Had the President taken advantage of notifying Congress, he and 
the country might well have avoided tremendous embarrassment - 
and loss of credibility.

48 
The Iran-contra affair presents this committee and the country 
with a crucial question: Should the laws governing covert activities 
be changed? 
To answer this question, we first might examine the attitude of 
President Reagan. In his letter to the Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee of August 7, 1987, the President said that the current laws are 
adequate and that any changes could occur by Executive Order. I 
strongly disagree. 
In the Iran-contra affair, the President displayed an attitude that 
is antithetical to the oversight process. You will recall that the 
President signed a finding that explicitly instructed the Director of 
the CIA to notify the Congress of the activity. 
For 10 months, the Director and others involved abided by this 
instruction. In fact, the President finally notified the Congress only 
after the activity had become public knowledge. 
Much later, after the Congress had begun its inquiry, the Presi-
dent in his letter to the committee supported the concept of notifi-
cation but insisted on two exceptions. These exceptions would re-
lieve the President of the notification requirement in "cases of ex-
treme emergency" and "exceptional circumstances." I suggest to 
this committee that to permit these two exceptions would make 
any notification requirement meaningless. 
Further evidence of the Administration's attitude is the Justice 
Department's December 1986 memorandum supporting the Presi-
dent's position in delaying notification for 10 months. The memo-
randum offered the novel theory that the President may determine 
what is timely notice based on the sensitivity of the covert activity. 
According to this theory, the President would never have to 
inform Congress of a particularly sensitive activity. This theory 
clearly would undermine the whole concept of the duty of the 
President to keep the Congress informed. 
Moreover, we find that this continues to be the legal theory of 
the Justice Department. In testimony before the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee in December 1987, two months or so ago, a De-
partment representative made the following statement: 
There may be instances where the President must be able to initiate, direct, and 
control extremely sensitive national security activities. We believe this presidential 
authority is protected by the Constitution, and that by purporting to oblige the 
President under any and all circumstances, to notify Congress of a covert action 
within a fixed period of time, S. 1721 infringes on this constitutional prerogative of 
the President. 
In other words, it is the attitude of the Administration that, 
whatever laws exist, the President may interpret them as he choos-
es. This is not the way that I understand our Constitution is sup-
posed to work. So, my answer to the question confronting us today 
is that the laws governing the oversight process must be changed. 
And the changes must be specific, direct, and as clear as possible. 
I wish to lend my full support to H.R. 3822, the legislation that 
the Committee is considering today. 
Late last year, I testified before the Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee and supported S. 1721, the companion bill to H.R. 3822. I under-
stand that the committees have worked together on these bills, and 
I commend your cooperation, as well as its result.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 49 
The legislation that you have crafted meets the need for change 
that exists in the important area of notification to the Congress. 
It would require the President to sign a written finding, setting 
forth the particulars of a covert activity, normally when approving 
it but in no event more than 48 hours afterwards. 
The legislation would require the President to provide the intelli-
gence committees with the signed finding normally before the ac-
tivity begins, but in no event more than 48 hours after it is ap-
proved. 
The President could limit notification to the so-called Group of 
Eight, but he would have to explain why he was doing so. Findings 
that purported to validate past activities or authorize illegal meas-
ures would violate the law. 
I view these provisions as welcome and worthwhile improve-
ments in the oversight process; however, I believe that they do not 
go far enough to redress the recurring perils of covert activities. 
In order to discourage further abuses of our foreign policy and 
consequent subversion of our institutions of Government, I recom-
mend that the legislation also should contain sanctions to penalize 
any failure to notify Congress within the required period. 
Therefore, I would like to propose for the committee's consider-
ation a provision to be added to H.R. 3822 that would automatically 
terminate and prohibit the expenditure of funds for any covert ac-
tivity with respect to which the President had failed to follow the 
oversight process. 
This provision would go beyond the ban on funding of unauthor-
ized activities in the proposed legislation, because it would require 
the President, within the statutory period, to notify the intelligence 
committees, as well as sign a finding. 
Moreover, I would go a step further. According to my proposal, 
any Government officer or employee who knowingly and willfully 
violated or conspired to violate the prohibition against the expendi-
ture of funds for such a covert activity would face criminal penal-
ties. 
This addition to the legislation, in my view and the views of the 
Constitutional scholars whom I have consulted, would be fully con-
sistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Furthermore, 
it would be fully warranted by the principle of the rule of law 
which is our country's creed. 
As I see it, there is no reason or excuse for failing to notify the 
Congress according to the law, and there should be no exception to 
the sanction against violating such law. 
The purpose of this legislation is not to assume good faith, but to 
ensure good Government, and Congress should do whatever is nec-
essary and proper towards that end. 
It is a grave matter to propose criminal penalties for official mis-
conduct. Even so, it is a recourse that has ample precedent, and re-
garding covert activities, it is a measure that I consider to be neces-
sary. 
I can recall testifying some 12 years ago before the Select Com-
mittee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelli-
gence Activities?the Church Committee?regarding the gross 
abuses in covert activities that were the concern of that committee. 
In my testimony in 1975, I said,

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

The lack of proper controls has resulted in a freewheeling course of conduct on 
the part of persons within the intelligence community that has led to spectacular 
- failures and much unfortunate publicity. A new approach is obviously needed, for it 
is unthinkable that we can continue to commit the egregious errors that have 
caused such consternation to our friends and such delight to our enemies. 
The Church Committee helped enact the 1980 Intelligence Over-
sight Act, and this certainly was a step forward. But today we 
know that it was not enough. Sadly, my words from 1975 are all 
too pertinent today. 
I wish to make another point. It bears emphasizing that it was 
by Act of Congress that the CIA was established and exists today; 
it was by Act of Congress that covert activities were authorized and 
continue to occur. 
This is so because our Constitution confers on Congress the 
power to make the laws, and the President is charged with taking 
care-that the laws are faithfully executed according to the intent of 
Congress. 
In my judgment, the Constitution clearly provides to Congress an 
important role in foreign policy, and this role includes the process 
of overseeing covert activities. 
It is part of the system of checks and balances among the sepa-
rate branches of Government. And we should remember that the 
oversight process does not give the Congress a veto, but only a 
voice. 
At no time in recent memory has there been more need than 
now for Congress to speak on the subject of covert activities. In the 
aftermath of the Iran-contra affair and the damage that it did to 
our nation's credibility and influence, it is incumbent on all who 
hold positions of authority to take the necessary steps toward re-
storing our former position. 
The legislation before you is a splendid move in this direction 
and will be of vital importance in reducing the possibility of an-
other similar disaster. 
I thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much, Mr. Clifford, for your 
thoughtful statement.

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION 
February 24, 1988 
STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARK M. CLIFFORD 
Chairman Stokes, Chairman McHugh, and members of the 
Committee: 
I am pleased to appear before you today to offer my views 
on the subject of covert activities, and in particular the 
legislation under your consideration for improving the process 
whereby these activities are approved by the President and 
made known to the Cohgress. This is a subject of great 
significance to our nation's foreign policy and our system of 
government. It is also, as we have recently seen, a subject 
of serious potential abuse. Therefore, the Committee's 
efforts are both timely and vital. 
As the Committee knows, covert activities have become 
numerous and widespread, practically constituting a routine 
component of our foreign policy. And with these activities 
have come repeated instances of embarrassing failure -- where 
the goals of the operations themselves were not fulfilled and 
unforeseen setbacks occurred instead. I believe that on

balance covert activities have harmed this country more than 
they have helped us. Certainly, efforts to control these 
activities, to keep them within their intended scope and 
purpose, have failed. 
We have reachedthe point now where we must reassess the 
very idea of conducting covert activities. If we are to 
continue with them and gain any benefit from them, we must 
find a way to keep them consistent with the principles and 
institutions of the Constitution and our foreign policy. If 
we determine that this cannot be done, then I say we are 
better off without covert activities entirely than with them 
out of control. 
On this score, we must keep in mind what is meant by 
covert activities. These are only part, a very small part --
perhaps 2 or 3 percent -- of the intelligence activities of 
our government. Covert activities, in my definition, are 
active efforts to alter political conditions in foreign 
countries through financial, paramilitary, and other means. 
That the government should want to disavow responsibility for 
such activities is understandable. 
Over the last year or so, the cost that covert activities 
can inflict on our system of government also has been clear. 
Whatever the specific actions or individual responsibility, 
the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of profits from 
those sales to the contras in Nicaragua caused severe damage

to our government and the institution of the Presidency. The 
President's credibility suffered drastically and with it the 
integrity of the nation's foreign policy. 
One of the principal shortcomings of the Iran-contra 
affair was the failure of the President to notify the 
intelligence committees of the government's activities. The 
oversight process could have served a significant, salutary 
purpose: giving the President the benefit of the wisdom of 
those who are not beholden to him, but beholden like him 
directly to the people, and prepared to speak frankly to him 
based on their wide, varied experience. Had the President 
taken advantage of notifying Congress, he and the country 
might well have avoided tremendous embarrassment and loss of 
credibility. 
The Iran-contra affair presents this Committee and the 
country with a ,crucial question: should the laws governing 
covert activities be changed? 
To answer this question, we first might examine the 
attitude of President Reagan. In 1-i(e letter to the Senate 
Intelligence Committee of August 7, 1987, the President said 
that the current laws are adequate and that any changes could 
occur by executive order. I strongly disagree. 
In the Iran-contra affair, the President displayed an 
attitude that is antithetical to the oversight process. You 
will recall that the President signed a finding that explic-
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

-4-. 
itly instructed the Director of the CIA not to notify the 
Congress of the activity. For ten months, the Director and 
others involved abided by this instruction. In fact, the 
President finally notified the Congress only after the 
activity had become public knowledge. Much later, after the 
Congress had begun its inquiry, the President in his letter to 
the Committee supported the concept of notification but 
insisted on two exceptions. These exceptions would relieve 
the President of the notification requirement in "cases of 
extreme emergency" and "exceptional circumstances." I suggest 
to this Committee that to permit these two exceptions would 
make any notification requirement meaningless. 
Further evidence of the Administration's attitude is the 
Justice Department's December 1986 memorandum supporting the 
President's position in delaying notification for ten months. 
The memorandum offered the novel theory that the President may 
determine what is timely notice based on the sensitivity of 
the covert activity. According to this theory, the President 
would never have to inform Congress of a particularly 
sensitive activity. This theory clearly would undermine the 
whole concept of the duty of the President to keep the 
Congress informed. 
Moreover, we find that this continues to be the legal 
theory of the Justice Department. In testimony before the 
Senate Intelligence Committee in December 1987, a Department 
representative made the following statement: 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

- 5 - 
There may be instances where the President must 
be able to initiate, direct, and control 
extremely sensitive national security 
activities. We believe this presidential 
authority is protected by the Constitution, and 
that by purporting to oblige the President 
under any and all circumstances, to notify  
Congress of a covert action within a fixed  
period of time, S. 1721 infringes on this  
constitutional prerogative of the President.  
In other words, it is the attitude of the Administration 
that, whatever laws exist, the President may interpret them as 
he chooses. This is not the way that I understand our Consti-
tution is supposed to work. So, my answer to the question 
confronting us today is that the laws governing the oversight 
process must be changed. And the changes must be 
direct, and as clear as possible. 
I wish to lend my full support to H.R. 3822, 
specific, 
the legis-
lation that the Committee is considering today. Late last 
year, I testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee and 
supported S. 1721, the companion bill to H.R. 3822. I under-
stand that the committees have worked together on these bills, 
and I commend your cooperation, as well as its result. The 
legislation that you have crafted meets the need for change 
that exists 
in the important area of notification to the 
Congress. It would require the President to sign a written 
finding, setting forth the particulars of a covert activity, 
normally when approving it but in no event more than 
forty-eight hours afterwards. The legislation would require 
the President to provide the intelligence committees with the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

bb 
- 6 - 
signed finding normally before the activity begins but in no 
event more than forty-eight hours after it is approved. The 
President could limit notification to the so-called Group of 
Eight, but he would have to explain why he was doing so. Find-
ings that purported to validate past activities or authorize 
illegal measures would violate the law. 
I view these provisions as welcome and worthwhile 
improvements in the oversight process; however, I believe that 
they do not go far enough to redress the recurring perils of 
covert activities. In order to discourage further abuses of 
our foreign policy and consequent subversion of our institu-
tions of government, I recommend that the legislation also 
should contain sanctions to penalize any failure to notify 
Congress within the required period. 
Therefore, I would like to propose for the Committee's 
consideration a provision to be added to H.R. 3822 that would 
automatically terminate and prohibit the expenditure of funds 
for any covert activity with respect to which the President 
had failed to follow the oversight process. This provision 
would go beyond the ban on funding of unauthorized activities 
in the proposed legislation, because it would require the 
President, within the statutory period, to notify the 
intelligence committees, as well as sign a finding. Moreover, 
I would go a step further. According to my proposal, any 
government officer or employee who knowingly and willfully 
violated or conspired to violate the prohibition against the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
67 
- 7 - 
expenditure of funds for such a covert activity would face 
criminal penalties. 
This addition to the legislation, in my view and the 
views of the Constitutional scholars whom I have consulted, 
would be fully consistent with the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution. Furthermore, it would be fully warranted by the 
principle of the rule of law which is our country's creed. 
As I see it, there is no reason or excuse for failing to 
notify the Congress according to the law, and there should be 
no exception to the sanction against violating such law. The 
purpose of this legislation is not to assume good faith but to 
ensure good government, and Congress should do whatever is 
necessary and proper towards that end. 
It is a grave matter to propose criminal penalties for 
official misconduct. Even so, it is a recourse that has ample 
precedent, and regarding covert activities, it is a measure 
that I consider to be necessary. 
I can recall some twelve years ago testifying before the 
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect 
to Intelligence Activities -- the Church Committee --
regarding the gross abuses in covert activities that were the 
concern of that ,committee. In my testimony in 1975, I said: 
The lack of proper controls has resulted in a 
freewheeling course of conduct on the part of 
persons within the intelligence community that 
has led to spectacular failures and much 
unfortunate publicity. A new approach is 
obviously needed, for it is unthinkable that we . 
can continue to commit the egregious errors that 
have caused such consternation to our friends 
and such delight to our enemies.

The Church Committee helped enact the 1980 Intelligence 
Oversight Act, and this certainly was a step forward. But 
today we know that it was not enough. Sadly, my words from 
1975 are all too pertinent today. 
I wish to make another point. It bears emphasizing that 
it was by act of Congress that the CIA was established and 
exists today; it was by act of Congress that covert activities 
were authorized and continue to occur. This is so because our 
Constitution confers on Congress the power to make the laws, 
and the President is charged with taking care that the jaws 
are faithfully executed according to the intent of Congress. 
In my judgment, the Constitution clearly provides to 
Congress an important role in foreign policy, and this role 
includes the process of overseeing covert activities. It is 
part of the system of checks and balances among the separate 
branches of government. And we should remember that the 
oversight process does not give the Congress a veto, but only 
a voice. 
At no time in recent memory has there been more need 
than now for Congress to speak on the subject of covert 
activities. In the aftermath of the Iran-contra affair and 
the damage that it did to our nation's credibility and 
influence, it is incumbent on all who hold positions of 
authority to take the necessary steps towards restoring our 
former position. The legislation before you is a splendid

move in this direction and will be of vital importance in

Chairman McHuGH. As you can appreciate, as a co-sponsor of 
the legislation, I am delighted with the substance of what you have 
said. 
One of the arguments, as you know, against our approach is that 
there is a problem with leaks. 
Mr. Hyde has eloquently talked about that today and on other 
occasions and, of course, we are concerned about leaks. 
I guess I would like to draw upon your long experience both in 
the Executive Branch and as a person very close to Government to 
ask about your experience with leaks. 
Frankly, we have heard arguments on both sides of the question 
as to where the problem is more substantial, in the Executive 
Branch or in the Congressional branch, and I just want to invite 
your comments if you have any on this problem because it is at the 
center, I think, of some of the opposition to the legislation which 
we are offering. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Two major observations. 
Leaks have occurred in our Government back to the Administra-
tion of President Washington. Leaks will always occur in our Gov-
ernment. There is no way that I know of that they can be prevent-
ed 100 percent. 
I have the feeling now that there is a greater sense of responsi-
bility on the part of Congress. I think that reducing the group who 
knows to eight in those particularly sensitive matters is a step in 
the right direction. 
I think that the experience of these last years would show that 
Congress holds most of the important intelligence information care-
fully within itself. 
Leaks occur in the Executive branch of the Government. One 
time we had a very serious leak in the Johnson Administration and 
there was a lot of thundering against Congress, and as we got to 
the bottom of it, we found it was President Johnson who leaked the 
information in a telephone conversation. 
I noted with interest that one time Colonel North was critical of 
Congress for a certain leak and when the matter was traced back, 
it was found it was Colonel North who had leaked the story to a 
reporter for Newsweek Magazine. 
So they occur in both branches of the Government. 
Here is my conclusion. I would rather take the risk of the possi-
bility of leaks than leave it up to one individual in the Executive 
branch of Government to decide which of the covert activities 
would go on without anybody else being notified. That is the big 
danger in our Government. It is contrary, in my opinion, to the 
basic precepts of our system. 
These were developed to have checks and balances, where in the 
Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches each is constantly 
checking the others. 
Here, however, it is suggested that we carve out a new theory. It 
offends me that a President can say I am going to go down this 
road and, according to the Justice Department, because I consider 
it to be an extreme emergency, I don't need to tell anybody about it 
at all. I think that is contrary to our form of Government and I 
would hope we would recognize that fact.

There is a great tendency to confuse the ordinary functions of 
our intelligence department with this very narrow area of covert 
activity. 
I do not want the Congress to interfere in the conduct of intelli-
gence. We have worked on that for 40 years. 
I served 7 years on the Intelligence Board. We were in constant 
contact with Congress and we went all over the world to try to im-
prove our intelligence operation. 
It isn't our intelligence operations that cause the trouble. It isn't 
dealing with foreign countries and the gathering and use of intelli-
gence. It is when we break away from the original concept of the 
functions of intelligence and get into the covert field, mainly when 
we want to change something that is going on in the government of 
another country. 
Look at the mistakes?we went wrong in Indonesia years ago. 
We tried to unseat Sukarno and a CIA pilot went down in a plane 
and blew our cover. 
We tried to conduct an offensive against Castro in the Bay of 
Pigs, one of the great debacles in American history. 
In the sixties and early seventies, we were conducting an effort 
to assassinate Castro and it came out, embarrassing us in our 
standing in the world. 
We got into Chile and wanted to depose Allende and as a result 
of our efforts, he ended up dead, either by suicide or by an assas-
sin's bullet. 
Every one of these instances involved straying from the ordinary 
field of intelligence and getting into the covert field and they were 
all very serious mistakes. 
This is another one. 
Some 12 years ago, I sat in such a situation as this because we 
had a terrible embarrassment over a series of covert actions, and 
the Congress said we are going to take action, and they passed the 
law of 1980. It wasn't good enough. It hasn't done the job. 
I say let's do the job. We can do it without interfering with the 
ordinary functions of the CIA. 
Let's just stop the freewheeling in this very dangerous area of 
trying to go around changing governments in other areas of the 
world. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you. 
Mr. Livingston? 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Mr. Clifford, I appreciate your sincere concern 
for?as expressed in your testimony?for the conduct of our inter-
national relations, and I am just worried though that your concern, 
if applied by law as you propose, would, in fact, do what you say 
you don't want to do. 
You said that you didn't want to interfere with the intelligence 
activities of this Nation, but in fact, if this bill were passed, there 
is a strong likelihood that we would be doing a great deal of inter-
fering with the conduct of our intelligence activities. 
The bill defines special activity so there is a very broad scope of 
activities which would come under the oversight functions of Con-
gress, much broader than exists today. 
It would redefine the process by which we authorize and appro-
priate funds for intelligence activities, very restrictively, which 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
62 
would probably mean that Congress will be micromanaging the ac-
tivities of the CIA. 
There are restrictions in the bill on the transfer of articles and 
funds to other countries, putting in arbitrary aggregates which 
build up?I don't even think there is a limitation in terms of 
years?so that the ceiling would be reached in very short order. 
We may well find that we are incapable of transferring on an 
emergency basis funds or articles of defense to countries that are 
in desperate need of help in an emergency. 
Then the 48-hour notice provision as well, which does say that 
there are no conditions, no circumstances under which the Presi-
dent and the Central Intelligence Agency might reasonably with-
hold information from Congress, even though it might mean the 
loss of lives of individuals. And you would take that one step fur-
ther?you would say that you would add a provision to this bill 
that would automatically terminate and prohibit the expenditure 
of funds for any covert activity with respect to which the President 
had failed to follow the oversight process. 
As I have pointed out, this bill provides a very rigid oversight 
process. 
Are you going to tell us that you believe that if the President, for 
example, delayed until 49 hours instead of the 48, even though he 
might be acting in good faith, the notification of Congress of a very 
necessary and vital intelligence covert activity, that you would just 
cut off all funds and terminate the program no matter what the 
consequences to the United States and its citizens might be? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. The early part of your statement is one with 
which I disagree. You pick out parts of the bill. I don't believe that 
the bill interferes with the normal operation of the CIA or with our 
intelligence community. 
I think there are needed restrictions, I think they are there, and 
I think they are reasonable. One hour over? I guess you could take 
any rule and draw an analogy from it. If you are going to have a 
rule, then I would abide by the rule. And I would enforce the rule. 
If I have to file my appeal with the Supreme Court of the United 
States within 30 days, I must file it in 30 days. If I file it on the 
31st day, it is no good. 
So if you set a law, I think the law should be obeyed. 
And keep in mind that all we are talking about is that when the 
President gets it in mind, he says, "It has been suggested to me 
that here would be a very interesting covert activity where we 
might be able to dislodge this Administration in a foreign country." 
And he says, "I think it is one we ought to do." 
All we are suggesting is that he meet with a committee of the 
Congress and tell them that. I think he might get some valuable 
expressions from them, and he does it within 48 hours. 
If they say, "We don't think you ought to do that," he says, 
"Thank you, gentlemen," and he goes ahead and does it, which he 
can do under the law, but it gives him the benefit of advice from 
men who have served many years, much longer than he. 
I would like him to get the benefit of that wisdom before he 
starts off on a course of action that may result in a disaster.

Mr. LIVINGSTON. I agree that the President can get a great deal 
of knowledge and consultation from the Congress and should do so 
at every available opportunity. 
I am concerned that we are rigidly imposing a set of rules that 
will bind his hands no matter what the circumstance might be, 
which ultimately require that he defer any action or defer any no-
tification of Congress, and if we rigidly bind him to those rules?we 
are not talking about a case in court. We are not talking about the 
consequences of losing your appeal. 
We are talking about the possibility that people will lose their 
lives and that the security of the United States might be unduly 
jeopardized because we have confined the President to a rigid set of 
rules. 
In my opinion, the rules are too rigid. There is no flexibility, and 
I think that is a dangerous step for the Congress to take. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Mr. Livingston, our system is filled with rules. The 
President must veto a bill in ten days. If he waits until the 11th 
day, it is untimely. 
We have any number of rules of that kind. I don't see why this 
should be subject to any different interpretation than any other 
rule in this very limited field. 
I think it comes down to this?a person's attitude toward our 
present intelligence operation in this field depends to a great 
extent upon his attitude toward covert actions. 
If he thinks that covert actions should be an ordinary, common 
function of our intelligence community, then he would feel con-
cerned at any kind of limitation. 
I don't feel that way at all. I think they should be launched after 
only the most careful consideration, because they turn up in the 
most embarrassing manner.. 
I was abroad?I don't know when it was?when it was discovered 
that we had been mining the waters off of Nicaragua, and I was 
with a group who couldn't understand it. 
The United States had been mining the waters and some of our 
allied ships encountered the mines. One friend said something that 
has haunted me ever since. He said, "I have the feeling that Amer-
ica has lost its way." 
I had that feeling in Iran-contra; we have lost our way. We took 
a public position, thundering in attitude, the rhetoric was harsh 
about not dealing with terrorist nations, while under the table we 
were sending anti-tank weapons, sending weapons to knock down 
planes from the sky. 
The world saw what has happened; it looks as if America has lost 
its way. I want to prevent that. 
The damage we sustain from one tragic covert action, in my 
opinion, is much more damaging than five or six or ten covert ac-
tions. 
We have not had many successful covert actions. 
One reason is that, if we are successful, you don't ordinarily hear 
about it. But we heard about them a lot through the years on the 
Intelligence Board and we found them, I will wager every man of 
the ten-man committee, working seven years in that area, I believe 
every man left with the feeling, "If I had my choice, I probably 
would say cut out covert activity; it is not worth the danger."

That is really what we are discussing?not the whole field of in-
telligence. 
We expanded intelligence. We had 208 suggestions over a four-
year period that we made to the intelligence operators, and some 
204 of them were adopted and put into operation. 
We have got a good intelligence operation, very effective. A lot of 
countries look to us. 
If a country says to us, "Here is some information, Judge Web-
ster. I am giving it to you, but I don't want you to share it with the 
Congress," if I were in Judge Webster's position, I would say, 
"Don't tell me. If I can't share it with the Government, with the 
Congress, don't tell me." 
That should be our position. We either have a system of democ-
racy and function in that manner or I don't think we deserve to 
have the feeling that we all have toward our country. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Stokes? 
MT. STOKES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Clifford, you have had a long and distinguished career in 
Government and it is a real honor to have you appear here this 
morning and testify on this legislation. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. STOKES. The last answer that you just made to us touches on 
a question I was going to ask and maybe you could expand upon it 
a little bit?the argument appears plausible on its face, whereas 
Mr. Webster says a foreign government or a third-party govern-
ment says, "The only way we will cooperate with you is that you 
do not tell other persons," and, therefore, our President feels that 
in order to carry out this effort, he must make that type of a- com-
mitment to this foreign country and then, of course, our Govern-
ment should understand why he cannot comply by telling the Con-
gress is because he had to make this commitment to a third coun-
try. 
Would you elaborate on that a little bit for us? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Yes. We get right to the heart of our system. We 
either have a system of checks and balances or we don't have such 
a system. 
If a foreign government should say to you, "Mr. Chairman, while 
you are traveling abroad, I want to give you some very vital infor-
mation regarding your country and mine, but I am only going to 
give it to you if you promise not to tell your President," that isn't 
the way our system works. 
You don't say, "All right, tell me; I won't." We have to work to-
gether. 
We can't isolate the President or the Executive Branch so that it 
can have this information having made a commitment not to 
inform the Congress. 
We don't want to get in that posture. 
To see what exists here in this effort to try to get some rules, 
let's go back over the situation that existed in the Colonel North 
days. 
Two-and-a-half years this went on, operating under the table, ex-
panding all through the world?Bill Casey had an idea that this 
was working so successfully that he would make it a permanent op-
eration financed privately. They were getting money in from differ-

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 35 
ent private sources and thought it would be of immense usefulness 
to continue. 
The trouble is that it isn't our system. It isn't the way we run 
our Government. It is the way the Soviets run theirs. It is the way 
it may operate in Libya, but not in the United States. So I am sug-
gesting let's have some rules and if Colonel North, or some other 
colonel in the future, decides that he is going down the road of 
some secret covert operation, as soon as there is no notice to the 
Congress, he is in violation of law and he shouldn't be using any 
funds so appropriated. 
And if he is in violation of law and he does it in the knowledge 
that there was no notice to the Congress, then he is doing it know-
ingly and willfully?that is the language of many of our felony 
statutes?and he has committed an offense. 
Now, I don't know that it would absolutely prevent it, but I 
assure you it would slow it up. 
I can picture one meeting when Colonel North had his colleagues 
there and he said, "Here is a new idea. I think we ought to start 
down this road." 
Somebody said, "There are a number of laws like the National 
Security Act of 1947, the Hughes-Ryan Act, and it is in violation of 
those laws, Colonel," and he said, "What is the penalty under those 
laws of my violating them?" and the lawyer said, "There aren't 
any penalties," and the colonel said, "Well, then, don't interrupt 
me." 
I think this is the attitude. Let's take a position. Let's see if we 
can't get the people to conform to our system and not operate se-
cretly in this secret kind of Government. 
Mr. STOKES. I was particularly struck by your statement that this 
legislation has nothing to do with good faith. It is about good gov-
ernment. Within that phrase you really struck at the heart of what 
we are trying to do here. 
But another seemingly plausible argument is the one advanced 
by Mr. Webster this morning when he says "I have initiated cer-
tain changes to correct the problem of persons who lie to the Con-
gress, and I have dealt properly with those individuals and we are 
running a type of thing now where this won't occur in the future." 
And he says, "In addition, the President has signed an NSDD in 
which he says he is going to comply with the law.' 
Can you address that argument. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I think there are two important answers to that. 
We have been down that road, Mr. Chairman. 
That is what the 1980 law was for. There was a lengthy hearing. 
Congress said, "Now we have the answer. The President or the Ex-
ecutive Branch must report to the Congress, give us reasonable 
notice"?I think that was the language?"and now we have the 
matter buttoned down so we won't have these embarrassing events 
occur anymore." 
It just didn't work at all. We have tried all this. We have tried 
what Judge Webster told us about this morning, leaving it up to 
the Executive Branch. 
There is another part of that, that if everybody in the Executive 
Branch were a Judge Webster, we could sit back and relax, but

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 J6 
they sure aren't and they haven't been over this 'past number of 
years. 
Also keep in mind that Judge Webster could handle the CIA as 
expertly and as judiciously as it could be handled and things might 
still be going on in our country that would ultimately embarrass us 
deeply. 
When these last events were going on and Admiral Crowe was 
asked his reaction, he said "I didn't know anything about it." 
In the financial arrangement, nobody ever told the Secretary of 
the Treasury about it. They confined their information and activi-
ties to those they wanted to. This was a call within our Govern-
ment. It isn't enough to say that they have dismissed some people 
from the CIA, and the President says that now, he is going to coop-
erate better. That doesn't do it. Then for the President to write the 
letter and say, "Yes, I will cooperate and I will comply with the 48-
hour notice with two exceptions; one, extreme emergencies and the 
other exceptional circumstances." Well, almost every opportunity 
in the covert field is one of them. 
They are not routine. You may go months and months handling 
the intelligence work ably and professionally and not have a single 
covert activity come into view. 
So each time that escape clause could be used, and it is trouble-
some. 
So let's have a clear set of rules. Let me conclude by saying how 
many more times do we have to go through this? We have been 
through it ever since we had the law, since 1947. 
We have used occasional parts of it and done it effectively, but 
we have had one embarrassment after another. 
Now we have the most serious embarrassment of them all?the 
Iran-contra affair. 
How much longer do we have to wait? So let's step up to it now. 
It isn't just the next ten months of President Reagan. It is the 
next four, five, six Presidents that come along. 
Let's set a clear path so we don't go down this mistaken road 
again. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
We have revisited the Iran-contra hearings at great length and I 
wish we had a lot of time to go over that. 
I would like to fill in a bit of background from another perspec-
tive. 
Mr. Casey is not here to defend himself; he died, and the witness 
has characterized him as supporting his own agency, and not sub-
ject to oversight. It was stated by one of the witnesses that he had 
talked to Casey about that, but Mr. McMahon said that would be 
the furthest thing from Mr. Casey's mind. 
So it is unfortunate that we don't have Mr. Casey to defend him-
self. 
You have hypothecated North talking to people and saying, 
"Let's disobey the law." 
I sat through all the hearings; I don't recall any such occurrence, 
but it is helpful, I suppose, to the argument. And, when it comes to 
diverting money to the contras, $3.5 million, which may or may not 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 67 
have been the Treasury's money, I view that in the light of divert-
ing $8 million of the taxpayers' funds in the continuing resolution 
for a school in Paris, for "refugees" from North Africa, which the 
Senator who pushed that had the good grace to ask that it be re-
voked. 
So there are diversions and there are diversions. 
Let me ask you, I take it when you were in the Truman Adminis-
tration, you opposed the covert activity that helped save Italy in 
the post-war years from being taken over by the communists who 
were pouring millions of dollars in there? Your distaste for covert 
activity, I take it, was expressed in the Truman Administration? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. No. I heartily supported it. 
Mr. HYDE. That is one covert activity you supported? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I sure did. And it was very successful. 
Mr. HYDE. Then you support the successful ones, but not the un-
successful ones? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. No. That is not the point. Here was a carefully 
structured plan to meet the communist menace in Italy. They were 
making an all-out plan to get a communist government in Italy. 
Careful, lengthy study indicated to us that the proper, intelligent 
use of funds in Italy might prevent that from occurring. 
So we did it. We did it successfully. I would do it today. That is a 
very useful covert activity. 
Mr. HYDE. That is my point. You are not against all covert activi-
ty? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Oh, my, no. 
Mr. HYDE. I misunderstood you. I thought you said if you had 
your way, you would do away with all covert activity. 
You understand the Bay of Pigs, what really happened there, 
don't you? You certainly do not blame it because it was a "covert 
activity"? 
You blame it, I am sure, as most people do, by the change of 
mind in the Administration, the decision to deny air cover to those 
people we had trained, we had supplied, and we had said go hit the 
beach at the Bay of Pigs, worst possible place. At the last minute, 
the President changed his mind and withheld air cover. Some 
people, like Oliver North analogize that case of leading people into 
fighting and then not supporting them to the contras case of lead-
ing people into fighting and not supporting them. They view that 
as a betrayal. 
You mentioned the Bay of Pigs as a debacle. It was. Oh, was it 
ever. 
But I think why it was a debacle is important to know. 
Now, I would never fence with you on the law, because you are a 
distinguished lawyer with one of the great reputations of all time, 
and deservedly so let me say. I simply am puzzled by your state-
ment that you disagree with the Justice Department when it says 
that to notify Congress of a covert action within a fixed period of 
time infringes on this constitutional prerogative of the President. 
You say, "In other words, the attitude of the Administration that, 
whatever laws exist, the President may interpret them as he choos-
es. This is not the way I understand our Constitution is supposed to 
work."

Well, I would say that is too flat a statement from my imperfect 
position as a lawyer. The President signs the law as Congress 
passes it. It seems to me the signer of the document has something 
to say about what it means to him, what his interpretation is, as 
much as those who debate and put the language together and pass 
it. 
It seems to me that with regard to the Executive function of de-
termining that a covert action will occur and the performance of 
that as to time, telling the President, okay, but you have got 48 
hours to tell us about it, I wouldn't say that is constitutionally 
flawless, would you? 
Don't you see a constitutional question there? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I do not. 
Mr. HYDE. You do not? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I do not. I think that the Congress has a reasona-
ble right when it passes a law to have the President keep it in-
formed of the manner in which the law is being carried out. 
Mr. HYDE. I would agree with that, but covert activity, you say, 
depends on some statutory enactment. Isn't our history replete 
with covert activities back to the presidency of Jefferson that did 
not have statutory warrant? 
The Barbary pirates? Things were done in Florida. Even the Lou-
isiana Purchase was covert. Congress never knew about it. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. You go to the Barbary pirates; that was military 
action. 
Mr. HYDE. Yes, but Congress did not know what the President 
did. He did it. He achieved his purpose. 
I am just suggesting that covert activities may well be a part of 
the inherent Executive power of the President which is given by 
the Constitution to the President generically, and that for Congress 
to fine-tune and say, you will perform an Executive function within 
the time we say you will, I just see a constitutional question. 
I don't know whether it is right or wrong, but I don't think it is 
as clear, Mr. Clifford, as you say. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Well, then I have not been very persuasive. 
Mr. HYDE. Oh, with those who agree with you, I am sure you are 
totally persuasive. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. It is clear to me; I do not believe there is any in-
herent power in the President to go off and make these very impor-
tant decisions affecting the security of our country and to do it all 
alone. I don't think the Constitution gives him any such power as 
that. I do not think the President has the sole right of conducting 
foreign policy in the United States. 
I don't find that in the Federalist Papers at all. 
Mr. HYDE. You find it in the Curtiss-Wright decision, but of 
course that is the invitation to struggle that has gone on for many, 
many years. What are the parameters? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. There are two points about the Curtiss-Wright 
case. One, it has been almost completely overruled. It was 50 years 
ago. 
It has been almost completely overruled by the Youngstown 
Sheet and Tube case. 
Second, a comment in there regarding the power of the President 
is plainly obiter dictum.

Mr. HYDE. I will send you my paper on that, Mr. Clifford. You 
don't have to read it, but I will send it to you. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I look forward to it. 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGn. Mr. Richardson. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. I would hate to get into an argument with you 
because of your breadth of knowledge and experience. Let me say I 
have been persuaded by a good part of your testimony, except for 
one provision that you are recommending, and that is the provision 
that deals with criminal penalties. 
The concern I have is I think there is no question when you talk 
about being on the edge of legality and illegality if there is some-
thing out there that the. official might make sure he acts on proper 
legal grounds. 
However, can this provision be interpreted by those that are con-
cerned about having an effective intelligence gathering agency and 
a covert action that is prescribed within law and the national inter-
ests? 
Are we not, perhaps, clipping the agency a bit? Won't this provi-
sion have a deleterious effect in that maybe that official that sees 
all these restrictions on him?again, not on the legality question, 
but sees these numerous constraints?let me be the devil's advo-
cate and say, what about that argument? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. I think it is not an appropriate argument. Ninety-
eight percent of our intelligence activities are devoted to what they 
should be: The gathering and evaluation of intelligence. We do it 
very well. That is not our danger. 
We do not have embarrassments that come from the ordinary 
conduct of our intelligence. We are doing that 24 hours a day. 
It is the toughest, meanest activity that goes on. We do it be-
cause we have to. 
We probably would not survive without it. I strongly support it 
in every way. 
All we are talking about is that very narrow two percent again. 
That is what has gotten us into the trouble. 
This last Iran-contra affair did not have to do with ordinary in-
telligence. Again, it was that very narrow two percent. 
On that two percent, I would like to surround that with such re-
strictions that it makes it much less likely that we are to have an-
other tragedy in that area. That is why I think it is appropriate to 
do it. 
I do not think it interferes with the other 98 percent in any way. 
I think it just justifies and sends the warning out that you cannot 
free-wheel in this area. Two-and-a-half years this group was doing 
it. It expanded all over. They owned ships, they sent arms, they did 
all kinds of things. It was going on all the time, using?much of 
it?government funds. I would like to say that, if you do not give 
notification to the Congress, then you cannot use government 
funds. 
I find that reasonable. That is one of the fundamental functions 
of Congress, to appropriate. The only branch of the government 
that can. 
So you say, "we appropriate the funds, but if you don't comply 
with this reasonable restriction, then you may not use ' those 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
70 
funds." I think you have the right to say that. Then, if anybody 
knowingly and willfully despite that knowledge goes ahead and 
uses funds, then I think he should be subject to criminal penalties. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. I do not quarrel with the notification of Con-
gress provision and on the propriety in enacting some kind of stat-
ute. I just think there may be within that narrow two percent some 
contingency where the appearance of this kind of provision might 
be in the long run deleterious. 
I will not press that. 
I have a second question which may have been touched in your 
testimony. Regrettably I was not here. That is on the CIA's fund, 
the reserve for contingencies. By the time these funds end up in 
the regular budget process?we are talking about the congressional 
power of the purse role?it is very difficult to cut these funds off. 
Are you also advocating some restraints on the use of the reserve 
to initiate covert actions, such as perhaps setting a maximum 
amount that can be used for a particular action, for prohibiting the 
use of the reserve for certain kinds of activities? Are you going 
that far in advocating congressional control? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. No. The distance that I do go is that when a Presi-
dent decides that he is going to launch a new covert activity, 99 
percent of the time, it will take some funds to be carried out. The 
President decides the source of those funds. I say, if he comes up 
and gives you the notification, all right, perhaps he uses those 
funds at his discretion. If he does not give you the 48-hour notifica-
tion, which I consider to be reasonable, then whatever funds he in-
tended to use he must not use because he has failed to comply with 
the law. 
Mr. RICHARDSON. That makes it clear. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Richardson. 
Mr. Kastenmeier. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I, too, was sorry I was not here when Mr. Clifford delivered his 
testimony. I did hear his testimony before the Senate Intelligence 
Committee some months ago and thought it was extraordinarily ef-
fective and useful not only for its recommendations but for the his-
toric perspective that Mr. Clifford gave to the question and for his 
analysis. I happened to be persuaded. 
I also happened to be persuaded by the necessity of including 
criminal penalties. I think it is extremely difficult for any country, 
particularly a free society, to cope with its perhaps necessary na-
tional security trappings, because very often they are driven by 
idealogical concerns and excesses, and there is very little normally 
to restrain such activity. 
As Mr. Clifford suggests, it is likely to recur again. It has in the 
past. When we think we have restrained some of the excesses, we 
see in another year that they have returned to us. 
I wonder whether, Mr. Clifford, you are sanguine about being 
able to deal with that issue of the embarrassments and excesses in 
the name of national security that might be committed in the long-
term? Or are we doomed to have to re-learn these lessons over and 
over again?

Mr. CLIFFORD. I think in every nation's history, at some point, 
the country must face reality. I think that time has come for our 
country. We have been through this. We have had setback after 
setback. As I mentioned earlier, we made a determined effort in 
1980 to come to grips with this. The Administration at that time 
said, oh, you do not need to go nearly so far as you are considering; 
rely upon us, depend upon us, we will cooperate with you. 
And I think somebody mentioned at the time that it was a Demo-
cratic President and a Democratic Congress. 
So we have been down this road of expecting that good fellows 
will work together and we will get results. It has not paid off at all. 
We are right back where we were. 
I say how long do we have to go through this? Let us face up to it 
now. I think that this committee has an opportunity of rendering a 
significant service to the country by saying we have been through 
this enough. 
Now, let us take a new approach to it, let us confine this area 
very carefully. 
I want a President to think much more carefully about starting 
off on a covert course of action than they have been doing in the 
past. It has been pretty easy. You do not tell anybody about it. You 
say, "well, it is up to me as to whether I sign a finding. I may do it 
ten months later or I may give notification ten months later." 
It is so loose and all. He may say, "this is such an opportunity to 
make such a great gain," and he may be doing it with the best of 
intentions. They go just as sour as those that perhaps don't have 
such good intentions. 
We have learned enough now, I believe, from the record that we 
can say let us have a new set of rules and see if that does not limit 
us from going through these national tragedies. 
MT. KASTENMEIER. I thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you. 
Mr. Glickman. 
Mr. GLICKMAN. Thank you very much. 
First of all, I think I need to respond to one thing Mr. Hyde said. 
Quite frankly, I thought it was not subject to the substance of what 
we were talking about. Somehow the comparison was made that 
some funds that Congress has spent improperly itself was equiva-
lent to improper expenditures on covert activities by the Executive 
Branch of Government. 
It is true. We sometimes are wasteful. The example was given, 
the $8 million to a French school which we have subsequently re-
pealed. That in no way, in no way parallels the use of funds for 
covert activities that have not been approved and may be done in 
connection with violations of law because as bad as the $8 million 
to French schools was, it did not involve war and peace, did not in-
volve the possible lives of Americans in action, did not involve 
American prestige in the world. 
I do not want the public of this country to think that maybe one 
example of wasteful spending is equivalent to another example 
which goes far beyond wasteful spending and goes to the heart of 
our checks and balances.

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 2 
It looks to me like the heart of all this is the question of mis-
trust. That is why you have laws in the first place, to prevent 
people from doing things they ought not to be doing. 
I wanted to try to go again to Mr. Richardson's question. I agree 
with you about criminal penalties. I wanted to ask a question. Your 
penalties for anybody who would willfully and knowingly violate 
the section, would that apply to the President of the United States, 
as well? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. It would. 
Mr. GLICKMAN. I happen to believe, like yourself, that that is the 
best inhibitor of?best preventer of illegal conduct. It may not be 
utilized very often, but the cloud of criminal activity is what we 
use. in voluntary compliance with our tax laws and just about ev-
erything else in this country. 
I do disagree with you a little bit on the issue. You say if there is 
an illegal activity we would automatically terminate and prohibit 
the expenditure of funds for those covert activities. You might be 
involved in the middle of something that would be far more dan-
gerous for the United States to stop because of the peculiarities of 
international politics. 
I am just wondering, would not the criminal activities really take - 
care of this problem, rather than stopping a covert action right in 
the middle of it, when perhaps that could involve a loss of lives to 
some of our friends? 
Mr. CLIFFORD. In the event that there has been a covert activity 
that has been going on for some period of time, and if the Presi-
dent chose not to comply with the law and he had not given the 48-
hour notice and it might have been going on for some three months 
thereon, and then possibly there is a leak someplace and it comes 
to your attention, I think the law should be applicable. 
I don't believe you can create exceptions. If he chooses not to 
comply with this reasonable requirement and report to you, then 
he operates at his peril, in my opinion. 
Mr. GLICKMAN. The problem is it is not just his peril at that 
point; it is the country's peril. We may have other objectives that 
would be far more seriously damaged from a standpoint of loss of 
American lives and folks out in the field not withstanding the mis-
take he has made. 
What I am trying to say to you is that I would like to punish him 
and his people for doing improper activities by failure to notify us, 
and therefore I support the criminal penalties. 
Maybe we ought to terminate the employees as well as some 
form of criminal penalties, but we may be punishing innocent folks 
by just automatically terminating that activity after a period of 
time. I think we have to be very careful about going down that 
road. 
Otherwise I find your testimony to be extraordinarily credible. I 
have learned a lot today. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Glickman. 
Are there any other questions?

Mr. HYDE. Just for my friend's edification or disedification, the 
similarity between the $8 million and the alleged diversion of 
funds to the contras is simply that they were both done in the dead 
of night without people knowing about it. 
Secondly, I am not sure the $3 million that went to the contras 
were taxpayers' funds. They were from the proceeds of the sale of 
the arms to the Iranians, the price jacked up by General Secord. 
Secord paid for the arms, every penny the CIA wanted. 
It was just that things happened, and nobody knew about them. 
One was $8 million, one was $3 million. I don't find them too dis-
similar. 
One last question to my friend?a person I admire. I wish he 
were my friend. 
I wish we knew each other better. That is what I meant. Insofar 
as we know each other, I certainly consider you to be my friend.

Mr. GLICKMAN. Who says he won? 
Chairman McHuGH. Well----
Mr. HYDE. You weren't listening. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Clifford, we are very much indebted to 
you for your presence here today and for your testimony. We hope 
that we will have the opportunity to hear from you again on other 
matters, as well. 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. CLIFFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Our next witness is a former colleague and 
friend, the Honorable John Buchanan, Jr. He represented the 6th 
District of Alabama for many years, serving on the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
John is a senior associate at the Kettering Foundation and 
Chairman of its International Affairs Committee. Since 1981 he has 
served as Chairman of People for the American Way. 
Mr. Buchanan is accompanied this afternoon by the Legislative 
Counsel of People for the American Way, Mr. Steven Katz. 
John, it is a pleasure to have you with us. We appreciate your 
staying with us during the prior testimony, as well. Please proceed.

STATEMENT OF JOHN H. BUCHANAN, JR., CHAIRMAN, PEOPLE 
FOR THE AMERICAN WAY ACTION FUND, ACCOMPANIED BY 
STEVEN KATZ, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL, PEOPLE FOR THE 
AMERICAN WAY 
Mr. BUCHANAN. It is a privilege to testify before you and the dis-
tinguished members of your committee on behalf of the 270,000 
members of the People for the American Way, the nonpartisan 
constitutional liberties organization which it is my privilege to 
chair. 
The importance of secrecy to the security of our nation is undeni-
able. But even national security is not very well served by exces-
sive government secrecy. 
In December 1987, People for the American Way released its 
report, "Government Secrecy: Decisions Without Democracy." We 
sent each member of this committee a report. It costs $8.75. Keep 
it, read it. I hope you will. Steve Katz was its author. We hope it 
will make a contribution not only to this discussion but to the over-
all problem we addressed in that report. 
It culminates almost two years of investigative research into the 
growth of official secrecy in the United States and its consequences 
for our government and citizens. It documents the ongoing tension 
between secrecy and democracy, the existence of a secrecy system 
at work well before the Iran-contra affair, and the potential for ex-
cessive secrecy by future administrations?Democrat or Republi-
can. 
The bill you consider today, the "Intelligence Oversight Act," is 
an essential piece of legislation, a reform mandated not only by the 
Iran-contra affair, but also by the rightful role of congressional 
oversight in our constitutional government. 
Mr. Chairman, it seems to me you are acting to make sure the 
prerogatives of the Congress are honored and its responsibilities 
fulfilled under the Constitution in our system of checks and bal-
ances. 
We believe that Americans strongly support congressional over-
sight and access to information. In a November 1987 nationwide 
poll commissioned by People for the American Way, the Roper or-
ganization asked Americans about government secrecy. Overall the 
response to the poll was a call for greater "openness in govern-
ment"; 93 percent of those surveyed specifically supported "open-
ness in government" because Congress needs the information to 
perform its oversight role. 
The question before us today, of course, is not simply congres-
sional access to information in general. It is information about in-
telligence activity, particularly notification of covert activity per-
formed by the Central Intelligence Agency and other government 
entities. 
Congressional oversight of the intelligence community, particu-
larly "special" or covert activities, is central to the legitimate for-
eign policy and national security role of Congress. This goes beyond 
the fundamental oversight role of Congress in the authorization, 
funding and execution of government programs and policies. 
American foreign policy and our system of government cannot 
succeed unless the President and the Congress cooperate. The Con-

75 
stitution gives both the Congress and the Executive specific foreign 
policy powers. It does not make foreign policy the exclusive domain 
of one branch of government. 
The result is a system of checks and balances which ensures that 
our nation's foreign policy and national security framework is con-
sistent with the policy, law and interests of our nation. To do other-
wise, as we have seen in the Iran-contra affair, is to subvert our 
constitutional system, contravene established foreign policy and 
ignore the rule of law. 
Indeed, the former Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral 
Stansfield Turner, states in his book, "Secrecy and Democracy": 
In gauging whether congressional oversight has done more good than harm, we 
have to look at the benefits it affords . . . Most of all, the requirement to report to 
Congress is valuable because it forces the DCI and his subordinates to exercise 
greater judiciousness in making decisions about which espionage operations are 
worth the risks. We have seen some of the unfortunate past excesses that can be 
attributed to the absence of adequate accountability . . . Finally, contact with the 
congressional committees is salutary for the CIA's people because it helps them 
keep in touch with national views . . . For all these reasons, congressional oversight 
is a definite plus. 
The proposed Intelligence Oversight Act, like its Senate counter-
part passed in committee last week, provides the necessary reforms 
to guarantee that the legitimate role of Congress and our checks 
and balances system are functioning effectively. 
Democracy demands the vigilance of its citizens and elected offi-
cials. The passage of the legislation before us today is necessary for 
such vigilance to be meaningful. 
Congress must be kept fully and currently informed of the intel-
ligence activities of the United States, whether it is the CIA, the 
National Security Council or other entities. Notification of "spe-
cial" or covert activities is particularly important. 
We support the proposed requirement that the intelligence com-
mittees are informed of a finding "as soon as possible after such 
approval and prior to the initiation of the special activity author-
ized by the finding," and in exceptional circumstances, we support 
the proposed 48-hour time limit for notification pursuant to initi-
ation of a covert operation. 
Congressional oversight and notification as outlined in this bill is 
essential for our support of legislation on covert activities. 
It is also important to recognize, however, that the proposed leg-
islation not only makes the president more accountable, but ap-
pears to expand the president's power to authorize covert activity. 
Under current law and executive order, authority to engage in 
covert activity is limited to the CIA unless the president makes a 
determination that another agency can do the job better. We have 
reservations about your using language that would encourage the 
president to reach out beyond the CIA in this kind of activity. 
We have some reservations about what could be interpreted as 
an apparent expansion of authority, particularly as our nation 
emerges from a scandal where agencies outside the CIA acted with 
indifference to the law. 
Covert operations should be limited. By their very nature and as 
a matter of policy, covert operations are not accountable to many 
in government. They lack the broad congressional and public sup-
port necessary to serve and protect the nation's vital interests.

Mr. Chairman, at this juncture in our nation's history, it is un-
clear why Congress would so readily dispatch the performance of 
covert activities to more, not fewer, agencies of our government. 
? Mr. Chairman, our organization supports the proposed legislation 
in large measure because it aims to ensure that our government 
operates under established policy and law on intelligence activity, 
even though particular covert operations and plans remain vital se-
crets. 
We believe, however, that the legislation will fall short of its goal 
of an established policy and law on intelligence activity unless the 
committee recognizes the impediments posed by the promulgation 
of secret presidential directives. 
These directives are issued through the National Security Coun-
cil and have established covert action policies binding on the gov-
ernment today. Such directives have made it possible for govern-
ment officials to operate outside the scope of public laws and execu-
tive orders on covert action, and are indifferent to statutory action 
for congressional oversight. 
The use of such directives, evolving through administrations 
since President Truman, has increased in sophistication and au-
thority. They started out almost as position papers. They are far 
stronger than that today. 
In 1976 a special Senate committee studying presidential power 
concluded that these directives: 
Represent a new method for promulgating decisions, in areas of gravest impor-
tance. Such decisions are not specifically required by law to be published in any reg-
ister, even in a classified form; none have prescribed formats or procedures; none of 
these vital Executive decisions are revealed to Congress or the public except under 
irregular, arbitrary or accidental circumstances. 
That description holds true today. Under President Reagan, the 
series is called the National Security Decision Directives, or 
NSDDs. Awareness of the series in Congress is very limited. As 
Representative Anthony Beilenson, Chairman of ,the Intelligence 
Oversight and Evaluation Subcommittee, stated before a House 
Government Operations subcommittee last year: 
What I have to say about NSDDs, as they are called, will be brief. It is based on 
an incomplete understanding of this form of presidential decision. That is because 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not receive copies of NSDDs. 
I share with the former Secretary Clifford great admiration?and 
the members of this committee?great admiration for Judge Web-
ster. I think we are all reassured to have a person of his caliber in 
the position of being Director of Intelligence for our country. 
Like Secretary Clifford, I disagree with his position on this 
matter. I was particularly intrigued that he cited an NSDD as the 
cure to the problem which confronted us in the Iran-contra affair. 
Actually I would say it is part of the disease, not part of the 
cure. It is part of the problem, not the answer. 
The President could sign?and in this case notify?the Congress 
of the content of that NSDD today. You could decide it sufficed, 
and tomorrow it could change and you would not necessarily know 
it. 
But if this President stood by his present policy and did not in 
secret?as happened before?change, modify the NSDD or create

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 77 
new ones that would contradict that policy as expressed in Judge 
Webster's testimony, the next president could certainly do so. 
I would advise the committee to hear the wise words of Thomas 
Jefferson and "bind men with the chains of law." 
As of January 1, 1988, President Reagan has issued at least 286 
NSDDs. Some are innocent, but many are not. On three occasions 
Congress has overturned or nullified specific NSDDs through legis-
lation. NSDDs have been found to secretly create national policy, 
to permit fugitive policymaking and to avoid oversight and ac-
countability. 
President Reagan has issued NSDDs to authorize an array of ac-
tivities, including the secret transfer of millions of taxpayers' dol-
lars to Argentina to train Nicaraguan rebels in 1981, increasing 
U.S. military activity in Central America and the Caribbean in 
1983, and authorization of the Libyan disinformation campaign in 
1986. 
In the case of covert action policies, at least two NSDDs demon-
strate the ability of the President to secretly modify established 
policy and law, and we believe could undermine the purpose of this 
legislation. These are NSDD 159, "Covert Action Policy Approval 
and Coordination Procedures," and NSDD 286, which is untitled, 
but sets policies and procedures regarding congressional oversight 
of covert action which fall short of the stricter requirements of 
today's bill. 
Focusing on NSDD 159, its history tells much about its purpose 
and its danger. NSDD 159 was issued by the President on January 
18, 1985, shortly after the most significant of the Boland amend-
ments had taken effect terminating military and paramilitary aid 
to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
As stated in the Iran-contra committee report: 
Still the President felt strongly about the contras, and he ordered his staff, in the 
words of his National Security Adviser, to find a way to keep the contras "body and 
soul together." Thus began the story of how the staff of a White House advisory 
body became an operational entity that secretly ran the contra assistance effort, 
and later the Iran initiative. The action officer placed in charge of both operations 
was Lieutenant Colonel Oliver L. North. 
NSDD 159 facilitated the operational independence of the Na-
tional Security Council in two important ways: appeared to in-
crease the ability of agencies other than CIA to engage in covert 
activity; second, it carves out an exemption from reporting to Con-
gress about a vast array of activities in support of CIA operations 
performed by non-CIA government entities. 
First, NSDD 159 grants the use of a finding by agencies other 
than the CIA, appears to contravene President Reagan's own Exec-
utive Order on intelligence activities. Issued in 1981, the order 
states that "no agency except the CIA may conduct any special ac-
tivity [covert activity] unless the President determines that another 
agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective." [E.O. 
12333, Section 1.8(e)] 
In the arms-for-hostage transfers, for example, which the Nation-
al Security Council coordinated, no determination was ever made 
that the NSC would "more likely achieve [this] particular objec-
tive" than the CIA. Nonetheless, one finding was issued for this 
action in December, 1985, and two in January, 1986. Even so, the

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

78 
findings were deliberately withheld by the President from Con-
gress, which learned of the arms sales, with the rest of the world, 
from a disgruntled Iranian middleman. 
Second, because the NSDD carves out an exemption from report-
ing to Congress about an array of activities in support of CIA 
covert, we believe the proposed legislation will fall short of its 
goals. NSDD 159 weakens the reporting requirement by distin-
guishing "substantial support" to the CIA which must be described 
in the "finding or memorandum of notification" from "routine sup-
port" which is exempt from the reporting requirements. 
On its face, "routine support" may sound minimal, but NSDD 
159 describes its scope as including "personnel, funds, equipment, 
supplies, transportation, training, logistics, and facilities." The di-
mensions of these activities enlarge significantly when one consid-
ers the unreported covert NSC activities in Central America and 
the Middle East following issuance of NSDD 159. 
We cannot be certain that even the reforms proposed today will 
prevent bizarre .and mistaken actions by our Government. Howev-
er, every effort should be made to ensure that the legislation will 
be able to meet its objectives. 
We urge you to include the following provisions in the bill or in 
its legislative history. 
One, existing NSDDs on covert action not consonant with the 
terms of this law should be understood as inoperative and should 
be officially rescinded by the President. 
Two, the National Security Council must provide the Congress 
- with copies of all existing NSDDs, and to the extent classified, then 
the appropriate committees and leadership. 
Three, copies of all newly issued Presidential National Security 
Council directives must be provided to the Congress when promul-
gated, and to the extent classified, then to the appropriate commit-
tees and leadership. 
Four, lastly, all support?"substantial," "routine," or otherwise?
by non-CIA Government components to CIA covert actions must be 
fully and currently described in the finding or memorandum of no-
tification provided to the Congress by the Director of Central Intel-
ligence. 
Mr. Chairman, we support this legislation and appreciate the op-
portunity to testify.

I am John Buchanan, Chairman of the People for the American 
Way Action Fund, a nonpartisan constitutional liberties 
organization. I am pleased to testify today on behalf of the 
270,000 members our organization. I am accompanied by our 
legislative counsel Steven Katz. 
Today's hearing is not without historic importance. It is 
one of the first opportunities since the Iran-contra hearings for 
the public, Congress, and administration officials to debate the 
scope of intelligence oversight reforms. In a larger sense, it 
is a debate over the foreign policy and national security role of 
the Congress. As a citizen, and as a former Member of Congress 
who served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am very pleased to 
appear before you today to address these crucial issues. 
SECRECY AND DEMOCRACY 
The importance of secrecy to the security of our nation is 
undeniable; but even national security is not very well served by 
excessive government secrecy. In December, 1987, People for the 
American Way released its report "Government Secrecy: Decisions 
Without Democracy." The report culminates almost two years of 
investigative research into the growth of official secrecy in the 
United States and its consequences for our government and 
citizens. It documents the ongoing tension between secrecy and 
democracy, the existence of a secrecy system at work well before 
the Iran-contra affair, and the potential for excessive secrecy 
by future administrations -- Democrat or Republican.

As historian and former presidential aide Arthur Schlesinger 
states in the preface to our report: 
Secrecy is the bane of democracy because it is 
the enemy of accountability. The framers of the 
American Constitution designed a system of 
government intended to bring power and 
accountability into balance. The secrecy 
system, as it has been nurtured by the 
executive branch over the last forty years and 
with special zeal over the last seven years, is 
the indispensable ally of the Imperial 
Presidency. 
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT 
The bill you consider today, the "Intelligence Oversight 
Act" is an essential piece of legislation, a reform mandated not 
only by the Iran-contra affair, but also by the rightful role of 
congressional oversight in our constitutional government. We 
believe that Americans strongly support congressional oversight 
and access to information. In a November, 1987, nationwide poll 
commissioned by People for the American Way, the Roper 
Organization asked Americans about government secrecy. Overall, 
the response to the poll was a call for greater "openness in 
government." 93% of those surveyed specifically supported 
"openness in government" because Congress needs the information 
to perform its oversight role. 
OVERSIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY 
The question before us today, of course, is not simply 
congressional access to information in general. It is information 
about intelligence activity, particularly notification of covert 
activity performed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and

other government entities. 
Congressional oversight of the intelligence community, 
particularly "special" or covert activities, is central to the 
legitimate foreign policy and national security role of Congress. 
This goes beyond the fundamental oversight role of Congress in 
the authorization, funding, and execution of government programs 
and policies. American foreign policy and our system of 
government cannot succeed unless the President and the Congress 
cooperate. The Constitution gives both the Congress and the 
Executive specific foreign policy powers. It does not make 
foreign policy the exclusive domain of one branch, of government. 
The result is a system of checks and balances which ensures that 
our nation's foreign policy and national security framework is 
consistent with the policy, law, and interests of our nation. To 
do otherwise, as we have seen in the Iran-contra affair, is to 
subvert our constitutional system, contravene established foreign 
policy, and ignore the rule of law. 
Indeed, former Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral 
Stansfield Turner, states in his book Secrecy and Democracy:

The proposed "Intelligence Oversight Act", like its Senate 
counterpart passed in committee last month, provides the 
necessary reforms to guarantee that the legitimate role of 
Congress and our checks and balances system are functioning 
effectively. In a perfect world, these principles would be self-
executing. We know from experience, however, that the mechanisms 
for accountability must be both crafted and implemented 
carefully. Democracy demands the vigilance of its citizens and 
elected officials. The passage of the legislation before us today 
is necessary for such vigilance to be meaningful. 
Congress must be kept fully and currently informed of the 
intelligence activities of United States, whether it is the CIA, . 
the National Security Council (NSC), or other entities. 
Notification of "special" or covert activities is particularly , 
important. We support the proposed requirement that the 
intelligence committees are informed of a Finding "as soon as 
possible after such approval and prior to the initiation of the 
special activity authorized by the finding," and in exceptional 
circumstances, we support the proposed 48-hour time limit for 
notification pursuant to initiation of a covert operation. 
The present notification system is ineffective for purposes 
of proper congressional oversight. Frequently, the White House 
has failed to comply with the notification rules, and when it 
has, Congress's role is no greater than that of an umpire dusting 
off homeplate after the batter has hit a home run.

Congressional oversight and notification as outlined in this 
bill is essential for our support of legislation on covert 
activities. It is also important to recognize, however, that the 
proposed legislation not only makes the president more 
accountable, but appears to expand the president's power to 
authorize covert activity. Under current law and executive order, 
authority to engage in covert activity is limited to the C.I.A. 
unless the president makes a determination that another agency 
can do the job better. The bill you consider today establishes, a 
new section of the National Security Act entitled "Presidential 
Approval and Reporting Of Special Activities," and states that 
"the President may authorize the conduct of a special activity by 
departments, agencies, or entities of the United States 
Government." We have some reservations about this apparent 
expansion of authority, particularly as our nation emerges from a 
scandal when agencies outside the C.I.A., acted with indifference 
to the law. Covert operations should be limited. By their very 
nature and as a matter of policy covert operations are not 
accountable to many in government. They lack the broad 
congressional and public support necessary to serve and protect 
the nation's vital interests. Mr. Chairman, at this juncture in 
our nation's history, it is unclear why Congress would so readily 
dispatch the performance of covert activities to more, not fewer, 
agencies of our government.

NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COVERT ACTION POLICY 
Mr. Chairman, our organization suppports the proposed 
legislation in large measure because it aims to ensure that our 
government operates under established policy and law on 
intelligence activity, even though particular covert operations 
and plans remain vital secrets. 
We, believe, however, that the legislation will fall short 
of its goal of an established policy and law on intelligence 
activity, unless the committee recognizes the impediments posed 
by the promulgation of secret presidential directives. These 
directives are issued through the National Security Council and 
have established covert action policies binding on the government 
today. Such directives have made it possible for government 
officials to operate outside the scope of public laws and 
executive orders on covert action, and are indifferent to 
statutory action for congressional oversight. 
The use of such directives, evolving through administrations 
since President Truman has increased in sophistication and 
authority. In 1976, a special Senate committee studying 
presidential power concluded that these directives 
represent a new method for promulgating decisions, 
in areas of gravest importance. Such decisions are 
not specifically required by law to be published in 
any register, even in a classified form; none have 
prescribed formats or procedures; none of these 
vital Executive decisions are revealed to Congress 
or the public except under irregular, arbitrary, or 
accidental circumstances. 
That description holds true today. Under President Reagan, 
the series is called the National Security Decision Directives or

NSDDs. Awareness of the series in Congress is very limited. As 
Representative Anthony Beilenson, Chairman of the Intelligence 
Oversight and Evaluation Subcommittee stated before a House 
Government Operations Subcommittee last year: 
What I have to say about NSDDs, as they are called, 
will be brief. It is based on an incomplete 
understanding of this form of Presidential

Committee on Intelligence does not receive copies 
of NSDDs. 
As of January 1, 1988 President Reagan has issued at least 
286 NSDDs. Some are innocent, but many are not. On three 
occasions Congress has overturned or nullified specific NSDDs 
through legislation. NSDDs have been found to secretly create 
national policy, to permit fugitive policymaking, and to avoid 
oversight and accountability. President Reagan has issued NSDDs 
to authorize an array of activities including the secret transfer 
of millions of taxpayers dollars to Argentina to train Nicaraguan 
rebels in 1981, increasing U.S. military activity in Central 
America and the Caribbean in 1983, and authorization of the 
Libyan disinformation campaign in 1986. 
In the case of covert action policies, at least two NSDDs 
demonstrate the ability of the president to secretly modify 
established policy and law; and we believe could undermine the 
purpose of this legislation. These are NSDD 159 "Covert Action 
Policy Approval and Coordination Procedures," and; NSDD 286, 
which is untitled, but sets policies and procedures regarding 
congressional oversight of covert action which fall short of the 
stricter requirements of today's bill.

Focusing on NSDD 159, its history tells much about its 
purpose and its danger. NSDD 159 was issued by the President on 
January 18, 1985, shortly after the most significant of the 
Boland Amendments had taken effect terminating military and 
paramilitary aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. As stated in the Iran-
contra Committee report: 
Still the President felt strongly about the 
Contras, and he ordered his staff, in the words of 
his National Security Adviser to find a way to keep 
the Contras "body and soul together." Thus began 
the story of how the staff of a White House 
advisory body, became an operational entity that 
secretly ran the Contra assistance effort, and 
later the Iran initiative. The action officer 
placed in charge of both operations was Lt. Col. 
Oliver L. North. 
NSDD 159 facilitated the operational independence of the 
National Security Council in two important ways. First, it 
extended the use of a Finding, the presidential license for 
covert activity, to agencies other than the CIA. Second, taking 
the opposite tack towards accountability, it carved out an 
exemption from reporting 
activities in support of 
government entities. 
First, the use of a 
to Congress about a vast array of 
CIA operations performed by non-CIA 
Finding by agencies other than the CIA 
appears to contravene President Reagan's own executive order on 
intelligence activities. Issued in 1981, the order states that 
No agency except the CIA may conduct any special 
activity [covert activity] unless the President 
determines that another agency is more likely to 
achieve a particular objective. [E.O. 12333, Sec. 
1.8(e)] 
In the arms-for-hostage transfers, for example, which the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
86 
National Security Council coordinated, no determination was ever 
made that the NSC would "more likely achieve [this] particular 
objective" than the CIA. Nonetheless, one Finding was issued for 
this action in December 1985 and two in January 1986. Even so, 
the Findings were deliberately withheld by the President from 
Congress, which learned of the arms sales with the rest of the 
world from a disgruntled Iranian middleman. 
Second, because the NSDD carves out an exemption from 
reporting to Congress about an array of activities in support of 
CIA covert, we believe the proposed legislation will fall short 
of its goals. NSDD 159 weakens the reporting requirement by 
distinguishing "substantial support" to the CIA which must be 
described in the "Finding or memorandum of notification" from 
"routine support" which is exempt from the reporting 
requirements. On it's face, "routine support" may sound minimal, 
but NSDD 159 describes its scope as including "personnel, funds, 
equipment, supplies, transportation, training, logistics, and 
facilities." The dimensions of these activities enlarge 
significantly when one considers the unreported covert NSC 
activities in Central America and the Middle East following 
issuance of NSDD 159. 
Mr. Chairman, my incredulity increases each time I revisit 
the facts of the Iran-contra Affair, and yet it happened. What's 
worse is that it happened after Watergate and after the Church 
Committee investigations of the CIA. 
We cannot be certain that even the reforms proposed today

will prevent bizarre and mistaken actions by our government. 
However, every effort should be made to ensure that the 
legislation will be able to meet its objectives. 
I urge you to include the following provisions in the bill 
or its legislative history: (1) Existing NSDDs on covert action 
not consonant with the terms of this law should be understood as 
inoperative and should be officially rescinded by the President. 
(2) The National Security Council must provide the Congress with 
copies of all existing NSDDS, and to the extent classified, then 
the appropriate committees and leadership. (3) Copies of all 
newly issued presidential National Security Council directives 
must be provided to the Congress when promulgated, and to the 
extent classified then to the appropriate committees and/ 
leaderUHip.(4) Lastly, all support, "substantial," "routine" or 
otherwise by non-CIA government components to CIA covert actions 
must be fully and currently described in the Finding or 
memorandum of notification provided to the Congress by the 
Director of Central Intelligence. 
Mr. Chairman, and distinguished members of the committee, 
thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.

Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much, Mr. Buchanan. I ap-
preciate your being here today and giving us your insights. Per-
haps you can begin by just saying an extra word or two about the 
organization that you represent and its purpose. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. We are, as I indicated, ? 270,000 strong. We are 
private citizens; we are nonpartisan. Our purpose is to protect, en-
hance the constitutional liberties of American citizens, and we 
sought to do so in a series of ways. 
One of our areas of operation is in protecting freedom to learn 
and combatting censorship activity in public education. We have 
sought to combat religious intolerance in political life in the 
United States. We think the pluralism of this country is its 
strength and we have sought to protect the 1st amendment and 
other constitutional rights and liberties of American citizens. 
We also are attempting to do our part to uphold democratic 
values, and toward that end, we are trying to increase voter and 
citizen participation in the Government. 
Chairman McHuGH. I am sure some of the people observing 
these hearings did not know about your organization. 
I would like to make one point. I think you have raised a number 
of interesting and important issues in your testimony which we 
should look at more carefully. 
I want to reassure you that, at least on my behalf, there is no 
intent to expand the authority that the President holds. There is 
no real attempt to restrict the President from conducting covert op-
erations as compared to what he has now. 
The real thrust of this legislation, as you know, is to require that 
the Congress know what decisions are being made with respect to 
covert operations so that we can perform our oversight function 
and so that the President might have the benefit of our advice in 
the case of a significant policy decision. 
And, therefore, at least with respect to the one point you made, 
it may appear that we are attempting to expand the President's au-
thority, but we really are not intending to? do that. We are simply 
saying that if in fact he uses one of these organizations under exist-
ing authority, which perhaps is a question here, he must notify us 
through the procedures described in the bill. 
Beyond that, I will pass to my colleagues in the interest of time. 
But thank you for your presentation this morning. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Buchanan, you have made a good contribution to this effort 
although I don't completely agree with you. I am curious?I notice 
you have come out in favor of the restrictive reporting period com-
pelling the President to consult with the Congress before he en-
gages in covert activity, under the most exceptional circumstances, 
within 48 hours. 
When the intelligence oversight legislation of 1980 was under 
consideration by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Congress, on 
which you served in the House, at that time Chairman Zablocld of-
fered an amendment which provided the President the realistic 
flexibility to defer prior reporting if essential to meet extraordi-
nary, vital interests of the United States or was essential to avoid 
unreasonable risk to the safety or security of the personnel or 
methods provided.

It seems to me that was a pretty good rule, and unfortunately I 
am not sure that the Iran situation complied with that rule, but 
you voted for that rule and now you have changed' your mind ap-
parently, and I wanted you to have a chance to explain your rever-
sal. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. I yield to no one in my admiration for the gen-
tleman from Louisiana, whose integrity and reliability are quite an 
asset to your district and to the Congress. 
I guess we both have the right to be wrong, since perhaps I erred 
in fulfilling similar responsibilities to the ones you are fulfilling 
here. I was in the position of trying to defend the prerogatives of 
the President, which, as a minority Member of the committee, 
often fell my lot. When I first came to Congress, there were a few 
people who would say "I agree with your voting record 100 per-
cent." I was tempted to say, 'If we are lucky we may be 75 right, 
but the chances are it is more like 50/50." 
I feel strongly at this juncture that what is more broadly at 
stake is what I believe to be an affront to the Constitution in the 
Iran-contra affair and to the constitutional prerogatives of the Con-
gress. I think there is an effort to get at something very important, 
that Congress fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and that its 
prerogatives be honored. 
You represent the people. I have faith in the American people 
themselves, and more faith in elected representatives than you 
seem to have in yourselves and each other, because we are talking 
about eight persons who have to be notified, eight persons in whom 
I have specific trust, and eight persons who ought to be persons the 
people can trust. 
It seems to me we should not, in the name of preserving of a 
democratic society, stray away from the very system that has made 
it a democratic society, and therefore, if I had that vote to cast 
again, I might cast it differently.. But I urge the Committee to deal 
with the present problem as illustrated in Iran-contra, and one 
that we in our report found to be a growing problem in Govern-
ment in areas beyond this. 
The American people in majority, we have found, want greater 
openness in government. They specifically want the Congress to 
have the information it needs to exercise oversight in their behalf, 
and I don't think it is an unreasonable provision of law to require 
it. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I appreciate your position, but I am concerned 
that rigid rules will cause greater problems. I agree with you. The 
implementation of the Iran-contra affair rubs against my sensibili-
ties for the same reason it does every Member of this Committee. 
Mr. Hyde has expressed his opinion to that end. There were errors 
made in implementation of that policy. The policy was well-moti-
vated, that we free our hostages and help the Freedom Fighters in 
Nicaragua, but there were errors committed. 
My concern is down the line if you are going to use this as an 
example to compel the Central Intelligence Agency to make sure 
that they dot their "i's" in every circumstance, we may find our-
selves in some circumstance in the future whereupon, frankly, 
American lives again or the security interests of the United States 
are seriously jeopardized.

For example, right now we have a possibility of?let me back-
track. The CIA, in conducting operations, often need some menial 
support from other agencies, such as weather reports from NOAA. 
They can have the flexibility to rely on those other agencies to pro-
vide those functions and those services for people, to do it without 
reporting to Congress, without reporting to the President, to do it 
as a day-to-day routine matter. 
What you are saying is that if we pass this bill, they have to 
report to Congress virtually everything they do, and wouldn't this, 
in addition to jeopardizing the security of the country and the 
safety of Americans, wouldn't this end up in Congress being over-
whelmed with paperwork and oversight to the extent that we 
couldn't possibly accomplish the micromanagement that is required 
by the bill? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. I don't think reporting of the NSDDs to Con-
gress would constitute a burden on the Administration, and it 
could be limited to Members of Congress holding these responsibil-
ities. So I don't think that does constitute an overwhelming 
burden. 
Let me say that I think that congressional oversight may give 
you the kind of need-to-know in the language of the Intelligence 
Community that to do your job constitutionally, you have the need-
to-know about these things. If I were President, I would seek the 
ge-htleman from Louisiana's counsel, that of the gentleman from Il-
linois, Mr. Hyde, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Stokes and others 
in-Congress I trust, to get your judgment on whether we should do 
A or B in the area of covert activities. If you had been consulted, 
for example, you might have in 1984 not have agreed to the CIA 
mining of harbors in Nicaragua, certainly not when two Members 
of the Senate were on the scene there and could have been blown 
up in the process. 
There has been a series of decisions that had Congress been in 
this way notified, your counsel might have been of benefit to the 
President or the Director of Intelligence in a way that would have 
been persuasive and prevented mistakes. " 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. We were notified. There was an instance involv-
ing the Libyan raid in which Members of Congress? were notified in 
advance, and whether you trust us or not, Sam Donaldson half an 
hour before the raid came on the air and said there was going to be 
a significant event involving Libya. There is a problem with disclo-
sure. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to express my appreciation to Mr. Buchanan for his ap-
pearance here and his testimony. Most of us remember when he 
served in this body with us and the high esteem we had for him 
and the great integrity with which he served in this body. It is 
indeed always a pleasure to see him. 
MT. BUCHANAN. Thank you, sir. 
Mr. STOKES. I have one question, perhaps just to invite a com-
ment. I think in this whole picture people sometimes tend to lose 
sight of the fact that in this case, the Iran-contra case, what really 
happened is that the law was circumvented. There was nothing in 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

93 
Iran-contra which prohibited the President of the United States 
either from calling in the "Gang of Eight" or calling the Intelli-
gence Committees of the House and Senate and advising them of 
what he was going to do. 
Then he had a third alternative. Had he decided it was so sensi-
tive he could not comply with the law in that respect, he could 
have then initiated his action, then given timely notice to the Con-
gress, and Iran-contra would never have been out of control as it 
was. 
Here, instead of complying with any one of the three options, the 
President chose to instruct the CIA not to notify the Congress and 
to let this action proceed in this unconstitutional manner. 
From time to time our Committee -receives in the normal course 
of business notification about covert actions and those covert ac-
tions proceed without any leaks or without any disclosures of any 
kind, and in most instances, they are successful ventures. The prob-
lem here got out of hand because they actually circumvented the 
natural, normal processes of government and actually circumvent-
ed the CIA. 
People in the CIA, had they been permitted to carry out this 
function in the normal way, could have carried it out because of 
their ability to carry out actions of this sort, so this legislation 
really deals with a situation were the President and others in our 
administration attempted to circumvent the laws. 
I don't know how much good it will do to enact this law. If they 
choose to disobey the law, we are still in the same position. But at 
least I think the American people will have seen the Congress act 
responsibly in this respect. 
Do you have a comment? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I think your words I would 
simply echo. It seems to me that while the American people over-
whelmingly want more openness in government and they want you 
to have the information you are seeking to acquire by the reporting 
requirements of this legislation, I don't think outside the Beltway 
people have generally perceived the constitutional crisis that is em-
bodied in Iran-contra that I perceive. It seems to me that it is a 
scandal. It is outrageous and it constitutes a challenge to the Con-
stitution itself. 
We simply can't have a situation where lieutenant colonels run 
secret wars from the basement of the White House as functionaries 
of an agency that was never intended to be an operational agency 
but an advisory body to the President. We can't have a situation 
where the President and the Secretary of State are denouncing a 
policy of doing business with terrorists while we are implementing 
that policy from the basement of the White House. 
We don't need a situation in which we have a disinformation 
campaign going on toward Libya and all in secret, without knowl-
edge or participation by the people or their elected representatives. 
I think that is a challenge to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, 
whose bicentennial we celebrate now. 
If the American people don't understand how precious a heritage 
this is, they need to get themselves educated. They need to be con-
cerned about this. And if they are not, they ought to be ashamed. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you.

Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. HYDE. I, too, welcome John Buchanan, a very able Congress-
man and useful person now that he is elevated from the political 
fever swamps to citizenhood. 
On page 4 of your prepared statement, you say, "Frequently, the 
White House has failed to comply with the notification rules.. . ." 
Background material prepared by committee staff for last year's 
hearings stated, "As far as we know, since enactment of the Over-
sight Act in the fall of 1980, the Committee has been given notice, 
prior to implementation, of all findings, except for the January 17, 
1986 Iran finding." So how do you reconcile your claims of frequent 
Administration noncompliance with notification rules with our 
committee's knowledge that in only one instance since 1980 has 
prior notice not been given? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. The White House has engaged in a struggle with 
Congress over the spirit and level of White House requirements, 
and timely notice has been stretched to its limits?the invasion of 
Libya is a good example. 
Mr. HYDE. Once. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. There was no effective way for Congress to re-
spond. This behavior only contributed to the inability of Congress 
to support the invasion. The letter of the law requiring findings 
and reporting of findings has been ignored in coordinating Iran 
arms sales, covert action without a finding or notification to the 
Congress. 
In November '85 the President authorized the covert sale of 
Hawk missiles to Iran supposedly in exchange for hostages. The 
hostages were never forthcoming. 
Mr. HYDE. I wonder if I could interrupt. Regarding your refer-
ence to the exchange of arms for hostages, really that is not the 
way it was supposed to work. The hostages were held in Lebanon 
by Hizballah or the Islamic Jihad. We hoped the Iranians could in-
fluence the terrorists who were holding the hostages. Because you 
couldn't deal with the terrorists, and Iran subsidized, trained and 
supported the terrorists, you tried to get at the terrorists through 
them. So it wasn't exactly weapons for hostages, it was weapons for 
access. It is very complicated, and we say things so trippingly from 
the tongue that make it weapons for hostages. It wasn't conceived 
as such. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. I think the whole phenomenon of NSDDs, which 
I urge the committee to look at in further consideration of the leg-
islation, would start as position papers and then become what Mr. 
Brooks calls secret laws. The number of these directives, the con-
tent of some of those you know about seem to say there was an 
effort on the part of this President to do a good many things which 
were at least unknown to you and some of which appeared to con-
travene a law you had passed and the will of the American people. 
Perhaps that has not been true in as many instances as I believe, 
but we know that the problem has existed. I need to make sure 
that that particular, problem can't exist. 
Mr. HYDE. I agree with almost everything that Mr. Stokes said. 
He talked about options that were available to the President. I 
don't see how you can have a successful foreign policy, especially a 
high risk one, without taking into your confidence at least some of

the important leaders in Congress. It is risk insurance. It shares 
some of the responsibility. You get advice from a different perspec-
tive that the "yes men" around the President might not give him, 
and I think it is foolish and counterproductive not to get that noti-
fication. I think that is wise, I agree. 
I have a problem with rigidly circumscribing it by a number of 
hours, because you deny a flexibility that I think the President has 
constitutionally, but also that he may have to have, as we saw in 
the Carter administration's Iran situation. Where we had six of our 
people in the Canadian Embassy for a? matter of some three 
months. There President Carter on two occasions failed to notify 
Congress when they went in to test the ground and later when the 
planes came in, because lives were at stake. 
Ultimately notice was given in a timely fashion. I think the 
standard of "timely fashion" makes sense. I think to try to micro-
manage it down to 48 hours is to put a chilling effect on operations 
that may be necessary to save lives in a world of increasing terror-
ism and the need to cooperate with other countries who may have 
people on the ground in places, whose lives are at stake, too. So I 
think we need the "timely" notification, and I think it should be 
statutory. 
I think the President should have flexibility there. Ten months 
in the Iran arms transfer situation is not timely, I couldn't agree 
more, but I think he has not gone unscathed for failing to notify in 
a timely fashion. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. He supports timely fashion. The 48 hour period, 
it seems to me that is a matter of negotiation for the committee 
itself. But I would remind my distinguished friend that 200 years 
ago today we were in the midst of the ratification struggle for the 
Constitution of the United States and it was really threatened and 
there had to be promised a Bill of Rights before some states would 
ratify it. 
And during that period of writing of the Federalist Papers, the 
Bill of Rights?during that time frame, the Constitution was fully 
explored by conventions of the various states, and the words were 
pored over, and in the conventions the words were very carefully 
drawn. It seems to me that it was very wise of the American people 
to take a hard look at that which was to become the basic law of 
the land. 
It seems to me further that it is always right to bind men by the 
chains of law?in Jefferson's words?and if you have a situation 
where a President and his functionaries have disregarded the law, 
have failed to do what the law required and in so doing, have 
brought a challenge to the Constitution, I think it is not unreason-
able that Congress try to make sure that that not happen again. 
I won't argue about the 48 hour thing. You can negotiate what is 
reasonable and timely notification, but even with the 48 hours we 
are talking about eight persons, or four if the Senate provision is 
adopted, and four I believe to be trustworthy. 
I want to say finally, and my good friend from Illinois I know 
agreed with this, that the real strength of this country lies not in 
our military establishment, though it is necessary. It certainly does 
not lie in covert operations, although sometimes they may be nec-
essary. The real strength of our country lies in its people, like

Bonnie Blair of Champaign, Illinois. People of courage and people 
who are champions, I think, are the strength of this country. 
I believe that the Congress is like a mirror reflecting what the 
American people are. You see the strengths and the weaknesses, 
the diversity, but I see no reason to trust more that vast array of 
people in the military down at the low ranks who are privy to clas-
sified information, that vast array of people in the Executive 
Branch, foreign nationals, as in the case of Iran/contra, private 
citizens as in that case, more than we trust the elected representa-
tives of the people, and more than we trust a carefully selected 
group of leaders who get to share in this process that can be impor-
tant to the American people. 
I really think that you are doing right in this bill and I thank 
you for it. 
Chairman McHum'. Mr. Kastenmeier. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you,.Mr. Chairman. 
I think you are right. We haven't, I suppose, as a committee done 
a survey on whether notice was timely in a number of situations 
that may or may not have been, but certainly as to the Iran/ 
contra, the Iran affair?there have been others, as you point out, 
both the attack on Libya and the Grenada invasion?this commit-
tee was notified as a committee, the leadership was I think in both 
cases, brought down to he White House and notified that the 
attack was underway and in terms of what the statute contem-
plates, notification and consultation, they were not consulted, they 
were merely informed, and informed so late in the process that 
anything they would have said would have been irrelevant. That is 
not the spirit of the law. Would you admit to that? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Absolutely. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. We heard the preceding witness suggest if we 
were serious that we might consider in light of past failures, the 
invocation of criminal penalties. I don't know that you dealt with 
that question. What is your reaction to Mr. Clifford's suggestion in 
that regard? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. I think if I were in the gentleman's position, I 
would have to very carefully weigh that proposal and anything I 
said would be opinion, not judgment, because it is also new to me. I 
do share the frustration of the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Hyde, 
about the problem of leaks and how to handle it. It seems appropri-
ate for the Congress to do something to put some kind of teeth into 
law that would make it more injurious to guilty parties to leak in-
formation that could affect human lives or the national security of 
the U.S. 
I am not sure whether this is the right thing to do, and I would 
share the reservations of the gentleman from Kansas about cutting 
off an operation that might in itself have importance, but the 
criminal provisions I think you should at least consider. I think 
you should take a hard look and try to find some way?although 
you can never completely eliminate leaks that are costly to the 
country?I think it is appropriate to try to do something about it. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. You raise?you devote quite a bit of your tes-
timony to the interesting subject of national security directives, 
NSDDs. Obviously, none of the directives would apparently be op-

erable if the text of the directive were in opposition to existing 
statutory law, isn't that correct? 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Yes, but I don't know what has happened in the 
past in that area. It would appear to me that some of the NSDDs 
that were in-house being enacted by Lt. Colonel North and others, 
from my point of view appeared to be in contravention of existing 
law, and therefore, it seems to me if you can make sure either in 
language in the legislation, or in the legislative history, to try to 
strengthen the possibility that that doesn't happen in the future, it 
would be a good thing to do. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. I want to join my colleagues in thanking you 
for appearing today, both your organization and you personally, be-
cause it is a very sensitive area and there are many who testified 
who have a direct interest institutionally in the area, and not very 
many who have an interest which is not institutional in the sense 
of being part of it, and you and your organization are in that mold 
and the objectivity you bring to us is I think beneficial and appreci-
ated. 
I thank the gentleman for his appearance. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHum'. Mr. Buchanan, let me, as chairman of the 
subcommittee, express for all of us our appreciation. We admire 
your record in Congress, which was a long and distinguished one, 
but it is obvious that you are continuing to contribute in important 
ways as a private citizen, and we thank you for your help here 
today. 
The subcommittee stands in recess until 2 o'clock. 
[Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m., the subcommittee was recessed, to re-
convene at 2:00 p.m., the afternoon of the same day.] 
Chairman McHuGH. The Subcommittee will please come to 
order. 
We are delighted this afternoon to have as our first witness our 
colleague and good friend, Congressman Lee Hamilton, who has 
served very capably as a Representative for Indiana's Ninth Dis-
trict since 1965. He is a senior member of the Committee on For-
eign Affairs and chairs that Committee's Subcommittee on Europe 
and the Middle East. 
He is also Vice Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. 
From 1981 through 1986, Congressman Hamilton was a member 
of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence serving as 
Chairman during his last two years on the Committee. 
He was also Chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate 
Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, and we were all, I might say, 
Lee, very proud of the job you did for us in that capacity. We very 
much appreciate your coming this afternoon to give us the benefit 
of your insights on this legislation and we welcome your testimony. 
STATEMENT OF HON. LEE HAMILTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA 
Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I appreciate the opportunity to testify and to appear before your 
subcommittee and the Intelligence Committee whose work I respect 
and-for whose members I have the highest esteem.

I, of course, support H.R. 3822 and urge its enactment. In the 
opening part of my testimony, I identify several provisions which I 
think are important provisions, and so far as I know, relatively un-
controversial. Nonetheless; I want to mention them in the testimo-
ny because I think it is important to identify several of those provi-
sions which will provide a better understanding of the require-
menti and structure of congressional oversight of intelligence ac-
tivities. I ask my statement be included in the record in full. 
? The requirement that you have a written covert finding, it seems 
to me, is crucial. The requirement that the covert action support 
foreign policy goals is important, a prohibition on retroactive find-
ings is important, a requirement that you have a full description of 
the scope of the covert action and those parties that are going to 
participate in it is important, and the requirement that you have a 
signed presidential finding submitted to the Committee likewise is 
important for the reasons I set forth in my statement. . 
I understand, of course, that the prior notification requirement is 
the critical feature of H.R. 3822. The structure of the bill is that 
prior notification must be given to the Intelligence Committees or 
to the Gang of Eight in all cases unless things are moving so fast 
and you have an extraordinary situation which makes that provi-
sion for such notification impossible. 
This is the formulation that I thought the Congress had enacted 
in 1980. Timely notification was inserted into the statute to reflect 
that formulation. At that time, the Administration?a Democratic 
administration?persuaded the Intelligence Committees and the 
Foreign Affairs Committees that the term "timely notification", al-
though ambiguous, was more in keeping with the spirit of intra-
branch comity and less offensive to Executive Branch sensibilities. 
Now, we are told by the Administration that "timely" means 
whatever the President says it means and that he can withhold no-
tification as long as we wants. It seems to me if we let this inter-
pretation stand, an interpretation that says the President can with-
hold information from the Congress at his discretion, then Con-
gress will have seriously weakened its oversight capabilities and 
consented to a basic shift of power away from the Congress to the 
Executive Branch. 
Once the power to withhold information from the Congress is 
granted to the President, how can it then be maintained that Con-
gress stands equal in power to the President? 
The record suggests to ,me that Congress should pass an unam-
biguous, straightforward statute that permits no evasion from the 
responsibility to keep Congress currently informed. Such a statute 
must provide for prior notification of covert actions. Covert actions 
do not fit comfortably within the traditional processes of our gov-
ernment. 
Many times I believe?and I think most members of this commit-
tee believe?that covert actions are necessary. They can be a most 
useful instrument of policy when their objectives are understood 
and focused, when they complement accepted policy, when they are 
used as a tool of foreign policy and not as a substitute for foreign 
policy.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 99 
Because covert actions can be so bound up with important for-
eign policy issues and because only the Intelligence Committees 
can provide independent oversight over them they must be the sub-
ject of thorough discussion and divergent advice within the Intelli-
gence Committees. 
Someone outside the foreign policy bureaucracy must have the 
President's ear. When it becomes known within that bureaucracy 
that the President is tilting one way or another on an issue, the 
bureaucracy tilts the same way. That tilt is, it seems to me, appro-
priate. He is, after all, the President of the United States. 
But few, if any, will tell the President that a proposed activity is 
unwise. That is why it is so important for him to have outside inde-
pendent advice. And, when covert actions are at issue, that advice 
cannot come from the public. It cannot come from the press, and it 
cannot come from the Congress as a whole. It can only come from 
the Intelligence Committees or the Gang of Eight. It must come at 
a time when it will do some good. 
That is why, in my opinion, the prior notice provision of the bill 
is so crucial. Covert actions are too important, their implications 
are too great, to consign their formulation to a closed group of pol-
icymakers loyal to the President. Remember, too, that once a major 
covert action is begun, it is next to impossible to stop it. 
Some say covert actions are too sensitive to divulge to the Intelli-
gence Committees, or to the gang of eight, or, as in the Senate bill, 
to the gang of four. 
What an astounding admission that argument is. It says, in 
effect, that our most distinguished members, our leadership, cannot 
be trusted. Also, the Intelligence Committees regularly receive in-
formation concerning intelligence programs and covert actions that 
directly involve risk to human life. These secrets, and covert action 
secrets, are protected, and protected well by the Intelligence Com-
mittees. 
Dozens, even hundreds of people in the Executive Branch know 
of covert actions. A few more senior Members do not expand the 
risk. 
Moreover, if Congress grants that some things are too sensitive 
to tell Congress, is not then the whole oversight process irreparably 
undermined? We have a government of coequal branches. Secrets 
are not Executive Branch secrets; they are U.S. Government se-
crets. 
Each branch must be responsible for them. Each House of Con-
gress must act to discipline any Member or staffer of the Intelli-
gence Committee thought to have breached his duty to protect in-
formation. But the Congress cannot, without seriously eroding its 
powers, accept the notion that some secrets can be held only by the 
Executive Branch, and not by the leadership of the Congress. 
In the final analysis, it is a question of balance. We must balance 
the harm that may result from the disclosure of a secret against 
the value of consultation and independent advice for the President 
prior to the initiation of a covert action. Have not the events of 
recent years shown us that the President needs that kind of advice 
in all circumstances? When covert actions are contemplated that

luo 
will have profound effects on our security interests, the balance, in 
our democracy, must be struck in favor of prior consultation. 
In the long run that approach will serve us best. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

FEBRUARY 24, 1988 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION 
PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
MR. CHAIRMAN, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS CONGRESSIONAL 
OVERSIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. 
I SUPPORT H.R. 3822 AND URGE ITS SWIFT ENACTMENT. IT SETS 
OUT REASONABLE AND PRECISE PROCEDURES UNDER WHICH THE CONDUCT 
OF NECESSARILY SECRET GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE SQUARED WITH 
THE TRADITIONS AND VALUES WHICH UNDERLIE OUR REPRESENTATIVE 
DEMOCRACY. IT DOES SO WITHOUT ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN EXISTING 
STATUTES, AND WITHOUT RESTRICTING THE ABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT 
TO RESPOND RAPIDLY IN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES. H.R. 3822 Is, I 
BELIEVE, A MODEST RESPONSE TO RECENT EVENTS. 
THE BILL HAS SEVERAL IMPORTANT AND SALUTARY PROVISIONS, 
INCLUDING: 
0 A REPEAL OF HUGHES-RYAN, AND COMBINING ITS SUBSTANCE 
WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT, 
MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS AND 
STRUCTURE OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE 
- ACTIVITIES;

0 A REQUIREMENT, IN MOST CASES, FOR A WRITTEN COVERT

OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES" WILL FORCE THE 
PRESIDENT AND HIS STAFF TO FOCUS DIRECTLY ON THE 
FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE COVERT ACTION; 
A PROHIBITION ON RETROACTIVE FINDINGS WILL AVOID 
RESORTING TO LEGAL STRATAGEM TO COVER PAST ERRORS OF 
JUDGMENT OR POLICY; 
O A REQUIRMENT THAT THE FINDING CONTAIN A FULLER

THOSE THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN IT INSURES A MORE 
THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL, IN BOTH THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH AND THE CONGRESS; AND 
O A REQUIREMENT THAT A SIGNED PRESIDENTIAL FINDING BE 
PROVIDED TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES MAKES CLEAR 
THAT THE DOCTRINE OF PLAUSIBILE DENIABILITY APPLIES TO 
THE ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO DENY TO-THE WORLD 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A COVERT ACTION; NOT TO THE ABILITY 
OF THE PRESIDENT TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

THE PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT, HOWEVER, IS THE CENTRAL 
FEATURE OF H.R. 3822. As I UNDERSTAND IT, PRIOR NOTICE MUST BE 
GIVEN TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES -- OR THE GANG OF EIGHT --
IN ALL CASES, UNLESS THE EXIGENCIES OF A FAST MOVING AND 
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION MAKE THE PROVISION FOR SUCH NOTICE 
IMPOSSIBLE. THIS FORMULATION IS WHAT I THOUGHT CONGRESS HAD 
ENACTED IN 1980. "TIMELY NOTICE" WAS INSERTED INTO THE STATUTE 
TO REFLECT THAT FORMULATION. AT THAT TIME, THE ADMINISTRATION, 
A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION, PERUADED.THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEES AND THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEES THAT THE TERM 
"TIMELY. NOTICE", WAS, ALTHOUGH AMBIGUOUS, MORE IN KEEPING WITH 
THE SPIRIT OF INTRA-BRANCH COMITY AND LESS OFFENSIVE TO 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH SENSIBILITIES. 
Now WE ARE TOLD BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT "TIMELY" MEANS 
WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT MEANS AND THAT HE CAN WITHHOLD 
NOTICE AS LONG AS HE WANTS. IF WE LET THIS INTERPRETATION 
STAND -- AN INTERPRETATION THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT CAN WITHHOLD 
INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS AT HIS DISCRETION -- THEN CONGRESS 
WILL HAVE WEAKENED SERIOUSLY ITS OVERSIGHT CAPABILITIES AND 
CONSENTED TO A BASIC SHIFT OF POWER AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS TO 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ONCE THIS POWER TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION 
FROM THE CONGRESS IS GRANTED TO THE PRESIDENT, HOW CAN IT THEN 
BE MAINTAINED THAT CONGRESS STANDS EQUAL IN POWER TO THE 
PRESIDENT?

THE RECORD SUGGESTS TO ME THAT CONGRESS SHOULD PASS AN 
UNAMBIGUOUS, STRAIGHTFORWARD STATUTE THAT PERMITS NO EVASION 
FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THE CONGRESS CURRENTLY INFORMED. 
SUCH A STATUTE MUST PROVIDE FOR PRIOR NOTICE OF COVERT 
ACTIONS. COVERT ACTIONS, AS A CONCEPT, DO NOT FIT COMFORTABLY 
WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL PROCESSES OF OUR GOVERNMENT. 
MAN,(TIMES COVERT ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY. THEY CAN BE A 
MOST USEFUL TOOL OF POLICY: 
- WHEN THEIR OBJECTIVES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND FOCUSED; 
- WHEN THEY COMPLEMENT ACCEPTED POLICY; AND 
- WHEN THEY ARE USED AS A TOOL OF FOREIGN POLICY, NOT AS A 
SUBSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN POLICY. 
BECAUSE COVERT ACTIONS CAN BE SO BOUND UP WITH IMPORTANT 
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, AND BECAUSE ONLY THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEES CAN PROVIDE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OVER THEM, THEY 
MUST BE THE SUBJECT OF THOROUGH DISCUSSION AND DIVERGENT ADVICE 
WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES. SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE 
FOREIGN POLICY BUREAUCRACY MUST HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S EAR. WHEN 
IT BECOMES KNOWN WITHIN THAT BUREAUCRACY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

TILTING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON AN ISSUE, THE BUREAUCRACY TILTS 
THE SAME WAY. THAT TILT -IS, IT-SEEMS TO ME, APPROPRIATE. BUT 
FEW, IF ANY, WILL TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT A PROPOSED ACTIVITY 
IS UNWISE. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO HAVE 
OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT ADVICE. AND, WHEN COVERT ACTIONS ARE AT 
ISSUE, THAT ADVICE CANNOT COME FROM THE PUBLIC, FROM THE PRESS, 
OR FROM THE CONGRESS AS A WHOLE. IT CAN ONLY COME FROM THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES OR THE "GANG OF EIGHT." IT MUST COME 
AT A TIME WHEN IT WILL DO SOME GOOD. 
THAT IS WHY, IN MY OPINION, THE PRIOR NOTICE PROVISION OF 
THE BILL IS SO CRUCIAL. COVERT ACTIONS ARE TOO IMPORTANT, 
THEIR IMPLICATIONS TOO GREAT, TO CONSIGN THEIR FORMULATION TO A 
CLOSED GROUP OF POLICYMAKERS LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT. REMEMBER, 
TOO, THAT ONCE A MAJOR COVERT ACTION IS BEGUN IT IS NEXT TO 
IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP IT. 
SOME SAY COVERT ACTIONS ARE TOO SENSITIVE TO DIVULGE TO THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES, OR TO THE GANG OF EIGHT, OR, AS IN THE 
SENATE BILL, TO THE GANG OF FOUR. 
WHAT AN ASTOUNDING ADMISSION THAT ARGUMENT IS. IT SAYS, IN 
,EFFECT, THAT OUR MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS, OUR LEADERSHIP, 
CANNOT BE TRUSTED. ALSO, THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES REGULARLY 
RECEIVE INFORMATION CONCERNING INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS AND COVERT

ACTIONS THAT THAT DIRECTLY INVOLVE RISK TO HUMAN LIFE. THESE 
SECRETS, AND COVERT ACTION SECRETS, ARE PROTECTED, ?AND 
PROTECTED WELL BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES. 
NEXT, DOZENS, EVEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH KNOW OF COVERT ACTIONS. A FEW MORE SENIOR MEMBERS DO 
NOT EXPAND THE RISK. 
MOREOVER, IF CONGRESS GRANTS THAT SOME THINGS ARE TOO 
SENSITIVE TO TELL CONGRESS, IS NOT THE WHOLE OVERSIGHT PROCESS 
IRREPARABLY UNDERMINED? WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF COEQUAL 
BRANCHES. SECRETS ARE NOT EXECUTIVE BRANCH SECRETS; THEY ARE 
U.S. GOVERNMENT SECRETS. EACH BRANCH MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THEM. EACH HOUSE OF CONGRESS MUST ACT TO DISCIPLINE ANY MEMBER 
OR STAFFER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THOUGHT TO HAVE 
BREACHED HIS DUTY TO PROTECT INFORMATION. BUT THE CONGRESS 
CANNOT, WITHOUT SERIOUSLY ERODING ITS POWERS, ACCEPT THE NOTION 
THAT SOME SECRETS CAN BE HELD ONLY BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND 
NOT BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CONGRESS. 
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, IT'S A QUESTION OF BALANCE. WE MUST 
'BALANCE THE HARM THAT MAY RESULT-FROM THE DISCLOSURE OF A 
SECRET AGAINST THE VALUE OF CONSULTATION AND INDEPENDENT ADVICE 
FOR THE PRESIDENT PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF A COVERT ACTION.

Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Lee, very much for your state-
ment:-
You and your colleagues on the special committee investigating 
the Iran-contra episode spent many months looking into the cir-
cumstances of that case, and heard from many witnesses, including 
many Administration witnesses. 
During the course of those investigations, what justification was 
offered, if any, by the White House, by the Administration officials, 
for not telling Congress about its covert operations to transfer arms 
to Iran? 
As you know, the express policy of our government was to not 
deal with the terrorist-supporting states, including Iran, but there 
was this covert, secret policy to do just the opposite. 
Did the Administration have any justification to offer during the 
course of your investigation about why Congress was not advised of 
that covert operation? 
Mr. HAMILTON. I think the position of the Administration was 
that they did not advise the Congress of those activities that you 
have correctly described because they did not trust the Congress 
with the information. They thought the Intelligence Committees 
would leak it. 
The events of Iran-contra occurred when you had a law on the 
books that required prior notice in most instances, and I guess, in a 
few cases, limited instances, it required timely notice. The basic 
justification by the Administration was its constitutional theory 
that the President of the United States has an inherent power to 
withhold information. 
And if you accept that, then it really does not matter what we 
write into statute. We can put the President has to notify us imme-
diately, or we can say 10 days, 100 days; but if you take the posi-
tion the Administration has taken that there is an inherent consti-
tutional power not to inform the Congress, then the statute in a 
real sense becomes irrelevant. That was the justification. It is a 
constitutional theory. 
Quite frankly, when we passed the Intelligence Oversight Act in 
1980 with that preambular clause in it, we simply did not address 
this question head on. 
This was, as you all know, passed under a Democratic Adminis-
tration. The Executive then, as the Executive now, was trying to 
protect the Executive Privilege. 
I think you have an extraordinarily expansive view of that power 
today. 
Chairman McHuGH. I presume it is fair to say that from your 
perspective, given all the facts of that case, there was no justifica-
tion for withholding that information from the Intelligence Com-
mittees, or certainly the Gang of Eight? 
Mr. HAMILTON. I think there was no justification for it. Indeed, I 
would argue just the other side. 
I think we would have had a very good chance to have saved our-
selves a lot of agony in this Nation if the procedures of the statute 
had, indeed, been followed and elected members of the Intelligence 
Committees or the Gang of Eight had had an opportunity, which I 
am almost certain they would have exercised, to object vigorously 
to the policies that were followed.

109 
Chairman McHuGH. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why prior 
notice should be written into the law and seen as the namal proce-
dure? 
Mr. HAMILTON. Yes. I agree. 
Chairman McHuGH. Judge Webster, when he was here this 
morning, emphasized that the President, has agreed through the 
President's National Security Decision Directive, to abide by more 
reasonable rules, taking the position, in effect, that although he 
has the legal right to withhold information under the Constitution, 
he promises not to do that. 
What is your opinion about the National Security Decision Direc-
tive as a guarantee that Congress will have an opportunity to get 
notice of these kinds of covert operations in a timely way? Is that 
sufficient protection for the Congress? 
Mr. HAMILTON. First, I think we should recognize that the Presi-
dent has taken a lot of commendable steps, as a result of the hear-
ings, as a result of the Tower Review Board, as a result of the In-
telligence Committees activities. The steps he has taken with re-
spect to the procedure to be followed on covert actions are com-
mendable. 
They have been done by the National Security Decision Direc-
tive, as I understand it. I believe that those steps are sincerely 
taken, and I would doubt that this Administration would carry on 
any covert action today without informing the Congress. 
In other words, I think I would argue that the Iran-contra hear-
ings have had a deterrent effect on the manner in which covert ac-
tions are carried out. Nonetheless, you are dealing here with a 
matter that will affect far more than just the Reagan Administra-
tion, and we all know the difference between an Executive Order 
and a law. 
This matter is so basic?it is so fundamental?that I think it 
should be a matter of statute. The President of the United States 
must clearly understand that if he is going to conduct these covert 
operations, he must notify the Congress in all circumstances. I 
think the country will be strengthened as a result of that. 
If I were the President, it would seem to me I would want that 
power. I would want to take an idea for a covert action and get an 
opinion on it from elected representatives who have some sense of 
what the American people think and what this country should do 
and to test my proposal against their independent judgment. 
Presidents must know that the people that advise them so closely 
are people many of whom he has appointed and are loyal to him, 
as they should be, but even those who are not appointed by him 
are people who believe that the President is the Commander in 
Chief, and they serve the President, not the Congress. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Livingston? 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Welcome, Mr. Hamilton. I have always enjoyed working with you 
throughout your service and my service in Congress. I certainly en-
joyed serving under you when you were chairman of the full Com-
mittee on Intelligence.

Mr. LIyINGSTON. But as luck would have it, we do disagree on 
this issue, and I hope you will not take offense if I say, in response 
to your statement, I am aware that you are under the impression 
that the only issue before us is the 48-hour notice and the prior 
consultation by the President. 
Let me say, referring back to the testimony of the current Direc-
tor of the Central Intelligence Agency, Judge Webster?there are 
several concerns about this particular bill. 
There are concerns about the vague language on the aggregation 
of the dollar value of arms transfers which applies to specific coun-
tries. 
There are concerns about the requirement to impose a process of 
authorization and appropriation on nonappropriated funds at the 
micro-management level of Central Intelligence Agency activities, 
covert activities, and to involve the U.S. Congress at that level. 
There are concerns that our definition of "special activities," as 
this bill would change the Hughes-Ryan Act, became too broad and 
that, frankly, a number of activities which have never been antici-
pated by the drafters of this bill might be under the purview of 
Congress as covert action requiring a finding, again resulting in 
micro-management. 
All of these are problems. If you would like to comment on any 
one of those problems, I certainly welcome your thoughts. 
But I do want to go further and talk specifically about the 48-
hour notice. 
Mr. HAMILTON. Well, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I 
saw the Director's statement this morning. I recognize that he 
brought out several problems that, frankly, until then I did not 
know were problems with the bill. 
The early part of my statement, that portion of it not related to 
the 48-hour notice provision, comments on important aspects of the 
bill under consideration, which arose out of, incidentally, our expe-
rience in the Iran-contra hearings. 
I would hope the gentleman would take a look at those, and my 
comments with respect to the specific provision you mentioned are 
limited because I do not know much about those. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. We will certainly have an opportunity to look at 
those at greater length later on. We do have hearings on this sub-
ject scheduled, I think, for March 10th; is that correct? 
Let's talk about the 48-hour notice. You said the events of recent 
years have shown us that the President needs that kind of advice, 
meaning consultation with Congress, in all circumstances. Let's 
talk about "all circumstances." 
This bill seeks to rigidly compel the President and the CIA to 
consult with Congress in almost all circumstances before they 
engage in covert action; then under extraordinary circumstances, 
always, without exception, within 48 hours after commencing the 
covert activity. 
I question whether or not that really envisions all circumstances. 
I wonder if we are not foreclosing our options and if?in fact, Mr. 
Hamilton, can't you foresee some circumstance so volatile that if 
even one person comes into the loop and gets the information and 
finds out about the information who doesn't really need to know

111 
about the activity, that the project?and, more importantly, lives of 
people?could be jeopardized? 
Don't you think there is any situation that could develop at such 
a time that if Congress is notified prior to or 48 hours after a 
covert action is authorized in response to the incident, that such an 
event might occur and that people might genuinely be placed in 
danger if just one person finds out that doesn't really need to know 
about that project? 
Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Livingston, I think the risk is greater on the 
other side. I think the risk is greater when the President does not 
have the independent advice than is the risk that you describe. 
I really can not think of any specific factual circumstance when 
a president could not notify at least the gang of eight within the 
48-hour period. 
Any covert action is going to?certainly any paramilitary covert 
action, but probably any covert action?is going to involve a lot of 
people. It is going to involve scores of people at the White House, it 
is going to involve scores of people in the Central Intelligence 
Agency. If you use military forces, it is going to involve hundreds 
of people. If all of those people can know about it, but the Speaker 
of the House and the Minority Leader of the House cannot know 
about it, I just think that is a situation that is unacceptable to the 
Congress. 
If you take the position of the Administration, Mr. Livingston, 
you do not define the circumstances where a president can with-
hold notice. It is a wide-open situation for them, if you use the 
phrase "extraordinary circumstances." 
When we asked Mr. Meese what kind of circumstances you are 
talking about, he responds in the most vague kind of sentences, so 
that, in effect, a President has extraordinary power just to with-
hold information. 
My view is that the risk really is not great that you described, 
but it is much greater for a President to act without sufficient in-
dependent advice. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I think your reference to Mr. Meese's testimony 
really describes his approach or his interpretation of timeliness at 
the time they were conducting the Iran covert activities. I daresay 
his interpretation of timeliness today would be much different and 
that he would probably say that it was a much briefer period of 
time. 
Mr. HAMILTON. Keep in mind, Mr. Livingston, that we never 
would have been notified of the activities of Iran-contra had it not 
come out in the press. The Administration never did come to a po-
sition. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Let's just put the shoe on the other foot for a 
second. 
You recall the incident where we attacked Libya. Our planes 
went in and attacked. There was consultation there. There was a 
leak to the press, which resulted apparently in Sam Donaldson's 
announcement that some big project was about to occur some half 
an hour before the raid. We ended up losing a pilot. 
I don't have any idea who ended up leaking that information, 
but it is quite possible that whoever did leak it could have en-
hanced the anti-aircraft readiness of the Libyan government. We

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
112 
might have lost that plane and that pilot because that information 
was leaked prematurely. 
It seems to me that we ought to have some concern for the 
people who are out there in the field protecting the security inter-
ests of the nation and who frankly could be jeopardized by some 
unforeseen event, an event we can't contemplate today, which does 
require a withholding of information from the Congress for longer 
than 48 hours. 
Mr. HAMILTON. Well, I think you need to be commended for your 
sensitivity to that. I hope I do not appear insensitive to the prob-
lem that you raise, because the problem of leaks can be a serious 
one. 
I want to check my recollection here, but my recollection is that 
the bombing in Libya was printed in the European newspapers a 
day or two before it occurred. I will check that. But that is my 
recollection of that particular instance. So I don't think it was any 
overwhelming surprise that that raid took place. 
But let's assume that the information is terribly sensitive. The 
premise really of your position is that the leadership of the Con-
gress is going to leak it, that the most respected members of our 
institution are going to leak that information. I just do not think 
that is the case. 
I would share your view if we were requiring the President to 
notify the Congress of the United States, but every member of this 
Intelligence Committee is selected with enormous care. I know that 
because I participated in the selection process, although it is obvi-
ously the Speaker's call. You do not put members onto this com-
mittee unless those members are respected and are thought by 
their peers to be able to keep silent. . 
What is true of the members of the Intelligence Committee is 
surely true of the leadership of this Congress. If we cannot trust 
the Speaker and the Minority Leader and the Gang of Eight, our 
institution is in grave peril. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Stokes? 
Mr. HAMILTON. May I make one comment, Mr. Chairman? 
Chairman McHuGH. Yes, please. 
Mr. HAMILTON. This respects the Gang of Eight. This is not rele-
vant to Mr. Livingston's question. But I noticed the Gang of Eight 
excludes the Majority Leader of the House. 
I just put that before you for your consideration. You identify the 
Speaker and the Minority Leader, the leaders of the Intelligence 
Committees, but I just wonder if you ought to exclude the Majority 
Leader of the House from the people who are notified. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you for that thought. We will cer-
tainly take that under consideration. 
Mr. Stokes? 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I just want to express my appreciation to Lee Hamilton for his 
appearance here this afternoon and his testimony on this bill. 
I had the pleasure of serving under his chairmanship on this full 
Intelligence Committee and under his distinguished chairmanship 
of the Iran-contra committee. It is indeed an honor to have him 
here this afternoon.

113 
I wonder if I might ask you to comment upon what I thought was 
some excellent testimony this morning from the Director of the 
CIA, Judge Webster. I thought he made two points which I think 
need to be given serious consideration. 
One point was, as he said in his testimony, "I have taken steps 
within the CIA to discipline those employees who failed to follow 
CIA procedures and meet the standards of conduct expected of CIA 
employees or who testified to Congress in a manner that was not 
candid or forthcoming." To his credit, he has done that, and he is 
to be commended for it. 
He also says in his testimony, "Similarly to the extent there 
were any procedural shortcomings demonstrated by the Iran-contra 
matter, they have already been addressed by the new Presidential 
directive within the present statutory framework." 
As you know, Lee, during the course of the Iran-contra hearings 
we ran across another NSDD that had been issued by the President 
relative to Presidential findings and notice to Congress which had 
been totally ignored by the President. 
I just wonder if you would comment on those two aspects of the 
Director's testimony? 
Mr. HAMILTON. Well, with respect to the discipline steps taken, I 
am not familiar with those in detail, but my impression is the 
same as yours. I think the Director should be Commended for the 
steps he has taken, and I know he has been responsive, in part at 
least, to the pleas of members of Congress. I would join you in your 
commendation of him. 
I also note, with regard to the second point, that he himself rec-
ognizes that the Presidential directive is not the same as legisla-
tion. He goes on to say that he is persuaded that new legislation is 
not the best way to address the concerns that members have. 
I think the fundamental difference here is a kind of a difference 
in time perspective. Members of Congress serve through several ad-
ministrations, sometimes many administrations, and we recognize 
that presidential directives, after all, do not get much publicity 
within the Congress. 
There are few members of Congress who know what is in a presi-
dential directive. We tend to know much more about legislation, 
and there is a permanence to the legislation that is important. 
You are dealing in this area with the fundamental national secu-
rity interests of the United States, and you are dealing with it not 
with respect to President Reagan but with respect to many presi-
dents to come. 
I think the features of the bill deserve to be stated in permanent 
legislation. 
Mr. STOKES. Let me ask you this. In light of our experience in 
terms of the Iran-contra investigation, the things we learned there, 
do you have an opinion as to whether or not we should write some 
prohibition into this legislation that the NSC should not have an 
operational role in covert actions? 
Mr. HAMILTON. I think the NSC should not have an operational 
role in covert actions and, as I understand it, the President has 
written that into a Presidential directive. I think he is to be com-
mended for that.

114 
I think I would feel more comfortable about it if it were written 
into law. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. Kastenmeier? 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I guess my recollection is a little bit different than that of my 
colleague, Mr. Livingston, about a couple of matters in which there 
was alleged to be notice and consultation, the Libyan attack and 
the Grenada invasion. 
It is my recollection that the leadership, certainly privately and 
perhaps publicly, complained that they were called in at the last 
minute when, as a matter of fact, the operations were underway; 
that in no way can one suggest that they were, pursuant to law, 
consulted. They were informed and probably not timely informed. 
Is that not your recollection? 
Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Kastenmeier, I am not certain about that. I 
think my recollection is that they were informed when the planes 
were in the air. That is when the actual notification was made at 
the White House. 
It seems to me that is what I recall. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. That is my recollection, as well. 
One witness this morning suggested that based on his long expe-
rience and based on the fact that we have been through this a 
couple of times, several times, one as late as 1980?I am referring 
to Mr. Clifford?he suggested that failure to observe the statutory 
restraints should be accompanied by a criminal penalty. Of course, 
that is not, as I understand it, in either the House or Senate legis-
lation pending before us, but I am wondering what your reaction to 
Mr. Clifford's suggestion is. 
Mr. HAMILTON. It is a new suggestion to me. I have not consid-
ered it. My initial reaction to it is not supportive. I don't think a 
violation would ordinarily rise to the level of a criminal sanction, if 
by criminal sanction you mean a felony, a prison sentence and all 
the rest. I don't think that would be necessary. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. In other words, is it your view that you think 
no sanction would be necessary? 
Mr. HAMILTON. I think what is necessary is a clear and precise 
statement of what the Congress of the United States expects the 
President to do in these situations and I think presidents will do it 
so long as it is clear. 
When you have a phrase like "timely notification", that obvious-
ly invites a difference of interpretation, an ambiguity. Before I 
would want to consider a step that I would consider to be quite se-
rious, the inclusion of criminal sanctions, I think the first step 
surely should be just a clear statement of what we think the re-
sponsibility of the President is. 
Incidentally, I think all of us here would agree that the Constitu-
tion would permit the Congress of the United States to prohibit 
these activities if we wanted to. We do not want to, but if the Con-
gress has the power to prohibit these activities, then surely we 
have the power to say that these activities may go on, but that the 
President must notify us.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
115 
That is much less of a requirement than prohibition. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Another suggestion that was parenthetically 
made by our colleague, Mr. Hyde, with which the witness agreed?
that is to say, Mr. Clifford?was that the Congress ought to think 
about terminating the present arrangement of two intelligence 
committees and go to a single joint committee with a very limited 
number of members. 
What is your reaction to that suggestion? 
Mr. HAMILTON. Well, the Select Committees considered that. It is 
a point there was some difference on. The majority recommenda-
tion was that we should not approve a joint committee. I agreed 
with that majority recommendation. 
I was reminded by some of my staff friends that I at one time 
had supported the idea of a joint committee. From time to time 
here, you change your mind on matters. I have come to the view 
that the lesson of Iran-contra and other events, too, I guess, is that 
the intelligence communities require a very rigorous oversight, and 
my suspicion is that many who favor a joint committee really favor 
less oversight, not more. 
I don't think that is true, may I say, of all who support the joint 
committee idea, but I think it is true of many. 
I believe that the independent evaluation by the two separate in-
telligence committees makes sense. 
There is another factor here, I think, that is important. That is 
the intelligence committees are extremely sensitive committees 
within the Congress. 
And you all know that Members of Congress look carefully to 
what you do and think about issues and there is a certain respect 
that builds up in the House for Members of the Intelligence Com-
mittees that I think is peculiar to the institution of the House and 
peculiar to the institution of the Senate, and if you combined them 
in a joint committee, I think you would have less respect than you 
may now have. 
So I do not approve of the idea of a joint committee. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHum'. Thank you, Mr. Kastenmeier. 
Are there any other questions? 
Thank you very much, Lee, for being with us and for your testi-
mony and especially for all the fine work you did as chairman of 
that select committee and as chairman of this permanent commit-
tee. 
Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

We are delighted to have you with us and we appreciate your 
testimony. 
Mr. Goodman. 
STATEMENT OF DR. ALLAN E. GOODMAN, ASSOCIATE DEAN, 
SCHOOL OF FOREIGN SERVICE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY 
Dr. GOODMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I do appreciate the chance to express my views and I have fo-
cused my statement which you have and would like to focus my re-
marks largely on the prior notice requirement of H.R. 3822. 
I think this legislation is very important. I think it strengthens 
congressional oversight. I think it incorporates further into intelli-
gence law the principle of checks and balances. I also think it is 
consistent with sound intelligence practices. 
Rather than read my statement, I think I will try to summarize 
by doing two things: One, refer to how I think the intelligence com-
munity is going to positively benefit from a prior notice require-
ment; and second, address two questions that I know from prior 
testimony are on your minds. 
One is, is this consistent with security; and the other is, will it 
inhibit foreign intelligence services from cooperating with the 
United States? 
? Let me begin with the first point in terms of how the intelligence 
community, I think, will positively benefit from the prior notice re-
quirement. 
I would like to make two points; the first by quoting a publica-
tion of the Central Intelligence Agency which is an extract from 
their in-house journal called "Studies in Intelligence" published 
this fall in commemoration of our Constitution. 
On pages 78 and 79, a top intelligence officer who has appeared 
many times at your committee, I think, writes, "Another benefit of 
congressional oversight is that it forces the CIA, an organization 
schooled in activities abroad, to confront the American political 
process. Many CIA managers are well informed about situations in 
other countries, but uninformed about the home front. Exposure of 
these managers to Congress not only forces them to learn how a 
closed intelligence agency fits into an open society, but also forces 
them to acquire skills and experience that make them better man-
agers. The result is development of a CIA cadre that appreciates 
from experience the role of Congress in the political system." 
It seems to me in perhaps no other facet of intelligence work is 
the need for the manager at Langley to be aware of and sensitive 
to our political process greater than in the area of covert action, 
and I think this bill furthers that goal, because covert action oper-
ations involve the CIA deeply and directly in something that intel-
ligence agencies rarely do, namely, the active promotion and sup-
port of American foreign policy. 
I think it is especially vital that those who propose and manage 
covert activity have access to the political experience and the inde-
pendent appraisal and wisdom of the members of the Intelligence 
Oversight Committees before these operations are launched. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
So I think the confrontation with Congress, the exposure to our 
political process, is a very positive political benefit and something 
which the CIA recognizes itself in this publication. 
Second, I think it is really important to look at the matter of 
prior notice from the perspective of an intelligence officer and from 
the perspective of those officers who may have to carry out a 
covert action. 
In previous testimony, I know several DCI's referred to the diffi-
culty they would have had in looking an agent in the eye and 
asking them to conduct a covert operation if they had to also tell 
that agent that the senior leadership of Congress was being in-
formed before the operation was launched. 
I think the next DCI is going to find a changed attitude among 
intelligence officers at Langley, and I think it is the direct result of 
the Iran-contra affair. 
The intelligence officer today, and especially tomorrow, who may 
have to carry out a covert operation is going to want to know two 
things: First, that the operation can be kept secure, and I will come 
to that when I address whether or not prior notice is consistent 
with security. But the other thing he will want to know is that 
Congress has been duly and properly informed and that he is going 
to undertake an activity that is fully consistent with U.S. laws. 
Because not to have that kind of assurance results as it did in 
the Iran-contra affair in ruined careers, recriminations, low 
morale, and ultimately the exposure of a covert operation through 
the investigation and hearing process. 
So it seems to me that from the perspective of a professional in-
telligence officer they would want to know that Congress has been 
informed, that it is a lesson they are going to draw from the Iran-
contra affair and something that a DCI in the future owes them 
just as much as they owe secrecy and security. 
I know two questions are much on your minds: Is prior notice 
consistent with security? 
The answer to that question, in my mind, is yes, partly because 
we have had good experience with it. 
As the CIA General Counsel testified before you in June of 1987, 
prior notice has been the norm, and I can only find three instances 
between the Carter and the Reagan Administrations when prior 
notice has been withheld. 
So it would seem to me that the oversight process with respect to 
voluntary prior notice is working well from the point of view of se-
curity. 
It also occurs to me because we have to think about unforeseen 
circumstances that what we have going for us today which we 
didn't have a few years ago is the new Crisis Management Commu-
nications Center in the White House, something created by Mr. 
Meese and Judge Clark a few years ago and it has been substan-
tially upgraded. 
This Crisis Management Center, I think, provides the secure 
communication facilities that would make it possible to inform at 
least the senior membership of Congress, if not the appropriate 
members of the Oversight Committee of a covert operation before 
it is launched, no matter how serious the crisis, how precious the 
time, how dire the emergency.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1118 
I think the capability in the facility is here now and it might not 
have been here a few years ago, and I think it is something that 
would facilitate briefing the appropriate senior Members of Con-
gress without risking the disclosure of a covert action operation 
before it was launched. 
The second issue I know of concern is the question of whether 
having a requirement for prior notice would inhibit foreign intelli-
gence services from cooperating with the United States. 
This is a very sensitive area, but I think you have to look at the 
record of the Casey administration, because my answer is no, I 
don't think it will inhibit the kind of cooperation we need from for-
eign intelligence services. 
The late Mr. Casey made it a high priority to increase foreign 
intelligence cooperation, particularly in the area of counterterror-
ism and narcotic interdiction with foreign intelligence services. 
From statements he made about this priority and the success he 
had with it, I think he did succeed. He did so at a time, of course, 
when prior notice had been given to Congress of virtually all covert 
operations and it seems to me that the decision about whether or 
not a foreign intelligence service cooperates with us or vice versa is 
based much more on considerations of what is in it for us or them 
than it is on whether or not their parliament or our Congress has 
intrusive oversight of covert action in intelligence operations. 
So it seems to me that intelligence cooperation is going to contin-
ue whether or not this provision is enacted into law, and enacting 
a prior notice requirement, I don't think, will have a chilling effect 
on this important area of intelligence, namely the cooperation be-
tween the United States and foreign intelligence services. 
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I think that the H.R. 3822 makes 
good sense and I also think it sends, if passed, a very important 
signal that we have put the Iran-contra affair behind us; we have 
learned appropriate lessons from it, and we have applied them in a 
way that won't cripple the, effectiveness of American intelligence in 
the future. 
Thank you very much. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much for a good summary.

'STATEMENT BY 
Dr. Allan E. Goodman 
Associate Dean, School of Foreign Service 
Georgetown University 
HOuse Permanent Select Committee On Intelligence 
Hearing on H.R. 3822 
24 February 1988 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your invitation to express my 
views on H.R.3822. The focus of my statement will be on that 
part of the bill which requires the president to assure that 
the intelligence oversight committees of Congress are fully 
informed about covert action operations before they are 
initiated. 
Covert action is a very small part of what the 
intelligence community does, but has repeatedly gotten the 
CIA into enough trouble with Congress to warrant this change 
in the law. As the CIA's own in-house journal, STUDIES IN 
INTELLIGENCE, recently concluded: "When an administration 
resorts frequently to covert action, credibility problems are 
exacerbated, and CIA pays a high price." It has certainly 
done so in the wake of the Iran/Contra affair, where covert 
action was used to carry out operations directly contrary to 
stated U.S. foreign policy positions and in a manner that 
violated basic tenets of the intelligence profession. 
But unless or until the president finds that covert 
action is no longer in the nation's interest, I think it is 
vital that its use be regulated by our laws and that the

cburse of action it represents be wisely chosen. The 
requirement of H.R. 3822 for prior notice would at least 
assure that these operations are legal and that they are 
credible to more than the strong personalities who make 
national 
security policy in the White House. 
incorporate the principle of checks and balances 
cornerstones of our constitutional system-- into 
law. 
And it would 
--one of the 
intelligence 
Moreover, given the necessity for effective oversight of 
covert action, the prior notice requirement is essential to 
allowing Congress to perform its proper function. H.R. 3822 
is, thus, a major step both toward improving congressional 
oversight and one that is consistent with sound intelligence 
practices. 
As previous testimony before this committee and before 
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (on S. 1721) has 
established, such prior notice has been given to the Congress 
for nearly every covert action authorized by presidents 
Carter and Reagan. Prior notice thus does not appear to have 
been an encroachment on the president's power to conduct 
foreign policy. In reviewing the testimony previously given 
to this committee, I was struck by the fact that while prior 
notice of covert action has been the norm for at least a 
decade (according to the CIA's general counsel), it has not 
had a chilling effect on the Reagan administration's vigorous 
resort to this instrument of foreign policy. In fact, the

number of covert action operations increased in the Reagan 
administration some five times compared to the record of the 
Carter administration. 
Nevertheless, the administration's spokesmen have 
opposed H.R. 3822 (and its companion bill in the Senate) on 
grounds that to require prior notice in all instances would 
compromise security, would be logistically difficult to 
implement in crisis situations, an would weaken the 
credibility and effectiveness of the intelligence community. 
The experience to date suggests that when prior, notice 
has been given, the Congress has kept the operation secret. 
While details of many covert actions have eventually been 
revealed, this has not occurred as a result of the DCI 
providing the oversight committees or congressional leaders 
with prior notice. Moreover, the operations run as covert 
actions where such notice was withheld -- the aborted rescue 
of American hostages in Iran in 1979 (when a considerably 
larger number of representatives and senators had to be 
informed of covert actions than is the case today), the 
Iran arms-for-hostages initiative undertaken by the NSC staff 
in 1985-1986, and the Contra re-supply effort -- have 
resulted in far more damage to the credibility of the United 
States and the effectiveness of the intelligence community 
than would have been the case had Congress been properly 
informed. And clearly in the case of the Iran arms 
initiative, the oversight committees would have been more

reliable in keeping the details of the operation secure than 
foreign privateers and Iranian mullahs._ 
Another frequently-made argument against the prior 
notice requirement is that unforseen circumstances in a 
crisis may make it impossible for even a handful of senior 
Congressional leaders to be briefed before an operation had 
to be launched. I do not find this argument compelling in 
light of the secure communication capabilities that the White 
House now has as a result of the creation of its crisis 
management center. Even in the most dire of circumstances, 
this facility makes it possible to contact at least some 
congressional leaders immediately and to brief them on the 
operation without risking disclosure. 
Nor does the practice of giving the congressional 
oversight committees prior notice of covert action appear to 
have had a chilling effect on the cooperation of foreign 
intelligence services with the CIA. I infer this from the 
statements made by the late William Casey (at conferences 
sponsored by SRI International and the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy in 1985), indicating that such cooperation had 
been increasing during his tenure as DCI, especially in the 
areas of counter terrorism and narcotics interdiction. In 
any case, the principal motives for foreign intelligence 
services to cooperate with United States agencies have been 
traditional friendships and affinities, as well as 
hard-headed appraisals of what they were likely to gain from

123 
such intelligence sharing. These considerations appear to 
have far outweighed concerns with the ability of either the 
U.S. or allied intelligence services to keep secrets or limit 
parliamentary oversight. For example, the relationship the 
U.S. has maintained over the years with British intelligence 
continues despite the fact that the British services have 
been repeatedly penetrated by the KGB and the CIA has, 
according to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence 
(writing in the winter issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS), become "the 
most visible, most externally scrutinized and most publicized 
intelligence service in the world." 
Instituting a prior notice requirement now would benefit 
the intelligence community in two important ways. First, as 
a top intelligence officer recently noted in the CIA's 
in-house journal, STUDIES IN INTELLIGENCE, "congressional 
oversight...forces the CIA...to confront the American 
political process. Many CIA managers are well informed about 
situations in other countries, but uninformed about the home 
front. The exposure of these managers to Congress not only 
forces them to learn how a closed intelligence agency fits 
into an open society, but also forces them to acquire skills 
and experience that make them better managers." In perhaps 
no other facet of intelligence work is the need for the 
manager to be aware of and sensitive to the American 
political process greater than in the area of covert action. 
Because covert action operations involve the CIA directly 
5

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

124 . 
in active measures to support U.S. foreign policy, it is 
vitally important that those who propose and manage them have 
access to the political experience and independent appraisals 
of the members of :the intelligence oversight committees 
before such operations are launched. 
Second, I think it is important to look at the matter of 
prior notice from the perspective of an intelligence officer, 
who may have to carry out a covert action. In previous 
testimony, several former DCI's have referred to the 
difficulty they would have had in asking their agents to 
undertake a covert action mission if it had to be reported to 
Congress before it was underway. To do so, they argue, would 
increase the probability that details of the operation would 
be revealed and that the agent's life would be put at even 
greater risk. But the Iran/Contra affair, especially, has 
changed the outlook of many intelligence officers. Today, an 
operative would want to be assured both of secrecy and of the 
fact that the Congress was given the appropriate prior notice 
of the covert action they were about to Undertake in order to 
avoid charges of impropriety later, charges which might well 
result in the hearings and public exposure that ruins careers 
and damages the credibility of the U.S. intelligence 
community. 
In short, Mr. Chairman, prior notice makes good sense 
for both the intelligence community and the oversight 
process. Swift passage of H.R. 3822 would be an important

Chairman McHuGH. I think it is interesting at least to me that 
you 'have taken a different perspective on the attitude of "intelli-
gence agents than we have heard before from other witnesses. 
As' you have Said, your former superior at the CIA testified that 
he would be reluctant to tell an agent who was going out on a sen-
sitive mission that he had to share that information with Members 
of Congress. 
Your experience here is relevant because you take a different 
tack, which is that agent might well appreciate knowing that at 
least the leadership in Congress is advised and, therefore, is not 
likely to raise objections later if the operation becomes public. 
Perhaps in that context you could tell us a little bit more about 
your contacts with intelligence agents and the agency. 
I know you have worked in the agency, but you have continued, I 
think, to take an interest in these issues. 
Perhaps you can expand a bit on your background and what 
leads you to believe beyond your own instinct that agents of the 
CIA or other agencies would feel this way. 
Dr. GOODMAN. Let me point out, first, with respect to Admiral 
Turner's testimony that he did qualify it by saying that the time 
he withheld prior notice, the rescue mission for hostages in Iran, 
notice was given to a much larger number of Congressmen and 
Senators than it is today. 
I don't know if he would feel with a smaller number more 
secure, but I think that was a difference. 
Another interesting point that the publication makes is that two-
thirds of the people working at Langley these days have grown up 
under a system of strong congressional oversight. I think that they 
respect it. I think that they do feel that Congress has an important 
role to play in something that no other country has ever done, had 
a secret intelligence service in an open society subject to rule of 
law and subject to congressional oversight. 
I think the younger people at Langley understand this, appreci-
ate it, and see the need for it because they see the negative conse-
quences. 
They see that failures to comply with law or failure to provide 
Congress notice create problems for them, for public confidence 
when these fundamental principles are not followed, so I think you 
will increasingly be working with the CIA personnel system that is 
producing people who respect oversight and appreciate the need for 
it most importantly in the operations area because the last thing 
an operations officer wants is to conduct an operation that is going 
to end up on national television all through the summer being in-
vestigated because it is illegal, improper, or because there was not 
prior notice. They want to be protected in that regard. 
Chairman McHuGH. I would like to ask your views on two issues, 
first with respect to the notice requirement. Where the President 
believes it is a particularly sensitive operation, he may choose in 
his discretion to notify the so-called "Gang of 8." The Senate bill 
has a provision which would reduce that number to four. 
Do you have any views on whether it should be eight or four, and 
if so, why? And secondly, the issue which Mr. Kastenmeier raised 
earlier with Mr. Hamilton, with regard to a Joint Intelligence Corn-
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 127 
mittee compared to the two separate committees we have today, 
which would be better in terms of oversight? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I strongly favor notice to the Gang of 8, or every 
conceivable human effort made to create that notice, because I 
think on particularly risky, sensitive, time-sensitive operations, the 
President and the DCI need the independent appraisal and to make 
sure that these stand the test of your scrutiny which you are going 
to have to give judgment on, either in your annual report or later 
on. 
So, I support your version of the bill and think you should aim at 
eight. If someone is out of the country and totally unreachable, if 
you have eight and can only reach six, I think you have gone closer 
to the spirit of the law than if you have four and can only reach 
two. 
The principle of prior notice is so important, because the DCI 
gets the benefits of the checks and balances system. I favor a joint 
committee, but until Congressman Hamilton spoke, I didn't realize 
that many support it because it would weaken intelligence over-
sight. 
I don't think that should happen, but to the extent that a joint 
committee would create greater security so that people at Langley 
and elsewhere would feel that they could share more with this 
committee, that it would create the kind of staff and time that you 
might need to go into more detail on things that are appropriate, 
those are some of the positive benefits. 
I think the present system has worked very well, both oversight 
committees do different things, their annual reports and investiga-
tions are quite different, and I think we benefit a lot from that as 
well. 
Chairman McHum'. Thank you. 
Mr. Livingston? 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I want to commend you on your lucid testi-
mony. You have given us a lot to think about. Let's explore a 
couple of your points. 
You said that probably most foreign countries would not be in-
hibited because we involve Congress in the decision-making process 
whether or not to engage in covert actions, yet Canada specifically 
said as a requirement for their housing those individuals, they 
didn't want any word sent to Congress. 
What makes you think that won't happen again and again and 
again where some countries are going to not only hesitate to act in 
the best security interests of the U.S., but even perhaps fail to act 
to save lives of Americans unless under the conditions that the 
President not inform the Congress? 
Dr. GOODMAN. With respect to the Canadian case, I think you are 
referring to the rescue of the hostages when a much larger number 
of Congressmen and Senators had to be informed, when this over-
sight process was much newer, when there was a fear than Con-
gress was going to be the great source of leaks rather than the Ex-
ecutive--
Mr. LIVINGSTON. You think that is not a fear anymore? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I don't think so. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. As a matter of record, we have had one incident 
involving a member of the other body who is currently under some 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

ILO 
degree of investigation for statements of confidential material, 
secret material, and that does go on. We have had Members who 
have admitted publicly or who have been investigated. 
What makes you think that is any less likely today than it has 
been in the past? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I think in the area of covert action, pending the 
investigation that you are referring to, there has been no leak from 
Congress. In all my experience dealing with you in the Carter Ad-
ministration and outside observing it since, there is no question in 
my mind that the Congress takes this as a very serious, very risky 
operation. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Certainly the Congress as a whole does, but 
questioning your attitude that eight Members are better than two, 
isn't it a fact in intelligence circles that any one extra person can 
be a security threat to an operation? 
Dr. GOODMAN. Yes, it is. 
Mr. LiviNGsToN. We are politicians and given to working with 
our mouths, and isn't it human for good politicians to talk about 
things, and isn't it a possible risk to human life and safety and to 
the security interests of the United States by involving any more 
Members of Congress in the decision-making process on covert ac-
tivities than is absolutely necessary? 
Dr. GOODMAN. Yes, sir, but the question is, what is necessary, 
and it seems to me in our system it is necessary to have them in-
formed before these are launched. We are dealing with a situation 
where the record of Congress is excellent. We don't have a record 
of lots and lots of leaks and lots of compromises of covert oper-
ations. 
I think the risks on the other side are greater. We are in worse 
shape if we haven't consulted you and then end up on national tel-
evision. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I am not going to argue that there haven't been 
mistakes made. But your initial point that operational security and 
the full informing process, bringing Congress into the loop, are 
compatible is questionable to me, and I am concerned about the ri-
gidity, excluding any possibility that not informing Congress so 
soon might be a lot safer and a lot wiser in the long run in certain 
isolated circumstances. 
But we are excluding that with this legislation, and you don't 
seem to worry about that. 
Dr. GOODMAN. I knew you were going to ask me that question, 
and I have been thinking about it ever since you asked Congress-
man Hamilton. I can't foresee those circumstances except in the 
case of a declared war, and that is where covert action began in 
our country. We didn't have covert action all the time. We never 
had it in peacetime until 1947, when it was created by the Act. 
In wartime, it seems to me the Congress gives the President 
through emergency powers the latitude, and the only circum-
stances that I could see where time and risk and security might 
make it impossible might be covered by a wartime situation in 
which you would pass special legislation. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. In fact, isn't it true that properly secure covert 
activity might avoid the probability of war? That is what covert ac-

? tivity is about in many instances, is keeping us from going to 
armed conflict. 
Dr. GOODMAN. I think we owe it to you and to the political proc-
ess to make sure that you are informed that we are about to do 
that, and have you prepared that if this operation fails, we are 
moving close to war. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Were you here for the Director's testimony this 
morning? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I was not. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I would like you to get a copy of his testimony 
and respond to other points other than the notice issue that was 
raised by him, if you could comment on those, because he has indi-
cated that there are grave concerns in addition to the notification 
that we ought to take into consideration, and the fear is that Con-
gress may well be into the micromanagement of the activities of 
the CIA, and we really don't need to be. 
Look at it, and we would love to have your letter on it. 
Dr. GOODMAN. I will do so. 
Chairman McHuGH. Let me state for the record for Mr. Living-
ston's benefit that our staffs have been working closely with the in-
telligence agency staffs on these points which the Director raised 
this morning. 
It is my impression that there is not real substantive disagree-
ment between the Agency and the drafters of the bill and that 
these language questions, which are legitimate questions, can be 
worked out between our staff and the Agency staff. ? 
So, I think the really fundamental difference in principle does go 
to the heart of this notice issue, and the other issues, while perfect-
ly legitimate to address, are being worked out between the staffs. 
Mr. Stokes? 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Dr. Goodman, we thank you for an excellent statement. I was in-
terested in your comments with reference to the CIA in-house jour-
nal, and I think one of the ironic things about the Iran-contra 
hearing is that the CIA got painted with a very broad brush. 
As you know, under ordinary circumstances, covert action is au-
thorized by law to be carried out by the CIA. CIA got brushed here 
for something that the Agency as such did not do. We know from 
the Iran-contra hearings that Director Casey was involved with 
Poindexter and North, but the Agency as an agency was circum-
vented here, and this operation was carried out by the NSC, which 
is not authorized by law to carry out covert actions. 
So, I would suppose that men who are involved in their business 
and who take pride in the fact that, notwithstanding some of the 
adverse publicity the Agency gets, they are professionals, dedicated 
to their country and performing their jobs professionally, would 
possess a great deal of a situation, wouldn't you? 
Dr. GOODMAN. Yes, sir, I do. In fact, in the article I quoted earli-
er, in it there is another statement from a CIA officer that said 
when Administrations frequently resort to covert action, the CIA 
pays a very high price, and I think we have witnessed this, wheth-
er or not it conducted the operation or whether or not it was cir-
cumvented.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1-30 
As you know from my statement and prior writings, I have 
major reservations about using this instrument of foreign policy. 
Mr. STOKES. The other thing I would like you to comment on is 
this argument about a third country saying to the United States, 
"Because of the possible risk to life, that we won't cooperate unless 
you agree that you will not tell other officials." 
That, to me, is really very offensive, particularly as one who sat 
in as a member of the Iran-Contra Committee, and listened to how 
Iranians knew all about this operation, here are foreign govern-
ment officials and persons not even officials of that government, 
the so-called moderates who had all of this information, but our 
government said, we can't trust the Speaker of the House and the 
Majority or Minority Leader of the House or the leaders of the 
Senate, but yet they were trusting foreign officials who have no re-
lationship to this government whatsoever, and Members of Con-
gress, elected representatives of the people, could not be provided 
this kind of information. 
It just seems to me that by any adherence to this argument we 
allow ourselves to get into a situation that is totally contemptuous. 
Would you aggree? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I agree, and I think any professional intelligence 
officer would want to be absolutely certain that Congress was in-
formed of what they were doing. In this situation, I do think it was 
ludicrous that they would withhold information from Congress and 
give it to Iranians and foreign privateers rather than the elected 
representatives of our people. 
I think most foreign intelligence services probably understand 
and know that we have an oversight system, know that it is getting 
stronger, and know that it is irreversible and are prepared to work 
with it. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Kastenmeier. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I would like to compliment Dr. Goodman for his presentation. I 
have very little to ask him. We, of course, constantly get the sug-
gestion that there is a danger in informing the Congress, that we 
put certain persons at peril, but that seems to be just one side of 
the coin. 
The other side of the coin is that if an Administration scrupu-
lously acknowledges the law and abides by it in terms of carrying 
it out and indeed does solicit the views of the Congress, that in 
some cases it may not enter a covert action which, if they had en-
tered it, would have been dangerous for personnel indeed. 
I think sometimes this is overlooked in this argument, the other 
side of it. I surely do not want to revisit the rescue mission argu-
ment with respect to Iran, but the irony is that the Congress was 
not informed, maybe for good reason, but the fact is that it turned 
out disastrously anyway. 
Lives were lost, it had nothing to do with the fact that the Con-
gress was informed; in fact it was not, and indeed the hostages all 
did return home safely. So, I think the question of putting people 
at risk cuts both ways, and the balancing of objectives in terms of 
public policy suggests that you recommend here in terms of sup-
port of the bill.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 131 
That is my only observation. If you care to comment--
Dr. GOODMAN. I do. I think that any DCI would want to think 
very carefully about using covert action, and part of the thinking 
very carefully is consultation of the Congress. This might result in 
fewer covert operations, and that might be a healthy thing. 
It also might prepare us for the risk that one of them fails, but I 
think in future, that is something we ought to leave, as Congress-
man Hamilton said, unambiguous. That ought to be part of the 
way we do our business, and I think this law makes it so. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman McHuGH. Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Just to answer your last question and some-
thing you wrote, an article called "Reforming U.S. Intelligence," 
published last year, it leads me to believe that you are not only 
just in favor of restricting covert activity as this bill would do, but 
you would like to see it abolished altogether, wouldn't you? 
Dr. GOODMAN. Yes, sir. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Don't you foresee any opportunities for covert 
action that might enhance the security of the Nation or protect the 
citizens of this country? 
Dr. GOODMAN. In that article I mentioned the many dimensions 
of covert action, black propaganda, support of political parties cov-
ertly abroad, that most of those activities could be better accom-
plished either openly through institutions that the Congress and 
State Department have created, like the National Endowment for 
Democracy. 
I did say that in the paramilitary area particularly with respect 
to the rescue of hostages, there probably was a role for covert 
action operations, but I thought it was better placed in the Depart-
ment of Defense than in the CIA, because the latter really has 
been long since out of the business of training, fielding armies and 
having experience with them. 
But I do believe in general it is a very risky and very unwise 
option, and I would urge any future President not to use it, and 
would prefer that we didn't have it. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. You don't deny that the Soviet Union and the 
communist bloc countries engage in covert action on a regular 
basis, do you? 
Dr. GOODMAN. No, and I think a great deal of it falls flat on their 
faces, particularly their propaganda and active measures cam-
paigns, which are revealed almost all the time. But because they 
have it doesn't mean we ought to have it. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. You see no benefit at all in our using covert ac-
tivity to combat that, then? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I see very little benefit. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. If it were up to you, you would be here advocat-
ing the abolition of covert activity rather than simple restriction of 
it? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I think so, but first, I advocate prior notice. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Congressman Hyde asked of Clark Clifford earli-
er this morning about an incident involving post-war Italy. We en-
gaged in a covert activity which ultimately led to keeping Italy in 
the Western bloc as opposed to losing it to the Eastern bloc. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1,32 
Even Mr. Clifford, who does not like covert activity, said that 
was outstanding. 
Dr. GOODMAN. I agree. I think a lot of the covert activity that we 
engaged in between 1947 and 1955 was effective, was secret and 
was kept secret, and served our interests very well, but I think that 
the world has changed. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. It has, and I would venture to say that the Ex-
ecutive Branch didn't labor under anywhere near the amount of 
second-guessing and restrictions that the Executive Branch now 
suffers under, and you want to intensify it. You want to increase 
those restrictions. 
So, in effect, you would say bye-bye Italy. 
Dr. GOODMAN. Two points?I am not increasing it all that much 
from what it is at present, because all but three covert actions 
have been given prior notice to Congress in the past 10 years in 
both Administrations, and we are talking about a number much 
larger than three that have been given prior notice. 
The Italian operation is a good case in point. We could do it se-
cretly then and we were able to keep it secret then, but we could 
have done it then as now just as effectively through the National 
Endowment for Democracy, through a chartered organization of 
Congress that most other countries do the same thing with. The 
German political party institutes do the same kind of thing today. 
So I think it could have been done equally well. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Don't you agree we kept it secret because we 
didn't have all that oversight and all the Congressional interfer-
ence in the operation? 
Dr. GOODMAN. I don't. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. 
Chairman McHuGH. Thank you very much for your testimony 
here today. We appreciate it, particularly given your background 
in the field, and you have given us material which I think will be 
very helpful to us during our deliberations. 
We have one more committee hearing scheduled for March 10, 
and hopefully, speaking for myself as chairman, after the conclu-
sion of that public hearing, we will proceed to consider the bill in 
committee. 
The hearing is now adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 3:30 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Washington, DC. 
The subcommittee met at 1:30 p.m. in room 2203 of the Rayburn 
House Office Building, Hon. Matthew F. McHugh, chairman of the 
subcommittee, presiding. 
Present: Representatives McHugh, Stokes, Kastenmeier, Living-
ston, and Shuster. 
Full committee members present: Representatives Beilenson, 
Hyde, and McEwen. 
Staff present: Thomas K. Latimer, committee staff director, Mi-
chael J. O'Neil, committee chief counsel, Thomas R. Smeeton, com-
mittee associate counsel, Bernard Raimo, Jr., subcommittee coun-
sel, Stephen D. Nelson, subcommittee counsel, Diane S. Dornan, 
professional staff, Jeanne M. McNally, clerk,_Karen W. Schindler, 
secretary, and Merritt R. Clark, chief, registry/security. 
Mr. McHum.' [presiding]. The subcommittee will please come to 
order. This is the fifth and final day of the hearings on legislation 
to amend the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980. More specifically, 
the Subcommittee is considering H.R. 3822, a bill introduced by 
Chairman Stokes, Congressman Boland and me. It incorporates 
many of the recommendations of the Special House and Senate 
Committees that investigated the Iran-Contra Affair and is sub-
stantially similar to a bill reported favorably by the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee, S. 1721. 
The provisions of H.R. 3822 have been described and debated at 
some length at our prior hearings. Suffice it to say that the center-
piece of the legislation is a requirement that the President notify 
the Intelligence Committees of any covert operation he has author-
ized prior to its implementation. 
In extraordinary circumstances, the President may limit such 
prior notice to a small group of eight in the leadership. 
And when the President believes that time is of the essence, he 
may dispense with notice to anyone in Congress for up to 48 hours 
after the covert action has begun. 
There are other provisions in the legislation, but the heart of the 
debate is whether the President's discretion to withold notice to 
Congress should be limited in any way.

Under current law, the President is generally required to give 
prior notice to the Committee, or to the leadership group of eight. 
But he may withhold notice at his discretion, in which case he is 
obligated to provide it to the committee "in a timely fashion." 
In the case of the arms sales to Iran, the President construed 
current law as permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10 
months after the covert sales had been authorized, an interpreta-
tion which is totally unacceptable if congressional oversight is to 
have any meaning. This is not a hypothetical case. 
The President signed his finding authorizing arms transfers to 
Iran in January of 1986. The first arms delivery had actually been 
made some months beforehand. In any case, the President did not 
provide anyone in Congress with notice of these transfers before he 
made them. 
If he had done so, as the law generally requires, he would surely 
have heard some strong objections and might have spared the 
country a serious foreign policy setback and himself a major politi-
cal embarrassment. 
Not only did the President withhold prior notice of this covert 
action, he never informed Congress of the arms transfers to Iran at 
all. Although Iranian officials, arms merchants and others knew 
about them, the elected Representatives of the American people 
were never told. 
We learned of this policy only because a publication in the 
Middle East reported the information. We've indicated previously, 
and I would like to reemphasize, that our purpose here is not to 
dwell on past mistakes, or engage in criticism of the Iran arms case 
for the sake of any partisan purpose. 
But I don't think any Member of Congress with any interest in 
meaningful oversight of covert activities can accept the situation as 
it presently exists. 
While the Administration witnesses have admitted that the cir-
cumstances in the Iran case deprived Congress of timely notice, 
and while they pledge to do better in the future?and we appreci-
ate that, the Justice Department has taken the position in these 
hearings and in the Senate that the President was wholly within 
his legal authority to withhold notice from Congress, as he did in 
the Iran arms case. 
This is an interpretation of law which we simply can't accept, 
and that's why we've introduced H.R. 3822. 
This afternoon, we have a number of very distinguished wit-
nesses who will comment on the legislation, as well as on the gen-
eral issue itself, including our old friend, the Secretary of Defense, 
Frank Carlucci. 
Before calling upon you, Mr. Secretary, however, I'd like to 
invite Mr. Livingston and Mr. Stokes to make any opening remarks 
they may have. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I'm firmly convinced that H.R. 3822 is an unnecessary and poten-
tially harmful piece of legislation. To this point, the committee has 
had the benefit of a great deal of testimony on both?sides _of the 
issue, but one of the things which struck me with the greatest force

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 135 
is the practical difficulties this bill would cause for our covert ac-
tivities, which comprise a small but important part of our intelli-
gence activities. 
There are also some very serious constitutional concerns that a 
number of witnesses have brought to our attention as well. 
Former intelligence officials in both Democratic and Republican 
Administrations have told the committee that the Iran-Contra 
Affair was an aberration, that the failure was in the people run-
ning the program rather than the process itself. 
They pointed out that the 48-hour notice period could potentially ? 
increase the danger to the lives of foreign operatives and would 
have a chilling effect on the cooperation that we have come to 
expect from our allies. 
I believe that covert operations are an important part of our 
effort to protect the national security interests of the United 
States. It's clear to me that the majority of the witnesses that sup-
port this legislation do not believe that we should be engaging in 
covert activities at all. 
If we pass this legislation as it stands, their wish could come 
true. Our allies would become increasingly reluctant to cooperate 
with us if they felt that the information would be broadcast to too 
many people, and future administrations would think twice about 
engaging in any covert activity unless they felt that there is a con-
census among all members that must be notified. 
That's a bad way to do business. As I said, I'm very concerned 
about the practical difficulties that H.R. 3822 will cause. But there 
are also major concerns about the constitutional impact of this leg-
islation. 
Scholars and, for that matter, officials of both branches argue 
about the constitutional prerogatives of the executive and the legis-
lative branches. But this bill's rigid procedural constraints and mi-
cromanagerial rules in the guise of oversight create conditions of 
permanent constitutional conflict that will be harmful to the spirit 
of cooperation that must exist between future administrations and 
Congress. 
I believe it is a serious mistake to build into the statutory struc-
ture of executive/legislative branch relations a permanent invita-
tion to discord. 
We need to think whether in our zeal to extend the bounds of 
congressional oversight what we are actually doing is harming our 
national security interests. 
The original drafters of this law recognized that there were le-
gitimate interests of both the executive and the legislative 
branches that needed to be protected. 
They realized that the cooperation between the branches was 
necessary in order to have both effective oversight and a useful in-
telligence program. 
So they did not try to overregulate the intelligence functions of 
the administration. In effect, they opted for pragmatic ambiguity 
instead of statutory micromanagement. 
There is no doubt that the administration was less than coopera-
tive in this regard during the Iran-Contra Affairs, but it has also 
made a major effort to install corrective procedures.

We should allow enough time to see if the new rules will work. 
At this point, I see no reason to inflict a statutory formula for con-
stitutional conflict between the branches.

ment which we would like to incorporate in the record at this 
point.

Hearings on H. R. 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act 1987 
Before the Subcommittee on Legislation 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
House of Representatives 
Prepared Statement 
of 
Eugene V. Rostow* 
March 10, 1988 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your invitation to testify on the constitutionality 
of H.R. 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1987. The Bill would require the 
President to ensure that the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives 
are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United 
States, including any significant anticipated intelligence activities. 
The term "intelligence" is not defined by the Bill, except by indirection in 
Section 503 (e), which distinguishes the "special activities" of the Central 
Intelligence Agency from its operations in foreign countries intended solely for 
obtaining necessary intelligence. For other departments and agencies of the 
United States, "special" activities are defined as activities conducted in support of 
national foreign policy objectives abroad which are planned and executed so that 
the role of the United States government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly, 
and does not include activities to collect necessary intelligence, or diplomatic 
activities carried out by officers of the Department of State or other persons

representing the President. Section 503 (e) also covers foreign countries or private 
citizens requested by United States officials to conduct a "special activity" on behalf of 
the United States. In short, the "special" activities covered by Section 503 (e) seem to 
be "covert" or deniable operations initiated or conducted secretly by our government in 
order to influence the policy of foreign governments. As section 501 (f) makes clear, 
however, the Bill is not confined to so-called "special" intelligence activities defined in 
Section 503 (e), but encompasses a vast and uncharted range of activities undertaken in 
support of the foreign policy of the United States by civilian officials and military 
officers under the direction of the President. It is impossible to tell how far the Bill 
could be interpreted to reach into the activities of the government outside the 
intelligence community. In my experience, intelligence routinely flows into the 
government from many sources, public and private, and many routine secret or 
confidential diplomatic negotiations would seem to fit the definition of "special" 
activities in the Bill. 
I attach two articles as a fuller exposition of the legal theory from which the 
conclusions of this statement,are drawn. 
In my opinion, H. R. 3822 is unconstitutional for four related reasons: 
1. The Bill would require the President to disclose information which 
Congress can request but not command the President to provide; 
2. In fact, the Bill does more than require information: it seeks to 
establish a procedure of compulsory consultation between the President 
and two designated committees of Congress. This goal is beyond the 
legislative powers of Congress; 
3. De facto, the Bill would give the two intelligence committees of 
Congress, or one acting alone, an unconstitutional legislative veto over 
a wide and undefined class of Presidential decisions in the field of 
intelligence; and 
4. The procedures mandated by the Bill would largely remove the 
Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence entities in the 
executive Branch from the control of the President with respect to 
many of their functions, and place them under the direct control of 
Congress Instead.

1. 
The first reason why the Bill is unconstitutional is that it would command the 
President to provide two Congressional Committees with information dealing with 
extremely sensitive areas of his responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations and 
for limited military and quasi-military operations in self-defense. Section 501 (a) 
properly recognizes that the power to decide whether such operations should be 
undertaken and how they should be carried out is entrusted to the President by the 
Constitution. 
As judicial opinions and constitutional practice since the Presidency of George 
Washington attest, Congress does not have the power to compel such disclosures of 
information. In Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall declared that "the secrets 
of the cabinet" were beyond judicial scrutiny, and "executive privilege" has been 
recognized both in the Courts and in Congress ever since. The Bill therefore violates 
the principle of the separation of powers, by crossing the boundary between the 
legislative and the executive departments of our tripartite government. The balance 
among conflicting Constitutional policies is of course different where the information is 
sought by the accused in a criminal proceeding, but there are limits to even these. For 
example, Thomas Jefferson did not comply fully with judicial demands in the trial of 
Aaron Burr. 
It cannot be recalled too often that ours is not a Parliamentary system, and that 
the President is not a Prime Minister. Chief Justice Marshall said in 
Marbury v. Madison, that ",b.y the Constitution of the United States, the President is 
3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 [Co 
character, and to his own conscience." As Marburtv. Madison itself demonstrates, 
the principle does not mean that the President is ever above the law, or that 
appropriate means for assuring democratic responsibility are not available and 
should not be used. It does mean, however, that the means chosen for the purpose 
in H. R. 3822 are inappropriate and unconstitutional. 
When Congress seeks information from the President, it should follow nearly 
invariable precedent by "requesting" the information "only insofar as the 
transmission of it, "in the President's judgment," is compatible with the public 
interest," to recall the language used by Senator Spooner of Wisconsin in 1906. 
This is not a matter of courtesy or comity between the two branches of 
government. Senator Spooner explained his judgment in the following terms: 
"The State Department stand upon an entirely different basis as to the 
Congress from other Departments. The conduct of our foreign relations is 
vested by the constitution in the President. It would not be admissible at all 
that either House should have the power to force from the secretary of state 
information connected with the negotiation of treaties, communications from 
foreign governments, and a variety of matters which, if made public, would 
result in very great harm in our foreign relations?matters so far within the 
control of the President that it has always been the practice, and it always 
will be the practice, to recognize the fact that there is of necessity 
information which it may not be compatible with the public interest should be 
transmitted to Congress?to the Senate or to the House. 
"There are other cases, not especially confined, Mr. President, to the state 
Department, or to foreign relations, where the President would be at liberty 
obviously to decline to transmit information to Congress or to either House 
of Congress.* 
* Quoted in Edward S. Corwin, The President: Office and Powers (1940) at p. 404.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 141 
Every study of the subject agrees with Corwin's conclusion. From the 
earliest days of the government, the overwhelming majority of attempts by 
Congress to obtain information from the President or the Secretary of State in the 
field of foreign affairs were requests, not demands, and were qualified by 
provisions authorizing the President to withhold information if he thought its 
disclosure would be inconsistent with the public interest. Where Congressional 
requests for information did not include the usual qualification, Presidents treated 
them as if the qualification had been included, and declined to answer nearly as 
often as they responded. President Washington's refusal to give the House of 
Representatives information about the negotiation of Jay's Treaty in 1794 is 
perhaps the most famous of these episodes. Others concerned military, and quasi-
military and even covert operations during the period of acute controversy with 
Spain prior to the acquisition of Florida, the Civil War, and later periods of strain. 
The reasons for the practice and the rule are rooted in the nature of things. 
The President is often called upon to prepare or to initiate lines of policy for which 
public and Congressional opinion is not yet ready. In response to those initiatives, 
circumstances may change, and opinion with it. Could Lincoln have obtained 
Congressional support for many of the steps he took before and after Fort Sumter, 
while the Civil War was still a threat rather than a consuming reality? In handling 
those problems, Lincoln kept his own counsel, consulting with very few persons, 
each carefully chosen by him. Nearly every President has faced problems of the 
same character, though not of the same magnitude (save in the case of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt), and they all acted in the same way.

Despite its form, however, H.R. 3822 is not a Bill simply requiring the 
transmission of information the Congress regards as important to it in discharging 
its legislative functions. As most of its supporters freely concede, the Bill is 
designed, despite the disclaimer of section 501 (a), to put the members of the two 
intelligence committees squarely into the center of the President's decision-making 
process as active and indeed "equal" participants. This is surely unconstitutional, 
for a number of obvious reasons, not the least being the provisions of Article I, 
Section 6. 
Some defend this extraordinary Congressional intrusion into the President's 
domain as no more than a requirement that under certain circumstances H. R. 3822 
"merely" requires the President to "consult" Congress, as if such a requirement 
were of obvious constitutionality. This is not the case. 
Consultation between the President and members of Congress is a political 
necessity both for members of Congress and for the President. It is an endless 
process which takes place continuously in a thousand forms--at meetings and poker 
games; over the telephone; at funerals and weddings; and at solemn meetings in the 
White House. The President can never "consult" Congress; he can only consult 
members of Congress. The word "consultation" is not a term of Constitutional 
import. Congress is a collective body which can act authoritatively only by passing 
a bill or joint resolution which is then presented to the President for signature. 
When, how, and whom to consult is a political art, often one of supreme importance 
6

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 143 
to Presidents and members of Congress alike. But it cannot be structured and 
regulated. As I said two years ago in an article called Once More Unto The Breach, 
a copy of which is enclosed, "Congress cannot command the President to consult 
with a particular Member of Congress any more than it can tell him who his 
Secretary of State or his most trusted advisers should be. Any such attempt would 
interfere with the President's most sensitive executive discretion, that of political 
leadership." That comment was addressed to the War Powers Resolution of 1973. 
It applies equally to H. R. 3822. 
The President's Constitutional discretion to conduct aspects of his foreign 
policy in secret has not been seriously challenged until the recent past, when the 
circumstances leading to President Nixon's resignation in 1974 encouraged 
Congress to take a number of radical steps in seeking to change the Constitutional 
balance between Congress and the Presidency in the making and conduct of foreign 
policy. The recent dispute over President Reagan's secret arms sales to Iran has 
stimulated the further step in this direction of H. R. 3822. 
Some of the witnesses before this Committee, notably Clark Clifford, have 
defended the constitutionality of the Bill on the ground that it is consonant with 
our system of "checks and balances." Checks and balances in managing the 
relationship among the three branches of our government have proved to be an 
admirable source of friction and tension in the working of the government, thus 
helping to prevent tyranny and to protect personal liberty. But the formula is not a 
universal panacea. In creating the Presidency, the goal of the Founding Fathers 
was to establish an executive capable of "energy, secrecy, and dispatch."

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

One cannot recite the words "checks and balances" as a magic incantation to 
justify a Bill which would introduce a serious check on a Presidential power 
hitherto deemed to be exclusively executive in character. Congress cannot 
supplement the Constitution by inventing new Constitutional checks at will. The 
Constitution itself has been extraordinarily effective in this respect,--some would 
say much too efffective, and it requires no augmentation. 
At first glance, the reporting requirements of the Bill seem innocuous. 
Nonetheless, they challenge the President's Constitutional discretion in extremely 
important ways. They are not in fact reporting requirements at all, but would 
confer upon two committees of Congress the right and power to advise the 
President in advance of his decisions about how to execute the laws. It is a long 
Constitutional step between making laws and applying them to particular cases. 
Congressman Hamilton was commendably frank in his testimony before you on 
February 24, 1988, where he said, 
"Now we are told by the Administration that "timely" means whatever the 
President says it means and that he can withhold notice as long as he wants. 
If we let this interpretation stand--an interpretation that says the President 
can withhold information from Congress at his discretion--then Congress will 
have weakened seriously its oversight capabilities and consented to a basic 
shift of power away from the Congress to the Executive Branch. Once this 
power to withhold information from the Congress is granted to the President, 
how can it then be maintained that congress stands equal in power to the 
President?" 
But Congress and the President are not constitutionally equal in power with 
respect to all aspects of the making and conduct of foreign policy. Congress has 
enumerated legislative powers, the President, "the" executive power. In some 
areas Congress is clearly supreme, in others, the President. Only Congress can 
appropriate money,

? 
declare war, and enact laws; only the President can nominate and remove high 
officials, recognize foreign governments, and conduct foreign relations. In all 
areas, however, cooperation between Congress and the President is necessary if our 
complicated government is to function effectively. But cooperation is not a simple 
rule of thumb, equally applicable in every case. And it is not a matter for 
legislative timetables. The timing and sequence of that cooperation must be 
flexible and responsive to circumstance. Its success depends ultimately on the 
political insight and intuition of the chief participants in the process. 
The unfettered Executive autonomy of the President has been a critical 
factor over and over again in assuring the survival of the nation. Washington, 
Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, and many other Presidents have exercised their 
executive powers in decisively important ways without informing the Congress or 
consulting with Congressional leaders. At a later point, when in their judgment the 
situation was ripe for such action, they turned to Congress for legislative or 
political support. 
The necessity for dealing with problems in stages--the executive usually first, 
and Congress thereafter--is often a matter of supreme importance, fully congruent 
with the animating ideas of our Constitutional arrangements. Our constitutional 
system of separate powers is in fact a system of intermingled powers, as Madison 
saw clearly. Neither Congress nor the President can proceed very far in any given 
direction without the help of the other. Congress can declare war but the 
President must conduct it. Congress declared war on Great Britain in 1812. 
President Madison secretly initiated negotiations for peace eight days later.

President Washington declared our neutrality in the great European war of the time 
despite our Treaty of Alliance with France, and then discovered that he could not 
enforce neutrality without a statute, which came a year later. So now, in dealing 
with the confused and often obscure thrusts of the Cold War the Soviet Union has 
been waging against us for more than forty years, the conduct of American 
diplomacy and security policy requires an active, resourceful Presidency, taking 
advantage of every opportunity to advance the interests of the United States, in 
public and in secret, by methods which must include first-rate intelligence and 
effective defense against the covert and quasi-military attacks of our adversaries 
as well as more visible military attacks. 
HI. 
In fact, however, the purpose and effect of the reporting requirements of 
H. R. 3822 are not to transmit information or to require consultation; they are 
designed and defended as devices which would allow two Congressional Committees 
to prevent Presidents from acting as President Reagan did in seeking to improve 
our relations with Iran by methods which included secret arms sales. 
As Senator Cohen said in his speech on the floor of the Senate on 
March 3, 1988, the object of the Bill is to allow small groups of Congressmen to 
keep the President from making what they regard as mistakes--that is, in plain 
language, to substitute their judgment for that of the President on how to conduct 
our foreign relations. 
Senator Cohen insists that Congress is looking for a "voice" in the decision 
making process, not a "veto". The Senator's contention is without constitutional 
substance. Neither the Constitution nor the pattern of Constitutional practice

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 147 
before 1980 gives the slightest support to the claim that the law-making authority 
has the right to offer the President advice in advance of his decision about how to 
carry out his constitutional duty faithfully to execute the laws. The Senator's 
claim of such a right crosses the boundary line between the legislative and the 
executive power. There is no such right, even with respect to treaties. In many, 
perhaps most cases, a wise and prudent President will consult members of Congress 
or citizens he regards as specially qualified to advise him on a given subject before 
he decides on his course of action. But the choice has always been his. The cases 
where a President chooses not to consult in advance have been among the most 
important in our history. 
In any event, under the highly charged circumstances of cases covered by H. R. 
3822, a Congressional voice cannot be distinguished from a Congressional veto. It 
requires a robust imagination to suppose that a President would continue in a 
covert operation if an influential group of important Congressmen advised him 
vehemently that the proposed action would be a political disaster:?another - 
Watergate or Irangate. Senator Cohen concedes that in consultations under the 
1980 Statute, Congressional advice has invariable been followed. The conclusion is 
hardly surprising. 
Thus the Constitutional problem presented by Section 503 is similar to 
that presented by the War Powers Resolution. To be sure, there is no formal 
provision in H. R. 3822 for a legislative veto which would override a President's 
decision to undertake the intelligence activity he has reported to the Intelligence 
Committees of Congress. It does not provide for veto by concurrent Resolution or 
one-House Resolution, but by the secret advice of one or both of the Intelligence 
Committees, or of a smaller group.

IV. 
The focus of public controversy over H. R. 3822 has been Section 503 CO, 
which provides that no special intelligence activities may be initiated before the 
intelligence committees are formally notified, except where the President 
determines in special circumstances that time is of the essence. Even where delay 
in notification is justified, the Committees are to be notified not later than forty-
eight hours after the special activity has been authorized by the President. 
These provisions are fundamental to the character of the Bill with respect to 
the compulsory provision of information, consultation, and the legislative veto, 
which I have already discussed. -They have another _constitutional dimension. 
In Section 502, the Bill seeks to impose separate and comprehensive reporting 
requirements on the Director of Central Intelligence and the heads of all other 
departments, agencies, and other entities involved in intelligence activities. Such 
a requirement would be constitutionally appropriate for ministerial functions of the 
branches of the government involved in intelligence, but not for their policy 
programs. As written, the Bill can only have the effect of weakening the ties 
between the intelligence community and the President and bringing it more and 
more under the control of the two Congressional Intelligence Committees. 
Manifestly, this would-be an unconstitutional development, which all concerned 
with the integrity of the Constitution should oppose.

V. 
Many justify the Bill as an attempt to prevent what are widely regarded as the 
errors or follies of the Iran-Contra affair. Rigid procedures of disclosure and 
consultation, however and a de facto legislative veto vested in a small group of 
Congressmen and Senators cannot guarantee that all the policies and programs the 
United States government undertakes will always be wise, or will always succeed. 
Members of Congress are quite as capable of error as the President. 
It is characteristic of us to believe that if something goes wrong we can fix it by 
passing a law. So, in the mood of shock and agitation caused by Watergate and 
President Reagan's secret dealings with Iran, we turn automatically to legislative 
remedies. I urge you to resist the temptation and approach your task in the spirit of 
No. 41 of the Federalist Papers. Measures of self defense will always be governed, 
Madison wrote, by "the impulse of self-preservation." It is better not to confine the 
discretion of the government in dealing with such problems by rigid rules. The problems 
usually arise in unfamiliar forms and without warning. Rigid rules may hamper the 
government when action contrary to the rules is necessary, and tempt government to 
act in violation of the rules when such action is not necessary. The example of the War 
Powers Resolution should stand as a warning in your minds. With the best intentions in 
the world, it is easy to do more harm than good. 
H. R. 3822 belongs with a group of most unfortunate statutes passed since the 
time when the campaign in Vietnam became unpopular. Through those statutes, 
Congress has attempted to "micromanage" the President's conduct of foreign relations. 
The Supreme Court has long since indicated that most of these statutes are 
unconstitutional. Its decisions on the separation of powers have been sharp and clear 
for many, many years. In my view, the greatest contribution Congress could make to 
the future of our foreign policy and to the preservation of the rule of law in the 
commonwealth is to bring the statute book into conformity with the law of the 
Constitution on the relation between Congress and the President in the field of foreign 
affairs.

Eugene V. Rostow 
On Foreign Covert 
Action Operations 
I am happy to respond to your letter of 
July go, asking my views (t) on the legal basis 
for the conduct by the President of what you 
call "foreign covert action operations" in the 
absence of specific statutory authority; and (a) 
whether, or to what extent. Congress may by 
statute limit or prohibit the conduct of such 
"foreign covert action operations" by the Presi-
dent. Your letter gives several examples of what 
you mean by the phrase, ranging from the Bay 
of Pigs episode to sabotage, propaganda, and 
assistance to foreign political groups. 
I have prepared this letter during a sabbati-
cal in the country, without benefit of library. It 
will therefore be general and informal in char-
acter. 
In brief, my answers to your questions are 
as follows: 
(s) In the absence of statutory authority. 
the President has inherent constitutional 
power to conduct "foreign covert action oper-
ations'' because he is the President under our 
Constitution: that is, he is the sole organ of 
the nation in the conduct of foreign rela-
dons, the commander-in-chief of our armed 
forces; and the head of State. 
(a) Congress cannot prohibit the Presi-
dent from carrying out "foreign covert action 
operations," but it may establish and regulate 
the methods through which the President car-
ries them out, as it establishes and regulates 
the work of the courts and the action of the 
President in other aspects of his duty. Con-
gress cannot deny the President the capacity 
to function effectively in this area any more 
than it could deny the courts the capacity to 
carry out their independent constitutional 
duties, or deprive the President, for example, 
of his pardoning power, or his power to re-
move Cabinet officers at will. 
Let me start with the unassailable proposi-
tMn that since 1776 the United States has been 
a nation among the nations, fully vested with 
sovereignty, as that concept is known to interna-
tional law, and endowed with the capacity to 
do whatever nations do in world politics, in 
accordance with the effective norms of interna-
tional lass. 
But the limitation of the previous sentence 
does not help much in articulating a sound an-
swer to your questions. The nations are of 
course under an obligation to respect and obey 
the generally accepted norms of international 
law. Tice United States has always purported to 
base its foreign policy on scrupulous respect for 
international law, a policy I strongly support. 
But other nations do not always follow the 
sante policy. And international law fully ac. 
knowledges the fact that nations have the sover. 
eign power, if not the right, to breach their 
obligations under international lass and take 
the consequences. Our constitutional law fully 
recognizes this fact (Gray v. United Slates, 21 
Ct. CI. 340 (1886); Diggs v. Schultz, 470 Fad 
46s (Ct. App. D. of C. 1972)). It follows, both 
under international law and our own constitu-
tional lass, that we must be capable of employ-
ing the remedies 49 sehhelp contemplated as 
legitimate tinder international law to deal effec-
tively with such wrongful acts. International 
law does not know the remedy of specific per-
formance. 
To paraphrase Chief Justice Hughes' fa-
mous comment about the scope of the war 
power, the authority of the nation to protect 
its interests in world politics is the authority to 
protect those interests successfully. As a matter 
both of international ancl of constitutional law, 
the extent of the nation's rights, duties, powers, 
and privileges in foreign affairs will therefore 
depend upon the condition of world politics 
and upon circumstance. In all legal systems lass 
derives from the nature of things. What the 
United States can do turns on what it must 
do: that is, on what its responsible political 
officials believe it should do to safeguard the 
security, prosperity, and honor of the nation, 
both in serene times, and in times of trouble. 
Under the Constitution of i787 the author. 
by of the United States to act as a sovereign 
nation in "the great external realm" is divided 
between the Presidency and the Congress. The 
allocation of power between Congress and the 
Presidency in dealing with external affairs has 
never been and can never be mapped with pre. 
vision. As Hamilton said, the threats which may 
arise to plague the nation are infinite and be-
yond prediction. The powers of the nation must 
always be adequate to deal with whatever men-
ace may arise. The point I am trying to make 
is nowhere more. evident than in the astonish-
ing arrangements we have made. and take for 
granted, about the President's singular duties 
with regard to the nuclear weapon. Since the

Presidency is the only institution of our govern-
ment capable of dealing with the problem, we 
entrust it to the President. 
A familiar constitutional paradox domi-
nates your enquiry. On the one hand, the Presi-
dency is one of the three autonomous branches 
of the government, often called "independent"; 
on the other, as Madison saw from the begin-
ning. the principle of the separation of powers 
does not mean that the three branches of the 
government are really separate at all. For the 
most part, their powers are commingled and 
shared. They are therefore not independent but 
interdependent, although there are some func-
tions unique to each branch. Only a judge can 
issue a mandamus. Only Congress can declare 
war. Only the President can order the troops 
into battie. If one visualizes the powers of the 
President and of Congress in the field of foreign 
affairs diagramatically, they could be repre-
sented by two circles, tangential to each other, 
with a third circle, its center on the point of 
tangency, including about half of each of the 
others. The parts of the first two circles outside 
the third would represent the distinct and inde-
pendent powers of Congress and of the Presi-
dency; the third circle, the powers they share. I 
shall not attempt here to survey the field, recon-
ciling the respective foreign affairs powers of 
Congress and the President. You are familiar 
with Corwin's magisterial book on the Presi-
dency and Professor Louis Henkin's comprehen-
sive recent treatise. I examined one panel of the 
problem in an article in the Texas Law Review, 
"Great Cases Make Bad Law," 50 Tex. L. Rev. 
833 (1972). 
Suffice it to say, for the purposes of this 
letter, that nearly two centuries of experience 
permit us to identify the ideas which govern 
the division of -authority between the Presi-
dency and Congress in the Foreign Relations 
Law of the United States. 
In my judgment, that allocation of author-
ity corresponds to functional necessity?that is, 
to the nature of the tasks involved and of the 
institutions themselves. I have no quarrel with 
the existing constitutional plan, difficult as it is 
to carry out. In my opinion, it corresponds to 
the nature of our constitution and people. com-
bining the capacity for swift executive action 
with ample means for assuring democratic re-
sponsibility. 
The President speaks for the nation in 
diplomacy. He is commander-in-chief of the 
armed forces. And he is head of state, endowed 
therefore with residual emergency powers 
Lincoln used. In many areas, the President 
makes policy himself, in addition to carrying 
out the policies of Congress. The Monroe Doc-
13 
trine, for example, is a presidential policy but 
not less a national policy for that reason. 
The Congress is the legislature, deliberately 
denied any executive power. The Senate has a 
special role in certain appointments and in 
treaty-making. And only Congress can declai e 
war. 
Defining the limits of Congressional power 
in relation to the inherent authority of the 
other two branches is never an easy task, but 
it is a familiar one in our constitutional system. 
We know, for example, that while Congress can 
regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts 
and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme 
Court, it has never deprived the courts of the 
capacity to carry out their judicial duties. Con-
fronting such a possibility, Justice Story once 
said that the courts would exercise their in-
herent rule-making power to assert jurisdiction. 
The test has never arisen, and I trust it will 
never arise. But I believe Justice Story was 
right. There is a point beyond which regulation 
becomes usurpation. In relation to the Presi-
dency, too, all sorts of limits are recognized. 
Congress can, for example, establish a Civil 
Service System, but it cannot deprive the Presi-
dent of his indispensable power to remove Cabi-
net officers and other high officials at will. Nor 
can Congress interfere with the President's par-
doning power, although it can, I should sup-
pose, pass amnesty statutes of its own. 
What your letter identifies as "foreign 
covert action operations" belong to two realms 
in which the President and Congress are at once 
independent and interdependent?the conduct 
of foreign relations and the international use of 
force. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say 
that diplomacy and the limited use of coercive 
measures are equally normal aspects of the con-
duct of foreign relations in times of war and 
peace alike. As the Supreme Court once com-
mented, secret services "are sometimes indispen-
sable to the government," both in hostilities and 
in "matters respecting our foreign relations." 
Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 106-107 
(1876). Since the conduct of foreign relations 
under our Constitution is peculiarly Presiden-
tial in character, especially in those of its as-
pects where secrecy is essential, the task of de-
fining the limits of Congressional authority 
with respect to the secret aspects of diplomacy 
is unusually difficult.

I assume that you are mainly interested in 
the international and constitutional legal prob-
lems raised by foreign covert action operations 
during peace time. Once Congress has moved 
the nation to a state of war, within the intend-
ment of international law, most of the ques-
tions suggested by your letter disappear. 
International law contemplates the possi-
bility that a long list of limited coercive meas-
ures may be employed in international rela-
tions during peace time to redress violations of 
international law which cannot be dealt with 
by less drastic means. They range from ordinary 
intelligence gathering procedures to the exer-
cise of what Article 51 of the United Nations 
Charter acknowledges as each nation's "inher-
ent right of self-defense" against armed attack 
(or the imminent threat of armed attack), and 
its equally "inherent" right to respond recipro-
cally to lesser forms of coercion or to assist 
another nation under attack or threat of attack. 
The clumsy drafting of Article 51 subsumes a 
comprehensive array of measures of self-help a 
nation may take in peace time to defend itself 
against violations of international lass by 
another nation to its detriment. Some involve 
the use of force. Others, like ordinary diplom-
acy and less visible methods of gathering infor-
mation, seek to discover, to anticipate or to 
deal with harmful or hostile actions other states 
may be planning or taking against the best in-
terests of the United States. Such measures of 
self-help should be limited and addressed to the 
breach itself. They are never intended as acts 
of general war, nor are they intended to affect 
the territorial integrity or political indepen-
dence of the nation to which such defensive 
measures are addressed. 
One of the accepted rules of this branch of 
international law, both before and since the 
enactment of the Charter of the United Nations, 
authorizes the international use by force by way 
of proportional response to the use of force by 
or from another nation in breach of its obliga-
tions in international law. For example, when 
guerrillas conducted raids within the territory 
of the United States from Spanish Florida in 
1819 or from Mexico in 1916, Spain in the one 
case and Mexico in the other had violated their 
duties to us under international law by failing 
to prevent such activities from their territories. 
Prompt relief being unavailable through diplo-
matic channels, the United States was legally 
authorized to send troops in order to eliminate 
the danger. We acknowledged the principle when 
the shoe pinched the other foot. In 1837, armed 
bands assembled in up-state Ness' York to help 
an insurrection in Canada. We conceded that, 
14 
in such a case, Great Britain could send troops 
into the United States for the limited purpose 
of eliminating the threat to Canada if the 
United States did not disarm and disperse the 
guerrillas with dispatch. 
This principle of international law has 
been appropriately invoked nearly every week 
in the Middle East during recent years, when 
Israel has raided guerrilla camps in Jordan or 
Lebanon from which attacks have been launched 
against it, or made limited attacks in Egypt or 
Syria, in response to guerrilla attacks from those 
countries. 
Constitutionally, such limited uses of force 
to defend the United States or its allies against 
breaches of international lass have been con-
sidered to be among the duties of the Presi-
dent, acting alone. The President has sometimes 
had the support of a Congressional Resolution 
before or after the event in cases of this kind. 
It is always desirable, when it is also feasible, 
for the Congress to join the President in putting 
the full weight of the nation behind an Ameri-
can warning or other act of permissible self-
help. But Congressional support is not necessary 
to the legality of such actions under the Consti-
tution. Thus, the President has used force on 
his own authority many, many times since 1789, 
not only in dealing with armed attacks, like 
those from Spanish Florida or Mexico I have 
just mentioned, but also in protecting American 
citizens and property abroad, when they were 
subjected to treatment which violated the stand-
ards of international law and when, as a prac-
tical matter, political or judicial remedies could 
not be obtained immediately. 
The practice is so familiar that it requires 
no evocation of precedents. The Mayaguez epi-
sode is the most recent occasion on which a 
President deemed it necessary to use force in 
the exercise of his responsibility to protect 
American citizens and property abroad against 
a breads by another state of its obligations to us 
under international law. 
The use or the threat to use military force 
or other coercive measures is also a familiar fea-
ture of diplomacy, especially, of course, during 
Periods of turbulence like the modern era. 
Thus, the United States put 5o.000 troops on 
the Mexican border after the Civil War to back 
the President's suggestion that France withdraw 
its support from the government of Maxi-
milian. The United States made this threat to 
use force on the authority of the President 
alone, as an integral part of his responsibility 
for the conduct of foreign relations in general 
and the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine 
in particular. Under our constitutional practice, 
it would have been time to involve Congress

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 153 
formally before or after hostilities broke out if 
the President's warning had failed of its pur-
pose. 
President Kennedy's handling of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis in 1962 should be viewed, I be-
lieve, in the same perspective, as permissible 
self-help authorized by Article 51 of the Char-
ter. We actually used a small amount of force, 
in stopping Soviet vessels on the high seas, and 
threatened a greater use of force, in order to 
reinforce a diplomatic demand on the Soviet 
Union. Our policy in the Cuban Missile Crisis 
of 1962 was not a move to defend the United 
States against the threat of imminent nuclear 
or other attack. There was no risk of any such 
attack. As President Kennedy pointed out at 
the time, the emplacement of Soviet missiles in 
Cuba was not in itself the crux of the contro-
versy: Soviet missile-carrying submarines roamed 
the Atlantic at will. 
Here again, the action taken was Presiden-
tial. Because of the controversy over the consti-
tutionality of President Truman's course in 
Korea and the amendment to the Constitution-
proposed by Senator Bricker, a hasty Resolution 
had been passed by Congress purporting to deal 
with the Cuban crisis. But it did not cover the 
situation as it developed. There is no doubt, 
however, that Congress supported the President 
in what he did. 
The most recent and most portentous threat 
to use force in aid of diplomacy was President 
Nixon's series of warnings to the Soviet Union 
not to attack China. This was the essence of 
his diplomacy for achieving a rapproachement 
with China as a step towards stabilizing the 
relationships among the Soviet Union, China, 
and the United States and its European and 
Asian allies. The President was addressing the 
ominous Soviet mobilization on the Siberian 
frontier between China and the Soviet Union. 
What he said, in context, was a secret threat to 
use force in the event of a Soviet attack on 
China. Thus far, that Presidential threat has 
been effective. 
Here too, what the President did has had 
general and Congressional support. I am not 
aware of any criticism of President Nixon's 
rapproachement with China on constitutional 
grounds. 
In all these instances, and many others, the 
action required of the United States was Presi-
dential in character. In some?like President 
Nixon's recent warnings to the Soviet Union to 
protect China and Israel?secrecy added to the 
possibility of success and was perhaps essential 
to success. It is easier for a nation to yield to a 
secret than to a public threat. In such affairs 
a hint is far more likely to be effective than an 
15 
ultimatum. All were situations requiring a 
quick response and a nearly continuous course 
of action. They were "executive" rather than 
"legislative" in nature?if those two slippery 
words can be considered to possess tangible 
cores of meaning. They involved either limited 
defensive responses to an attack on the interests 
of the nation or equally limited recourse to 
pressure in aid of diplomacy. 
III 
What you describe as "foreign covert ac-
tions" are accepted and relatively minor ex-
amples which fit into both the general cate-
gories I have sketched out in the second part 
of this letter. 
The Soviet Union and some other nations 
engage in large-scale and systematic programs of 
"foreign covert operations" directed against our 
interests all over the world. I assume your Com-
mittee has carefully studied the events behind 
the important Mexican decision in 1971 to ex-
pel over fifty Soviet diplomats and the corres-
ponding decision of the British government (in 
the same year, I believe) to expel an even larger 
number "for espionage and sabotage." These 
were dramatic instances which came close to the 
surface of public knowledge. Neither customary 
international law nor the law of the United 
Nations Charter?insofar as it may differ from 
customary international law?provides any rem-
edies against such policies, save self-help in the 
pattern of Article 51. Are we to stand by and 
allow NATO allies, like Portugal, Italy, Greece, 
or Iceland to be subverted and conquered by 
well-financed Soviet programs of propaganda, 
sabotage, and even direct revolutionary activity 
(like that publicly revealed in Mexico in 1971) 
without any response? 
It seems to me that the long tradition of 
using secret agents in diplomacy provides the 
simple and sensible answer to that question. 
That answer must be, "Of course not." The use 
of secret agents was a familiar feature of the 
diplomacy our Founding Fathers knew and 
practiced. It has been commonplace ever since. 
And today it is employed by our adversaries on a 
larger and more sophisticated scale than at any 
previous time in history. It makes no sense to 
claim that either international law or our own 
Constitutional law prevents the United States

104 
from defending its interests against such pres-
sures. 
The defense of the nation against these un-
remitting pressures may sometimes involve ele-
ments of international coercion which would be 
of doubtful international legality if they were 
not intended to defend our interests against 
illegal coercive pressures mounted against us by 
the Soviet Union or other states. But they are 
far less burdensome than the uses of coercion 
mentioned in Part II of this letter. If it was 
permissible under international law for Presi-
dent Wilson to send troops into Mexico in 
order to capture Patch? Villa?and it was?it 
is a fortiori legal for the United States to pro-
vide funds for democratic newspapers or politi-
cal parties in Chile or Portugal or to engage 
in some of the other kinds of foreign covert 
actions contemplated by your letter. Such oper-
ations should be deemed proper exercises of our 
inherent right of self-defense, as activities nor-
mal to the conduct of our foreign relations in 
this period of intense and dangerous interna-
tional rivalry. 
IV 
Finally, I come to the question whether 
Congress can constitutionally limit or prohibit 
the activities of the President in this field. 
Let me start by making it crystal clear that 
I oppose, and I believe our constitution op-
poses, unreviewable power in any branch of 
the government. The American constitutional 
system is based on the principle of democratic 
responsibility. It has an answer for the famous 
and ultimate question of all government, "Quis 
custodiet custodes?" Our answer is plain, and 
the passion of our convictions on the subject 
was fully revealed in the Watergate affair 
through which we have just passed. 
The forms and methods of public accounta-
bility are not uniform, however. Some involve 
judicial or congressional review; for others, the 
only available remedy is at the polls. If the 
Supreme Court errs, in the judgment of the 
country, the remedy is a statute or a constitu-
tional amendment, embodying the sober second 
thoughts of the American people. 
Many, many decisions of government are 
necessarily entrusted by the Constitution and 
the laws to the uncontrolled discretion of the 
President, or Congress, or both. These are the 
16 
so-called "political questions" courts cannot re-
view. Some are purely Presidential; others 
purely Congressional; many involve the action 
of both branches?a declaration of war, for ex-
ample. For such exercises of the power of the 
political branches to make political decisions, 
the appropriate way to assure democratic re-
sponsibility is oversight and ultimate recourse 
to the political process. Great Britain, France, 
and other democratic countries make it a rule 
never to discuss their secret services in public. 
So strict a standard is not congenial to our 
political system. Nonetheless, in my view, Con-
gress should follow the holding in the Totten 
case, which requires the courts to respect the 
government interest in secrecy and conduct 
their oversight hearings in private. 
Such, I believe, is the constitutionally cor-
rect predicate for an answer to the questions 
posed by your letter, "Can Congress limit or 
prohibit the President's activities in the field 
of foreign covert action operations?" 
The question of prohibition . is easy, I 
think. Congress cannot deny the President au-
thority to use secret agents in the conduct of 
his constitutional duties as President any more 
than it could interfere with any other "in-
herent" or "independent" feature of his power. 
Regulation within the boundaries estab-
lished by our constitutional history is another 
matter. 
The problem, I suggest, is like that in-
volved in establishing and organizing the State 
Department. Only Congress can establish on-
going governmental institutions to assist the 
President in carrying out his responsibility for 
the conduct of foreign relations. It can pass 
comprehensive legislation to regulate the func-
tioning of the State Department. But in doing 
so, Congress cannot limit or control the exer-
cise of the President's constitutional discretion. 
It could not, for example, decide questions of 
recognition or non-recognition. They are for 
the President alone. It cannot, I believe, require 
the President or any other executive officer to 
reveal what Chief Justice Marshall, in Marian); 
v. Madison, called "the secrets of the cabinet." 
Congress could not require the President to act 
only on the recommendations of the Secretary 
of State, or the National Security Council, or 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It 
could not require the President to use only 
members of the Foreign Service or Ambassadors 
as his agents in diplomacy. From the time Presi-
dent Washington sent the Chief Justice to nego-
tiate Jay's Treaty to the day of Colonel House, 
Harry Hopkins, or Henry Kissinger (before Ile 
became Secretary of State). Presidents have often 
chosen to conduct diplomatic business through

channels convenient to them. 
Similarly, Congress cannot control the Pres-
ident's discretion as Commander-in-Chief, save 
through its power of the purse, although it can 
and does legislate on a large scale to organize 
and regulate the military establishment. It 
could not order President Roosevelt to start a 
Second Front in France or prevent a President 
from negotiating and signing an armistice or a 
cease fire. 
In the nature of world politics today, what 
your letter calls "foreign covert action opera-
tions" will often be "indispensable to the 
government" to recall the phrase from the 
Totten case. Under most circumstances, they 
come well within the areas of action the Presi-
dent is fully authorized to take on his own re-
sponsibility. In Totten the Court ruled that in 
hiring a secret agent without statutory author-
ity, the President made a contract binding on 
the United States and payable from contingent 
funds entrusted to him by Congress. Congress 
can probably alter that practice and regularize 
the President's mode of making such contracts. 
But it cannot deprive him of the function. 
Can Congress limit or control the Presi-
dent's discretion in carrying on foreign covert 
operations, save through a refusal to appropri-
ate funds? To a degree, I believe it can. For 
example, I see no reason why Congress could 
not declare that it is against the policy of the 
United States to engage in political assassina-
tion. To my official knowledge, that was the 
firm and immutable policy of the United States 
while I served in the government in high 
enough positions to know, and I was assured 
that it had always been the policy of the United 
States. Congress has passed legislation and rad-
fled treaties dealing with many aspects of the 
law of war. Those statutes and treaties restrict 
the powers of the President as commander-in-
chief. If the Senate can ratify treaties and Con-
gress pass legislation outlawing the use of 
poison gas or the bombing of open cities, I 
see no reason why Congress could not outlaw 
certain practices by our CIA agents, so long as 
the function itself is not crippled or controlled. 
Manifestly, there is no chance whatever 
that the rules of the game for the secret services 
will ever be prescribed by international agree-
ments like the Geneva Conventions regulating 
the use of force in war and other hostilities. 
Whether it is prudent to consider such legisla-
tion is therefore a difficult question. But your 
letter asks only whether under the Constitution 
Congress has the power to pass any substantive 
legislation at all in the field beyond house-
keeping statutes. 
17 
My answer to that question is a qualified 
"Yes." In my opinion, Congress can pass legis-
lation dealing with foreign covert action opera-
tions of the President as chief diplomat of the 
nation, commander-in-chief of its armed forces, 
and head of state, so long as it does not cross 
the intangible boundary between the legislative 
and executive aspects of the problem. Admit-
tedly, the delineation of that frontier is difficult 
and will always be difficult for the reasons I 
suggested earlier. -Certainly my colleague Pro-
fessor McDougal was correct when he wrote to 
you on August 21 that "Congress has no more 
authority to regulate the independent powers 
of the President than the President has to regu-
late the independent powers of the Congress." 
But which part of the President's powers are 
truly independent and which are shared with 
Congress? There are many fields in which the 
President can and should act in the absence of 
Congressional action but where Congress can 
act if it wishes to do so: the abrogation of 
treaties, for example; the exclusion of aliens; 
the regulation of international cables and other 
devices of telecommunication. 
In trying to analyze the division of the 
foreign affairs power and the war power be-
tween Congress and the President, the conduct 
of foreign covert action operations is surely an 
aspect of diplomacy and of the President's 
duties as commander-in-chief, which should be 
classified close to the Presidential end of the 
spectrum. It is necessarily secret and intimately 
associated with the conduct of foreign relations, 
rather than the articulation of legislative policy. 
Nonetheless, I should be the last to deny that 
there is some room for substantive policy legis-
lation in the field, so long as the basic process 
of the Constitution is respected. 
The democratic quality of American life 
depends ultimately not only on the rectitude 
of our governors but on the inevitable rivalries 
and jealousies of the three branches of govern-
ment. Those rivalries produce the tensions 
which have made it possible to preserve our 
Constitutional system for nearly two centuries 
and thus to protect our liberty. The present 
study of your Select Committee represents one 
manifestation of that constitutional tension. Of 
course tension should not be carried so far as 
to paralyze government. It never has. But it 
should go far enough to satisfy us that any 
abuses of the system have been cured; that 
every reasonable precaution against possible 
future abuse has been established; and, above 
all, that the proper functioning of the Presi-
dent's secret services as indispensable agencies 
of government has been facilitated and assured.

"ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH:" THE 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION REVISITED 
EUGENE V. ROSTOW* 
LECTURE I. 
The War Powers Resolution was enacted over President Nixon's veto 
in 1973, as the twin dramas of Vietnam and Watergate were approaching 
their climax in the President's resignation nearly a year later. The sponsors 
of the statute told the American people it would protect the nation from 
"another Vietnam" and piously restore the constitutional balance the 
Founding Fathers intended between Congress and the President with regard 
to the use of the national force. That balance had been disturbed, the sup-
porters of the Resolution claimed, by a series of Presidents since McKinley 
who had stolen the war-making powers entrusted to Congress by the Con-
stitution, and thereby made Congress the impotent slave of an Imperial 
Presidency. Once we return to the true constitutional faith, these Soions 
said, the peace, security, and prosperity of the United States and its allies 
would be assured. 
The critics of the statute were equally apocalyptic. The Resolution,

they argued, rested on a mistaken understanding of the intentions of the 
Founding Fathers and the course of constitutional history. The proponents 
of the Resolution were guilty of a cruel and hypocritical deception in prom-
ising the American people immunity from "another Vietnam." Not even an 
Act of Congress can guarantee that our wars will always be conducted 
wisely and effectively, and won. In any event, they pointed out with some 
asperity, the Vietnam War had been authorized not only by the decisions of 
four Presidents, but by two treaties and repeated Congressional acts and 
joint resolutions which. amply satisfied the procedural requirements of the 
new statute. Moreover, the War Powers Resolution could not "restore" the 
balance of the Constitution; that balance had never been disturbed. The 
foreign affairs powers, including the war powers of the United States, had 
been exercised in much the same way between the time of Washington and 
John Adams and that of Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, and Lyndon Johnson. 
If enforced, the War Powers Resolution would accomplish the most revolu-
tionary constitutional change in American history. It would deprive the 
President of his capacity for prompt and decisive action which has been 
critical to his effectiveness both in the conduct of foreign relations and in 
the management of crises. These powers are inherent in the Presidency and 
necessary to the security of the nation?more necessary today than ever 
before. Actually enforcing the War Powers Resolution would convert the 
strong, autonomous President which is one of the great achievements of the 
Constitution into a mere lackey of an omnipotent Congress. Such action 
would repudiate Hamilton's theory of the Presidency which has dominated 
judicial decisions and constitutional practice in the domain of foreign affairs 
since 1789, and for the first time embrace what Corwin scornfully called 
the "ultra-Whig" view of the office.' If the War Powers Resolution had 
been in effect, Lincoln could not have saved the Union, Franklin Roosevelt 
could not have taken the early steps which made it possible in the end to 
defeat Hitler, and Kennedy could not have conducted the Cuban Missile 
crisis successfully. Thus, in the eyes of Hamiltonians, the War Powers Res-
olution would restore the Articles of Confederation as our norm for han-
dling the foreign affairs of the nation, and leave the United States drifting 
helplessly in stormy seas, naked before its enemies. In their view, the ultra-
Whigs have revived a familiar and beloved constitutional controversy in or-
der to avoid the disagreeable fact that changes in the magnetic field of 
world politics since 1789 have imposed novel and dangerous tasks on the 
people and government of the United States. 
With the benefit of hindsight, these two lectures attempt to review the 
continuing debate about the War Powers Resolution against the back-
ground of international law and politics and the nation's experience in con-

ducting its foreign relations under the Constitution of 1787. The first lec-
ture examines the controversy in the light of constitutional theory and early 
practice; the second takes up the War Powers Resolution and its reception. 
For purposes of international law. the United States is a unitary, not a 
federal state. Internationally, the American states are provinces, devoid of 
4-sovereignty." Since we prevailed in the Revolutionary War, the United 
States is considered legally to have come into being as a full fledged mem-
ber of the family of nations with the Declaration of Independence, vested as 
of that date with all the powers, rights, immunities, and privileges acknowl-
edged by international law as the prerogative of widely recognized states. 
Correspondingly, the United States is liable to other states for the perform-
ance of the duties imposed upon all states by international law. In the 
"great external realm" of foreign affairs, the United States can do whatever 
other states do?that is, whatever it deems necessary and reasonable to as-
sure its safety and well-being in international society. 
The Constitution does not purport to "grant" international powers to 
the United States any more than it purports to create the United States. On 
the contrary, as is natural in a document reorganizing the institutions of a 
functioning government for the second time more than a decade after its 
creation, it treats the United States as an existing and on-going political 
entity. The Constitution is written in the name of "the people of the United 
States," and notes as obviously valid the treaties made under the authority 
of the United States between 1776 and 1789, Thus the international pow-
ers of the United States are conferred and defined by international law. 
Internationally, the government of the United States possesses all the pow-
ers possessed by any other state under international law, including the sov-
ereign power to violate international law. The Constitution commits these 
powers to the political discretion of Congress and the President in accor-
dance with the principle of functional necessity. If Congress or the Presi-
dent should decide to use the national force in violation of international 
lav., courts and citizens are bound thereby, as they are bound by other offi-
cial decisions with in the discretion of the political branches of govern-
ment.' The division of the foreign affairs and war powers between Congress 
and the President reflects the grand Design of the American polity, to recall

the favorite major premise of John Marshall's constitutional opinions.' In 
this instance, the great purpose of the Constitution is to fullfil the twin 
objectives of executive effectiveness and democratic responsibility: a strong, 
energetic President and a strong, energetic Congress. The international 
powers of the nation which are legislative in character, with some excep-
tions, are Congressional, and those which are executive in character, with 
some exceptions, are Presidential. The Senate must give its advice and con-
sent to the appointment of high officials and the ratification of treaties, and 
only Congress can "declare" war. 
The President created by the Constitution was in no Sense to be a 
Prime Minister. No member of Congress can serve in the executive 
branch" And the President is elected not by Congress but by an indepen-
dent national constituency for a different term. As Professor Corwin wrote, 
Mlle fact is that what the Framers had in mind was not the 
cabinet system, as yet nonexistent even in Great Britain, but the 
'balanced constitution' of Locke, Montesquieu, and Blackstone, 
which carried with it the idea of a divided initiative in the mat-
ter of legislation and a broad range of autonomous executive 
power or 'prerogative'. Sir Henry Maine's dictum that 'the 
American Constitution is the British Constitution with the mon-
archy left out' is, from the point of view of 1789, almost the 
exact reverse of the truth, for the presidency was designed in 
great measure to reproduce the monarchy of George HI with the 
corruption left out, and also of course the hereditary feature.'

There is comfort in reciting these familiar words, and it is intellectu-
ally necessary to do so, but they are no more than a starting point for anal-
ysis, and a fairly boggy starting point at that. The boundary between the 
legislative and the executive power is not always easy to draw in the domes-
tic governance of the United States, although with regard to some problems 
one can in desperation invoke Justice Potter Stewart's celebrated comment 
about "hard-core" pornography:

I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; 
and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I

case is not that.' 
With regard to foreign affairs, including the respective powers of the 
President and Congress over the use of force, the normal difficulties of con-
stitutional construction arc complicated by two special factors: (I) modern 
American citizens and lawyers are less familiar with international law than 
their predecessors in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; and 
(2) the turbulence of the world since 1914 has required a far more active 
American foreign policy than was the case for most of the nineteenth cen-
tury. Since 1914, foreign affairs have been a much more constant preoccu-
pation of American domestic politics and a much more important factor in 
the perennial tug of war between Congress and the President than has been 
the case since the Presidencies of George Washington and John Adams. It 
is no wonder that John Quincy Adams once remarked that the boundary 
between Presidential and Congressional power in the field of foreign affairs 
is as yet undetermined, and perhaps never could be defined.' 
A great deal of the heat in the debate over the War Powers Resolution 
derives from a popular and sometimes even professional misunderstanding 
of the clause in the Constitution which specifies that Congress has the 
power "to declare war." The phrase has acquired a mystic denotation in 
the vocabulary of American politics quite unjustified by its meaning and 
history. Despite nearly two hundred years of experience to the contrary, 
people cling to the view that there is something improper, perhaps illegal or 
even a bit dictatorial in hostilities authorized by the President alone, or by 
the President and Congress acting together but without benefit of a Joint 
Resolution labelled a "Declaration of War." 
The national force has been used abroad more than two hundred times 
since 1789, and its use hinted at or threatened by Presidents in secret or 
public diplomatic messages many more times, but only five "Declarations of 
War" have been adopted." The practice of other nations in this regard is 
the same. "Declarations" of war are rare; and no nation has issued a "Dec-
laration of War" since the United Nations Charter was adopted in 1945.

6 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 21 
Nonetheless, the words "declare war" and "declaration of war" remain the 
focus of uneasy concern in the endless American argument about the war 
powers of the nation. The War Powers Resolution does not commit this 
vulgar error in form, but it does so in spirit. Politicians find it all too easy to 
exploit that concern when wars become unpopular, as all wars do, and es-
cape from the battlefield by denouncing "John Adams' Undeclared War," 
"Harry Truman's Undeclared War," or "Lyndon Johnson's Undeclared 
War," as the case may be. 
There is no excuse for the survival of this hoary bit of verbal necro-
mancy. Both the text and the context of the Constitution give an obvious 
substance?indeed a "plain meaning"?to the words "declare war." 
With the possible exception of the clause endowing each state with two 
Senators, no provision of the Constitution is less ambiguous than the 
paragraphs of Article 1 Section 8 which state that Congress has power: 
To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the 
high seas and offenses against the law of nations; and 
To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make 
rules concerning captures on land and water. 
The language of these paragraphs is peculiar to international law, and 
can only be understood in the setting of international law. The phrase "to 
declare war" in the Constitution has a specific meaning in international 
law. Under international law, force may be used between states both in 
time of war and in time of peace. All international uses of forces are not 
"war" in the legal sense of the word, however bloody and extended the 
conflicts may be. The older treatises on international law generally ap-
peared in two volumes, one devoted to the Law of War, the other to the 
Law of Peace. A "declaration of war" transforms the relationship between 
the belligerents into a state of war and challenges the relation of non-par-
ticipants to the belligerents. The state of war contemplates unlimited hostil-
ities between the belligerents, the internment or expulsion of enemy aliens, 
the termination of diplomatic relations, the sequestration or even confisca-
tion of enemy property, and the imposition of regulations?censorship, for 
example?which would be unthinkable in liberal-minded states during 
peacetime. And it gives rise to thorny and nearly insoluble problems of neu-
trality which were important factors in the involvement of the United 
States in a least four wars and a number of diplomatic controversies which 
approached the point of war. 
On the other hand, the permissible international use of force in time of 
peace, as international law defines peace, stretches across a wide spectrum 
of situations from "showing the flag" and other kinds of diplomatic warn-
ings to actual hostilities in the exercise of a state's sovereign and inherent

right of self-defense." 
The doctrines of international law on the subject of self-defense are 
reasonably clear cut. The dominant characteristic of such international uses 
of force in peacetime is that they should be limited and proportional re-
sponses to a prior illegal act of a forceful character for which another state 
is responsible." Thus if State A violates certain fundamental rights of State 
B?for example, by sending guerrillas, armed bands, or terrorists from its 
territory into that of State B in order to assist a rebellion against the gov-
ernment of State B or by failing to prevent such incursions?and diplo-
macy, arbitration, and other peaceful procedures for curing the breach are 
unavailing, State B and states which decide to help it are entitled to use 
whatever force against State A is necessary to cure State A's breach of 
international law: so much and no more. 
In one of the leading cases of this kind, which took place in 1837. the 
United States had failed to prevent some anti-British enthusiasts assembled 
on the Niagara River in northern New York from forming armed bands 
which crossed the river to join an insurrection against British authority in 
Canada. After remonstrance failed, the British sent a company of soldiers 
into New York to disperse the "freedom fighters." In the Anglo-American 
diplomatic correspondence on the subject, still frequently cited, the United 
States conceded that Britain had the abstract right under international law 
to do what it did, but should have given the United States more time to 
eliminate the camps itself. There was no confusion about what was happen-
ing. The United States did not suppose that Great Britain was waging gen-
eral war against it. The British intervention was limited by the nature of 
the breach of international law it was intended to cure." 
In an even more famous episode, Great Britain paid the United States 
a large sum in damages, as established by arbitration, for having failed

during the Civil War to prevent the Confederate cruiser Alabama from 
slipping out to sea unarmed from Liverpool where it was being built. The 
United States repeatedly warned Great Britain that the ship was intended 
to be used as a commerce raider. Britain agreed that its failure to prevent 
the escape of the vessel violated its international legal duty to the United 
States." 
Another important branch of the law of self-defense in international 
law concerns assistance to friendly states in putting down riots, insurrec-
tions, rebellions, and civil wars, as well as incursions from other states. A 
state has an absolute right to assist another state if it wishes to do so under 
such circumstances. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter refers to this 
right as the right of "collective self-defense" and provides that nothing in 
the Charter shall impair "the inherent right of individual and collective 
self-defense." On the other hand, states are absolutely prohibited by inter-
national law from assisting rebels against the government of a state, even if 
hostilities reach the level of actual belligerency, as the Alabama episode 
demonstrates. The civil wars in the Congo and in Nigeria during the sixties 
were modern applications of the principle. There states were considered free 
to assist Nigeria in putting down the Biafran secession, and three states did 
so publicly, but no state was allowed to help Biafra." 
There have been many comparable applications of the principle of self-
defense throughout modern history, involving not only the protection of bor-
ders, but the protection of citizens and nationals in danger abroad; the elim-
ination of what a state perceives to be a threat to its national interests, like 
President Kennedy's limited use of force during the Cuban Missile crisis of 
1962," and interventions on. humanitarian grounds where organized govern-
ment has broken down." Israel, for example, had the right under interna-
tional law to use whatever force was reasonably required to gain the release

of iu citizens held hostage at Entebbe in 1976, and to attack PLO installa-
tions in Lebanon in 1982 and in Tunisia in 1985." The United States had 
the same right to use force when our Embassy staff was held in Tehran 
during the Carter Administration, and when citizens were similarly held in 
Beirut more recently." 
There arc many diplomatic episodes, arbitrations, and judicial opinions 
dealing with the legality of such uses of force under international law. The 
rule they represent is applied and discussed with striking uniformity at the 
professional level. This uniformity is hardly surprising, since the rule re-
flects the principle of the sovereign equality of states on which the system of 
world order is based." 
In addition, the United States like other countries has used force or the 
threat of force many times in support of its diplomacy, from the visit of 
Commodore Perry to Japan in 1853 to President Nixon's secret nuclear 
warnings that induced the Soviet Union not to attack Chinese nuclear in-
stallations in 1969. This behavior, too, is accepted as legitimate under inter-
national law in times of peace. 
How should this wide array of national power to use force internation-
ally. both in times of peace and of war, be exercised under the American 
Constitution - by Congress, by the President, or by both? Can there be a 
single rule applicable to situations of such unpredictable diversity, beyond 
the provision that only Congress can declare war?

the War of 1812, which was formally declared." There was a most contro-
versial Presidential proclamation of neutrality in 1793," backed thc next 
year by an equally controversial Neutrality Act, parts of which are still on 
the statute books." And in Jefferson's administration we indulged in .11 
trade embargo which proved to be as futile as every other act of economic 
warfare and stirred the first cry for secession in the nation's history." 
Out of the crucible of that experience there emerged a workable and 
consistent division of authority between Congress and the President with 
regard to the making and execution of foreign policy, including the toie of 
the national force. That division has survived with little change until the 
present time. It constitutes a pattern of cooperation and rivalry characteris-
tic of all our constitutional arrangements. Its main lines are determined by 
the nature of things. Only the President can conduct the day to day diplo-
macy of the nation and command its armed forces. Only Congress can pass 
laws needed to make conduct criminal," appropriate money, or 
give longer 
range policy a completely solid footing. As Judge Abraham D. Sofaer con-
eludes in his comprehensive study of the early constitutional development of 
the war power, the framework of executive-congressional relations achieved 
during the first eight years of the Constitution "differs more in degree than 
in kind from the present framework."" The President has inherent consti-
tutional rights and obligations, Judge Sofaer contends, to use the national 
force under many circumstances, at least until Congress acts to the con-
trary, and, absent valid legislative direction to the contrary, may well be 
considered to be "a sufficient embodiment of the national sovereignty to 
exercise its rights under the law of nations."" 
The controversy over Washington's Neutrality Proclamation of 1793 is 
a useful point of departure.

ated in 1778 by Benjamin Franklin." Those treaties were universally (and 
rightly) regarded in the United States as the rock on which the indepen-
dence of the nation was founded. Franklin's treaties seemed to require the 
infant Republic, in the event of war between France and Great Britain af-
ter the end of the Revolution, to side with France, protect the French colo-
nies in the Caribbean, and allow France to fit out privateers in the United 
States, conduct naval war from American ports, and hold consular prize 
courts in the United States. 
Any such course of action by the United States would have been an act 
of war against Great Britain, entitling Britain to respond with force. In 
1793, the United States could easily have been reconquered by Great Brit-
ain both from Canada and from the seas. The other frontiers of the nation 
were held by British or Spanish forces which could readily have attacked or 
incited Indians to do so. Spain was dubious both about the fact and the 
example of the American Revolution, and would become Britain's ally in 
the war with France. The United States had no navy at the time, and little 
by way of an army. Washington and his cabinet?including both Jefferson 
and Hamilton?were determined to preserve neutrality despite the treaties 
with France. They were equally agreed in advising the President not to call 
Congress into special session, because of the inflamed state of public 
opinion." 
With the passions of the Revolution still very much alive, the country 
was violently pro-French and anti-British, and the Jeffersonian party made 
enthusiasm for France and the French Revolution a political principle. As 
John Marshall commented in his book Life of Washington, "by a great 
proportion of the American people, it was deemed almost criminal to re-
main unconcerned spectators of a conflict between their ancient enemy and 
republican France."2 
Some argued that since only Congress could adopt a Declaration of 
War, only Congress could adopt a Declaration of Neutrality. To their 
minds, Congress' authority to declare war included every possible facet of 
the sovereign national power to use force or not to use it: to avoid the ap-
parent obligation of the treaties, or to embrace them heroically. 
Hamilton recommended that the President side-step the issue. In his 
view, Franklin's treaties did not apply because they were defensive in char-

acter and France had declared war on Great Britain. If the President con-
sidered this construction too controversial politically, Hamilton advised him 
not to recognize the revolutionary government in France, nor to receive its 
Minister, the notorious Citizen Genet, thus suspending the treaty until a 
better day; or, in any event, to make his interpretation of the treaties a 
condition of receiving Genet. All sides in the controversy agreed that the 
President had the sole power of recognizing foreign governments. Jefferson 
supported the policy of neutrality, although in deference to his pro-French 
sensibilities the word "neutrality" was avoided in the Proclamation the 
President finally issued. But Jefferson was offended by the thought that rev-
olutionary America, which had dealt happily with Bourbon France as an 
ally, might treat republican France as a pariah. If the President decided to 
receive Genet, Hamilton replied, he should issue the Proclamation on his 
own authority." 
Hamilton's exposition of the President's power to act under the circum-
stances was published after the event in a series of seven newspaper articles, 
signed Pacificus. They are one of the neglected masterpieces of our litera-
ture both about the Constitution and about our foreign policy." 
The Proclamation of Neutrality had two functions, according to Ham-
ilton: (1) to notify the world that the United States was at peace with both 
belligerents, and intended to respect its international law duties of neutral-
ity towards each; and (2) to warn United States citizens to abstain from 
acts which would contravene these duties and thus risk dragging the United 
States into war. The issuance of the Proclamation necessarily rested on the 
President's opinion that under the circumstances the United States was not 
bound to execute certain key features of the treaties with France. Does the 
President have the authority to make such a decision, and act on it, at least 
in the first instance? 
Hamilton's answer is a categorical "yes." The same answer would be 
generally accepted today. A recent instance of the exercise by a President 
of his power to act on his own interpretation of a treaty was President 
Carter's decision that he could exercise the authority of the United States 
pursuant to its Security Treaty with the Republic of China to terminate 
that Treaty in accordance with its text on one year's notice."

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 13 
As for the particular problem of neutrality, the constitutional power is 
joint and several?a concurrent power. Both the President and Congress 
can proclaim neutrality, each in its respective sphere. Congress' view is nec-
essarily final. But circumstances often make it prudent for the President to 
act quickly and decisively, and the President's action can affect the situa-
tion with which Congress may have to deal later. 
A Proclamation of Neutrality, Hamilton pointed out, is a normal and 
proper act for a government determined to remain at peace. Its principal 
purpose is "to prevent the nation's being responsible for acts done by its 
citizens, without the privity or connivance of the government, in contraven-
tion of the principles of neutrality, an object of the greatest moment to a 
country whose true interest lies in the preservation of peace."Can such a 
proclamation be issued by the President alone, or does it require an act of 
Congress? Hamilton's argument for Presidential power goes to the essence 
of the problem the nation faced: "a correct mind," he wrote, "will discern 
at once that it can belong neither to the legislative nor judicial department, 
and therefore of course must belong to the executive."" The President, not 
Congress, is charged with conducting the foreign relations of the United 
States. Congress is not responsible for making or interpreting treaties and is 
"not naturally that member of government which is to pronounce on the 
existing condition of the nation with regard to foreign powers or to admon-
ish citizens of their obligations and duties in consequence; still less is it 
charged with enforcing the observance of those obligations and duties." 
The proclamation of neutrality did not alter the legal status of the nation 
with regard to the war raging in Europe and on the seas; it simply called 
attention to the fact that the United States continued to be at peace with 
both belligerents, a condition only Congress could change. The question 
could not be submitted to the courts, which have jurisdiction over treaties, 
to be sure, but only when contending parties bring such matters before 
them as part of a justiciable controversy. As everyone at the time knew, 
Washington had asked the Supreme Court for its opinion on the matter, 
and the Court had refused, on the ground that it was not authorized to 
issue advisory opinions, but only to decide actual cases or controversies." It 
follows, Hamilton concludes, that since the United States has the power 
and the duty under international law to make its neutrality clear promptly, 
and since neither Congress nor the courts can carry out that duty effec-
tively, it must be considered the function of the executive, who conducts the

foreign relations of the United States; interprets treaties in the first instance 
in cases where the courts are not competent?that is, between government 
and government; is the power charged with the execution of the laws, of 
which treaties form a part; and is Commander-in-Chief of the armed 
forces." 
This "natural and obvious" view of the matter, Hamilton continued, 
anticipating the magisterial style of some of Marshall's greatest opinions, is 
not precluded by the language of the Constitution. The grant of the execu-
tive power of the United States to the President in the Constitution is com-
prehensive; the mention of certain aspects of the executive power in the 
document does not confine the President's authority to those enumerated. 
Under the Constitution, the President has the full executive power of the 
nation -- that is, the powers of the British Crown, subject only to the ex-
ceptions and qualifications stated in the instrument. Among those excep-
tions and qualifications, of course, is the right of Congress "to declare war, 
and grant letters of marque and reprisal." "It deserves to be remarked," 
Hamilton said, "that as the participation of the Senate in the making of 
treaties, and the power of the legislature to declare war, are exceptions out 
of the general 'executive power' vested in the President, they are to be con-
strued strictly, and ought to be extended no further than is essential to their 
execution."" Jefferson later expressed the same view that Congress' war 
power should be strictly construed as an exception to the President's execu-
tive power. 
In the exercise of its power to declare war, Hamilton continued, Con-
gress can and should consider whether the treaties with France put the 
United States under an obligation to make war. But before Congress acts, 
the President has the same right of judgment in fulfilling his own obligation 
to conduct the foreign relations of the country in accordance with its best 
interests as he perceives them." Because of the division of the executive 
power in the Constitution, the authority of Congress and of the President in 
this regard is concurrent. Congress has the last word, but often under cir-
cumstances carefully arranged by the President acting independently. Nor-
mally, the procedure adopted to deal with the emergency represents the 
best judgment of the President and the Congressional leadership as to the 
most appropriate way to reach the end they both have in mind, taking polit-
ical reality into account. To make delicate judgments of this kind and im-
portance is the quintessence of the President's political responsibility as 
President ? his share in the nation's sovereign prerogative. 
To recapitulate Hamilton's reasoning from the vantage point of mod-

ern constitutional law: Since the nation has all the powers conferred on 
pates. by international law, each of those powers must exist somewhere in 
she government. If they are not within the judicial province, and could not 
be or have not yet been exercised by Congress, the President may exercise 
them both in his own right as holder of the executive power and as the 
embodiment of the residual sovereignty of the United States." 
Hamilton's Pacificos Papers were so influential that Jefferson, who wa-
vered badly on the issue of neutrality under the pressures of politics, in-
duced an unwilling Madison to reply. Madison's response, signed Helvidius, 
failed in its purpose, although it has remained a persistent dissenting view, 
and has recently been revived somewhat under the pressure of events." 
Hamilton's analysis of the Presidency leads logically to the conclusion 
that while only Congress can move the nation into a state of "public, notori-
ous. and general war," as that term is known to international law, the Presi-
dent can use the national force under all the other circumstances in which 
international law acknowledges the right of states to use force in time of 
peace. While the President alone has authorized most of the two hundred or 
snore international uses of force the United States has undertaken in time 
of peace, the pattern of practice is by no means so symmetrical. When it is 
politically possible for a President to do so, he prefers to obtain Congres-
sional support for his military actions before or after the event. No Presi-
dent can forget the outcry against "John Adams' Undeclared War," which 
helped make Adams a one-term President and killed the Federalist Party. 
The irony of the problem of course, is that obtaining congressional sup-
port for his actions does not always protect a President against the political 
storms normally stirred up by war. Poor John Adams had at least four stat-
utes to support his limited maritime war against France. They did him no 
political good. Later Presidents have had the same experience. As President 
Lyndon Johnson once remarked about the Vietnam War, 
I said early in my Presidency that if I wanted Congress with me 
on the landing of Vietnam, I'd have to have them with me on 
the take off. And I did just that. But I failed to reckon with one 
thing: the parachute. I got them on the takeoff, but a lot of them 
bailed out before the end of the flight."

ters not whether you win or lose, it's how you lays the blame.'"" 
This fact of American political life is one of the main reasons why the 
War Powers Resolution is so profoundly misconceived. It purports to re-
quire Congressional approval for every international use of the national 
force. But unless great national issues are at stake, most Congressmen and 
Senators prefer not to take responsibility for the President's use of the 
armed forces. It is a political risk they are happy to leave to the President. 
As Congressmen and Senators have often told me when, as a government 
official, I solicited their support for the President on the Hill, "The Presi-
dent has to do what has to be done. I want to be re-elected next year." 
The constitutional battles of the first generation after 1789 settled the 
respective roles of Congress and the President with regard to the use of the 
armed forces in the Hamiltonian mode. Later experience has only filled in 
the details. Until the War Powers Resolution was passed, the debate over 
the respective powers of the President and Congress was largely a matter of 
political rhetoric or ideological advocacy, not constitutional law. Congress' 
power to "declare" war does not embrace all aspects of the nation's author-
ity to use or threaten to use armed force in international affairs. And it does 
not mean that the national force can only be used if Congress has first 
approved the President's action through a declaration of war. In the early 
case of Talbot v. Seeman, dealing with a problem arising out of John Ad-
ams' Undeclared War, Chief Justice Marshall welcomed the fact that 
neither counsel in the case made any such claim." The Supreme Court 
commented in a comparable case, Bas v. Tingy: 
Congress is empowered to declare a general war, or congress 
may wage a limited war; limited in place, in objects, and in 
time. If a general war is declared, its extent and operations are 
only restricted and regulated by the jus belli, forming a part of 
the law of nations; but if a partial war is waged, its extent and 
operation depend on our municipal law . . . Nile acts of con-
gress have been analyzed to show that a war is not openly de-
nounced against France, and that France is nowhere expressly 
called the enemy of America: but this only proves the circum-
spection and prudence of the legislature."

Vietnam cases of 1971 to 1973, the courts have refused to sustain the pro-
position that the use of force by the President is unconstitutional except 
after a formal declaration of way by the Congress."" 
It is equally settled that it is constitutionally proper?indeed inevita-
blc?that the President can use or threaten to use the armed forces without 
any action by Congress both in support of his diplomacy and in situations 
where international law justifies the limited and proportional use of force in 
times of peace in order to deal with forceful breaches of international law 
by another state. 
President Andrew Johnson did not require an Act of Congress before 
sending 50,000 hardened troops to the Mexican border in order to help per-
suade France to withdraw its troops from Mexico at the end of our Civil 
War." Nor did President Truman need congressional permission, at a time 
of great tension with the Soviet Union over Greece and Turkey, before 
sending the battleship Missouri to Turkey with the body of a deceased 
Turkish Ambassador." For the same reason, President Kennedy acted con-
stitutionally in using a limited amount of force during the Cuban Missile 
Crisis, and threatening to use a great deal more if necessary, without the 
comfort of a statute behind him. The President did not seek Congressional 
action as the crisis approached, but the Congress passed and the President 
signed a law nonetheless. The statute was hastily drafted, however, and did 
not cover the situation President Kennedy actually faced, although it does 
cover the problems President Reagan faced in Grenada and is currently 
facing in Nicaragua. The Act provides that the United States is determined 
(a) to prevent by whatever means may be necessary, including 
the use of arms, the Marxist-Leninist regime in Cuba from ex-
tending, by force or the threat of force, its aggressive or subver-
sive activities to any part of this hemisphere; [and] (b) to pre-
vent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally supported 
military capability endangering the security of the United 
States." 
Thus military actions to preserve the nation's maritime rights, protect 
its citizens or other nationals abroad, or carry out its treaty obligations, do

not require Congressional approval, before or after the event. It is charac-
teristic that when Congress passed a Joint Resolution supporting President 
Wilson's extensive military operations in Mexico in 1914, it did not purport 
to "authorize" what President Wilson had done. Instead, it stated that the 
President was "justified" in his use of force in Mexico, and disclaimed any 
hostility toward the Mexican people or any purpose to make war on them." 
As the Supreme Court remarked in the great case in In Re Neagk, the 
President has the inherent power to use force without the support of a stat-
ute not only to enforce "acts of Congress [and) treaties . . : according to 
their express terms, [but also to protect] rights, duties, and obligations 
growing out of the constitution itself, our international relations, and all the 
protection implied by the nature of the government under the Constitu-
tion."'" This view of the Constitution echoes Chancellor Kent's comments 
early in the nineteenth century about the scope of the power of the govern-
ment to deal with the "great interests which relate to this country in its 
national capacity." 
LECTURE 11. 
Ill 
In the literature of the American Constitution, there has always been a 
minority view opposing the Hamiltonian gospel sketched in the first lecture. 
The dissenters, broadly speaking, interpret the foreign affairs powers of the 
nation in the constitutional spirit of those who opposed the ratification of 
the 1787 Constitution. Where Hamilton extolled a strong national govern-
ment, led by a strong President and a strong Congress, the ultra-Whigs 
argue for a weak national government, a weak President, and a somewhat 
stronger Congress, but a weak Congress nonetheless, checked and balanced 
at every turn by the states, the courts, and the people. Constitutionalists of 
this persuasion fear a strong national government, and above all a strong 
President, as dictatorship in disguise. With respect to foreign affairs, they 
fear that a Hamiltonian government could well drag the United States into 
foreign adventures which do not concern the security of the nation, and 
convert the ideal bucolic Republic of their dreams, the beacon of enlighten-
ment and the hope of mankind, into just another grubby imperial power. 
To people of this persuasion, it seems reasonable to suppose that if the 
United States were weak, pacifist, and unarmed, the predators of the jungle 
would fully respect its rights under international law. The constitutional 
doctrine of the ultra-Whigs fully matches their perception of world affairs.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 19 
They read the Constitution with suspicious literalism as a document impos-
ing limitations on government, and rarely granting power. And they are 
shocked and repelled by the Marsha!Ilan mode of constitutional interpreta-
tion, which Hamilton anticipated with grace and skill, and particularly by 
the notion of "inherent" or "implied" powers. The ultra-Whigs exemplify 
the naive jurisprudence of those who read text without context, and believe 
that every power of the national government must be grudgingly derived 
from "specific" words in the Constitution, rather than from the design and 
purposes of the Constitution as a whole and from its history as an instru-
ment of government. 
The fullest flowering of the ultra-Whig view with respect to the foreign 
affairs powers of the nation, including the war power, occurred during and 
after the Vietnam War, especially in connection with Congressional efforts 
to draft legislation which would restrict the President's authority to use the 
national force." There were many other manifestations of the ultra-Whig 
outlook. Congress sought to take advantage of President Lyndon B. John-
son's unpopularity and President Nixon's political weakness by passing a 
series of statutes which encroached on the President's authority to conduct 
the foreign relations of the country." But the successful campaign which 
achieved the War Powers Resolution in 1973 is by far the most important 
victory in the Congressional assault on the Presidency since the Vietnam 
War turned sour. 
I should make it clear that I participated in the controversy about the 
passage of the War Powers Resolution," and that I am and have been a 
firm opponent of unlimited Presidential discretion in using the armed 
forces, and a firm believer in the constitutional pattern of shared power 
between Congress and the President as it has evolved for nearly two hun-
dred years. The argument of my earlier articles is that the Hamiltonian 
principle of shared power, which requires cooperation and concurrence be-
tween Congress and the President as the exigencies of circumstance permit, 
cannot be reduced to a simple formula. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist

20 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 21 
Paper No. 23, the developments which may endanger the safety of the na-
tion and call for the use or the threat to use the national force are infinitely 
varied, so that "no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the 
power to which the care of it is committed." 
Since the early seventies, there have been a number of serious and well 
considered scholarly studies of the constitutional issues," as well as Judge 
Abraham D. Sofaer's meticulously careful War. Foreign Affairs, and Con-
stitutional Power: The Origins." In order to bring out the intellectual 
background of the War Powers Act, I thought it might be useful to begin 
by reviewing a few of the articles of that period published after my 1972 
article was written - articles which fairly represent the ultra-Whig view, as 
well as Professor Franck's important 1977 article, "After the Fa11," which 
derives from the same intellectual universe. I shall direct my observations 
here first to articles by Prof. Charles A. Lofgren, Prof. William Van Al-
styne, Prof. Francis D. Wormuth, and Mr. Raoul Berger." These writers 
offer related, but somewhat different hypotheses as restatements of the orig-
inal intent of the Founding Fathers embodied in the text of the 
Constitution. 
Mr. Berger believes that the Constitution "conferred virtually all of 
the warmaking powers" upon Congress, leaving the President only the 
power "to repel 'sudden attacks' on the United States." Professor Lofgren 
is more cautious. He says: "Waken together, then, the grants to Congress 
of power over the declaration of war and issuance of letters of marque and 
reprisal likely convinced contemporaries even further that the new Congress 
would have nearly complete authority over the commencement of war."" 
Lofgren carefully points out that in the cases arising from the undeclared 
war with France, "none of the Justices explicitly stated that only Congress 
might wage imperfect war, but that conclusion," he believes, "was clearly 
implicit in their remarks." He sums up in these terms: "Evidence from the 
years immediately following ratification of the Constitution thus cot-

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 21 
roborates the conclusion that Americans originally understood Congress to 
have at least a coordinate, and probably the dominant, role in initiating all 
but the most obviously defensive wars, whether declared or not.'47 
Van Alstyne reaches much the same conclusions as Berger, but with 
important variations on subsidiary issues. To Van Alstyne, the grant to 
Congress in Article 1 of the power "to declare war" includes by implication 
the power to authorize every possible use of the national force, save to repel 
attacks on the United States, its armed forces, or its citizens abroad. 
In Van Alstyne's view, the lodgment of the power to declare war in 
Congress forbids the sustained use of armed force by the President in the 
absence of a prior, affirmative, explicit authorization by Congress. Van Al-
styne would permit only one exception to the rule be distills from the text: 
an interim emergency defense power in the President to resist invasion or 
repel sudden armed attack until Congress can be convened to decide 
whether it will sustain or expand the President's defensive effort by specific 
declaration or, by doing nothing, require the President to disengage our 
forces from the theater of action." 
Berger and Wormuth appear willing to accept the holding in the Prize 
cases allowing Congress to ratify what the President has done in a situation 
of emergency." Van Alstyne does not agree. He sums up his analysis in this 
way: 
I. In the absence of a declaration of war by the Congress, 
the President may not sustain the-systematic engagement of mil-
itary force abroad for any purpose whatever. 
2. The interim use of military force solely to repel invasion 
of the United States or to relieve American citizens from an ex-
isting attack is an authorized executive war power granted by 
the Constitution. That power expires ex proprio vigore when the 
Congress has had reasonable opportunity immediately to con-
vene and to authorize the continuation or enlargement of hostili-
ties by express declaration. i.e., even the constitutional authori-
zation of emergency executive war power of immediate self-
defense terminates upon opportunity and failure of Congress to 
sustain it by express declaration. 
3. In the event that the Congress authorizes the initiation, 
continuation, or enlargement of military hostilities by express

declaration, the constitutional initiative of logistical, tactical, 
and strategic decision in the conduct of those authorized hostili-
ties belongs to the executive. 
4. A residual power of review and control is vested in the 
Congress through its continuing authority over appropriations, 
levies upon manpower, and its prerogative to modify or to repeal 
its declaration of war." 
Wormuth can accept no advance "delegation" of authority by Con-
gress to the President to determine the occurrence of defined events which, 
Congress says, require or authorize the use of force." Berger's position is 
almost the same. But Van Alstyne is willing to allow some small and con-
servatively construed practical leeway for the necessities of circumstance by 
way of Congressional delegation to the president of authority to use force in 
certain contingencies." It is difficult to sec how Berger and Wormuth can 
justify their purist positions, in view of the fact that since 1792 at least 
Congress has repeatedly joined its powers to those of the President in sup-
porting the use of force by the President under specified circumstances, e.g., 
in dealing with Indian raids and other attacks." 
These nuances aside, all three writers assert congruent positions?the 
President can act only as the agent of Congress in the use of force, except 
for a short time in narrowly defined emergencies directly affecting the terri-
tory or the armed forces of the United States. Some writers of this school 
go a quarter of an inch further and allow for the possibility?perhaps?that 
the President might be conceded to possess the authority to rescue citizens 
in distress abroad: a commonplace right which all nations have under inter-
national law and which the President of the United States has asserted and 
exercised repeatedly ever since the United States became a sovereign 
nation. 
IV 
According to the laws of logic, one fact inconsistent with a theory dis-
proves the theory. The hypothesis must be discarded and reformulated in 
terms which are consistent with the demonstrable evidence. 
Much can be said of the related theories of Messrs. Berger, Lofgren, 
Van Alstyne, and Wormuth as versions of the original intent of' the Found-
ing Fathers?their relationship, for example, to the President's autonomous

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 23 
constitutional authority over the conduct of foreign relations, which in 
troubled times has often involved the use of force or the threat to use it. But 
one fact looms up as the missing Hamlet of these four articles, a fact which 
conclusively disproves all their hypotheses at once: the treaty power, and 
the Founding Fathers' immediate experience with that power in connection 
with Benjamin Franklin's Treaties with France of 1778." 
The contemporary debate about the war powers of the President and of 
Congress is a response to the bitter experience of Korea and Vietnam. 
Those wars were fought under the authority of treaties?the United Na-
tions Charter in the case of Korea, and the Charter and the Southeast Asia 
Collective Defense Treaty in the case of Vietnam." Without reference to 
those treaties and to the respective role of the President and of Congress in 
making, interpreting, applying, and abrogating treaties, the conflicts in Ko-
rea and Vietnam would be constitutionally far more difficult to explain. But 
the treatment of the problem is cursory, at best, in all four of the articles 
selected for examination here. 
Van Alstyne recognizes the issue when he writes 
Even assuming a limited power in Congress to shift the determi-
nation to embark upon war to the President, under specified con-
ditions expressed in clear and definite guidelines, the transfer of 
such authority cannot be accomplished by treaty. The House of 
Representatives' prerequisite consent to this nation's involve-
ment in war was most deliberately required by the declaration of 
war clause after consideration of several alternatives, including 
the specific proposed alternative of vesting the power jointly in 
the Senate and President alone which was itself rejected. As the 
House does not consent to treaties, manifestly a treaty cannot be 
among the possible means of delegating its authority. To imply 
that the constitutional draftsmen could possibly have formulated 
a document so specific in its precautions against involvement in 
war while simultaneously creating an enormous loophole of ex-
clusive Senate power to give it away by simple treaty ratification 
is wholly without logic or evidence." 
Van Alstyne's argument is perfectly logical. Like many logical argu-
ments, however, it is destroyed by a page of history. 
While the attempt to reconstruct the Founding Fathers' state of mind 
is always shadowy and intangible work, and "original intent" can never be

24 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 21 
more than one guiding factor among many in the growth of the law, we can 
be certain of one feature of the original intent of the Founders: they ac-
cepted the possibility that the United States, like every other nation, could 
if it wished enter into treaties of military alliance. The United States had 
such an alliance with France, embodied in two treaties, plus a secret annex, 
a Treaty of Alliance, signed in Paris on February 6, 1778, ratified on May 
4, 1778, and abrogated by Act of Congress on July 7, 1798, and a Treaty of 
Amity and Commerce, signed on February 6, 1778, and ratified on May 4, 
1778." And the Founding Fathers regard the French alliance with grati-
tude and reverence as a pillar of the Nation's existence. Surely these two 
related treaties are covered by the provision of Article VI of the Constitu-
tion, that "all Mafia made, or which shall be made, under the Authority 
of the United States shall be the supreme law of the Land." 
For present purposes, two aspects of those treaties are of special impor-
tance: (1) the American guaranty of "the present possessions of the Crown 
of France in America" in Article 11 of the Treaty of Alliance; and (2) the 
provisions of Articles 21-29 of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which 
France, and many Americans, construed as authorizing France to fit out 
privateers and establish consular prize courts in American ports, in the 
event of war between France and Great Britain after the end of our War of 
Independence. 
The debate over the American policy of neutrality adopted in 1793 is a 
sufficient answer of principle to the argument made by Messrs. Van Al-
styne, Berger and Wormuth. Legally, Van Alstyne's argument against mili-
tary commitments by treaty cannot be admitted. Treaties and statutes are 
equally the supreme law of the land. Even tax and tariff problems are often 
handled by treaty, despite the Constitutional requirement that money bills 
originate in the House of Representatives. 
It is however, worth taking the argument a step further. In 1793, Pres-
ident Washington decided not to join France in war with Great Britain 
under the treaty and to declare our neutrality. Congress acted to the same 
effect a year later. Suppose, however, that the President's initial decision 
had gone the other way, and had in turn been duly supported, or not op-
posed, by Congress. Suppose President Washington had put garrisons and 
naval forces in the French islands of the Caribbean which were among the 
French possessions in America we had guaranteed to France "from the pre-
sent time and forever" under Article 11 of the Treaty of Alliance. Suppose 
he had convoyed vessels to those islands, and repelled British attacks on the 
vessels or the islands. 
Would it be possible under those circumstances to say that the Presi-

dent could not respond to attacks exactly as if they were "sudden" attacks 
upon the United States? When through a treaty, or through a joint resolu-
tion of the Congress, or both, the United States guarantees the territorial 
integrity and political independence of an ally, or of another nation, isn't 
the President duty bound to see to it that the treaty is faithfully executed? 
Can he take no steps to implement the guaranty, in order to head off a 
danger that might have to be fulfilled later by war itself, without the prior 
consent of Congress? Is it Constitutional for a treaty to declare, is Article 
5 of the North Atlantic Treaty does, that an armed attack against one or 
more of the allies shall be considered an attack against them all?" The 
declaration of the NATO Treaty flies in the face of the supposed constitu-
tional principles the four scholars selected for examination here, and, I 
should add, Professor Franck as well," find the original intent of the 
Founding Fathers. Their version of the Constitution would confine the Pres-
ident's emergency powers to attacks on the territory of the United States. 
Either the North Atlantic Treaty is unconstitutional, or their version of the 
original intent is inadequate and erroneous." 
The reasoning of Van Alstyne, Berger, Wormuth, Lofgren, and Franck 
would equally disable the United States from participating in the activities 
of the United Nations, as the peace-keeping policies adopted by the United

26 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 21 
In applying a treaty, there is clearly a spectrum of decisions which can 
and should be made, from the purely Presidential to the purely Congres-
sional. As the experience of 1793 attests, the President has an independent 
power to interpret and apply the treaty in the first instance, in the exercise 
of his share of the national authority to conduct foreign relations, a vital 
part of the Executive power. That is what the United States does every day, 
on the President's instructions, in voting at the United Nations. When such 
decisions involve coercive measures, or other substantive policies, Congress 
may tacitly accept the President's construction and application of the 
United Nations Charter, which is a treaty, or overrule it, as it did a few 
years ago in the case of an embargo on imports from Rhodesia." Exactly 
the same process occurs in the conduct of our affairs at the North Atlantic 
Council, the International Monetary Fund, and many other multilateral 
bodies based on treaties, executive agreements made under the authority of 
treaties or statutes, or purely Presidential executive agreements. 
This realistic sense of the wide range of policies and actions which may 
be involved in carrying out a treaty obligation animates the testimony of 
Secretary of State Dulles in his exposition of the Southeast Asia Collective 
Defense Treaty before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1954. 
Article IV of that treaty provides: 
I. Each Party recognizes that aggression by means of 
armed attack in the treaty area against any of the Parties or 
against any State or territory which the Parties by unanimous 
agreement may hereafter designate, would endanger its own 
peace and safety, and agrees that it will in that event act to 
meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional 
processes. Measures taken under this paragraph shall be imme-
diately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. 
2. If, in the opinion of the Parties, the inviolability or the 
integrity of the territory or the sovereignty or political indepen-
dence of any Party in the treaty area or of any other State or 
territory to which the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article 
from time to time apply is threatened by any fact or situation 
which might endanger the peace of the area, the Parties shall 
consult immediately in order to agree on the measures which 
should be taken for the common defense. 
3. It is understood that no action on the territory of any 
State designated by unanimous agreement under paragraph I of 
this Article or on any territory so designated shall be taken ex-
cept at the invitation or with the consent of the government

concerned." 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 27 
The Treaty, the Secretary said, was based on the inherent right of indi-
vidual and collective self-defense recognized in Article 51 of the United 
Nations Charter?a right whose initial exercise is not subject to the prior 
decision of the Security Council. So far as the United States is concerned, 
the Treaty includes "the understanding," in the words of President Eisen-
bower's transmittal statement, "that the only armed attack in the treaty 
area which the United States would regard as necessarily dangerous to our 
peace and security would be a Communist armed attack!" 
With regard to action under Paragraph I of Article IV?that directed 
against "armed attack"?Dulles said: 
The agreement of each of the parties to act to meet the common 
danger 'in accordance with its constitutional processes' leaves to 
the judgment of each country the type of action to be taken in 
the event an armed attack occurs. There is, of course, a wide 
range of defensive measures which might be appropriate de-
pending upon the circumstances. Any action which the United 
States might take would, for course, be in accordance with its 
constitutional processes." 
The term -armed attack" in Paragraph 1 of Article IV is the operative 
- phrase of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It is used in a number 
of other treaties and international documents. By 1954, it had a considera-
ble gloss, and a long history, embracing the support of revolution in Greece 
from Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria in the late forties to the attack on 
Korea.?' 
Berger does not discuss the meaning of the term "constitutional pro-
cess" in paragraph 1 of article IV: whether the President can act to initiate 
and conduct hostilities pursuant to the treaty, as President Truman did in 
Korea; or take preparatory and precautionary measures "short of war" 
without obtaining prior congressional approval; or whether every step under 
the treaty, from diplomatic consultation and secret or public warnings to 
deter an adversary, to the making of military contingency plans, requires 
prior Congressional assent. Van Alstyne, as was indicated earlier, takes the 
view that it is constitutionally impossible to consider treaties as a legitimate

basis for authorizing war. He therefore reads the treaty not as empowering 
the President to 'undertake the use of force, but as establishing an interna-
tional contractual obligation which requires the President to call Congress 
into special session if necessary, and requires Congress to make a declara-
tion of war if it intends to fulfill the treaty commitment by the use of 
force." 
- Secretary Dulles' testimony dealt with the full range of possible re-
sponses the United States might consider using once the President has de-
termined that "an armed attack" has occurred, thus justifying any country 
protected by the treaty to exercise its inherent right of individual and col-
lective self-defense under the United Nations Charter. In response to a 
question from Senator Smith, one of the signers of the treaty, be explained 
that the obligation under Section 1 of Article IV was substantially the same 
as that in the North Atlantic Treaty. Secretary Dulles' and Senator Smith's 
exchange is reported as follows: 
Secretary Dulles. You will remember, Senator Smith, the consti-
tutional debate which was evoked in relation to that clause in 
the North Atlantic Treaty, which said that an attack upon one 
is an attack upon all. It raised the question as to whether that 
automatically gave the President powers to exercise so that in 
the event of an attack upon Norway, for example, he would have 
exactly the same power as he would have if there was an attack 
upon New York or Washington. 
That matter was very fully debated in the Senate at the 
time. I had the honor of being a Member of your body at that 
time and participated in that debate. 
Therefore, when I had the responsibility of starting to nego-
tiate treaties in the Pacific, I felt that it would be preferable to 
adopt the language which was taken from the declaration of 
President Monroe, and which reflects our oldest and, in a sense, 
most respected foreign policy, the Monroe Doctrine, where we 
declared that an intrusion would be dangerous to our peace and 
security. 
Now, that was a formula which I recall that Senator Taft, 
who opposed the North Atlantic Treaty formula, has said would 
have been acceptable so far as he was concerned. 
It seemed to me that the practical difference between the 
two from the standpoint of its giving security to the other parties 
was not appreciable, and that it was better to avoid a formula

which would reopen the constitutional debate which took place 
in reference to that provision of the North Atlantic Treaty, so 
that formula was used in the Philippine Treaty, in the ANZUS - 
Treaties, it has been reproduced now in the Korean Treaty, and 
been reproduced in this treaty. 
I think that the difference practically is not great, but that 
the present formula does avoid at least a theoretical dispute as 
to the relative powers of the President and the Congress under 
these different formulas. 
Senator Smith. Well, this particular treaty which we have just 
signed and the other bilaterals that you have initiated might be 
said to have the Monroe Doctrine approach, which over a period 
of a good many years now has been very effective. This ap-
proach has accomplished the results that were sought originally 
by the Monroe Doctrine. We are practically giving a Monroe 
Doctrine warning here against aggression and we are standing 
by the votes that we took. 
Secretary Dulles. The language used here which has now be-
come, I would say, almost conventional with reference to these 
treaties, makes perfectly clear the determination of our Nation 
to react to such an armed attack. It does not attempt to get into 
the difficult question as to precisely how we act and precisely 
how the responsibilities are shared between the President and 
Congress. 
But as far as our national determination is concerned, it is 
expressed here; that is the thing that other countries are con-
cerned with, and the question of our internal procedures is not 
properly a matter of their concern, and, in fact, none of the 
countries with whom we have dealt are concerned about the dif-
ference in the, formula. 
Therefore I think it is better to use this language, which 
does avoid constitutional controversy, which has been used in 
these other treaties, and which stems from one of our oldest for-
eign policies, that of the Monroe Doctrine. 
In a sense, it is perhaps not quite as automatic as the other, 
but that would depend on circumstances. It is a clear determina-
tion of our national resolve, which I think will adequately serve 
to deter, if it is possible to deter at all."

The obligation of the United States in the event of an armed attack 
within the treaty area, as he made clear, is of course several, and not depen-
dent upon the prior agreement of other members of SEATO, except for the 
country concerned. That action could take many forms, including the use of 
mobile striking power against the source of the attack." Far from repudiat-
ing the precedent of President Truman's handling of the Korean war, Sec-
retary Dulles had the following colloquy with Senator Wiley: 
The Chairman. Well, in any case, I take it that paragraph 1 of 
Article IV applies?that part particularly?to meeting the com-
mon danger. Would it be in accordance with the constitutional 
processes? 
Secretary Dulles. Yes Sir. 
The Chairman. So whether it were the threat mentioned in Sec-
tion 2 or the common danger resulting from open attack, action 
could be taken only after consultation with Congress? 
Secretary Dulles. Yes Sir." 
Thus, both the Senator and the Secretary carefully avoided the view that 
the United States could act under paragraph I of Article IV only after a 
congressional declaration of limited or unlimited war. 
As for threats other than "armed attacks," Secretary Dulles testified: 
The danger from subversion and indirect aggression is dealt with 
in paragraph 2 of article IV, which meets this difficult problem 
more explicitly than any other security treaty we have made. It 
provides for immediate consultation by the parties whenever any 
party believes that the integrity of the treaty area is threatened 
by other than armed attack. The threat may be to the territorial 
inviolability or integrity, or to the sovereignty or political inde-
pendence of any party in the treaty area or any other state or 
territory to which paragraph 1 of the article may from time to 
time apply. The paragraph contains no obligation beyond con-
sultation, but the purpose of consultation is to agree on mea-
sures to be taken for the common defense. In its understanding 
with reference to article IV, paragraph I, the United States af-
firms that in the event of any aggression or armed attack other 
than Communist aggression it will observe the consultation pro-
visions of article IV, paragraph 2."

He was repeatedly questioned on the distinction between action under 
Section 1 and Section 2 of Article 4 of the Treaty. 
Senator Smith. Now, referring to Indochina where we are all 
very much concerned. According to a number of reports, one of 
the areas mentioned in the protocol, the present territory and 
jurisdiction of Vietnam, is in danger of falling under Communist 
domination. If that occurs, due to internal or external pressure, 
will the treaty involve us in measures to resist Communist con-
trol of the area? I think you answered that before, but 1 would 
like to get a clear answer as to whether a sudden movement tci-
ward Communist domination in South Vietnam would bring this 
treaty into operation. 
Secretary Dulles. Are you referring now to armed attack? 
Senator Smith. It would be armed attack; but suppose there 
were internal pressures?the subversive activity; was that not 
one of the questions we were trying to include? 
Secretary Dulles. Yes, I just was not clear as to whether your 
question is directed to article IV, paragraph 1, or article IV, 
paragraph 2. 
Senator Smith. Let us consider them both. Suppose there is an 
armed attack under article IV, paragraph I. I would think there 
would be no question in this instance, but if there is subversive 
activity which is threatening the integrity of South Viet-
nam?free Vietnam?would we feel that we were called upon 
under the treaty to give a danger signal and get together with 
our allies and consider it? 
Secretary Dulles. Well, article IV, paragraph 2, contemplates 
that if that situation arises or threatens, that we should consult 
together immediately in order to agree on measures which 
should be taken. That is an obligation for consultation. It is not 
an obligation for action. 
Of course, we are free to and taking measures already, 
apart from the treaty and before the treaty is enforced to assist 
in combating subversion in that area. 
But we can do much more effectively, I think what needs to 
be done, if the treaty is in force, and we have procedures for 
consultation under the treaty as to how to deal with these 
situations."

Secretary Dulles developed the idea further in an exchange with Sena-
tor Gillette. 
Senator Gillette. Mr. Secretary, I have just one question to ask. 
Referring to article IV again, the first section is clear. It states 
that each party recognizes an armed attack as threatening all, 
and agrees to act in meeting the common danger according to its 
constitutional processes. 
But section 2 provides that any similar threat, other than 
by armed attack will be met by consultation among the parties 
and agreement as to what action will be taken. ? 
Now, keeping those two things in mind, we come to the 
concluding paragraph, which states that we only recognize the 
obligation under section I in case of Communist aggression 
when we will proceed by our constitutional processes. 
Now, this is a hypothetical question?very improba-
bly?but one that I should like to have answered. In the event 
that there is armed attack in this area by other than a Commu-
nist country, does that mean that we, as a signatory cannot take 
any action in case of such armed attack in accordance with our 
constitutional processes until we have consulted with all the 
others and obtained agreement as to what we should do? 
Secretary Dulles. No sir. In that respect we retain entire control 
of our own policy, according to our own judgment. If there 
should be an armed attack which is not a Communist attack, 
affecting one of the parties to this treaty, the question of what 
we should do would then be determined by us as a matter of 
national policy. We would not be obligated under this treaty. 
Senator Gillette. May I supplement my question by saying I do 
not quite see why that follows. We provide by agreement that in 
case of an armed attack by a Communist country, we shall pro-
ceed, as you have just designated, by our constitutional 
processes, but we specifically provide in this concluding para-
graph that if there is an armed attack by any other than a Com-
munist country that we shall first consult with these associates 
and obtain their agreement before we take any action. 
Secretary Dulles. No. I think you have read into that more than 
it contains. 
Senator Gillette. Well, I hope I have. 
Secretary Dulles. It does not say that we will only act in agree-
ment or consultation. It does say that in that event we will be 
willing to consult.

Senator Gillette. No; it says that we will consult under the pro-
visions of article IV, paragraph 2. 
Secretary Dulles. Yes Sir. 
Senator Gillette. The language does not state that we will be 
willing to consult but before we take any action we "will" con-
sult under that provision and obtain agreement as to what action 
shall be taken. 
Secretary Dulles. No Sir. It does not say that we will consult 
before we act. All it says is we will consult. 
Senator Gillette. And that may be subsequent to action that we 
take? 
Secretary Dulles. It could be. 
Senator Gillette. That we take independently? 
Secretary Dulles. As you say, it is quite unlikely as a practical 
matter that we would act first, because as I indicated unless the 
armed attack is of Communist origin, it is difficult to say truth-
fully that is seriously affects the security of the United States. If 
communism throws aside all restraints and goes in for armed 
attack, then I think we can reasonably conclude that it is start-
ing on a course of action which is directly aimed at the United 
States, that we are the target. We could not say that truthfully 
in the event that there is an armed attack which occurred be-
tween two of the parties to this treaty, which would not be of 
Communist origin. That would not prove that there was any de-
sign against the United States. Therefore, we do not assume the 
same commitments in that respect. 
We do say that we will consult. We do not say that we will 
consult prior to any action. We merely say we will consult, 
period". 
There is thus no possible way to assert, as many do, that the obliga-
tions of the treaty could be carried out, so far as the Senate was concerned,. 
only by a vote of the entire Congress. Both the Senators and the Secretary 
preserved the full range of possibilities implicit in past practice, including 
the precedent of President Truman's pattern of action in Korea.

the Korean war unconstitutional." Cooper wished to clarify the point by 
statute, if he. could, by requiring congressional action to justify the use of 
force in behalf of treaty obligations "beyond the emergency authority of the 
executive."" His position fully accepted the authority of the President to 
take emergency action in carrying out treaty obligations, as President Tru-
man did in the first few hectic days and weeks of the Korean war, not with 
regard to the territory of the United States, but with regard to the territory 
covered by our treaty obligation?in that case South Korea, protected by 
the Charter of the United Nations. In this, Senator Cooper's position rests 
on the principles which governed President Washington's handling of the 
neutrality problem in 1793. 
In the Vietnam war, both the Presidency and Congress went beyond 
the formal pattern of Korea. Starting in 1957, the executive branch repeat-
edly invoked Article IV of the South East Asia Collective Defense Treaty, 
and characterized the activities of North Vietnam against South Vietnam 
as "deliberate aggression," invoking Section 1, not Section 2 of Article 
IV." So did the Council of the South East Asia Treaty Organization."

Truman's viev. of the matter?for the moment, at least?they could enjoy 
the best of both worlds."t' 
By concentrating here on the treaty-power aspects or the problem 1 do 
not mean to suggest that the President does not have some independent 
constitutional authority to use force, or to threaten its use, in the absence of 
treaty or advance congressional authorization through Joint Resolutions like 
the Middle Eastern Resolution of 1957 and 1961.'" These dimensions of 
the war powers have been extensively discussed elsewhere.'?' 
V 
Between the Congress of Vienna and the turn of the twentieth century, 
the United States was not a major action in world politics. We were a ward 
of the Eurocentered state system which governed the world in those days - 
and, on the whole, governed it a great deal more effectively than it has been 
governed since. The system of order conducted by the Concert of Europe 
left much to be desired in the realm of justice, although it did take the lead 
in abolishing slavery. But it did achieve a high degree of international 
peace, which proved to be a political environment congenial to rapid social 
progress throughout the world. 
Even during this period, the United States pursued an active regional 
foreign policy which involved the nation in three general wars and many

36 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 21 
the constitutional arguments of the Hamiltonians and the ultra-Whigs 
about the constitutional division of authority over foreign affairs between 
Congress and the President. 
There were five principal areas of international contention for the 
United States during the century before the United States became a deci-
sive factor in the world balance of power. 
A number of problems arose from the twin sacred texts of American 
foreign policy: George Washington's Farewell Address and John Quincy 
Adams' Monroe Doctrine. The Farewell Address laid down some practical 
rules for keeping the infant republic out of Europe's consuming political 
quarrels during times of relative peace and stability. Washington carefully 
recognized that periods of extraordinary convulsion in European politics 
might well require extraordinary remedies, including temporary alliances 
and participation in war. However, Washington advised the United States-
to take advantage of its distance from Europe by refraining from participa-
tion in the ordinary combinations and collisions of European politics." 
The obverse of the policy Washington recommended was that Europe 
should stay out of the political life of the Western Hemisphere. During the 
period of revolution against Spanish authority in South and Central 
America after 1815, Britain was concerned about the possibility that Spain, 
France, and even Austria might attempt to reconquer the former Spanish 
colonies, and thereby affect the equilibrium of Europe. The British Foreign 
Minister, George Canning, therefore proposed that Britain and the United 
States jointly adopt the principle of the Monroe Doctrine. The United 
States, equally alarmed by the possibility of new European intervention in 
the Western Hemisphere, but anxious not to be "a cock-boat in the wake of 
the British man of war," as John Quincy Adams remarked, announced the 
policy as its own. But the Monroe Doctrine would have been meaningless 
without the backing of Great Britain, the Queen of the Seas in those far off 
days.'" 
While American popular opinion gave these two eminently pragmatic 
documents an absolute character they did not have, they were and continue 
to be a powerful influence in the American mind. Perhaps it would be more 
accurate to describe them as a powerful part of America's collective 
unconscious.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 37 
The third factor in America's nineteenth century foreign policy which 
led to a good deal of international friction was the doctrine of Manifest 
Destiny. From the beginning, the American imagination was possessed by 
the glowing vision of the nation as a great empire stretching from the At-
lantic to the Pacific. Manifest Destiny was the driving force in American 
foreign policy, leading to the acquisition of Spanish Florida, the Louisiana 
purchase, the Transcontinental Treaty of 1819, .the Oregon ,Question, 
Alaska, and the Mexican War. The same impulse led also to the American 
presence in China and other parts of the Far East from the earliest days of 
the Republic; the opening of Japan in 1853; the acquisition of Hawaii and 
later of the Philippines, Guam, and the Marianas. 
The fourth key problem of our foreign policy during this period was 
the gradual disintegration of thy Spanish Empire and above all the revolt in 
Cuba at the end of the nineteenth century. 
Finally, the Civil War had critically important international dimen-
sions, which generated both diplomatic and constitutional controversy - the 
blockade; the long struggle to prevent British and French recognition of the 
Confederacy; the Alabama affair; and the expulsion of the French from 
Mexico. Constitutionally, President Lincoln's management of the tense 
early months of the Civil War is the supreme example of the Presidency as 
an independent branch of the American government. On issue after issue, 
the President acted alone on the basis of his inherent authority as Chief 
Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces; the Congress 
followed. 
The pattern of constitutional practice in the handling of these contro-
versies confirmed and deepened the Hamiltonian construction of the Consti-
tution which took shape during the first thirty-five turbulent years of the 
nation's experience under the Constitution of 1787. There were areas of 
foreign policy recognized as exclusively presidential - the recognition of 
governments, for example, and the conduct of diplomatic business. And 
there were exclusively congressional areas such as declarations of war and 
the enactment of other kinds of legislation. For the rest, Corwin com-
mented, "the Constitution, considered only for its affirmative grants of 
power capable of affecting the issue, is an invitation [to Congress and the 
President] to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign 
policy."0' 
Corwin's celebrated remark misses the Constitutional point. It is often 
read as criticizing the draftsmen of the Constitution for ambiguity and con-
fusion. In my view this is unjustified because sooner or later most aspects of 
the conduct of foreign affairs involve both legislative and executive deci-

sions. They are therefore the business of both Congress and the President, 
in a pattern which reflects no sharp lines of constitutional power but hun-
dreds of subtle and supremely political judgments about how the indispen-
sable cooperation between the branches can best be organized under the 
circumstances of the moment. It would have been foolish of the Founders, 
as well as impossible, to try to draw the line between executive and legisla-
tive power in the field of foreign affairs precisely and in detail. 
The flexibility of the constitutional arrangements for making and car-
rying out the foreign policy of the nation is not peculiar to the field of 
foreign affairs. As Madison saw from the beginning, the principle of the 
separation of powers does not mean that the three branches of the govern-
ment are really separate at all." For the most part their powers are com-
mingled. The branches are not independent but interdependent, and the 
preservation of the functional boundaries between the legislative and the 
executive depends as much on the conditioned reflexes of the political sys-
tem and the political strength of the President as on the occasional rulings 
of the Supreme Court. For example, Congress can establish a Civil Service 
Commission, but it would be unthinkable for Congress to interfere with the 
President's power to remove Cabinet officers and other high officials at will. 
The one occasion on which Congress sought to do so ? the Tenure of Of-
fice Act of 1867 ? became a constitutional crisis of extreme gravity, lead-
ing to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson." 
As Justice Brandeis once said, "The doctrine of the separation of pow-
ers was adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to 
preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid fric-
tion, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of 
governmental powers among the departments, to save the people from 
autocracy." 
VI 
The traditional tension between Congress and the President with re-
spect to the making of foreign policy in general, and the use of the armed 
forces in particular, was greatly intensified during the Twentieth Century. 
The cause of this phenomenon was not the malign ambitions of Presidents 
who dreamed of becoming emperors, or the supine passivity of Congress-
men and Senators who abdicated their historic responsibilities. The cause 
was quite different, and quite simple. The structure of world politics had 
changed profoundly. The state system governed by the Concert of Europe

collapsed in 1914. No new Great Power Concert has emerged to replace it ? 
a new grouping with the wisdom and the will to govern world politics as the 
Concert of Europe did in the century which followed the Congress of Vi-
enna. For the United States, the era of free security was over. 
After 1914, we began reluctantly to realize that if our primary na-
tional security interest, that in preserving the world balance of power, was 
to be assured, we should have to take an active part in the process of doing 
so. There was no alternative. Thus the United States felt impelled to fight 
in both World Wars in order to prevent Germany from conquering Russia 
and thereby achieving an unacceptable accumulation of power. In 1949, 
alarmed by Soviet expansion, we helped to organize NATO in order to pre-
vent the Soviet Union from gaining control over Germany and Western 
Europe. 
The two World Wars and the dissolution of all the European Empires, 
except for the Russian, caused a profound change in the balance of world 
power and the magnetic field of world politics. Europe ceased to be the 
center of 'the world political universe. The Concert of Europe could no 
longer manage the system of world public order. Japan and the Soviet 
Union were factors in world affairs on a new scale. The United States, no 
longer a peripheral adjunct to the European system, faced altogether new 
tasks in attempting to protect its national security. In 1823, when Canning 
suggested the policy now known as the Monroe Doctrine, he said he was 
calling in the New World to redress the balance of the Old. Since World 
War 11, the United States has had to play Britain's role as arbiter of the 
world balance of power. No other power could organize and lead the coali-
tions required to contain the Soviet Union's thrust for dominion, especially 
because of the history of the nuclear weapon. 
This transformation of the American national interest in world politics 
naturally stimulated an active debate within the United States both about 
the ends and the means of foreign policy and imposed new strains on the 
American political system. That debate reached an explosive climax during 
the early Nineteen-seventies. The bitter and prolonged war in South East 
Asia dragged on, to the accompaniment of anti-war rioting and disorder of 
a kind the nation had not experienced since the Draft Riots of the Civil 
War period and the troubles of Reconstruction. At the same time, the con-
troversy over President Nixon's behavior with respect to the Watergate 
scandal envenomed the political atmosphere, and produced so strong a 
movement for the President's impeachment that in August, 1974,?less 
than two years after his triumphant reelection in 1972?President Nixon 
resigned.

ity in Congress succeeded in passing the War Powers Resolution of 1973.11* 
Its nominal purpose was to assure the people that a vigilant Congress could 
and would protect the nation against future Vietnams. The political goal of 
Congress in its perennial war with the President, however, was quite differ-
ent. That goal was to take advantage of President Nixon's weakness and 
annex some Presidential territory as its own. For the first time in nearly two 
hundred years, the Hamiltonian view of the Presidency suffered at least a 
nominal defeat. 
The Resolution is an assertion of Congress' claim to supremacy with 
regard to the war power, but it does not adopt an extreme form of the 
ultra-Whig view. It does not say, for example, that the national force can 
be used by the President only if Congress has first passed a Declaration of 
War. Nor does it adopt the position that the President's right to use force 
without the prior approval of Congress is confined to cases of "sudden at-
tack." On the contrary, it acknowledges what history and common sense 
make obvious?that in the nature of world politics there will be many occa-
sions when the United States, like other nations, will have to use force 
quickly and decisively in order to protect its security, and that the President 
is the only possible representative of the nation capable of carrying out such 
actions. This is the essence of the argument for an "energetic" President 
which echoes through.the Federalist papers. 
The War Powers Resolution begins with the statement that its purpose 
is to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution, and purports to 
summarize their intent in three propositions: (1) the armed forces should 
not be introduced into or continued in hostilities or situations where they 
might well become involved in hostilities without the collective judgment of 
both the Congress and the President; (2) Congress has the power to pass all 
laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers of the 
President; (3) the constitutional powers of the President as Commander in 
Chief can be exercised by him to introduce the forces into hostilities or into 
situations where their imminent involvement in hostilities is "clearly indi-
cated by the circumstances" only pursuant to a declaration of war, "spe-
cific" statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by an attack 
upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces. It 
will be noted at once that this attempt at restatement omits any reference 
to treaties and the role of the Senate. 
Section 3 requires the President to "consult" with Congress "in every 
possible instance" before introducing the armed forces into hostilities or 
into situations where hostilities are an imminent risk, and also to "consult" 
regularly with Congress after hostilities have begun until they are

terminated 
"Consultation" between the President and Congress is not a term of 
constitutional import. The President cannot consult with "Congress." He 
can consult only with members of Congress and of course he does so in a 
early continuous political process that occurs in many forms?through 
meals, telephone calls, poker games, meetings over drinks or more solemn 
meetings between Congressional leaders and the President at the White 
House, funerals, weddings, and so on. The Resolution makes no attempt to 
define the word "consultation," and none is possible. The injunction requir-
ing the President to "consult" with Congress is meaningless piety. Congress 
has many vital functions in the political 'process. Its debates help to lead 
and crystallize public opinion, the ultimate source of political power in a 
democracy. Its Committees can serve as the Grand Inquest of the nation, 
investigating, probing, and proposing. But Congress can act only as a col-
lective body, by enacting legislation. The Constitution confers certain legis-
lative powers on Congress, and it can have no other powers. Furthermore, 
Congress cannot command the President to "consult" with a particular 
member of Congress any more than it can tell him who his Secretary of 
State or his most trusted advisers should be. Any such attempt would inter-
fere with the President's most sensitive executive discretion, that of political 
leadership. 
The fourth section of the Resolution requires the President to report to 
Congress within forty-eight hours and regularly thereafter whenever he has 
introduced armed forces into hostilities or into situations risking involve-
ment in hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war. Section 5 is paired 
with Section 4, and provides that the President shall terminate any use of 
the armed forces coming under Section 4 within sixty days, unless Congress 
has declared war or enacted a specific authorization for the use of the 
armed forces in another form, or extended the sixty-day period to not more 
than ninety days upon certification by the President that unavoidable mili-
tary necessity requires an extra thirty days. Subsection (c) of Section 5 
provides that where hostilities are being conducted abroad without a decla-
ration of war or a "specific" statutory authorization in another form, Con-
gress may require the President to terminate hostilities and remove the 
armed forces by concurrent resolution?that is, a resolution not signed by 
the President or passed over his veto. Subsections (b) and (c) of Section 
5?the guillotine provisions?are the heart of the Resolution. 
Sections 6 and 7 undertake to establish procedures purporting to bind 
future sessions of Congress to consider issues arising under Section 5 expe-
ditiously. Section 8 prescribes that Presidential authority to use the armed 
forces shall not be inferred from any statute unless it "specifically autho-
rizes the introduction of United States armed forces into hostilities, . . . 
and states that it is intended to constitute 'specific' statutory authorization

within the meaning of this joint resolution," and that no treaty shall be 
deemed to authorize the President to use the armed forces unless it is im-
plemented by legislation of the same tenor. The Section concludes with the 
ineffable thought that nothing in the Resolution is intended to alter the 
Constitutional authority of the Congress or the President. This Section, too, 
with its emphasis on "specificity," is legal nonsense. Where would it leave 
the reasoning of Morbury v. Madison or McCullogh v. Maryland? 
If the War Powers Resolution were to be carried out literally, it would 
constitute the most fundamental change in the Constitution ever accom-
plished?far more drastic in its effects than the shift of authority from the 
states to the national government which began after the Civil War. It 
would reduce the Presidency, as Senator Javits had urged, to the status of 
General George Washington as Commander-in-Chief during the Revolu-
tion, subject to the orders of an omniponent Congress and its officious Com-
mittees." The deterrent influence of American treaties, already weakened 
by the experience of Vietnam, would decline even further. The United 
States would be the only country in the world which lacked the capacity to 
enter into normal treaties and alliances and to conduct secret negotiations 
where the use of force was in question, and it would be hampered in many 
others ways in the conduct of its foreign relations. 
Enforcing the Resolution would produce all kinds of paradoxes. No 
President could do what Lincoln did during the Civil War, what Franklin 
Roosevelt did during the tense period before Pearl Harbor, or what Ken-
nedy did during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. But the legal arrange-
ments for the Vietnam War would have fully satisfied the requirements of 
the War Powers Resolution of 1973. That war was authorized not only by 
the United Nations Charter and the Southeast Asia Collective Defense 
Treaty of 1954, but by the highly "specific" Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 
1963 and other explicit acts of Congress as well. Above all, as has been 
evident in the thirteen years since it was passed, the Resolution would con-
vert almost every serious problem of American foreign policy into an acrid, 
arid, and irrelevant debate about constitutional power, making our proce-
dures for the conduct of foreign relations even more cumbersome and con-
tentious than they are already. 
Constitutional theology is our national passion. Every American heart 
beats faster when we try to divine the intentions of the Founding Fathers 
from materials Justice Jackson once said were "almost as enigmatic as the 
dream Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharoah." Such exercises are 
more than lively sport and evidence of our profound commitment to the rule 
of law. When guided by error or wishful thinking, or when they transcend 
the permissible limits of construction in interpreting the policies and Ian-

guage of the Constitution, they can do a great deal of harm?witness the 
Neutrality Act of 1939,11' which helped to convince Hitler that the United 
States would never help Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the 
War Powers Resolution, which similarly hobbles our diplomacy, makes de-
terrence less credible, and therefore greatly increases the risk of major war. 
The methods of the ostrich are of no avail in the realm of foreign affairs. 
The War Powers Resolution is in profound conflict with the necessities 
of governance in the turbulent world of the late twentieth century and with 
the Presidency which has evolved from the experience of the nation under 
the Constitution of 1787. It is therefore safe to anticipate that the 
Hamiltonian conception of the War Powers to which Washington, Lincoln, 
both Roosevelts, Wilson, and Truman made such notable contributions will 
prevail as the constitutional norm, and that the War Powers Resolution will 
become a footnote to history, either through repudiation or desuetude. 
Institutional pride may keep Congress from confessing error and re-
pealing the Resolution directly, although a face-saving repeal disguised as a 
revision is not unthinkable. The courts will almost surely declare the Reso-
lution unconstitutional if an appropriate case should arise. The 1983 ruling 
of the Supreme Court in I.N.S. v. Chadha"' is fully applicable to the chief 
operative part of the War Powers Resolution, Section 5. According to that 
section, the President's authority to use force evaporates unless, within sixty 
days, Congress votes a Declaration of War or a statute supporting the Pres-
ident's use of force in limited war. Section 5 also allows Congress to termi-
nate a Presidential use of force within the sixty-day period, or at any time 
in the future (even after it has once voted to support the President's use of 
force) by Concurrent Resolution, that is, by a Resolution passed by both 
Houses of Congress but not signed or vetoed by the President. 
Section 5 is a classic example of the legislative veto, a modern develop-
ment in legislation. It purports to reserve to Congress the power to termi-
nate or reverse a President's action under a statute or even to repeal the 
statute by Concurrent Resolution. The practice originated in 1932, at the 
dreariest point of the Great Depression, when a doomed Republican Presi-
dent faced a vigorous Democratic Congress already scenting the blood of 
pov,er. Since then nearly two hundred such statutes have been forced upon 
protesting Presidents. They authorize both Houses, or one House, or even a 
112 Neutralit) Act of 1939, 22 U.S.C. ? 441 (1982).

Congressional Committee to enact legislative vetoes, often in statutes of the 
greatest importance, like the War Powers Resolution of 1973. 
But Chadha ruled that Congressional action can have legislative effect 
only through Acts or Joint Resolutions fully subject to the President's veto. 
If Congress cannot terminate a war by passing a Concurrent Resolution, it 
can hardly do so by not passing such a Resolution. 
Section 5 is not separable from the rest of the War Powers Resolution. 
Without Section 5, the statute is devoid of substance. As was pointed out 
earlier,'" the provisions about "consultations with Congress" are at best an 
admonition or a prayer. Even the reporting requirements of Section 4, 
which seem innocuous at first glance, may well be unconstitutional as a 
usurpation of the President's discretion in the conduct of foreign relations, 
and especially of his discretion to use force in situations short of general 
and unlimited war. Should the President trumpet to the world the substance 
of a secret warning or signal designed to deter a hostile move by another 
power? It will normally be easier for a target state to heed a secret warning 
than a public one. Can Congress require the President to make all such 
warnings or signals public? 
The Chadha case has not been popular in the law reviews." Professor 
Tribe's treatment of the case is characteristic of a currently fashionable 
view among law professors and law journal editors. It appears as Chapter 6 
of Constitutional Choices."' Tribe mentions the application of the Chadha 
decision to the War Powers Resolution obliquely, discussing it in a series of 
footnotes."' 
The first sub-heading of Tribe's chapter gives the reader a clue to the 
thrust of the author's argument: "The Judiciary's Renewed Assertion of 
Structural Checks on Congressional Innovation." The topic sentence of the 
first paragraph sounds the theme: "At least since 1976, the Supreme Court 
has been anything but receptive to Congress' more innovative assertions of 
authority." A page later Tribe identifies such "innovative assertions of 
authority" by Congress as "the pragmatic accommodations of our times" to

the development of administrative agencies and other extensive "delega-
tions" of legislative authority.'" A page further on, it is suggested that the 
legislative veto appealed both to those who oppose the executive regulation 
of American life and industry and to their opponents "who resist deregula-
tion but espouse increased democratic control over those regulations which 
remain."'" We are not told why Presidential and judicial controls over the 
activities of the executive branch are inadequate or "undemocratic," or at 
least less "democratic" than Congressional controls, especially when Con-
gressional controls like the legislative veto preclude judicial review. 
One of the basic structural features of the Constitution is what Corwin 
palled "the divided initiative" in legislation, the President's capacity to veto 
bills passed by a simple majority of both Houses, and Congress' capacity to 
override such vetoes promptly by a two-thirds majority. Wilson thought the 
President's veto power was his most important prerogative. The veto is cer-
tainly one of the most important tools available to the Presidency. Starting 
long before 1976, the Supreme Court, has gone to great lengths to safe-
guard both the President's veto and Congress' capacity to override it." 
It is therefore hardly surprising that many serious students of Ameri-
can politics do not perceive the legislative veto as an "innovative assertion" 
of democratic legislative authority or "a pragmatic accommodation" to the 
development of administrative law, but a naked grab for Congressional 
supremacy intended to transform the American President into a weak 
Prime Minister. Tribe gingerly concedes that such concern with Congres-
sional encroachment on the President's power might justify the conclusion 
that some (unspecified) legislative vetoes are unconstitutional. He denies, 
however, that the issue was raised by Chadha, in which the Supreme Court 
said that all legislative vetoes are unconstitutional." 
The Chadha case involved the deportation of an alien by the vote of 
one House of Congress, reversing a decision in favor of the alien by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Tribe nowhere tells us flatly 
whether he considers the Court's decision to be right or wrong, although he 
clearly prefers the position taken in Justice White's dissent. Apart from his 
cursory reference to a desire to bring administrative agencies under "demo-
cratic" control, he makes no attempt to examine the problem of the legisla-
tive veto in its broader setting of history and constitutional policy and of its 
application to the President's executive authority, particularly in the field of 
foreign affairs. Instead, he indulges in a few pages of verbal jousting with

the arguments of the Court's opinion in the pyrotechnical style of "Paper 
Chase." Tribe thinks he has disposed of the logical contradictions and infe-
licities of the Court's opinion and left the decision in intellectual ruins as a 
"mystery." 
But has he? Tribe says it is hard to refute the Court's thesis, which he 
ridicules as the proposition that "a law is a law is a law," and adds that the 
Court's statement "sheds little light on why the veto at issue in Chadha was 
so law-like' an action that it 'had' to be deemed legislative."4 A few 
paragraphs later, however, he commends Justice Powell for his contention 
that the legislative veto provision ruled upon in Chadha was a bill of attain-
der. Tribe says the decision in Chadha might be deemed defensible on this 
ground." 
A bill of attainder is punishment imposed by legislation rather than by 
judicial action. Is Powell's argument therefore really different from Bur-
ger's? The vote of the House of Representatives deemed unconstitutional in 
Chadha purported to have effect, in Justice Powell's view, as a legislative 
punishment. What Powell and Tribe contend in effect is that is would have 
been an unconstitutional bill of attainder if it had been approved by both 
Houses and signed by the President, and therefore must be condemned as 
doubly unconstitutional because it was passed by one House and not signed 
by the President. Alternatively, Tribe could have said that the bill of attain-
der issue was not reached because what purported to be "legislation" was 
passed by one House only, and not signed by the President. In either case, 
isn't Tribe, like Burger, saying that "a law is a law is a law," for an ex-
tremely important reason of constitutional policy, namely, the protection of 
the President's veto? 
I have no difficulty with the Court's decision and opinion in Chadha, 
and believe they will and should survive as a bulwark against legislative 
encroachment on the executive power?a danger against which Madison 
warned eloquently in the Federalist. I should also contend that Chadha 
most emphatically applies to the problems of the War Powers Act, which 
purports to deal not only with the acts of the President under statutes and 
treaties, but also with exercises of his inherent and independent constitu-
tional power as head of the third branch of government. 
In holding the War Powers Resolution unconstitutional, the Court may 
well go beyond the Chadha case and deal with features of the Resolution 
which raise even more fundamental aspects of the separation of powers 
principle, for example, its effects on the President's power to conduct secret 
negotiations and on his hitherto unquestioned authority as Commander-in-

Chief to bring hostilities to an end, by receiving surrenders or negotiating 
cr.ase-fire or armistice agreements; and its attempt, recalling the thrust of 
the Bricker Amendment, to require legislation before treaties can actually 
be applied as the supreme law of the land." Even the reporting require-
ment of the Act, so innocuous at first glance, challenges the President's 
constitutional discretion in fundamental ways. Suppose there is growing 
tension in one or another troubled area of the world, and the President 
moves to protect our interests and at the same time prevent a crisis. He 
may wish to warn an adversary secretly, or signal our purposes by shifting 
troops to the theatre of possible conflict; going on alert; or taking a number 
of other possible measures of comparable import. It is usually easier for the 
adversarial power to heed such warnings if they are made secretly than if 
they are trumpeted to the world and thus become a matter of pride and 
prestige. Should Congress try to control the President's judgment on bow to 
handle so delicate a problem in the conduct of foreign relations? Under the 
Constitution, can it do so? 
If the Resolution is neither repealed nor declared unconstitutional by 
the Courts, it is bound to be ineffective nonetheless as an influence on the 
behavior of Presidents. It will be repealed in fact by a force more powerful 
than Congress or the Supreme Court, the nature of the problems of foreign 
policy and national security with which the government has to deal. It is 
striking, for example, that even at the height of the agitation which pro-
duced the War Powers Resolution, a Congressional vote rejected the propo-
sal to subject the President's control of the nuclear weapon to the proce-
dures of the Act." The most extreme of the ultra-Whigs who supported 
one or another version of the War Powers Resolution conceded that the 
control of the nuclear weapon has to be Presidential. 
At least eleven episodes involving the use of force or the imminent risk 
of using force occurred during the first decade after the War Powers Reso-
lution was passed. Several more have occurred since then. In each case the 
Presidents involved (except for President Carter) protested that the Resolu-
tion was unconstitutional, but made an effort at least to consult with Con-
gressional leaders and to keep Congress informed about the course of 
events. In no case did the procedure mandated by the statute prove conven-
ient or appropriate and in no case was it followed. And in each case the 
Resolution precipitated Congressional protests that the War Powers Resolu-
tion was being violated, and even that the President should be

impeached.'" 
VII 
This review of the controversy over the War Powers Resolution would 
be incomplete without a comment on Professor Thomas Franck's article in 
the American Journal of International Law, one of the most significant of 
the recent treatments of the subject." 
After recalling the pattern of constitutional practice with regard to the 
use of the national force much as it is described here, Franck writes: "None 
would deny that the rules relating to the conduct of our foreign relations 
have been fundamentally altered or restored to something nearer the classic 
intent of the Constitution's framers" by the recent assertion of Congres-
sional activism in seeking a larger role in the making of foreign policy and 
the conduct of foreign relations.'" It is one of the purposes of these lectures 
to puncture that familiar but altogether erroneous myth, a product of the 
self-deceptions so common during the Vietnam period. Unless we assume 
that the men who directed and debated the stormy diplomacy of the United 
States between 1789 and 1825?many of them alumni of the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787?knew less than we do about the "classic intent" of the 
Founding Fathers, the myth cannot survive even a cursory examination of 
the record. 
Professor Franck's argument suffers from an even deeper weakness. He 
allows his analysis and his prescriptions to be shaped by an untenable major 
premise. We should not be trying to guide the evolution of our constitu-
tional practice closer to what we imagine to be -the classic intent" of the 
Founding Fathers. Even if we could define that goal - and we cannot - it 
would not in itself be a relevant or appropriate objective for policy. The 
policy goals of the Constitution - effective government and democratic re-
sponsibility - should of course continue to govern the growth of our consti-
tutional law of foreign relations. That is the essence of the process through 
which any body of law grows. But the principle does not require us to cre-
ate a kind of Williamsburg Government, with Tip O'Neill costumed in silk 
knee britches and a wig. The problem facing the nation is to fashion and 
refashion the Presidency and Congress as responsible and cooperative insti-
tutions capable of carrying out a foreign policy adequate to the security 
needs of our times and of the foreseeable future. That is an entirely differ-

ent matter. 
Professor Franck gives his case away when he concedes that only the 
president can decide when to use the nuclear weapon. He quotes Professor 
Henkin with approval to the effect that the President's power to use the 
Nuclear weapon must include the power to execute a preemptive nuclear 
strike when the President and the President alone decides that a major at-
tack on the United States or its vital interests is imminent." If the Presi-
dent has this awesome power, on what conceivable ground can it be claimed 
that he lacks the inherent constitutional power also to use ordinary conven-
tional force, or to threaten its use, in order to limit, defuse, or resolve ordi-
nary diplomatic confrontations before they become catastrophic? Those 
who deem orthodoxy a serious problem in answering that question can take 
appropriate comfort from the fact that Presidents have used force to this 
cnd since we first had Presidents in 1789. 
Professor Franck refuses to follow this course. Instead, he would make 
the nuclear weapon an exception to an otherwise implacable rule, and re-
write the War Powers Resolution to that end. In other words, he would 
revise the Act? in order to achieve the goal of having Congress "participate 
fully" in making all decisions about the use of force except those involving 
the use of nuclear weapons. At various points in his article, he describes this 
goal as "healthy" and suggests that it was once the norm of practice, a 
suggestion conclusively refuted by the evidence he himself marshals." 
In order to accomplish "full participation" by Congress in decision 
making for situations within the ambit of the War Powers Resolution, Pro-
fessor Franck proposes a Congressional "consultation," not a vote. The per-
suasiveness of his conclusion is not enhanced by his assertion that "it is 
virtually beyond debate that some form of consultation is both legally and 
politically necessary." He recommends amending the War Powers Reso-
lution to meet President Ford's trenchant account of his adventures in at-
tempting to "consult" with Congressional leaders who were scattered at the 
critical moment between China, Greece, the Middle East, and Mexico. 
President Ford concluded that in times of crisis, decisiveness is every-
thing?and the constitution plainly puts the responsibility for such decisions 
on the President of the United States. There are constitutional limits on the 
Congress which cannot be legislated away."4 Professor Franck responds by 
suggesting that the War Powers Resolution be amended to designate ten 
congressional leaders as a committee to consult with the President before he

sends the armed forces into situations of conflict.'" 
Franck characterizes the provisions of the War Powers Act about trea-
ties as "a stunning and, in international law, perhaps illegal alteration in 
the conditions of U.S. accession" to the NATO Treaty, the Rio Pact, and 
presumably, other security treaties as well.'" After a page of discussion, 
however, he concludes that the provisions of the War Powers Resolution 
about treaties should be left untouched, although he says that under the 
Resolution all a President could do in the event that Germany or Japan 
were attacked would be to call Congress into special session. 
This feature of Professor Franck's article is its most startling and dan-
gerous proposal. It is incompatible with the basic thesis of Perez v. Brown-
MI" and many other cases that the United States has all the powers pos-
sessed by other states under international law ? in this instance, the power 
to make effective treaties of alliance ?and it flies in the face of what Presi-
dent Washington did and Alexander Hamilton wrote during and after the 
Neutrality Crisis of 1793. 
Writing in 1977 ? that is, before the decision in Chadha ?Professor 
Franck concluded that the concurrent resolution and guillotine features of 
Section 5 of the Resolution should be scrapped as unconstitutional. In their 
place, he recommends that Congress attempt to codify the circumstances in 
which the President could use the national force without prior approval by 
Congress, and then to have those limitations enforced by unenforceable ad-
visory opinions of the courts. The remedy of codification, as long experience 
has shown, is far worse than the disease, especially because Franck would 
confine the President's inherent constitutional authority to use force to cases 
of attack on United States territory, its armed forces, and "perhaps" its 
citizens abroad. The provisions he suggests for having the courts act as um-
pire of the revised Act?without the power to order compliance?are cer-
tainly unconstitutional under Article III, since they would require the 
courts to perform non-judicial functions. Even more important, they would 
further clog the conduct of our foreign relations. Franck reproaches Con-
gress for not insisting on Presidential compliance with the War Powers Res-
olution, and wants to give the task to the courts. But Congress' refusal thus 
far to insist on Presidential compliance with the War Powers Resolution has 
rested in each case on sensible political judgments. This is precisely the 
kind of judgment the nature of the issues requires. Strict judicial compli-
ance procedures would only make a difficult problem unmanageable.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 51 
VIII 
Once the constitutional aberration of the War Powers Resolution has 
been digested and forgotten, it will be apparent again that the President 
and Congress, separately and together, have been entrusted by the Consti-
tution and by its history with sovereign prerogatives in exercising the for-
eign affairs and war powers of the nation. Those prerogatives have been in 
uneasy balance for two hundred years. Over a wide range, the President 
and Congress can exercise their discretion as a matter of their joint or sev-
eral political judgments in dealing quickly with complex and swiftly moving 
events on the basis of often fragmentary information. The only constitu-
tional restraints on which the people can rely to secure them from the abuse 
of such discretion, as Chief Justice Marshall commented in Gibbons v. 
Ogden, is the electoral process itself.'" 
This conclusion applies, 1 hasten to add, only to the truly political deci-
sions Presidents and Congress make about foreign affairs and the use of the 
national force. I do not mean to question the constitutional rightness of 
decisions like Ex parte Milligan,'" Youngstown Sheet and Tube,'" Cov-
ert,'" Kent v. Dulles,'" and other cases in which the courts have held that 
certain decisions purporting to be based on the foreign affairs and war pow-
ers of the nation unjustifiably trespassed on the legislative powers of Con-
gress or the rights of citizens. On the contrary, I revere that line of deci-
sions as one of the finest justifications of our claim to be a nation under law. 
The real lesson of the War Powers Resolution, I suggest,?and the 
main lesson of the Vietnam experience of which it is a part?is the primacy 
of substance over procedure. We try to devise procedural solutions for 
problems like Vietnam because the leaders of our public opinion have not 
achieved a national consensus about the kind of foreign policy the safety of 
the nation requires at this stage of world history. Part of the responsibility 
rests on our educational institutions which do not often train our youth to 
understand history, the processes of politics, and the phenomenon of war. 
Another part represents a failure of leadership. When the war in Vietnam 
became unpopular, far too many Congressmen were willing to forget their 
own repeated votes for the war, denounce what they called a Presidential 
war, and assure their constituents that no President in the future would be 
able to lure America into war by "stealth." 
Democracy will not survive?and will not deserve to survive?unless it

Mr. LIVINGSTON. I simply would point to his specific four summa-
ry points in support of my own statement against this legislation. 
Professor Rostow says that, in his opinion, "H.R. 3822 is uncon- - 
stitutional for four related reasons: 
"1. The bill would require the President to disclose information 
which Congress can request but not command the President to pro-
vide; 
"2. In fact, the bill does more than require information: it seeks 
to establish a procedure of compulsory consultation between the 
President and two designated committees of Congress. He says this 
goal is beyond the legislative powers of Congress"; 
Third, and I think this answers the question raised by Mr. Stokes 
earlier on, and specifically, how it ties the President's hands, Mr. 
Rostow says: 
"3. De facto, the bill would give the two intelligence committees 
of Congress, or one acting alone, an unconstitutional legislative 
veto over a wide and undefined class of Presidential decisions in 
the field of intelligence;" and 
Fourth, he maintains, "The procedures mandated by the bill 
would largely remove the Central Intelligence Agency and other in-
telligence entities in the executive branch from the control of the 
President with respect to many of their functions, and place them 
under the direct control of the Congress instead." 
Mr. McHuGn. Thank you, Mr. Livingston. 
I will ask Mr. Stokes, the chairman of the committee, if he has 
any opening remarks. 
[The complete statements follow:] 
STATEMENT OF HON. LOUIS STOKES 
Mr. Chairman: I would just take a moment to commend you for the leadership 
you have exercised on this issue, and for the informative, and fair hearings you 
have organized and conducted. You have gone out of your way to accommodate 
those Members of this Committee who oppose this legislation, although strongly 
supporting it yourself. You have insured that all sides were heard, all issues aired, 
and that the discussion was full and frank. 
I would also note that you and I and other Members of the Committee began 
working on this legislation well over a year ago. As you noted, hearings began last 
April. We have examined the issues presented by H.R. 1013 and H.R. 3822 carefully, 
thoroughly, and at length. Prior to the Iran-Contra revelations, the Intelligence 
Committee, members and staff, engaged in review and oversight of the 1980 Act. 
Indeed, in 1983 the Full Committee conducted public hearings on covert action over-
sight. So these issues are not new; our deliberations are fully informed; we have not 
rushed to judgment. 
STATEMENT OF HENRY J. HYDE 
Mr. Chairman and distinguished Committee colleagues, today we have our second, 
and I understand final, hearing on H.R. 3822. 
In view of the revelations which emerged from the comprehensive Legislative and 
Executive Branch inquiries into the Iran/Contra Affair, it is understandable that 
some would urge that a significant tightening of the intelligence oversight statutes 
is necessary. However, I think that on more mature reflection, such measures do 
not appear necessary, at least not yet. 
The Tower Commission (President's Special Review Board) wisely concluded that 
statutory changes in the system of decision-making on intelligence operations and 
oversight were not necessary, and that the failures of the system should be laid to 
the failures of individuals to follow the pertinent procedures of the established proc-
ess. As the Commission's report notes:

"In the case of the Iran initiative, the NSC process did not fail, it simply was 
largely ignored. The National Security Advisor and the NSC principals all had a 
duty to raise this issue and insist that orderly process be imposed. None of them did 
so. 
Similarly, despite their somewhat inconsistent and superficial recommendations, 
in my view, the congressional select committees on Iran laid responsibility on 
human rather than systemic failings. The committees' majority report concluded. 
". . . that the Iran/Contra Affair resulted from the failure of individuals to ob-
serve the law, not from deficiencies in existing law or in our system of governance." 
It is also fundamentally important to keep in mind the fact that the covert Iran 
arms transfer was an aberration, a unique departure from past experience of at 
least a decade or more involving executive and congressioinal relations on covert 
action. That fact was made clear in the materials prepared by our committee staff 
for last year's series of subcommittee hearings on H.R. 1013, the predecessor bill to 
H.R. 3822. A staff background paper prepared for those hearings noted in part: 
"AsJar as we know since enactment of the Oversight Act in the fall of 1980, the 
Committee has been given notice prior to implementation of all findings except for 
the January 17, 1986, Iran Finding. 
"In addition, as far as we know, all covert actions carried out since 1980, again 
with the exception of the pre-January 17, 1986, Iran arms transfer activities, have 
been the subject of findings. There has been one occasion when prior notice was 
given only to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee and 
one occasion when notice was limited to the designated leadership group." 
President Reagan did take expeditious and appropriate action to reform and 
strengthen the NSC process for approval and review of covert actions as soon as he 
received the Tower Commission's report and recommendations on what had gone 
wrong in the handling of the Iran initiative. A year ago, on March 4, 1987, the 
President announced his commitment to implementation of the Tower Commission's 
recommendation and took the first steps to commence that implementation. After 
very lengthy and intense study, as well as some consultations with Congress, at both 
the Member and staff level, last year the President signed a new National Security 
Decision Directive (NSDD) 286 setting forth the revised procedures for the approval 
and review of covert actions, including procedures for effectively carrying put the 
President's responsibilities for notification to Congress on those matters. 
NSDD 286 addresses in a very constructive manner a number of issues related to 
those processes which are of interest to the Congress, and this Committee in par-
ticular. Among its important features, NSDD 286 provides that: (1) no covert action 
("special activity") may be conducted except under the authority of a written find-
ing; (2) there can be no "retroactive" findings; (3) all findings will be reviewed at 
least annually and will "sunset" unless the President specifically takes action to 
prevent their termination; and (4) a copy of each finding signed by the President 
will be provided to the intelligence committees as part of the notification proce-
dures. Moreover, the directive makes clear that there is a well-understood and ac-
cepted expectation of prior notification to Congress of covert actions. Only if the 
President determines that it is necessary, in order to meet rare, extraordinary cir-
cumstances, will notification be delayed until after the initiation of a "special activi-
ty" and then only consistent with the timely notice standard of section 501(b) of the 
National Security Act of 1947. In those very rare cases where notice would be de-
ferred, NSDD 286 provides for notification within two working days unless the 
President specifically directs otherwise. In those truly exceptional circumstances of 
a deferral of notification for longer than two days after a special activity has been 
authorized by the President, the grounds for that delay must be memorialized in 
writing and reevaluated by the National Security Planning Group (NSPG) of the 
NSC at least every 10 days. That procedural requirement is certainly calculated to 
keep the President and NSC members constantly mindful of the need to notify Con-
gress as soon as possible. 
I believe procedures such as these and the obviously strongly renewed commit-
ment of the Administration for a constructive relationship with Congress in the 
field of special activities should enable us to conduct effective oversight on those op-
erations without the troublesome statutory changes proposed in H.R. 3822. So far, 
those procedures seem to be working well, I believe we should give this revised and 
strengthened process a reasonable chance to demonstrate its workability before we 
start setting narrow and inflexible legislative requirements into statutory concrete. 
I know that some feel burdensome restrictions such as those in H.R. 3822 are 
needed or, notwithstanding the reforms of NSDD 286, the Executive Branch will in-
definitely ignore, whenever it pleases, its responsibilities to give timely notice to 
Congress. However, it should be clear to even casual observers that any Administra-

tion clearly risks paying a fearful political cost when it unreasonably defers congres-
sional notification. The effects of the political penalties President Reagan has paid 
have been felt throughout the breadth of his program initiatives, foreign and domes-
tic. The consequent loss of political capital has emboldened opponents of Adminis-
tration policies and programs in a wide range of areas, both at home and abroad. 
Certainly this has been a costly lesson which this Administration and future presi-
dents for years to come will long and vividly remember. As I have indicated before, 
congressional notification and consultation are a valuable form of "political risk in-
surance" whose importance has been starkly reemphasized in the wake of the Iran/ 
Contra Affair. 
My most fundamental concerns about H.R. 3822 are the potentially serious practi-
cal problems which the rigidity of its prior notification and extremely limited, 48-
hour deferral provisions represent. In the most sensitive circumstances where covert 
action might be an extremely valuable policy tool, these very inflexible notification 
requirements could exert a fatally chilling effect. The problems with attempts to 
legislate a rigid limit of 48 hours on the circumstance-dependent concept of timely 
notice was highlighted eloquently by expert testimony regarding the predecessor 
bill, H.R. 1013, last year. 
Admiral Turner, President Carter's DCI, described two covert activities related to 
the Desert I Iran hostage rescue and a covert action in cooperation with the Canadi-
an Government to secretly exfiltrate six U.S. diplomats from the Canadian Embassy 
in Tehran. He convincingly explained circumstances laden with serious risks to the 
lives and physical safety of personnel involved which he felt left him no reasonable 
choice but to defer notice to Congress until the high level of dangerous risks de-
dined sufficiently. Moreover, as we recall, in the "Canadian operation" the essential 
participation of Canada was contingent on deferring congressional notification until 
the safety of Canadian personnel was reasonably secure. That case involved a very 
friendly government with long democratic traditions and a relatively sophisticated 
understanding of the U.S. system of government. Not all governments we might 
have to cooperate with will possess these attributes. 
In his very persuasive testimony, Admiral Turner gave a thoughtful and realistic 
explanation of what timely notice means: 
"The timeliness is not measured by a clock. Timeliness should be measured by the 
risk. I waited three months in one of those cases, and we were three months getting 
the six people out from the Canadian Embassy. We were six months doing the other 
two operations I mentioned to you. 
"So I don't think we should focus on hours and days. I think we should focus on 
diminution of the risk. It could be that as an operation goes along the risk to human 
life drops off but the operation under the Finding is still continung. That would be 
the point at which the Executive should come to Congress. When that risk to 
human life is diminished sufficiently is when it is timely to notify the Con-
gress. . . ." 
Former DCI William Colby and former senior intelligence official Dr. Ray Cline 
basically concurred with Admiral Turner's views. At a subsequent hearing Presi-
dent Carter's counsel, Lloyd Cutler, who played a major role in the drafting of the 
existing statute, expressed similar serious reservations about the very restrictive 48-
hour time limit contained in H.R. 3822. During his appearance, Mr. Cutler told us: 
"[lit does seem to me that none of us are bright enough to devise an absolute 48-
hour rule that will cover all situations and to drive the President into the refuge of 
a constitutionally inherent right to do something which Congress cannot interfere 
with, it seems to me goes a bit too far. 
"I think the point of notice is not so much that it be beforehand, so that there is 
consultation with the band of eight or two committees that might amount to 40 or 
50 members and their staffs, it is that nothing can be done and kept secret, so that 
you never know that it happened, and whether you get the notice two days later or 
a week later, or a month later, it seems to me, in most cases, isn't going to make 
that much difference. And we can all conjure up situations in which 48 hours isn't 
enough. * * * 
"There are all sorts of situations like that that could come up and I think myself, 
you have got to allow a certain amount of intitiative to the President, although you 
require him to account to you afterwards." 
The thoughtful, compelling concerns of such experienced witnesses are powerful 
arguments against the basic approach of H.R. 3822 to the intelligence oversight 
process. Those concerns are given additional weight when we consider the epidemic 
proportions which the Washington disease of leaking has assumed. Of course leaks 
come from both the Executive and Legislative Branches, and ironclad proof of their 
sources is extremely rare. They are probably greater in number from the Executive

Branch because numerically more people are privy to classified information than 
here on the Hill. However, as a percentage of the number of people in each branch 
with access to classified information, Congress, despite its sanctimonious and out-
raged pretense of unsullied virtue, may be ahead in this dubious competition. 
A Senate Intelligence Committee study released to the press and others, reported-
ly found that in selected leaks of classified information, journalists referenced con-
gressional sources only eight to nine percent of the time, but cited Reagan Adminis-
tration officials 66 percent of the time. This research methodology is suspect, since 
journalists are alleged frequently to protect their most vulnerable sources, and per-
sons on the intelligence oversight committees would in many cases be particularly 
exposed by virtue of being the only knowledgeable "congressional" sources. Let us 
take the Senate study at face value, however, and also generously assume that Con-
gress has 2,500 people with clearances, as opposed to 2.2 million in the Excutive 
Branch and military. Reliance on the Senate study forces us to conclude that Con-
gress maintains just over 0.1 percent of the number of Executive Branch clearances, 
but is responsible for eight to nine percent of the leaks on national security issues. 
Specifically, on average, a cleared person in Congress is 60 times more likely than 
his counterparts elsewhere to engage in unauthorized disclosures. 
In any case, it is a cliche to acknowledge the widespread existence of a permissive 
culture regarding unauthorized disclosures to the media. "Leaking has become a 
standard operating procedure for a significant number of Washington insiders," 
Robert Garcia concluded in an August, 1987 article for American Politics on leaks 
by a variety of Washington officials, including congressmen. We, therefore, can no 
longer honestly claim, contrary to all common sense and experience, that Capitol 
Hill somehow has risen above it all. 
As Chapter 13 of the Minority Report of the Iran Committees makes clear, leaks 
have been a problem since the days of the Church and Pike Committees, Moreover, 
the Iran Committees themselves had their own problems with numerous leaks of 
sensitive classified information given in executive session to the Members and/or 
staff. That chapter concludes with a simple truth: 
"In the final analysis, as Chairman Hamilton noted in a perceptive article on pro-
tecting secrets that appeared in the September 4, 1985 Congressional Record, 'Leaks 
are inevitable when so many people handle secrets.' The most effective way of en-
suring secrecy is to restrict access to sensitive information to just a handful of re-
sponsible people." 
Interestingly, Lee Hamilton and his Senate counterpart, Daniel Inouye, followed 
their best instincts on how to keep secrets when it came time to depose Admiral 
Poindexter. As the Minority report observes: 
"The two select Committees recognized that the Admiral's testimony on the diver-
sion of funds was the pivotal, and potentially most explosive political question of 
this whole investigation. As a result, extraordinary steps were taken to protect the 
information. Specifically, only three staff attorneys and no members of either Com-
mittee participated in the secret questioning. The success of these procedures speaks 
volumes on how to protect secrets." 
While the remedy for reducing leaks is thus well-known, the circumstances we 
must work with ignore it. For even the most sensitive intelligence information is 
available to some 67 Members of Congress and 60 to 65 congressional staff between 
the two intelligence committees and certain appropriations subcommittees in each 
house. 
Of course, the fact as well as the more widespread perception that Congress is a 
source of leaks means that requiring the kind of inflexible prior reporting called for 
in H.R. 3822 will have a chilling effect on the willingness of some to cooperate with 
us on some extremely important covert actions in the future. Ultimately, that chill-
ing effect will extend its influence to the minds of those officials who must consider 
whether in any specific case to propose covert action as a policy option. Unfortu-
nately, they may refrain from even suggesting a covert action, although the rewards 
of its success could be great, because they believe necessary participants will fear 
premature disclosure to Congress under an inflexible congressional prior notifica-
tion requirement and decline to cooperate. Those supporters of H.R. 3822 who are 
opposed to any and every covert action as a policy tool fervently hope and expect 
the bill to have such a chilling effect. 
There are other concerns with H.R. 3822 touched upon by Director Webster. The 
expansion the bill would make in the categories of funds which must be "specifically 
authorized" under current law, in the sense of being both authorized and appropri-
ated, could have very disruptive and deleterious effects on some important intelli-
gence activities, such as the maintenance of "proprietaries" and the handling of fi-
nancial support from friendly governments to joint covert actions which might be

approved by Congess. There are also serious potential problems with the way the 
bill phrases the definition of "special activities." Director Webster has indicated 
that as it now reads that definition might well result in cumbersome and impracti-
cal requirements for signed Presidential findings for categories of intelligence activi-
ties which have never previously been considered to be covert action. 
For all of these important reasons, I strongly conclude that this legislation, no 
matter how well intentioned, is a fulfillment of the old adage, "Do something, even 
if it's wrong!" We are encroaching on the President's constitutional prerogatives by 
diminishing essential flexibility he may need, especially when cooperating allied 
citizens' lives, as well as our own, are at stake. Unusual circumstances make bad 
law?and the Iran/Contra Affair was more than unusual, it was one of a kind. I 
think we don't need new laws, just better observance of the ones we have. 
Mr. McHuGH. So, Mr. Secretary, as I said earlier, we are delight-
ed to have you. We understand the pressures on your time. As we 
all understand, there are few people with as much experience in 
Government as you and, therefore, your insights on not only the 
legislation itself, but also the issue of the general relationship be-
tween the Congress and the executive are important to us. 
And we are delighted to have you. Please proceed. 
STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK C. CARLUCCI, SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I ap-
preciate this opportunity to appear before you. I also appreciate 
your accommodating my schedule and the rather extraordinary ar-
rangements under which I have asked to appear. 
I asked to appear on a one-time basis as a former National Secu-
rity Advisor, as opposed to a sitting Secretary of Defense. 
At the outset, let me say that I am a strong supporter of the 
oversight process. In my experience in the Agency and DOD, it has 
been extraordinarily helpful. I believe that the relationship be-
tween the executive branch and the Intelligence Committees has 
evolved into a very solid and productive relationship. 
At the outset, let me say I am certainly not going to claim that 
mistakes were not made in the Iran-Contra Affair. The President 
has admitted the mistakes. Let me make only two quick points. 
. The first is that the kind of mistakes that were made do not lend 
themselves to a legislative solution. The Congress' own Iran-Contra 
report said, and I quote: 
"The Iran-Contra affair resulted from the failure of individuals 
to observe the law, not from deficiencies in existing law. Experi-
ence has shown that these laws and procedures, if respected, are 
adequate to the task." End quote. 
The second point I would make is that the managerial and per-
sonnel deficiencies revealed as a result of those events have been 
fully addressed. The President appointed a new National Security 
Advisor. There is a new and very capable director of Central Intel-
ligence. Under the President's direction, I as the National Security 
Advisor, did much what any CEO would do coming into a some-
what troubled company. 
There was a sizable turnover in the staff, a complete reorganiza-
tion of the NSC, and the Office of Political and Military Affairs 
was abolished because it didn't make any sense for me to have that 
kind of cross-cutting office.

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
214 
On direction of the President, we banned the National Security 
Council staff from having any role in the implementation of covert 
action programs because, in my judgment, it was a conflict of inter-
est. 
NSC is the overseer of the system. We've upgraded substantially 
the Office of General Counsel and given him direct access to me 
and direct access to any of the papers, documents or any of the 
meetings in the NSC. 
We also developed early on in cooperation with the Senate Select 
Committee on -Intelligence a new NSDD, which you are all famil-
iar, requiring that all findings be in writing and that they not be 
retroactive. 
We called for annual review of all covert actions with a sunset 
clause after 1 year. And the President personally attended the 
review of all the covert action programs. 
It called for prior notification of the Congress in all but extraor-
dinary circumstances, and in extraordinary circumstances, the so-
called "gang of eight" could be identified. In rare extraordinary cir-
cumstances, the President could delay notification until after initi-
ation of the covert action and notify within 2 working days. 
And in the event further delays were necessary, the President 
must say so in writing and there would be an NSC review of that 
action every 10 days. 
As a result of this NSDD, it's my own believe that a statute is 
unnecessary. It's also my belief that the provision to which you re-
ferred in the statute could damage the oversight process in a seri-
ous way; that is to say, the 48-hour mandatory reporting require-
ment. 
I am not a lawyer. The Justice Department has made its case on 
constitutional grounds. But I can assure you that this President 
feels strongly about the issue, as did his predecessor. As you know, 
I was in the CIA under President Carter and he felt very strongly 
on this issue. 
The heart of our constitutional process is trust between the exec-
utive and legislative branches. Admittedly, this trust broke down 
in the so-called Iran-Contra Affair. It seems to me that our job is to 
restore it in a way that makes the oversight process more effective, 
not less effective. 
We must ask ourselves the question: 
If this legislation were passed and if it provokes a veto, as it most 
surely will, then will it be followed by an interminable debate 
about its constitutionality, much like the War Powers Act? If that 
happens, will it help or. hinder the oversight process? Will it con-
tribute to trust and dialog? Or will it perpetuate an adversarial re-
lationship for years to come in an effort to ensure that a one-time 
human error can never be repeated? 
I think we have to admit that there are some things that just 
cannot be done by statute. At some point, we have to re-impose 
trust in the management of the executive branch and measure 
what that branch has done to correct its managerial mistakes?and 
there will always be managerial mistakes?rather than -attempting 
to correct them by circumscribing what the Justice Department re-
gards as the President's constitutional authority.

215 
This of course is not just a theoretical issue or a separation of 
powers issue. It can become a practical issue. You cited the Iran-
Contra Affair. The other one which the committee is aware of on 
the other side is the rescue operation in Iran from the Canadian 
Embassy. 
I was in the CIA at the time and I can remember participating in 
the planning of that operation, worrying about whether the dis-
guises were right, how would they get through the airport, would 
the Canadians cooperate? 
We were holding our breath while they went in and got those six 
people out. The Canadians?and we received testimony on this, or 
at least testimony has been received on the Senate side?made it a 
condition of their cooperation that the Congress not be notified. 
You and I can say that's wrong. And you and I could argue that 
the Congress does need information. 
But, that is not always convincing to foreign governments. Had 
we chosen to ignore the Canadian offer, who knows what would 
have happened to those people. Do we really want to force a future 
President to make a choice between lives?because, in this case, it 
was a question of lives?and a law which his Justice Department 
tells him is unconstitutional? 
I submit, sir, that that kind of an agonizing choice put before the 
President does not further the oversight process. 
Let me just comment on one specific aspect of the bill. And I 
would hope that this Committee could affirm, as the Senate did in 
its committee report on S. 1721, that it intends to preserve the cur-
rent understandings and practice on what constitutes a "special ac-
tivity". 
As Secretary of Defense, to put my other hat on for the moment, 
I'm concerned that the tactical military activities which are clearly 
not intelligence covert actions continue to be treated as such. 
For example, when we attempt to deceive the Soviet Union con-
cerning the movement of nuclear weapons, that clearly should not 
require Presidential findings. 
This is important because, if we change the current practice and 
understanding, the result could be confusion in the field as to when 
a Presidential finding should be sought for military-related activi-
ties. 
I do not think that is the intent of the committee, but I would 
hope that you could spell that out in report language as the Senate 
has done. 
In summary, I don't believe the new legislation is necessary to 
restore the trust, confidence and accountability between the execu-
tive and legislative branches. The Iran-Contra Affair is, by and 
large, behind us. 
Under the improved' procedures set up by the President, much 
better cooperation is now taking place between the executive 
branch and the Intelligence Committees. And I hope the committee 
will act in a way that promotes that kind of cooperation, and that 
our efforts over the past year will not be dissipated in a fruitless 
and enervating constitutional haggle that will impact adversely on 
the oversight process. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That completes my statement.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE FRANK C. CARLUCCI 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
BEFORE THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION 
ON H.R. 3822 
THURSDAY, 10 MARCH 1988 
Mr. Chairman, at the outset, allow me to thank you and the 
Committee for the opportunity to exchange views with you on the 
proposed Intelligence Oversight Act of 1987. Historically, 
Secretaries of Defense testify before only one Subcommittee on 
each side of the Capitol. My appearance here today should not 
be construed as a change in that policy. The subject matter of 
the legislation, the degree of Presidential interest, and my 
prior position as National Security Advisor during the period 
when important NSC reforms were made which bear directly on these 
hearings brings me here today on behalf of the Administration. 
In effect, I am testifying on a one-time basis as a former NSC 
Advi?or, not as a sitting Secretary of Defense. 
Since H.R. 3822 is very similar to the Senate bill, S. 1721, 
you may already be familiar with the many concerns which I raised 
before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on December 
16. The changes subsequently made by the Senate committee in 
its mark-up of S. 1721 addressed some of my earlier concerns. 
H.R. 3822 reflects a number of the Senate's modifications. 
Therefore, I will not repeat all of the same points here today. 
Instead, I would like to offer the Committee my thoughts on 
this entire process of reconsidering our intelligence statutes 
-- to reflect on the circumstances which prompted the intelligence 
committees to consider new legislation, and to ask whether this

bill would improve the situation. I hope that the members will 
give my message serious consideration before committing themselves 
to a position on this legislation or on any particular provision 
within it. The consultation which has taken place at the staff 
level over the past two months, and the Committee's evident 
desire to consider all the facts and arguments before endorsing 
any change in the law, give me confidence that the Administration's 
views are receiving a thoughtful hearing before this committee. 
do not mean to patronize the members. The reason I raise 
the question of adequate consultation is that I strongly believe 
that this legislative proposal is the unhappy result of a breakdown 
in consultation between the Executive and Legislative branches. 
It serves no purpose to cast blame. An attitude of mistrust on 
both sides complicated the kind of confidence in one another which 
our Presidents and our legislator's need in order to carry out their 
respective Constitutional duties effectively, and successfully. 
The Congressional Iran-Contra report was right when it said: 
"In a system of shared powers, decisionmaking requires 
mutual respect between the branches of government.... 
Democratic government is not possible without trust 
between the branches of government and between the 
government and the people." (p. 20) 
Today, I would like to offer the committee my thoughts on H.R. 
3822 as it relates to the goal of fostering these all-important 
relationships of trust and respect between the branches and 
between the government and the people. Those relationships 
suffered a setback in the Iran-Contra affair, as actions were

concealed from Congress and, in one key instance, from the 
President himself. An unhealthy lack of shared purpose between 
the Congress and the Executive -- to be blunt, an adversarial 
relationship -- kept key actors on each side from sharing 
confidences and building a lasting consensus whiCh would apply 
to all of the tools of statecraft which support national foreign 
policy objectives. 
I can think of no step by the Congress which would do more 
harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and 
candor between the branches than unilaterally to lay claim to 
prerogatives whieh the President firmly believes are vested in 
the Executive by the Constitution. Who among us can say with 
absolute certainty that no future President will ever be faced 
with circumstances requiring that notification of a covert action 
to the Congress be delayed beyond 48 hours? 
One recent example, which both intelligence committees have 
discussed, is the assistance which Canada rendered to the United 
States in 1980 in helping to smuggle six American hostages out 
of Iran. As the Subcommittee has heard from a colleague who 
served on the full Committee at the time, Canada had one request 
in offering its cooperation: that the President not tell the 
Congress. Was this unreasonable? You and I might say "yes," 
believing that the Congress could be trusted to protect this 
information. But from Canada's perspective, clearly it feared 
having its own Embassy in Teheran laid siege, as our own had 
been, if its assistance became known. President Carter authorized

a covert action to get those six Americans safely out of Iran. 
He did not tell the Congress until after the fact. some members 
disagreed but others argued that President Carter had done the 
right thing. 
This example helps us to separate politics froM process, and 
to understand how the founding fathers did the same thing when 
they designed our Constitutional separation of powers. Virtually 
all Americans would regard the rescue of six citizens in that 
situation as a goal justifying covert action, and they would 
view the Government of Canada as a worthy partner in that endeavor. 
Canada's demands for extreme secrecy would also appear reasonable. 
Yet the cold fact remains that if H.R. 3822 had been the law of 
the land in 1980, President Carter would have had to say "thanks 
but no thanks" to Canada. what would have happened to those six 
Americans, who were separated from the fifty-two Americans held 
in the American Embassy in Teheran, no one can say. 
So there is more to the 48-hour notification issue than abstract 
theory. President Reagan's policy, as laid down in NSDD 286, is 
to do precisely what H.R. 3822 would compel him to do -- to 
notify the intelligence committees of covert action findings no 
later than 48 hours after they are signed. If this policy cannot 
be followed for exigent reasons, the NSPG is required to review 
the situation every ten days. Other provisions of the NSDD have 
been praised by the sponsors of the Senate legislation. This is 
not surprising' since we consulted with the Senators as we devel-
oped our guidelines. We believe the NSDD works well with the

current statutory framework governing intelligence activities. 
However, I urge the members to consider the effect of provoking 
a Presidential veto on legislation governing the entire realm of 
intelligence activities. will this really improve the situation, 
or will it simply add to the atmosphere of mistrust in an effort 
to be certain that never again will an admitted mistake be repeated? 
The failures of the Iran affair were human and managerial. No 
statute can prevent these mistakes. How much better it would be 
to have a procedural and statutory framework that heals the wounds, 
provides for reasonable safeguards and encourages an atmosphere of 
trust. If trust, candor and accountability are the remedy to 
the problems which brought about the Iran-Contra affair -- as I 
believe they are -- the Congress risks undermining all of those 
goals, and reintroducing instead an unhealthy adversarial basis 
to the oversight process for years to come, if it incorporates a 
fundamental Constitutional disagreement into the law. 
I have dwelt on this one central issue because I hope to 
persuade the members that the position taken by President Reagan 
and his immediate predecessors is reasonable and correct. Ap-
propriate action was taken as soon as the President be/ame aware 
of the true nature of what had transpired in the Iran-Contra 
affair. A new National Security Advisor was brought in. Judge 
Webster was nominated as Director of Central Intelligence. 
President Reagan prohibited the National Security Council staff 
from participating in covert action, and he upgraded the position 
and authority of the NSC Legal Advisor.

The President directed that findings be set in writing prior 
to initiation of the covert action. He ordered a full review of 
ongoing covert actions, and revised or terminated any which were 
not seen to be necessary or effective. Under a "sunset" clause, 
Presidential authority for a covert action now expires after one 
year unless he revalidates it. 
The Congress' Iran-Contra investigation led to the conclusion . 
that "the Iran-Contra Affair resulted from the failure of indivi-
duals to observe the law, not from deficiencie? in existing law 
or in our system of governance." (p. 423) With specific reference 
to the existing "laws and procedures to control secret intelligence 
activities, including covert actions," the congressional report 
concluded that, "Experience has shown that these laws and procedures, 
if respected, are adequate to the task. In the Iran-Contra Affair, 
however, they often were disregarded." (p. 375) 
I do not believe statutory change is necessary. If government 
is to function effectively as well as responsively, there must 
be a line where the statutory framework ends and the President's 
internal management responsibility begins. No two Presidents 
are alike in their management styles. No two Administrations 
have used identical procedures and mechanisms for recommending 
options to the President or implementing_Presidential decisions. 
We must allow our Presidents to manage, and each President must 
be allowed to manage his Administration in the manner which 
suits him best.

I note that the Senate committee report on S. 1721 states 
that the definition of the term "special activity," as used in 
the bill, "is intended, as written, to reflect and incorporate 
existing law and mutually-agreed upon practice." (p. 38) If 
this Committee intends to change the accumulated body of mutual 
understandings on these very important definitional and juris-
dictional matters, I believe it is important to spell out the 
rationale. As Judge Webster noted in his recent testimony before 
you, a deviation from the existing practice regarding what 
constitutes a special activity could result in Executive branch 
agencies having to obtain findings for categories of activities 
that do not reauire findings today. I support Judge Webster's 
position that the Congress should not change the existing practice 
within the Executive branch on which activities are governed by 
a Presidential finding. 
As Secretary of Defense, I have a particular concern in this 
regard that tactical military activities continue to be understood 
as distinct from covert intelligence actions. This is not a 
question of what the Congress should be told, but rather a question 
of which activities should require a Presidential finding. For 
example, should a finding be required every time we attempt to 
deceive the Soviet Union on the movement of nuclear weapons or 
the capabilities of our own military forces? Clearly not, 
according to the current definition. In addition, should a 
finding be required whenever the CIA lends clandestine support to 
an overt military operation by providing communication assistance

or by convincing local officials to assist in the evacuation of 
Americans froma foreign country? Again, clearly not under 
current practice. I hope that the members will recognize the 
importance of preserving the body of mutually-agreed upon practice 
between the branches. 
We will not put the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contra affair 
behind us until we trust each other again. I urge the Committee 
to consider the very real adverse consequences of attempting to 
impose a new and inflexible statutory framework on our Presidents 
and our intelligence community. Let us instead test each other's 
good faith and professionalism, and give responsible officials 
in both branches a chance to earn each other's respect by giving 
real meaning to the concept of consultation. Not only does such 
an approach have the advantage of bringing the best out of our 
public servants: it is the way the founding fathers intended the 
system to work. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. McHuGH. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. 
As I said at the outset, you are very highly regarded here. And 
your testimony will certainly be considered very carefully. 
Let me just make a few observations on behalf of myself at least, 
if not the other authors. 
I think it is important to stress that we are not seeking to per-
petuate an adversarial relationship. You're quite right in suggest-
ing that the substance of our government process in many ways de-
pends upon trust and confidence. And no legislation can mandate 
that. 
So we do agree that whatever our differences in policy terms 
may turn out to be, it is important to try to foster, not impede, the 
growth of that trust and confidence. 
What we're trying to do in terms of this legislation is together 
flesh out what is the proper balance in this Constitutional sharing 
of powers and this constitutional process, using as we must the ex-
perience that we have gained not only through the Iran-Contra epi-
sode, but in other ways. 
I'll get to your Canadian case in just a minute, which I think is a 
tough case from the standpoint of those of us who propose this ap-
proach. 
Try if you can to put yourself in the position of the Congress of 
the United States. We are faced with a real situation in the Iran-
Contra case where the President made what I believe was not just 
a management decision, not just an implementing of policy deci-
sion, but basically decided to fundamentally change the policy of 
the United States of America with respect to Iran. 
Our public policy was, as you know, not to deal with Iran but the 
President decided for reasons which I'm sure he sincerely believed 
were valid to covertly sell arms to Iran. 
I think that was a fundamental policy decision. 
The President decided not to tell anyone in the Congress of the 
United States of that decision. And, indeed, we didn't learn of it 
until a Middle East publication released the news some 10 months 
later. 
The Justice Department and the administration witnesses gener-
ally have said that the President's action in that case was fully in 
conformity with law. The administration has not taken the position 
that people violated the law in that set of circumstances. 
Indeed, the Justice Department is on record in these hearings 
and in the Senate taking the position that the President acted law-
fully. 
That means, regardless of what good intentions now may be?
and I don't question for one moment the intentions of people like 
you and Director Webster and the National Security Advisor, or 
the President himself?that we are faced with a legal opinion 
which said that not only this administration, but any administra-
tion can on its own handle withhold fundamental policy decisions 
from the Congress of the United States. 
And I think that's a major issue for us here in terms of our re-
sponsibilities for oversight. 
I think you raised, as you say, a tough question with respect to 
the Canadian case, where lives clearly were in jeopardy, and where 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
225 
I'm sure none of us, whether we're in the executive or legislative 
branches, would want to jeopardize those lives. 
What our legislation would do, assuming it fully applies to that 
case?and I'm assuming that?would say to the President: 
"You should share that very sensitive information with no more 
than eight people in the Congress." 
You know who those people are. They include the Speaker of the 
House, the minority leader, the majority leader of the Senate, the 
minority leader there, and the two top people on the Intelligence 
Committees. 
You said that trust is an important part of our Government. And 
I think it's reasonable to suggest that the President can trust these 
people even with the most sensitive kind of information. 
Now, the argument is made, understandably, that the Canadians 
or other governments would say: 
"We don't want you to notify the members of Congress because 
we're afraid that information might leak." 
I think it's incumbent in a case like that for the administration 
representative?the CIA or whomever?to say to our Canadian 
friends: 
"Well, look, we have a somewhat different form of government. 
In your parliamentary system, the executive and legislative 
branches overlap. In our form of government, we have two sepa-
rate branches who share power. We believe we can trust, and you 
can trust these top leadership people, who number only eight. 
Therefore, we would urge you in your interest and ours to cooper-
ate with us. This information will be kept secret." 
_I think that is a more reasonable position, granted the risks, 
granted the sensitivities, than the alternative position which under 
current law and current interpretation by the administration says: 
"No one in Congress may be told about a fundamental policy de-
cision for many, many months if the Administration in its discre-
tion chooses to withhold that information unilaterally." 
Those are the two alternatives we're dealing with. And those of 
us in Congress who are concerned with a real live case and a legal 
interpretation in the Iran arms sales situation believe that the 
legal interpretation which we're faced with can in fact deny us, if 
not in this Administration, again, sometime down the road, funda-
mental policy information. 
And on balance, we don't think it's too much to ask the Adminis-
tration, even in sensitive cases, to share sensitive information with 
these eight leaders, because we have confidence in the? trust that 
would be put in those people. 
So that's the problem that we face. And it is a common problem 
because the last thing we want is a confrontation and an adversar-
ial circumstance. 
Therefore, however this may turn out in Congress, if, in fact, the 
Senate and the House pass this bill, I would hope that before the 
President vetoes it, that he will consider carefully and openly the 
responsibilities that we in Congress have and perhaps will not veto 
so quickly this type of legislation, which I don't think is very dra-
matic. Indeed, your own Directive, the President's own Directive, 
reflects in many ways what we are proposing in this legislation. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
226 
The only difference then is that the law would be permanent as 
opposed to a directive which could be unilaterally changed by the 
President later on. 
So I apologize for going on without really asking you a question. 
But I did want to reflect with you on the perspective that many of 
us have, taking into account not only the Iran-Contra problem, 
which is one tough case, as well as the Canadian-type situation, 
which I will concede is a tough situation for us to deal with. 
But, given the two alternatives, on balance, many of us believe 
that trusting a small group of leaders of the people in Congress is a 
better approach than the other alternative, which could again lead 
to a situation where no one in Congress for a long period of time 
knows anything about fundamental policy decisions. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I would clearly agree with you, Mr. Chair-
man. We can trust the Congress. I'm not arguing that point. I 
think one of the more futile exercises that we engage in is a finger-
pointing exercise between the Congress and the executive branch 
on who leaks what. 
Unfortunately, we have leaks out of both branches. That's not 
the issue. And, certainly, we tried to persuade the Canadians that 
we could trust the Congress and this would be handled discreetly. 
But, other governments make their own judgments. 
And if you can't persuade Canadians, who really understand 
more about our system of government than most other countries, 
how are you doing to persuade countries who don't have a system 
of government that anywhere near resembles our system of govern-
ment? 
How are you going to persuade dictatorships? 
You may need the cooperation of a dictatorship in one of these 
operations. And I don't know how many times I had discussions 
with cooperating intelligence organizations?western intelligence 
organizations?on this very subject. It is next to impossible to con-
vince them of this. 
So the issue is not whether we trust you, it is whether we can 
persuade other countries in exceptional circumstances that they 
ought to put their own national efforts at risk, put their own na-
tional equities in the hands of our Congress; because that's the way 
the Canadians looked at it. They saw their embassy, their people as 
just as vulnerable as our people. 
As far as the question of the President not telling the Congress 
of major policy decisions, I would respectfully submit that the pro-
cedure the President has set up in the NSDD, where he has to 
commit to writing any time the Congress is not informed, and then 
there is an NSC review every 10 days, is sufficient to deal with 
this. 
There are lively NSC meetings and, as you know, there is consid-
erable controversy even in the administration over a particular un-
dertaking. I doubt whether this President or any President in the 
future would want to be here constantly every 10 days to ask mem-
bers what they think about a particular operation. 
Anyway, you're forcing them to focus on the details and implica-
tions of this operation on a periodic basis. 
I can assure you that the President will reflect seriously on the 
relationship with Congress before he vetoes the legislation, but he

227 
has a responsibility not just to himself. The President has said a 
number of times that he does not view himself as the owner of this 
office, the Oval Office. He is just a caretaker and he has to think in 
terms of his successors. And how he binds his successors in their 
relations with Congress is important; the precedent which he sets 
for his successors is equally important. 
Mr. McHuGH. My time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. 
Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for making this appearance on what I believe to be a 
very important piece of legislation, if ill-advised. 
I share with you?I'm not certain what the intent of the legisla-
tion is either with respect to the President's intent to move nuclear 
weapons. So I hope the redactors will make that clear before we 
take this thing any further. 
Secondly, your testimony is very concise. And I appreciate your 
position. I share with you your appraisal of the Canadian Embassy 
situation. And, basically, doesn't that, in effect, say that, in today's 
complex and dangerous world, it is simply not realistic and work-
able to insist upon prior notification to Congress of all covert ac-
tions, no matter how dangerous or sensitive the circumstances may 
be surrounding the operation. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That is my view, Mr. Livingston, yes. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. And the timing of the notice to Congress of 
covert action should at least, in some cases, take into account the 
risk to human life involved in the operation, should it not? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Yes. And let me only point out that some 
covert action and operations, particularly where they're rescue op-
erations, take a long time to set up before the event actually takes 
place. 
So, if you notify a large number of people irrespective of who 
they are, whether they're in the executive branch or the Congress, 
while that operation is going on, you run the risk of compromise. 
It's axiomatic that the more people who know about an operation, 
the more likely chance there is of compromise. 
So the actual implementation may be sometime away. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Taking the third incident, for example, the 
bombing or the attack on Libya, obviously, if this legislation were 
in force, we wouldn't be talking about notifying Congress as late as 
the bombing itself. We'd be talking about notifying members of 
Congress weeks, or even months ahead of time, once the President 
committed the movement of any personal toward affecting the raid. 
Is that right? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That would be correct, but I hope that this 
does not apply to military operations. That's under the jurisdiction 
of a different committee. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. That's not clear in this legislation. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I would hope that the committee could 
make that clear. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. I think you've raised some serious 
questions. We haven't touched much on the constitutionality of this 
legislation, but expect to explore that later on with others. 
But I certainly do appreciate your appearance. 
Mr. McEwEN. Will the gentleman yield?

228 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. I'll be happy to yield. 
Mr. McEwEN. On that point, even though it was a military oper-
ation, the Libyan raid was a secret operation, was it not? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Oh, yes. 
Mr. McEwEN. Did the Presdident brief the Members of Congress 
with the express stipulation that it not be discussed publicly? I be-
lieve, in that case, the point that the gentleman has chosen to 
raise, that those in attendance chose to hold a press conference on 
the driveway of the White House, did they not? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I wasn't in government at the time, so I'm 
not an authoritative person to answer that. 
Mr. McEwEN. Well, the answer is yes. The answer is that they 
did, at the pleading of the President that lives were at risk and the 
operation, that they were going to be flying at night, and a situa-
tion in which they would be vulnerable and could they please, in 
the interest of peace and in the interest of American lives, hold 
their fire for a matter of hours. 
That proved to be too strong a request for them to accommodate. 
And I think that it's very appropriate for the gentleman from Lou-
isiana to raise it. 
Thank you. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. I yield back my time. 
Mr. McHuGH. We don't have time to get into this issue that Mr. 
McEwen has raised, at least I don't. I think he's incorrect. 
I would refer Mr. McEwen and others to the statement that Sen-
ator Inouye made during the Iran-Contra hearings in which I 
thought he rather forcefully and convincingly demonstrated that it 
was not the Senators or anyone in Congress who released that in-
formation. Indeed, Colonel North himself may well have been the 
source of this information. 
Mr. McEwEN. If the gentleman would yield on that point. 
Mr. McHum'. I won't yield because we do have a very short 
amount of time. 
Mr. McEwEN. I admit that's right. 
Mr. McHuGN. The Secretary has to leave at 2:15. I'll be happy to 
take the gentleman on another time on this. 
Mr. Stokes. 
Chairman STOKES. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Secretary, let me express my appreciation for your appear-
ance here today. I guess one of my concerns would be your men-
tioning the new NSDD that has been signed by the President as 
being evidence of the fact that a statute is unnecessary. 
I have some very real concerns about that because, as a member 
of the Iran-Contra Committee, we learned that there was in exist-
ence what was known as NSDD No. 59. I'm sure you're familiar 
with that. It was in existence at the time of the Iran-Contra situa-
tion. 
That NSDD, which had been signed by the President, required 
that all findings be in writing, and further required that there be 
notification to the Congress of all findings. 
It further required that the NSC and its members make all rec-
ommendations related to covert findings to the President, and that 
they be kept fully informed. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

A 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
229 
The President never took the action to repeal NSDD No. 59. He 
just ignored his own NSDD. 
So, when you say to us that you now have issued a new NSDD, 
what is there that would be different now with this NSDD from 
NSDD No. 59, which can be totally ignored by the President, since 
he is the one who initiates it. It has no validity of law. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I don't think there's anything in NSDD 59 
that circumscribes the President's consitutional authority to deter-
mine what "in a timely fashion" means. 
It does not require him to inform Congress of every event within 
a fixed time frame. So, within the confines of NSDD 59, he had the 
flexibility not to inform the Congress. 
Now, the President himself, and he said this many times, was 
not fully informed of the facts in the Iran-Contra Affair. That's 
why the Iran-Contra report said that it was a failure of individuals 
rather than laws. 
So, if an NSDD can be disregarded, so can a law be disregarded 
for that matter. 
I don't want to prejudge what the Special Prosecutor might do. 
I'm not trying to try people up here in this forum. I'm just citing 
the Congress' own report. 
Chairman STOKES. I guess one of our major concerns is in the 
same way at page two of your statement you make reference to the 
Iran-Contra report. You say that it was right when it says, "In a 
system of shared powers, decision-making requires mutual respect 
between the branches of government," and so forth. 
But, also in that report at chapter 28 under Recommendations, 
we said: 
Congress cannot legislate good judgment, honesty or fidelity to law, but there are 
some changes in law, particularly relating to oversight of covert operations that 
would make our processes function better in the future. And they are set forth 
below. 
One of the first things that was set forth are Findings and 
Timely Notice. I'm really concerned over how we are in any way 
taking away any powers from the President when we simply say to 
the President: 
You can make whatever finding you want to make, exercising your powers as 
President of the United States. It is just that you must notify the Congress within 
48 hours. 
And we're saying that to the President because under the cur-
rent law he had the right to make any decision he wanted to make, 
it was just that the law said, if he opted for that particular option 
not to notify the intelligence committees, not to notify the gang of 
eight, that he must then give timely notice to the Congress, which, 
in this case, was not done. 
So we say that, in its stead, in the stead of the timely notice, he 
must notify the Congress within 48 hours. 
How do we take away from the President's power in that re-
spect? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. The Justice Department can better make a 
constitutional argument that I can, Chairman Stokes. I'm not a 
lawyer. But there is sigmficant difference between "in a timely 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
230 
fashion", leaving that to the President's determination, and a fixed 
time requirement. 
The latter clearly circumscribes the President's authority and 
flexibility to conduct foreign policy. As I say, I'm not equipped to 
make the legal argument. 
Chairman STOKES. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. Shuster. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Secretary, we certainly appreciate your being here today. It 
seems to me that a very important point, and I appreciate your 
agreement or disagreement on this, that hasn't been made yet is 
that the President has paid an enormous price for not infoming the 
Congress of a covert action, which I think Republicans and Demo-
crats, liberals and conservatives alike can agree was a very, very 
bad policy. 
? On the other hand, for President Carter, there's no outcry at all 
for the Congress not having been informed on the Canadian oper-
ation because that's understandable. That's reasonable. 
Yet, we lump both the reasonable and the unreasonable together. 
We catch them all in this dragnet, in this straitjacket. It's akin to 
the farmer going out on the south 40 with a blunderbuss to shoot a 
skunk, and he hits his prize bull in the process. 
And that's what we're doing here. 
Would you agree or disagree? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I would agree, Mr. Shuster. As you say, I 
worked on a daily basis with the President during the post-Iran-
Contra Affair period. And while he suffered publicly, I can tell you 
that he suffered much more in private. He would agonize over this 
problem day after day and wonder why he wasn't fully informed by 
his own staff. 
He was very frustrated by the process. So, yes, he suffered. But, 
may I also point to a certain irony here. And I don't want to open 
another debate, but I mention the analogy between what this legis-
lation might do to relations between the executive and congression-
al branch and what the War Powers Act has done. 
It's perpetuated a constitutional debate. The War Powers Act, 
had the administration subscribed totally to it, might well have 
prevented us from doing what we are doing in the Persian Gulf, 
which has restored our credibility in the region to an amazing 
degree. 
I have been out there and I've seen how our relationships with 
the moderate Arab States have improved markedly as a result of 
what we have done in that area. 
So it was a mistake, yes. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Is it reasonable to say that, absent any law, as a 
result of the terrible price this administration has paid, any future 
President is going to think an awfully long time about the justifica-
tion and the reasonableness of withholding information from the 
Congress? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I think that is clearly the case. And as I said 
in my earlier remarks, we have to allow the President s-o-iife-mana-
gerial flexibility.

Mr. SHUSTER. He will at least have the capability to withhold in-
formation if he can justify having done so to save American lives. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Absolutely. And he needs to have that capa-
bility. The Canadian case is one case, but I can think of any 
number of cases that could come up where the choices would be ag-
onizing. 
Most cases, I am sure that the President would opt in favor of 
?informing the Congress. The bias is clearly in that direction. The 
track record is good. The oversight method is important and there 
is an atmosphere of trust evolving. 
So I think future Presidents would choose to work cooperatively 
with the Congress. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Thank you. 
Mr. McHuGH. Mr. Kastenmeier. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Secretary Carlucci, following up on Chairman Stokes' questions 
about the issuance of national-security decision directives, ordinari-
ly those directives are for internal use only and they're classified. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's correct. It's correct that they are 
briefed in the appropriate oversight committees, certainly. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. They are? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Yes. We have briefed the appropriate over-
sight committees on NSDD's. We do not make them available en 
masse to any committee. But, in appropriate oversight committees, 
they are briefed. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. That is to say each time? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Not as a routine matter. But where some-
thing is germane to the oversight committee, the executive branch 
does brief them. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. And it does so routinely? That is to say, each 
and every directive? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I don't want to say that, no. There are direc-
tives. There are clearly directives that are not briefed. There are 
some that pertain only to the executive branch. But, as I say, 
where they're germane to the oversight process, they are briefed. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. With respect obviously to the one that you're 
referring to, when you, in fact, were the National Security Advisor, 
you did, in fact, of course, brief the Congress. And perhaps?and 
I'm not sure about this?perhaps you also, the White House made 
public the fact that it had voluntarily, through a new National Se-
curity Decision Directive, imposed?altered the guidelines for itself 
with respect to notification to Congress. 
I think that was publicly shared. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. It was publicly shared. But we did more 
than brief the Congress. We invited the Congress down to work 
with us. The Senate Committee accepted our invitation and we 
worked almost on a daily basis with them to develop the NSDD. 
So they were fully aware of our rules as we went through them. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. I don't think that maybe applies to the House 
Committee. 
Secretary. CARLUCCI. The House Committee, I think your Chair-
man attended one meeting, if I'm not mistaken. But the House 
Committee chose to wait until the directive was finished. That was 
clearly their option.

The Senate Committee chose to work with us on a daily basis. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Of course those National Security Decision Di-
rectives are mutable. That is to say, they can be changed by the 
President, amended, reissued at his discretion. He may or may not 
share those with the Congress. 
That seems to me, I guess, the point of this. It places these direc-
tives in a different class in terms of what they achieve as opposed 
to a statute. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's correct. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Ten months from now, for example, we'll have 
a new administration. This is also a question to which you don't 
necessarily know the answer. 
I assume a new President does not start with the old President's 
directive, will have to reissue, reexamine and reissue National Se-
curity Decision Directives? 
Secretary CARLL/CCI. That's his option. Most Presidents would 
review them and make a statement that they stand until he de-
cides otherwise. I think it would be pretty difficult to revoke 
them?I think he would revoke them on a daily basis. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. This is something he's not required by law to 
reveal what he does in that connection to the Congress? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's correct. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. So we still may have what you regard as 
trust. But the fact is that the Congress doesn't necessarily play a 
role with respect to those. And if a new President or this President 
alters those directives without informing the Congress, indeed, he 
may do so. And even what you've attempted, I think very appropri-
ately, to do, to work at least with some of the Intelligence Commit-
tees and to make public the changes you recommended. 
And I think they were salutary insofar as they went. Nonethe-
less, that is something which is also subject to change. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That is correct. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. It is for this reason that I join with the chair-
man in suggesting that there is a reason why a permanent statute 
with respect to these rules is important and why the President's 
exercise of discretion with respect to issuing National Security De-
cision Directives from time to time, and possibly amending it, and 
possibly not revealing it to anyone outside the executive branch is 
not an adequate procedure for our purposes. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Mr. Kastenmeier, if a future President sets 
out deliberately to deceive the Congress, I submit that no amount 
of statutes can stop him. A President that was going to think twice 
before doing that?and most Presidents come in wanting to develop 
a good relationship with Congress, developing that atmosphere of 
trust?now having seen this event, as was pointed out, having 
looked at an executive order which makes sense, I would be very 
surprised if some President would come in and throw it out and 
say,"No, no, I'm going to play games with the Congress," or "I 
don't want to tell the Congress anything." 
Presidents look at the history of what has happened. They look 
at the relationships with the Congress. They have to get their pro-
grams through the Congress. 
So I submit that Presidents don't come in with the kind of 
narrow focus that is implied.

Mr. KASTENMEIER. I agree that that would not be the original in-
tention of such a President. I think they would find it necessary by 
events to justify, not necessarily a deception so much as secrecy. 
Silence. 
I think we've seen it too often in the past. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Secrecy is an important ingredient of our 
national security apparatus. But that is what is so good about a 
Select Committee on Intelligence. You have upgraded your security 
requirements enormously in the past couple of years. 
Presidents, by and large, are coming to trust your security. So 
that's not what really is at issue. 
There are two things at issue. The constitutional question, which 
would provoke endless haggling over this issue, which puts you in a 
War Powers Act kind of situation; and the very exceptional event, 
such as the one we discussed with the Canadian Embassy rescue 
operation. 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, MT. Chairman. 
Mr. McHum'. Thank you. 
Mr. Secretary, we have two more members to take questions. 
Can you bear with us for a moment? 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Certainly. 
Mr. McHuGH. Mr. Hyde. 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I gather from the discussion that has gone on that, in the Cana-
dian situation, the President was left with about three options?
break the law, go ahead and do it and save the lives, or tell Canada 
no can do, tough luck; or lie to the Canadians and follow our law. 
But you just couldn't do it. So we really haven't solved that prob-
lem. What we have here is a constitutional issue. This is one strug-
gle, one battle in the ongoing war between an Imperial Congress 
and an Imperial Presidency, both struggling for the primary power 
in foreign policy. 
And so the President really has very little choice if this thing is 
unconstitutional. He really can't sign it, as much as he might want 
to to get along and stroke some fur. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's right. 
Mr. HYDE. If you will forgive my imposition, I'm going to read to 
you on the Constitution from a letter from an attorney, a constitu-
tional scholar, Robert F. Turner, of the University of Virginia, on 
this very point. He says something interesting. He says: 
Aside from rather sloppy scholarship and even some indication of possible dishon-
esty, a major shortcoming of the majority Iran-Contra Committees report was its 
emphasis on "Foreign Policy as a Shared Power." 
Now, when he talks about dishonesty, it's worth reading the foot-
note: 
For example, on page 415 of the Majority Report, a reference to the President 
having authority under the Constitution was mysteriously omitted from within a 
quotation of the statute without ellipses being inserted to indicate the omission. 
Since the dropped words would if present significantly undercut the point being 
argued by the Report, if this was simply a "clerical error", it was an especially con-
venient one. 
But, in any event, since you've used the term "shared powers", 
and since the Iran-Contra Majority?not the Minority, I hasten to 
add?used the term "foreign policy as a shared power", I think it's

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
234 
worth just taking a brief look at Mr. Turner's comments On that 
issue. He continues: 
Certainly it is true that both the President and the Congress have constitutional 
powers that affect foreign affairs. The President is given the bulk of those "execu-
tive" powers through article II, section 1, and these are amplified by the enumera-
tion of other powers, such as that of commander in chief. But, the Senate is given a 
veto over the ratification of treaties, and the full Congress is given a veto over the 
decision to launch a war against another State. Article I, section 8, also vests other 
important powers with foreign affairs implications in the Congress. But the sugges-
tion that these are "shared" powers?while in some respects not technically inaccu-
rate?invites imprecise analysis. To conclude that, because both the President and 
the Senate have a role in the treaty-making process, it is Constitutionally permissi-
ble for the Senate to assume the negotiation function or to transmit an approved 
agreement to the United Nations, is simply wrong. It would be akin to saying that, 
since both the President and the Senate have a role in the appointment?process, the 
Senate could assume the function of nominating Cabinet officials and then appoint-
ing them over the President's objection. 
A far more precise analysis, in both instances, is to recognize that the President, 
the Senate, and the Congress each have certain specific powers which influence 
United States relations with the external world. 
In this regard, however, it is important to recognize that the constitutional grant 
of "executive power" to the President in article II, section 1, was in broad terms, 
conditioned only by specific constitutional grants to the Senate or Congress and the 
rights guaranteed to the people; while the grant to Congress in article I, section 1, 
was limited to, and I quote, "'(6) [41 legislative powers herein granted'." 
That's important: "Herein granted." 
As Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison observed, the exceptions to the executive 
power that were vested in the Senate and Congress were intended to be construed 
strictly. Since the powers vested in the President by the Constitution may not be 
taken away by simple statute, a statute which pretends to compel the President to 
provide national security information to the Congress would not be a part of the 
Supreme Law of the Land. 
And why is that important? 
Because the Constitution says, quote: 
This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursu-
ance thereof and all treaties made, et cetera, shall be the Supreme Law of the Land. 
Since the President is required by the Constitution to take an oath to preserve, pro-
tect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and since the Constitution is 
the preeminent law that the President is required by the Constitution to "take 
care" that it be faithfully executed, even a cooperative President would not have the 
legal option of acquiescing in such an unconstitutional procedure. 
Now we're talking about the law, the constitutional authority, 
not the policy. Policy is another matter entirely. Presidents can 
waive these things. They can act differently. I couldn't agree more 
that as a policy comity is required. We'd better not just notify, we'd 
better consult, get some input, take Congress in as a partner, as a 
matter of comity and common sense and policy. 
But not as a matter of constitutional law. 
Now, what's going to happen? 
And I'm nearly through, Mr. Chairman, but this is important. 
This bill is going to pass like it sailed through the Senate. The 
President is going to veto it. We'll have a big constitutional debate. 
He may or may not be overridden, depending upon how the rail-
road is going. And I don't know how we'd get a court case on these 
things, except the President has to break the law, has to engage in 
a covert activity?deliberately break the law and get excoriated 
and impeached and everything else, to get a court decision.

235 
But, finally, we'll get a court to decide that Congress just can't 
overreach. It just can't tell the President how he must exercise his 
executive authority given him without limit by the Constitution. 
And we give him, we not only tell him he's got to tell us, but 
within 48 hours. That's a problem. And I don't see any way around 
it. 
And I am somewhat relieved to have had the opportunity to at 
least state it. 
Thank you. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. Mr. Hyde, I hope I didn't say that the for-
eign policy is a shared responsibility. If I did, I stand corrected. 
Mr. HYDE. You quoted from the Iran-Contra report, which made 
that mistake, in my judgment. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's not directly attributed to me. I appre-
ciate that because I quite agree, we have different constitutional 
roles. 
You're exactly right in what is going to happen, at least in my 
view. And in the War Powers case, we've been unable to get any 
standing, to find anybody to get standing to bring the issue to a 
head in the courts. 
I suspect we'll have the same problem here if this law is passed. 
So it will go on and on and on. 
Mr. HYDE. Or take these things because they're political ques-
tions in their judgment and they'd like not to be involved. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. That's what one Judge has said on the War 
Powers Act. Look at the haggling we had over our Persian Gulf 
policy on this issue. We went through agony, not so much on the 
House side, but on the Senate side. And we'll go through the same 
kind of agony on this. 
MT. HYDE. Exactly. 
Mr. McHuGH. Mr. McEwen. 
Mr. McEwEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think my point's al-
ready been made. Thank you. 
Mr. McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, not only for being with 
us, but for your patience in extending your time. 
Secretary CARLUCCI. I appreciate the opportunity, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you very much. 
[Pause.] 
Mr. McHuGH. We welcome our witnesses. As I understand from 
staff, and as I observe, we're going to have, in effect, a panel of dis-
tinguished witnesses. And I appreciate you gentlemen being here 
for that purpose. 
Our first witness will be Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who has had a 
very distinguished career in the U.S. Air Force. Before he joined 
other parts of our executive branch, he rose to the rank of lieuten-
ant general in the Air Force. He also served most notably here as 
National Security Adviser under President Ford. 
He's currently vice president of Kissinger Associates. 
Our second witness, following General Scowcroft, will be George 
A. Carver, Jr. He is the John M. Olin Senior Fellow at The Center 
for Strategic and International Studies here in Washington. 
Dr. Carver retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1979 
after a 26-year career in which he served in several overseas posts 
as an Operations Officer.

From 1966 to 1973, he held the position of Special Assistant to 
the Director of Central Intelligence for Vietnamese Affairs. 
From 1973 to 1976, he served as Deputy DCI for National Intelli-
gence. 
Our third witness will be Dr. Gregory Treverton, currently a 
Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He previously 
served for 6 years on the faculty of the John F. Kennedy Center for 
Government at Harvard, and also has served on the staffs of the 
National Security Council and the Church committee. 
He's recently authored a book called "Covert Action?Limits of 
Intervention in the Postwar World." 
We're delighted to have you, gentlemen. 
STATEMENT OF LT. GEN. BRENT SCOWCROFT, USAF (RETIRED), 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT FORD 
Lieutenant General ScowcRorr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's a 
pleasure to be here to comment on this important legislation. I 
have submitted a statement which speaks for itself. Unless you 
prefer, I see no reason to read it, or even to summarize it at length. 
Mr. McHuGH. We will be happy to include it fully in the record, 
General, if you would like to make some comments. 
Lieutenant General ScowcRoFr. Let me just make two very gen-
eral introductory comments, Mr. Chairman. 
The first one is I believe it very important not to let the Iran-
Contra Affair color the entirety of the intelligence relationship be-
tween the Intelligence Committee and between the Congress and 
the executive branch. 
The Iran-Contra Affair was a serious mistake. It was a mistake 
for which the President paid a very high political price. There are 
lessons in that affair, not only for the President and future Presi-
dents, but for all his National Security associates. 
Those lessons, it seems to me, are far more effective than at-
tempts to tie the President down with a variety of small ropes so 
he's unable to commit error. 
I think, as Secretary Carlucci so eloquently said, our system can 
work effectively only on the basis of mutual trust and cooperation. 
It was not designed by the founders necessarily to work efficiently, 
but to protect the rights of the individual against an overweaning 
government. It does that very well. 
But we have to fill the gaps between the branches with coopera-
tion and mutual trust if we're to turn our system into an effective 
system. It is my judgment that, since the time I was in the White 
House, cooperation on intelligence matters between the Intelli-
gence Committees and the executive branch is really proceeding 
very, very well. 
Indeed, I would suspect that access to material for you all is 
probably more efficient than it is for the White House on a day to 
day basis. 
The second point I would make is that I think it is very impor-
tant to preserve the capability for covert action by the U.S. Gov-
ernment, even though it is a very difficult thing to conduct effec-
tively in the present climate. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
237 
There are two things we have learned about covert action result-
ing from the Iran-Contra Affair which should have been apparent 
before, but certainly are the case at the present time. 
The first one is that covert action should never be used counter 
to public foreign policy, to go in contradiction to it. That is a mis-
take in every sense of the word. And I think that the one who real-
izes it now more than anyone else is the President of the United 
States. And I hope, every Presidential candidate. 
The second one is that, in this day and age, covert action is very 
difficult to conduct if it does not represent a general consensus 
within the body politic, within the Congress and the executive 
branch. 
I would point out the difference between covert action in Central 
America and covert action in Afghanistan. Covert action in Af-
ghanistan has gone flawlessly?no leaks, no problems, no contro-
versy?because it has been generally accepted that it's a worth-
while thing for the United States to do. 
In Central America, it's been quite the opposite because there is 
no agreement on what the underlying policy ought to be. 
The executive branch has to be conscious of those practical limi-
tations now in our present climate about the use of covert action. 
But, if we are to preserve covert action, and I think it vitally im-
portant that we preserve that ability, then we want not only to be 
able to use it effectively, but to have the people involved in con-
ducting it confident that they are being provided all the protection 
that the U.S. Government can give them. 
I think that this legislation does not serve us well on either of 
those points. 
Thank you. 
[The complete statement follows:] 
STATEMENT OF BRENT SCOWCROFT ON H.R. 3822 
I have been asked to comment on H.R. 3822, dealing with Congressional oversight 
of intelligence activities. I am happy to do so. You have already received copious 
comments on every aspect of the bill, so I will be brief and to the point. 
The principal thrust of this bill, to tighten the requirements for notification of 
covert action, is an understandable reaction to Congressional frustrations arising 
from the Iran-Contra affair. But while the reaction is understandable, I do not be-
lieve it is wise. 
The whole subject of intelligence activities is a particularly difficult part of the 
generally troublesome issue of executive-legislative cooperation on the formulation 
and conduct of U.S. foreign policy. The conflict between the need for consultation 
and the requirement for secrecy to ensure an effective intelligence system is not 
easily reconciled. The problem becomes especially acute over the matter of covert 
action. 
Covert action, in my opinion, is a valuable instrument of foreign policy, one which 
it is important for the country to have available for certain highly selective situa-
tions and circumstances. But I want to underscore that covert action is a tool of 
policy. It should not?it must not?become the policy itself. That said, it is impor-
tant to recognize that, as an instrument, covert action can be useful only to the 
degree that it remains secret. The Executive Branch deals with the extraordinary 
requirements for secrecy in handling covert actions through the device of "need to 
know." In its simplest terms, that phrase means that no one is entitled, solely by 
virtue of his position, to be informed on any particular intelligence activity. With 
respect to the Intelligence Committees of the Congress, the device of "need to know" 
is not so easily administered. 
The Constitutional scholar Edwin Corwin has said that in the area of foreign 
policy, the Constitution is an invitation to struggle between the Executive and the 
Congress. But however the respective roles may be defined at any particular histori-
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

238 
cal period, it is generally conceded at present by the Executive Branch that the Con-
gress has a role to play with respect to the formulation of foreign policy and to over-
sight of the execution of those policies, including the employment of covert actions. 
The question with respect to application of the "need to know" principle in these 
circumstances is what precisely does the Congress need to know and when, in order 
to be able to exercise its responsibilities. The proposed bill, in my judgment, takes a 
rigid view of those needs, with insufficient regard to the principle of "need to know" 
and the requirement for secrecy. 
While there are several troubling elements in H.R. 3822, my principal concern is 
the requirement in Section 503 which mandates notification of covert action "in no 
event later than forty-eight hours after the special activity has been authorized." 
This requirement could in some rare circumstances pose unacceptable risks to the 
conduct of a covert action. There could be cases where Presidential authorization 
might be required considerably in advance of the execution of the activity in order 
that adequate preparatory measures could be taken. Notification upon authorization 
could risk exposure of the project and put the lives of Americans or others assisting 
the country in jeopardy. 
This clause is designed to close the "loophole" in current law which permitted the 
President to avoid notification of the Iranian arms shipments for many months. 
Concern over this particular event is understandable and warranted, but the exces-
sively restrictive language proposed seems a case of throwing out the baby with the 
bath. It is not possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the Executive 
without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act. 
The rigid notification requirement apparently stems from the belief that if the In-
telligence Committees had been notified of the Iranian arms proposals, the members 
would have reacted negatively and the President would on that account not have 
proceeded with his plans. There is no evidence to support this assumption. Indeed, 
as it was, the President was confronted, by his principal advisors, with views strong-
ly in opposition to the Iranian arms sales. 
Another operation having the unique characteristics of the Iranian arms for hos-
tages affair is not likely. In the Iranian case, every senior U.S. official involved 
made serious mistakes. That, I think we can be confident, will remain a rare phe-
nomenon. The cause of this particular foreign policy failure must be attributed to 
people, not process. In addition, and even more important, the Iranian affair is cer-
tain to be a graphic object lesson for future Administrations. The political costs to 
the President of the Iran/Contra affair have been severe. The President has been 
demonstrated to be accountable, in the most real sense, for the actions of the Execu-
tive Branch and, very directly, for the NSC and its staff. If there is a political mes-
sage in this unfortunate matter it is that the President, in his own interest, ought to 
seek consultation with appropriate elements of the Congress, especially where im-
portant policy issues are at stake, He simply cannot go it alone, not over the longer 
run, on issues of significance. 
Problems of governance, in our system of shared powers, cannot effectively be re-
solved by each branch pressing its extreme position. If the system is to avoid paraly-
sis and to perform well in the interests of the American people, it can only be 
through a cooperative, not a confrontational, approach, While the Constitution may 
be an invitation to struggle over foreign policy, we do not have to accept that invita-
tion. We can instead try comity. 
There are great lessons in the Iran/Contra mess, beyond the political costs of 
trying to bypass the Congress. Many of them, for the Executive Branch, were set out 
in the Tower Board report. Additionally, it should be clear that covert action should 
be undertaken only in support of our foreign policies, not in contradiction to them. 
In the Iranian case, in particular, the exception to policy had the practical effect, 
albeit unintended, of undermining seriously the strongly supported public policy. 
We may also have to recognize, regrettably, that in the present climate covert 
action should be undertaken only when there is broad consensus on the underlying 
policy it is designed to promote. That is unfortunate, because covert action can fre-
quently be most useful when problems are incipient, when modest efforts can be 
more effective than the massive involvement which may subsequently be required if 
issues are allowed to fester until their implications become apparent to all and 
there is a consensus on action. 
But while there are many lessons for the Executive?most if not all of which are 
recognized and being dealt with by the President?the Congress has responsibilities 
as well. Leaks, for example, which are at the heart of this issue, are a shared prob-
lem. It is even possible that the situation may be worse in the Executive Branch 
than on Capitol Hill. However, justified or not, a President understandably is reluc-
tant to share fully the most secret of matters with people some of whom may have

sharp policy differences with him and over whom he can exercise no authority or 
discipline whatever, Congress must accept some responsibility for the satisfactory 
resolution of these matters. It should accept that it is an integral part of the proc-
ess, not simply a judge and jury of the mistakes it perceives being made by the Ex-
ecutive Branch. 
The Tower Board recommended against legislation to deal with the problems re-
vealed in the Iran/Contra affair. I support that recommendation. In my opinion, 
H.R. 3822 is a step toward paralysis, not effective Government. 
Mr. McHuGH. Thank you very much, General. 
We'll now hear from Dr. Carver. 
STATEMENT OF DR. GEORGE A. CARVER, JR, OLIN SENIOR 
FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATION-
AL STUDIES 
Dr. CARVER. Mr. Chairman, esteemed members, I'm honored by 
your invitation to be here today to comment not only on the specif-
ic bill you are considering, but also on the larger issues addressed 
in that legislation. 
These larger issues impinge directly on our Nation's security and 
even its chances of survival in this strife-ridden and now thermo-
nuclear world. 
As we all know, it is not easy for an open democracy, such as 
ours, to have the kind of effective intelligence structure our nation 
needs, one that is capable of protecting our democratic freedoms, 
but does not curtail, or even worse, subvert them. 
These are issues to which I devoted the first 26 years of my pro-
fessional life, and in which, as a citizen, I have an abiding interest. 
It is a pleasure as well as a privilege to discuss them with this 
Subcommittee I feel confident that, as fellow citizens, we have 
common goals and objectives, for the issues here involved tran-
scend personal, political, parochial or partisan considerations. 
Our differences and your differences among yourselves will be 
over the optimum means of achieving these common goals, and the 
best way of resolving the complex, thorny questions these issues, in 
a democracy, inevitably pose. 
The matters addressed in H.R. 3822 are of enormous importance, 
as well as complexity. The time you have available in this hearing 
for considering them, particularly the time you can allocate to any 
single witness, is necessarily constrained. 
I have had separately submitted in writing for the record and for 
your consideration at your convenience my detailed comments on 
H.R. 3822 and the issues with which it deals. 
I would ask, Mr. Chairman, that you enter that full submission 
with the record. 
Mr. McHuGH. Without objection, certainly. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Excuse me, Dr. Carver, if I can interrupt. I just 
want to make sure that General Scowcroft and Dr. Treverton's 
statements likewise get in the record, as well as Professor Rostow's. 
Mr. McHuGH. That's been taken care of. 
Go ahead, Doctor. 
Dr. CARVER. In this orally presented summary, I will draw on 
that full submission to highlight some points to which I particular-
ly want to direct your attention.

But, Mr. Chairman, here I must ask your guidance. I timed my 
summary this morning and it takes me 21 minutes. I can cut it 
short if you would prefer. 
Mr. McHum'. I would prefer that you do so. [Laughter.] 
Dr. CARVER. I will skip a great deal, but I would like to turn to 
one of the conditions that are imposed on the finding. That is the 
fourth condition in section 503(a)(4) because that involves some 
things that I think we ought to be willing to take about 8 minutes 
to discuss. 
Mr. McHum'. Go right ahead. 
Dr. CARVER. This fourth condition is that "each finding shall 
specify whether it is contemplated that any third party which is 
not an element of or a contractor or contract agent of, the U.S. 
Government, or is not otherwise the subject to the U.S. Govern-
ment policies and regulations, will be used to fund or otherwise 
participate in any significant way in the special activity concerned, 
or be used to undertake the special activity concerned on behalf of 
the United States." 
As_do the other conditions, this one has a clear, eminently under-
standable Iran-Contra inspiration; but, no matter how reasonable 
and defensible this condition's intent may be, its language contains 
the potential for more problems, of greater severity, than those en-
gendered by all of the other conditions combined. 
As it stands, this fourth condition's language can be construed as 
being either trivial or as being extraordinarily dangerous, pn secu-
rity grounds. 
Virtually no foreign intelligence operation, certainly no covert 
action operation or "special activity," can be successfully conducted 
without the cooperation and utilization of foreigners?including in-
dividuals, entities or organizations, such as intelligence services, 
governments, or some combination of any or all of these. 
No sensible U.S. intelligence officer or service could plan a "spe-
cial activity" without, at a minimum, "contemplating" that one or 
more foreign individuals, organizations, services, or governments 
might be used "to fund or otherwise participate", in some signifi-
cant way, "in the special activity concerned on behalf of the United 
'States". 
In this whole matter, indeed, H.R. 3822 attempts to draw a dis-
tinction which may sound very simple, neat and tidy in a proposed 
statute, but which in the real world is very difficult to draw, and 
often does not exist. 
In the actual conduct of intelligence activities abroad, the cooper-
ating institutional and individual assets?agents if you will?used 
in special activities, and those used in normal, albeit sensitive, in-
telligence collection activities are often the same?the same institu-
tions, the same organizations, and the same people. 
Given the real world's exigencies and complexities, consequently 
there is often no way you can meaningfully distinguish?for pur-
poses of reporting to Congress?between foreign institutions and in-
dividuals who assist in the conduct of "special activities" and those 
who assist in the conduct of intelligence activities in general. 
This is significant, Mr. Chairman, because there was one point 
that I made in my opening remarks that I would like to direct your 
attention to, and skipped in my summary abridgement.

Covert action is an important intelligence community and, specif-
ically, CIA responsibility, but it is an ancillary one. Extreme care 
should be taken to ensure that any "fixing" you do of covert action 
does not unintentionally hamper the agency's and the intelligence - 
community's ability to perform their primary mission, for example, 
by putting sensitive intelligence sources at risk. 
This is particularly important when arms limitation treaties, es-
pecially ones involving strategic arms, are being considered and ne-
gotiated, for our compliance monitoring capabilities in this critical 
sphere hinge on the U.S. intelligence community's overall effective-
ness.' 
Now, back to proposed subsection 503(a)(4). If this fourth condi-
tion is construed as requiring only a general statement, than it is 
virtually meaningless; for if so construed, it can be satisfied by a 
standard, boilerplate sentence mechanically incorporated in every 
finding and saying something along the lines of "The special activi-
ty herein described of course contemplates the use and participa-
tion of one or more non-U.S. individuals, persons, organizations, or 
entities." 
If subsection (4) is supposed to mean more than that, however, 
particularly if it is intended to require giving some specific indica-
tion of what types of non-U.S. Government "third parties" will be 
participating, and in what ways, in the special activity covered by 
a particular finding, then that condition lays down a security mine-
field impossible to traverse unscathed. 
The language of the final sentence of H.R. 3822's proposed sub-
section 503(e) could easily be read as supporting a broad construc-
tion of this fourth condition of subsection 503(a). That sentence 
says, in language evoking Gertrude Stein: 
A request by any agency or department of the United States to a foreign country 
or private citizen to conduct a special activity on behalf of the United States shall 
be deemed to be a special activity. 
If H.R. 3822 is enacted, as currently drafted, this sentence could 
easily be construed as meaning that the Executive Branch is re-
quired to write and submit a separate finding on each and every 
request to a foreign government and each and every recruitment 
pitch to a foreign national for assistance in a U.S. covert action op-
eration. 
Should proposed section 503(a)(4) ever be given this type of broad 
construction, now or in the future, satisfying its requirements 
would inevitably involve security risks so grave that no prudent 
U.S. President, administration, or Director of Central Intelli-
gence?not to mention foreign individual, entity, or government?
would want to run them. 
In this context, harking back to an example that has been dis-
cussed before, please remember that less than one year ago, on 
April 8, 1987?in testifying before the full House oversight commit-
tee?Representative Mineta, a staunch proponent of strict congres-
sional intelligence oversight, confirmed and acknowledged, as we 
have discussed, that the Canadian Government did not want its 
1980 role in hiding, protecting, and safely exfiltrating American 
hostages from Iran to be reported to Congress by President Carter, 
at least while the operation was in train.

I know from my own experience as Chairman of the U.S. Intelli-
gence Coordinating Committee in Germany, from 1976 to 1979, how 
skittish my West German, Israeli, and other friendly foreign serv-
ice counterparts were about sharing sensitive information, especial-
ly operational information, on common concerns and targets?such 
as terrorism?because of their worries about how such information, 
after I reported it, would be handled back in Washington, particu-
larly if it was passed to Congress. 
The strong, almost universal perception of my foreign counter-
parts was that in the United States, we were manifestly incapable 
of protecting even our own secrets; hence, we could hardly be relied 
on to protect theirs. 
We may consider such foreign perceptions unwarranted and inac-
curate, but their widespread existence and their force are facts 
that American intelligence professionals cannot ignore or brush 
aside when planning operations?of any nature?in which coopera-
tive foreign participation is essential. 
Such foreign perceptions and concerns would be inflamed and ex-
ponentially increased if H.R. 3822's proposed subsection 503(aX4) 
should ever be enacted into law and then broadly construed. 
Should it ever come to be widely believed abroad that U.S. law 
required?or even if there was a serious risk that U.S. law might 
require?the identification in a written document, of which at least 
two copies would be sent to Congress, of all non-U.S. individuals 
and entities, including governments, cooperatively participating in 
any U.S. special activity, our pool of essential foreign assistance 
and support would swiftly. evaporate. The extent and speed of that 
pool's evaporation, furthermore, would be increased by the fact 
that few foreigners would note and even fewer would pay attention 
to any American legal distinctions between special activities and 
other intelligence activities. 
In this sphere, foreign perceptions and beliefs, not our assess-
ment of their accuracy and validity, would be controlling. 
From the perspective of 26 years experience in the profession of 
intelligence, I can state flatly that should H.R. 3822's proposed sub-
section 503(a)(4), or anything like it, ever be enacted into law, few 
foreign individuals or entities, governments again included, whose 
cooperation and assistance we would need to conduct "special ac-
tivities"?or, for that matter, any intelligence activities of any con-
sequence?would be willing to put their fortunes, reputations, or, 
in the case of individuals, their freedom and even their lives hos-
tage to the discretion and secret-keeping capability of the Congress 
of the United States. 
Quite apart from the nature and format of findings is the point 
that Secretary Carlucci took up, where there is a distinct contradic-
tion between the flexibility that is given to the President with re-
spect to authorization and is then taken away with respect to initi-
ation. The flexibility given in 503(c)(2), "in circumstances where 
time is of the essence," is taken away by 503(c)(3), because fre-
quently, as Secretary Carlucci said, a period of not just 48 hours 
but many months can lapse between the initiation and authoriza-
tion of a special activity. 
This again gets right back to the Canadian situation, where the 
Canadians for their own security protection made their essential 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
243 
cooperation contingent on Congress' not being told what was in 
train or what the Canadians were doing until after the operation 
was concluded. In that instance the period between authorization 
and implementation was measured in weeks and not in hours. That 
was a special activity under the terms of the legislation we are con-
sidering because it involved the CIA operation for purposes other 
than the collection of intelligence. 
But that is the net the drafters would have caught the Canadians 
and the U.S. Government in. 
Had H.R. 3822, as presently phrased, been on the statute books 
in 1980, President Carter, not President Reagan, would have been 
impaled on the horns of a dilemma. He would have had to either 
ignore the law or tell the Canadians that he could not lawfully 
meet the conditions that they imposed on their essential assistance 
and that as a sovereign government they had the right to insist on, 
even though declining that assistance clearly put American lives at 
risk. 
As you yourself indicated, Mr. Chairman, I can not believe that 
any member of this subcommittee or of the full House oversight 
committee or, for that matter, of Congress would want to put any 
American President, of whatever party, in such a situation. This is 
far from the least of the reasons why I respectfully urge that the 
subcommittee reconsider the language of H.R. 3822, and all of that 
language's implications, before recommending that this proposed 
bill as it now stands be enacted into law. 
In its conduct of Iran-Contra, the Reagan administration clearly - 
abused the discretionary latitude afforded any administration of 
any party, in conducting covert operations, by the flexibility and 
ambiguity of some of the language in the current statutes dealing 
with these matters. 
H.R. 3822 would remove the ambiguity and virtually eradicate 
the flexibility of the relevant statutes. Doing that, however, could 
easily prove procrustean and generate serious problems in future 
contingencies or situations not now foreseen. 
By reducing the permissible exceptions to a bare minimum, not 
always in consistent ways, H.R. 3822 would also push Congress far 
deeper into the prior notification thicket. In the light of Iran-
Contra, this might seem desirable, but it is a punitive move that 
would probably be rued by future Congresses, as well as future 
Presidents?regardless of party. 
As President Carter's, not President Reagan's, Deputy Assistant 
for National Security Affairs, David Aaron, put the matter quite 
neatly when testifying before the House Intelligence Oversight 
Committee in September 1983 in connection with the "special ac-
tivities" legislation that would also have altered the National Secu-
rity Act of 1947's current section 501: 
It was the purpose of [current] Sec. 501 to ensure that the Congress had sufficient 
access to information, in a timely way, to be able to exercise [its proper] functions in 
the field of intelligence activities. It was not [one of] the goals of Sec. 501 to make 
the Congress a codecisionmaker on covert action operations. 
Drafted in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Contra Report's 
preparation, H.R. 3822's language, at least to this reader's eyes, re-
flects an eminently understandable desire to rap Ronald Reagan's 
knuckles and tie his hands. But Ronald Reagan leaves the Oval

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

244 
Office permanently in January 1989?less than a year hence?and 
none of his successors, of whatever party, is likely to forget or 
ignore the lessons of Iran-Contra. 
Furthermore, if H.R. 3822 or any similar bill gets enacted, there 
is no way of telling what future President's hands that law may 
tie, under what particular circumstances, with what adverse 
impact on U.S. interests. 
Legislation affecting congressional oversight of intelligence ac-
tivities, particularly "special activities," is invariably complicated, 
for it inevitably involves the judicious weighing and balancing of a 
myriad of important, complex, and often conflicting considerations 
and equities. Such legislation should not be drafted or enacted in 
haste or under the influence of strong emotions, including pique. 
Nor is it wise to draft, debate, and enact such legislation amid the 
distractions and pressures of a Presidential election year, including 
an election year's temptations to adopt or endorse positions, on 
controversial issues, that are poll or popularity-enhancing in the 
short run, but not necessarily in the long-term best interests of the 
United States. 
Such considerations apply with particular force, to issues involv-
ing reforms; for reforms drafted and adopted under such circum-
stances and conditions almost invariably prove to have unintended, 
undesired consequences. 
During my own career in Government, I was privileged to devel-
op a close association with the Honorable Birch Bayh, the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence's second chairman. We differed 
on many issues, as we still do, but became and remain good friends. 
He visited me in Germany, as a guest in my home?where he 
was a great favorite with my children?while I had overall respon-
sibility for the U.S. intelligence community there and he was chair-
man of the Senate Oversight Committee. 
On one evening during that visit, I assembled a representative, 
cross-sectional group of my abler young officers who were deeply 
and personally involved in our efforts to combat terrorism and 
other threats to the security of the United States. We sat up all 
night, literally, having a frank, suitably lubricated, no-holds-
barred, give-and-take discussion. 
During that discussion, my frontline colleagues endeavored to ex-
plain, by citing a succession of concrete examples, how difficult it 
was to apply on the banks of the Rhine?and of other rivers 
around the world?the sweeping, "thou shalt not, ever, under any 
circumstances" reform restrictions of the mid-1970's, which sound-
ed so splendid when proclaimed, passed, issued, or endorsed along 
the banks of the Potomac. 
As my young colleagues kept recounting their frustrating first-
hand experiences with the results or consequences of these "re-
forms," the good Senator kept repeating, like an antiphonal re-
sponse in a High Church Anglican service, "But this was never the 
intent of Congress!" 
My equally antiphonal response was that in the field, we did not 
have the luxury of trying to divine congressional intent. Instead, 
we had to be guided and were circumscribed by what the govern-
ment's lawyers, incluidng the CIA's, construed to be the meaning 
of the language in statutes Congress enacted, such as the Foreign

245 
Intelligence Surveillance Act, or in executive orders and internal 
CIA regulations strongly influenced by congressional attitudes. 
No sensible person would contend?and I certainly do not?that 
our current laws dealing with covert action and its oversight 
cannot be improved. This subcommittee and its staff are to be com-
mended on the thought, care, and effort that have clearly gone into 
the consideration and discussions of H.R. 3822. 
For reasons I have tried to explain, however, I do not believe 
that the end results this distinguished subcommittee or its full 
parent committee wants to achieve, in the discharge of Congress' 
constitutionally mandated responsibilities, are most likely to be at-
tained by moving forward with H.R. 3822 or any similar legislation, 
unavoidably drafted in some haste in the wake of the issuance of 
the Iran-Contra Report and under the influence of emotions which 
that unhappy affair inevitably engendered on Capitol Hill, particu-
larly when any such legislation would have to be debated and en-
acted amidst the mounting, divisive and partisan pressures of a 
Presidential election year. 
In my opinion, which I offer with diffident respect, our nation's 
interests would be far better served if, instead, a small group of 
knowledgeable senior administration officials, past or present, 
could be convened to meet quietly with a corresponding, and corre-
spondingly small, bipartisan group of appropriate congressional 
leaders from both houses; and then, over the course of several 
months' frank, private discussion, this joint body, working together, 
could develop a set of agreed principles regarding covert action, 
work out a viable system for resolving executive/legislative branch 
disputes, and supervise the measured, careful drafting of any new 
legislation thought to be warranted?for formal introduction, 
debate, consideration, and enactment after the 1988 electoral 
season, with its attendant demands and pressures, has passed. 
This may be a utopian dream, but as a concerned citizen who has 
devoted over a quarter century to serving our Nation as an intelli-
gence professional, I would relish seeing this dream become a reali-
ty. 
Thank you very much for your time and attention.

Mt. Chairman and Distinguished Members: 
I am honored by your invitation to appear today to comment 
not only on the specific bill you are considering, H.R. 3822, but 
also on the larger issues addressed in that propOsed legislation 
and in the parallel, very similar Senate bill, 3.1721. . 
These larger issues impinge directly on our nation's 
security and even its chances of survival in this strife-ridden 
and now thermonuclear world. As we all know, it is not easy for 
an open democracy, such as ours, to have the kind of effective 
intelligence structure our nation needs -- one that is capable of 
protecting our democratic freedoms but does not curtail or, even 
worse, subvert them. These are issues to which I devoted, the 
first twenty-six years of my professional life and in which, as a 
citizen, I have an abiding interest. It is a pleasure, as well 
as a privilege, to discuss them 4ith this sub-committee. I feel 
confident that as fellow citizens we have common goals and , 
objectives; for the issues here involved transcend personal, 
parochial or partisan considerations. Our differences, and your 
differences among yourselves, will be over the optimum means of 
achieving these common goals, and the best way of resolving the 
complex, thorny questions these issues, in a democracy, 
inevitably pose.

To supplementmy orally presented summary comments, I am 
submitting this fuller statement for the record. To this 
.statement, I am also appending an essay entitled "A Needed 
Capability JeapordiZed: Covert Action in the Wake of the Iran-
Contra Hearings", which I wrOte goon after the hearings ended and 
was published in Ihs un Dieao nion (on 16 AUgust 1987), in The 
Washinaton Timis (on 17 August 1987), and in various other 
newspapers around the country. 
? 
This statement begins with a conceptual analysis of covert. 
'action, its complexities, and the problems its employment poses 
for an open, democratic society such as ours. I then touch on 
the Constitution's division of authority and responsibility in 
the fields of foreign affairs and, particularly, intelligence, 
and the resultant need for our government's executive and 
legislative branches to recognize each other's Constitutional 
roles and to work harmoniously together, if our nation's. 
interests are to be protected and well served. 
Within that context, an analysis is made of H.R. 3822's 
. provisions and, especially, the language in which they are. 
phrased, to assess the impact of these provisions, and this 
language, on a.number of topics germane .to the conduct of covert 
action and of intelligence operations in general. In sequence, 
this statement examines certain security concerns, reporting 
requirements and flexibility, the matter of "findings", and.some

of that complex issue's various ramifications. A look is then 
taken at questions involved in the timing of congressional 
notification and, in particular, "prior notification". My 
submission concludes by noting some of the risks inherent in 
emotion-impelled "reforms", especially ones drafted in haste, and 
theurespectfully offering, for this sub-committee's 
consideration, a fey of my own thoughts on what ought to be done, 
in light of our total national interests,. with regard to the 
important matters you are addressing. 
COVERT ACTION: ITS IMPORTANCE. COMPLEXITIES 
AND OVERSIGHT RAMIFICATIONS  
The primaryfocus of the specific legislation this sub-
committee is considering, H.R. 3822, and of current congressional 
concerns with respect to intelligence is, quite understandably, 
covert action. Here, however,. I most respectfully ask you to be 
careful, and not allow justified concerns to skew an essential 
sense of proportion. 
The primary function of the U.S. intelligence community is 
to collect information, distill it into intelligence by analysis, 
and then disseminate the fruits of this collection and analysis 
to those in our government's executive and legislative branches 
whom that intelligence will aid in the discharge of their 
Constitutionally-mandated responsibilities. The CIA is charged 
with all of these roles, plus that of being the U.S. intelligence

community's central coordinating linch-pin -- a role highlighted.-
by the fact that there is no Director of the CIA (alone). Its 
administrative head, the Director of Central Intelligence; is 
also -- concurrently -- the President's senior intelligence 
advisor and head of the U.S. intelligence community. 
Covert action is an important CIA responsibility but an 
ancillary one. Extreme care should be taken to ensure that any 
"fixing" of covert action does not unintentionally hamper the 
,Agency's and ,the intelligence community's ability to perform 
their primary mission -- for example,. by putting sensitive 
intelligence sources and methods at risk. This is particularly 
important when arms limitation treaties, especially ones 
involving strategic arms, are being considered and negotiated; 
for our compliance-monitoring capabilities, in this critical 
sphere, hinge on the U.S. intelligence community's overall 
effectiveness. 
"Covert action" is a term with such a broad scope that it is 
impossible to define with any degree of-precision.' It 
encompasses everything from encouraging a foreign journalist ? to 
write a story or editorial which'that journalist might well have 
written anyway to supporting, even guiding, fairly large-scale 
military activities-in foreign-lands. Covert action's purpose-As 
to influence the' behavior or policies of key foreign individuals, 
groups and nations, and the course of events in key foreign 
areas, in ways that further the interests ofthe nation Mounting.,

the covert action in question, but also in ways that mask that 
nation's hand and enables its involvement to be denied or, at, 
least, officially disavowed. Perhaps the best way to understand 
covert action is to think of it as a form of international 
lobbying that is, ideally, discreet and unadvertised. 
The usual euphemism for covert action, employed in the 
legislation you are considering, is "special activities" --
defined in Executive Order 12333 (and elsewhere) as: 
"activities conducted in support of national foreign 
policy objectives abroad which are planned and executed 
so that the role of the United States Government is not 
apparent or acknowledged publicly, and functions in 
support of such activities...." 
As the report of the Iran-Contra Congressional Investigating 
Committees notes, on page 375, 
"This definition excludes diplomatic activities, the 
collection and production of intelligence, or related 
support functions." 
Intelligence, activities, generally, are not easy for an 
open, democratic society to conduct effectively, especially in 
peacetime. For a plethora of reasons, covert action is 
particularly difficult, for a society such as ours, and raises 
particularly difficult questions -- ones that have no universally 
satisfactory resolutions, let alone any simple answers. 
To begin with, there is a consideration that is not polite 
to acknowledge or discuss, but which has to be faced. In most 
cases, conducting covert action involves contravening, infringing 
upon or directly violating the laws of some other nation or

nations, with which we are not in a state of war and with which, 
indeed; we. may have treaty relations Whose spirit, if not letter; 
such covert actions may also contravene. (The same is also true 
of espionage, but that is another matter.) This does not mean we 
should pass a self-denying ordinance; for covert action is a fact 
of international life. It is something that virtually every 
nation in the world essays, frequently targeted at us; and some 
of our closest allies, such as Israel, areamong its most 
indefatigible practitioners'. Such considerations do Mean, 
however, that covert action should be used very circumspectly, 
far more circumspectly than it sometimes has been -- as Iran-
Contra demonstrates all too clearly: Milan astutely employed, 
covert action can be a very useful, effective adjunct to policy; 
but it can never-be .a-substitute for-policy -- or for thought: 
In ,this Context, there is a salienttfeature.of-our political 
system whose consequences are frequently ignored Or brushed 
aside. Our Constitution combines in one individual, our 
President; two distinct offices and functions that most Other 
nations divide: the government's chief executive and 
administrative officer, and the nation's Chief of State. The 
former is a partisan political figure chosen (in America) by 
election; the latter, a-symbolic focus of national unity 
suppOtedly, in that.capacity, above the fray of political 
partisanship. As chief -executive officer,. a President should 
certainly be-accountable for his and-his administration's

actions. Nonetheless, it is by no means necessarily in our 
national interest for our Chief. of State to sign "findings" or 
any other documents directing agencies or officers of the U.S. 
Government to infringe upon or violate the laws of other nations 
with which we are not ima state of declared war. NSC staff 
members, national security advisors, cabinet officers and 
Directors of Central Intelligence are all expendable; but in our 
government, Presidents are not. As Chief of State, an American 
President should be able to distance himself or herself from, 
even disavow, a covert action that he or she approved, even 
ordered, as chief executive. This may sound complicated, but so 
is the real world and, hence, effective diplomacy that runs with 
the grain of its complex reality. 
Such messy complexities, and the troublesome issues they 
raise, lead some to argue that the United States should eschew or 
abandon covert action altogether. In a perfect world, this might 
be desirable; but in the world in which we have no choice but to 
live, it would be folly. One point on which members of the 
Congressional Committees investigating the Iran-Contra Affair 
were agreed is that, to use their Report's words (on page 383), 
"Covert operations are a necessary component of our Nation's 
foreign policy". :The real question before Congress, and the 
American people, is not whether our nation should conduct. covert 
action but, instead, how such operations should be handled, 
controlled and reviewed to ensure that they are soundly

conceived, efficiently executed and effective, but do not do 
injury to any of our democratic polity's fundamental interests or 
basic values. 
Congress was quite-understandably:distressed by the kinds of 
covert operations mounted during what we now term "Iran-Contra", 
by these-operations' execution and, particularly, by the way in 
which Congress was 'handled with respect to them. No matter how 
admirable or defensible the administration's motives and 
objectives-may have been, the way in which these operations-were 
developed and run violated every canon and precept of sound 
professionalism, not to mention common sense. Furthermore, all 
other considerations apart', tne administration's manner of 
dealing with Congress during this episode was both inept and 
politically tone-deaf. 
Congress has ample reason to be irritated at the 
administration, and concerned about the way it ,handled that 
specific covert action. In dealing with important issues, 
however, Particularly ones as complex as these, all prudent 
humans -- including distinguished members of Congress, and of 
both of its intelligence oversight committees -- should avoid, 
-acting hastily, vithpunitive intent, under the stimulus of 
irritation.

In its 24th Chapter of their Report -- "Covert Action in a 
Democratic Society" -- the Congressional Committees investigating 
Iran-Contra posed the fundamental question: 
"Is it possible for an open society such as the United 
States to conduct such secret activities effectively? 
And if so, by what means can these operations be 
controlled so as to meet the requirements of 
accountability in a democratic society?" 
In answering that question, the report noted the laws and 
procedures adopted after the investigations and debates of the 
mid-1970s, and then went on to observe (also on page 375) that 
"Experience has shown that these laws and procedures, if 
respected, are adequate to the task." 
Amplifying this theme, the Iran-Contra Report's 
"Recommendations" chapter (28) opens with two paragraphs which 
read: 
It is the conclusion of these Committees that the 
Iran-Contra Affair resulted from the failure of 
individuals to observe the law, not from deficiencies 
in existing law or in our system of governance. This 
is an important lesson to be,learned from these 
investigations because it points to the fundamental 
soundness of our constitutional processes. 
Thus, the principal recommendations emerging from 
the investigation are not for new laws but for a 
renewal of the commitment to constitutional government 
and sound processes of decisionmaking. 
That chapter does go on to recommend "some changes in law, 
particularly relating to oversight of covert operations", and 
some of those recommended changes are reflected in the bill this 
hearing was convened to address. Most respectfully, however, I 
hope that this Subcommittee's -- and the entire Congress' --

discussion and decision about the details of such suggested 
changes will be framed,within the judicious context set by the 
two paragraphs just quoted. 
The reference in the second quoted paragraph's concluding 
sentence to "the commitment to constitutional government and 
sound decisionmaking" raises a whole new set of important,-
complex issues: 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTELLIGENCE:  
THE CONSTITUTION'S DIVISION 
OF RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY 
Our Constitution does not explicitly mention intelligence, 
let alone covert action, nor does it use the terms "foreign 
policy" or "foreign affairs". By design, nonetheless, the 
Constitution divides authority and responsibility in this Sphere 
as well as in others. 
For example, the Constitution gives Congress the "power...to 
regulate Commerce with: foreign Nations" and "To declare War"; In 
addition to being named "Commander in Chief", however, the 
President is given "Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of 
the Senate, to make Treaties." 
Most of our nation's Founding Fathers did not regard the 
Constitution's division of authority over foreign affairs quite 
so extensive, or ambiguous, as many would now argue. At the time 
10

the Constitution was adopted, the general.view was that 
Congressional authorities,in,the.foreign policy sphere were 
exceptions to the stipulation in the first sentence of Section 1 
of the Constitution's Article II: "The executive Power shall be 
vested in a President ofthe United States of America". One of 
the few things on which Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison were all 
in agreement was that these exceptions should be construed 
"strictly". 
As Jefferson put the matter, in 17904 
"The transaction of business with foreign nations is 
executive altogether; it belongs then, to the head of that 
department, except as to such portions of it as are 
specially, submitted to the Senate. Exceptions are to be 
construed strictly." 
Hamilton expressed almost identical thoughts in his first 
pacificus letter, published three years lhter: 
"It deserves to be remarked, that as the participation of 
the Senate in the making of treaties, and the power of the' 
Legislature to declare war, are exceptions out of the 
general "executive power" vested in the President, they are 
to be construed strictly, and ought to be extended no 
further than is essential to their execution." 
Indeed, Jefferson -- with Madison in general concurrence --
extended this line of reasoning to cover the executive's 
obligation, which he considered quite limited, to account for the 
expenditure of funds appropriated by Congress for the conduct of 
foreign affairs. Jefferson, as President, put his thoughts on 
this matter quite succinctly in an 1804 letter to his Treasury - ? 
secretary, Albert Gallatin:

"The Constitution has made the Executive the organ for 
managing our intercourse with foreign nations.... The 
Executive being thus charged with the .foreign intercourse, 
no law has undertaken to prescribe its specific 
duties..:.[I]t has been the uniform opinion and practice 
that the whole foreign fund was placed by the Legislature on 
the footing of a contingent fund, in which they undertake no-
specifications, but leave the whole to the discretion of the 
president." 
Legislative-executive branch debates over roles, and 
primacy, in the general field of foreign policy are as old as, or 
even ante-date, our republic. Parallel debates with specific 
respect to intelligence, however, are of considerably more recent 
vintage. 
Though the word "intelligende" does not appear in the 
Constitution, how those who !ranted it viewed the intelligence 
function is quite forcefully and clearly expounded by John .Jay --
who as a co-author of the Federalist Fauers and then, under the 
new Constitution, our nation's first Chief Justice is certainly a 
reliable, authoritative source regarding "original intent". 
In Federalist 64, discussing foreign affairs generally -and 
treaty negotiations specifically, Jay wrote: 
"It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of 
whatever nature, but that perfect secrecy and immediate 
dik2At= are sometimes requisite. There are cases where the 
most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons 
possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of 
discovery. Those apprehensions will operate on those 
persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or friendly 
motives: and there doubtless are many of both descriptions 
who would rely on the secrecy of the President, but who 
would not confide in that of the Senate, and still less in 
12

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1660 
that of a large popular assembly. The convention have done 
well, therefore, in so disposing of the power of making 
treaties that although the President must, in forming them, 
act by the advice and consent of the Senate, yet he will be 
able to manage the business of intelligence in such manner 
as prudence may suggest." (emphasis in original) 
John Jay clearly regarded "the business of intelligence" as 
being primarily a presidential or executive branch function, not 
a legislative branch responsibility -- a view shared by all 
serving presidents from Washington onward. 
With regard to what is now called covert action, Senator 
Cohen -- in a 25 September 1987 statement introducing 8.1721 --
has contended that his bill and hence, by extension, H.R. 3822 as 
well: "would, for the first time, provide explicit statutory 
authority for the President to authorize covert actions, or 
'special activities', in support of U.S. foreign policy 
objectives, provided they are authorized in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in the bill." 
Oval Office incumbents and many others would argue strongly, 
however, that a President's authority to conduct covert action is 
not a gift from.Congress and requires no Congressionally-enacted 
statute. Instead, they would contend, it derives directly from 
Article II of the Constitution itself, specifically, from the 
previously quoted first sentence of that article's Section 1 --
"The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United 
States of America." -- and from the first sentence of that

article's Section 2, which explicitly names the President 
"Commander in Chief". In appropriating funds for covert 
activities, furthermore, Congress has certainly acknowledged --
by its own actions -- the right of suCessive Presidents to 
initiate, or commission, the specific covert activities for which 
such funds have been appropriated. 
While in office, our early presidents -- who had been 
directly and personally involved in the formulation and adoption 
of. our Constitution -- certainly did not act as if they felt that 
what we would now term covert action required Congressional 
involvement or, even less, prior Congressional knowledge. 
Indeed, if Jefferson, the-drafter of the Declaration of 
Independence, or Madison, the principal architect of our 
Constitution had shown, as President, the diffident deference to 
Congress that many now claim a President-is constitutionally 
obligated to show, in conducting foreign affairs, our republic 
would not now have its present territorial extent and probably 
would not have survived its perilous initial decades. 
In these areas where the Constitution delibertely divides 
authority -- our national interests are 'certainly not furthered 
by executive-legislative branch squabbles over turf, or attempted 
raids on each other's prerogatives. At both ends of Pennsylvania 
Avenue there needs to be a greater recognition than has been 
notable in.recent-months of the fact that, especially in the

and executive branches in a single harness, and unless they can 
pull together, in tandem, the nation suffers. 
In this context, I commend to all members of this sub-
committee -- and to all citizens interested in these vitally 
important subjects -- an essay co-authored by the Chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator David Boren, and his 
colleague Senator John Danforth. Their perceptive analysis was 
published in the 1 December 1987 edition of ma Washinaton post, 
under the headline title: "Why This Country Can't Lead". All of 
it is germane to the matters this sub-committee is addressing, 
but the following comments of these two distinguished senators 
are particularly relevant: 
Since we arrived in the Senate about a decade ago, 
partisanship within the institution has increased 
alarmingly. Some partisan one-upmanship may be 
expected in domestic matters, but it has spilled over 
into foreign affairs. In consequence, the stable and 
resolute foreign policy one should expect from the 
leader of the free world has been undermined by ongoing 
antagonism and turmoil between Congress and the 
executive branch of our government. 
On one hand, Congress is alarmed at the freebooting 
advonturism of a go-it-alone executive, as exemplified 
by the Iran-contra affair. On the other hand, the 
executive branch complains that Congress consists of 
533 secretaries of state who cannot resist any 
opportunity to interfere with arms negotiations and to 
micromanage foreign relations. The result is that 
mutual suspicion and a state of flux have supplanted 
the predictability and sense of purpose which 
characterise a leadership position in world affairs. 
Unlike parliamentary systems our Constitution 
divides foreign policy responsibility between two 
independent branches of government. The president is

263 
the commander in chief, but Congress gives its advice and 
consent to treaties and to the appointment of ambassadors. 
In recent times, Congress has confused this shared 
responsibility for foreign affairs with incessant and 
irresponsible tinkering. 
Though Senator -Boren would'doubtless not consider a bill of 
which he is a co-sponsor, S.1721, or its House counterpart, H.R. 
3822, to be an example of the Congressional tinkering he and 
Senator Danforth decry, I would respectfully suggest that a major 
defect in both bills, particularly H.R. 3822, is too little 
.acknowledgment of the fact that the President and the Congress do 
indeed share responsibility for foreign affairs and, by 
extension, intelligence, and that particularly with respect to 
intelligence, as John Jay arguesin Federalist 64, the 
Constitution confers some powers directly on the President, not 
on Congress. 
Involved here is one of our Constitution's many delicate 
balances, a balance carefully and properly acknowledged in the 
National Security Act of 1947's current Section 501, which both 
8.1721 and H.R.3822 propose to strike and replace with new 
language. 
As.this Committee well knows, that 1947 Act contains what is 
still- the basic charter of the CIA, the Director of Central 
Intelligence,and,vindeed, theU.S. intelligence community. 
Section 501 of that Act deals with Congressional oversight. It 
was added to the 1947 Act by. Sec. 407(b) (1) of the Intelligence

z64 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 3.981 (P.L. 96-450), known 
informally as the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980. As it now 
stands, Sec. 501's sub-section (a) -- before spelling out what, 
and how, the DCI and all intelligence community component heads 
are required to report to the Congress -- begins with a 
preambular clause that reads: 
To the extent consistent with all applicable 
authorities and duties, including those conferred by 
the Constitution upon the executive and legislative 
branches of the Government, and to the extent 
consistent with due regard for the protection, from 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information and 
information relating to intelligence sources and 
methods, the Director of Central Intelligence and the 
heads of all departments, agencies, and other entities 
of the United States involved in intelligence 
activities shall --
Then follows the list of reporting requirements (which, together 
with the full text of the current Sec. 501, are appended to this 
statement). 
Both S. 1721 and H.R. 3822,. as mentioned above, would strike . 
the current Sec. 501, inCluding sub-section 501(a), in its 
entirety, substituting new language for some of the text so 
stricken and repeating some of the former text in various places 
in several of the propOsed new sections. The carefully crafted 
Lead or "preambUlar" clause of current Sec. 501(a), quoted above, 
would disappear, though some of it is echoed in parts of S. 1721. 
Speaking of intelligence activities, for example, S. 1721's 
proposed new Sec. 501(a) says "that nothing contained herein . 
17

265 
shall be construed as a limitation onthe power of the President 
to initiate such activities in a manner consistent with his 
powers conferred by the Constitution." H.R. 3822, however, makes 
no reference to any Presidential powers of any description, let 
alone any conferred by the Constitution -- either in H.R.3822's-
proposed new Sec. 501(a) or anywhere else. The bill this sub-
committee is now considering, instead, speaks only of 
restrictions and requirements levied on the President, the DCI 
and the intelligence community, and ofthe obligations and 
responsibilities of all three with respect to reporting to 
Congress on current and anticipated intelligence activities. 
This approach inevitably gets into very murky Constitutional 
waters, for the Constitution can not be ammended or abrogated by 
a simple statute. The fact that one or more Members of Congress, 
if any of them were President, might not exercise Constitutionally-
conferred discretionary latitude in the same way as it was 
.exercised by some particular President -- including Ronald Reagan 
does not of itself mean that the Presidency, as an 
institution, does not not have the diecretiOnary powers in 
question. 
The "preambular" Clause of the National Security Act of 
-1947's current Sec. 501(4)-48 considerably more forthright than 
8.1721 about what the Chairman of-the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence has himself termed the executive and legislative 
branches' "shared responsibility"; but 8.1721's passing mention

of the powers that the Constitution confers on the President, and. 
of the fact that Congress should not attempt to limit or curtail. 
them,. is better than no mention at all of this Constitutionally 
weighty consideration -- about which, H.R. 3822 is deafeningly 
silent. 
Before this sub-committee or the full oversight committee 
recommends that the House, and the Congress, jettison the 
carefully crafted preambular language of the National Security 
Act of 1947.'s current Sec. 501(4, I respectfully urge that 
renewed, careful consideration be given to the cogent arguments 
presented to this very Committee in September 1983, when it was 
also considering legislation on "special activities", by two 
highly knowledgeable witnesses -- neither of whom is an opponent-
of strict congressional oversight of all intelligence activities 
or, for that matter, a Reagan administration supporter. 
In those September 1983 hearings, Mt. David Aaron -- a 
member of the Church Committee's staff and then, from 1977-81, 
President Carter's Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs 
remarked in his statement: 
"I start from the premise that the delicate balance 
struck in Sec. 501 most appropriately reflects the 
Constitutional ambiguity and tension in the 
relationship between the Congress and the Executive 
Branch, resulting from their differing respon-
aibilities.... It was the purpose of Sec. 501 to 
ensure that the Congress had sufficient access to 
information, in a timely way, to be able to exercise 
these [oversight and foreign policy] functions in the 
field of intelligence activities. It was not the

267 
intended goals of Sec. 501 to make the Congress a co-
decision-maker on covert action operations." 
Similar ground was covered, in those same hearings, by Mt. 
William Miller, who had previously served as the Staff Director 
of the Church Committee and then of the Senate's intelligence 
oversight committee. In his statement, Mr. Miller observed: 
"What is now the law of the land in Sec. 501 is the 
result of the several years' experience of both 
intelligence oversight committees and that of other 
House and the Senate Committees that have had 
responsibilities for intelligence activities since the 
Second World War. The existing law is the result of 
discussions, negotiations and give and take with two 
administrations, including the direct involvement of 
two Presidents, two Vice Presidents, four Directors of 
Central Intelligence, three Attorneys-General and a 
host of other Cabinet officials, Department' heads, 
Senators, Congressmen, Chiefs of Staff, constitutional 
experts and lawyers and other interested citizens. It 
? is not suprising that many urge caution about amending 
existing law, given the delicate issues involved and 
the broad spectrum of perspectives that Sec. 501 had to 
encompass." 
BECORITY CONCERNS 
Striking current Sec. 501 and,. hence, 501(a)'s opening 
clause would not only strike that clause's carefully drafted 
reference to the need to keep Congressional oversight authorities 
and executive branch reporting requirements consistent with the 
constitutional and "balance" issues here involved. It would also 
strike the general, tone-setting reference to the need to keep 
them consistent "with due regard for the protection from 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information and information

relating to intelligence sources and methods". 
Similar "due regard" language does twice appear somewhat 
later in H.R. 3822, in proposed Sections 502(a) and 503(b), but 
with a very significant modification. There is also a statement 
in proposed 501(d) that 
"The House of Representatives and the Senate, in 
consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, 
shall each establish, by rule or resolution of such 
House, procedures to protect from unauthorized 
disclosure all classified information and all 
information relating to intelligence sources and 
methods furnished to the intelligence committees or to 
Members of Congress under this title." 
Not having these security concerns reflected at the outset, 
however, attenuates their importance. Furthermore, neither the 
current Sec. 501 nor H.R. 3822, nor S.1721, makes any mention --
in the oversight context -- of the fact that another passage in 
the National Security Act of 1947, Sec. 102(d)(3), imposes. a 
statutory Obligation on the Director of Central Intelligence, 
with respect to security, by stipulating that the DCI "shall be 
responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from 
unauthorized disclosure." 
In addition, H.R. 3822's treatment of these critically 
important matters is inconsistent,. in a way perhaps overlooked by 
H.R. 3822's drafters but which is of enormous potential 
significance.

The just-quoted final clause of the National Security Act's 
Sec. 102(d)(3) provides: 
"That the Director of Central Intelligence shall be 
responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods 
from unauthorized disclosure." 
This language is repeated, and slightly broadened, in the "due 
regard" text of current Sec. 501(a) 'a preambular clause -- which 
H.R. 3822 would strike: 
"To the extent consistent ... with due regard for the 
protection from unauthorized disclosure 21 classified 
information and information relating tn intelligence sources 
and methods ...". (emphasis added) 
H.R. 3822's proposed Sec. 501(d), quoted above, echoes this 
language and broadens it a bit further by calling for procedures: 
"to protect from unauthorized disclosure All classified 
information and all information relating to intelligence 
sources and methods furnished to the intelligence committees 
or to Members of Congress under this title." 
On this singularly important topic, however, the proposed 
(and identical) "due regard" passages of H.R. 3822's Sec.502(a) 
and 503(a) reverse field sharply, in a confusingly inconsistent 
way. 
H.R. 3822's proposed Sec. 502 deals with "Reporting 
Intelligence Activities other than Special Activities": proposed 
Sec. 503 deals with "Presidential Approval and Reporting of 
Special Activities". With respect to the activities covered in 
each section, both proposed 502(a), and proposed 503(b), in 
22 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

270 
identical language, require the DCI et. al. "to keep the 
intelligence committees fully and currently informed", 
"To the extent consistent with due regard for the protection 
against unauthorized disclosure of classified information 
relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods..." 
(emphasis added) 
Involved here are two semantic shifts, one is minor; the other, 
decidedly not. 
In the minor shift, all other variations on the "due regard" 
and "protection" theme speak of protecting intelligence sources 
and methods, or information relating to them, or classified 
information trim unauthorized disclosure. Proposed Sec. 502(a) 
and 503(b), instead, speak of protection aaainst unauthorized 
disclosure. This inconsistency is slightly confusing but of no 
great consequence. 
The other, important shift is a very different matter. In 
-Sec. 102(d)(3), which H.R. 3822 would not alter., what is to be 
protected from unauthorized disclosure is "intelligence sources 
and methods". In current Sec. 501(a), it is "classified 
information and information relating 12 intelligence sources and 
methods" (emphasis added). In H.R. 3882'.s proposed Sec. 501(d), 
it is. "All classified information and sll information relating to 
intelligence sources and methods" (emphasis added). H.R. 3822's 
proposed Sec. 502(a) and 503(b), however, speak only of 
"due regard for the protection against unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive

271 
intelligence sources and methods" (emphasis added). 
- 
"Sensitive" is an adjective whose definition, or 
applicability in any concrete situation, is both imprecise and 
subjective. H.R. 3822 makes "sensitive" a hallmark 
characteristic restricting what needs to be protected, but 
nowhere does H.R. 3822 give this key, limiting adjective a 
definition governing its use in that particular context. Nor 
does H.R. 3822 specify who is to decide in any particular case, 
involving particular intelligence sources and methods, whether 
those sources and methods, in that Case, are "sensitive". Is 
this determination to be made by the President, by the DCI, by 
the Congress as a whole, by. either or both intelligence oversight 
committees -- or by whom? These may seem to be pedantic 
quibbles; but such inconeistencies and ambiguities could easily 
become enormously important in a complex, real-life Situation --
particularly one involving decisions at both ends of Pennsylvania 
Avenue on what needs to be told to, or can legitimately be 
divulged by, the Congress, and when. 
These potential pitfalls are deepened if proposed Sec. 
502(a) and 503(b) are read in conjunction with proposed See. 
501(e): 
"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority to 
withhold information from the intelligence committees on the 
grounds that providing the information to the intelligence 
committees would constitute the unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information or information relating to intelligence 
sources and methods".

272 
Taken in tandem, these three proposed sections of H.R. 3822 
set the stage for and, indeed, make almost inevitable future 
legislative-executive branch cat fights which ill-serve our 
national interests. In tandem, these three proposed sections 
give Congressional oversight committees a virtually unrestricted 
fishing license -- particularly if the Committees deem themselves 
the Arbiters of what information is, or is not, "sensitive" --
that future administrations, of whatever party, are bound to balk 
at, for very good reasons, if these administrations or their DCIs 
define "sensitive" in a different fashion. 
Though the executive branch is not, and never has been, any 
paragon of perfection with respect to discretion, it is worth 
noting that concerns about Congressional security are not only as 
old as Our republic but, in fact, antedate our constitution. 
Speaking of France's willingneps to provide essential covert 
assistance to the revolutionary cause, Benjamin Franklin and 
Robert Morris -- in their capacity as Members of the Committee of 
Secret Correspondence of the Continental Congress, America's 
first intelligence organization -- noted, on 1 October 1776: . 
"We agree in opinion that it is our indespensable duty to 
keep [this important intelligence] a secret, even from 
Congress ... He find, by fatal experience, the Congress 
consists of too many members to keep secrets." 
As the Iran-Contra Affairs Minority Report mentions, on page 
469, when Joel Poinsett (for whom the flower is named) was , 
25

conducting covert action missions in South America for then-
President James Madison -- our Constitution's principal architect 
Poinsett was under instructions to communicate in code, and 
all his important communications were witheld from Congress. 
Much more recent events unfortunately demonstrate a 
continuing justification for the kind of concerns that troubled 
Franklin and Madison.. In March 1987, the former Chairman of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- who had relinquished 
his chairmanship only two months earlier -- spoke to a group of 
potential ;supporters Convened, in Florida, by the America Israel 
Public Affairs Committee. In the wake and in the context of the 
Pollard affair, the former Chairman alleged to that audience that. 
the Pollard case had been preceded, in 1982, by a similar U.S. 
intelligence operation targeted against Israel -- an allegation. 
that both the U.S. and the Israeli governments immediately and 
emphatically denied. If there was any such operation, the former 
Chairman committed a serious security breach. If no such 
operation existed, his indiscretion was still grossly 
irresponsible particularly since many 7- in Israel, America, and 
elsewhere -- would presume that the former Chairman's comments, 
on such subjects, must be authoritative. 
In the intelligence field -- to American professionals and, 
even more, to foreign individuals and services co-operating with, 
U.S. intelligence -- these public remarks of the former Chairman

274 
of the Senate's intelligence oversight committee sent a shock 
wave around the world. They doubtless caused acute private 
distress to many of the former Chairman's Congressional 
colleagues, and to many Hill staffers; but the former Chairman is 
not likely to be called to account for his actions by anyone 
save, perhaps, the voters of Minnesota -- something else the 
intelligence world has not failed to notice. 
PORTING REOUIREMENTS AND.FLEXIBILITy 
H.R. 3822 would repeal Sec. 662 of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 -- the so-called "Hughes-Ryan Amendment" -- and 
strike the National Security-Act of 1947's current Sec. 501. 
H.R. 3822 would replace the latter with a new 501 ("General 
Provisions"), a new 502 ("Reporting Intelligence Activities Other 
than Special Activities"), and a new 503 ("Presidential Approval 
and Reporting of Special Activities"). The 1947 Act's current 
Sec. 502 would be re-designated Sec. 504, and amended to include 
the essence of "Hughes-Ryan" -- whose original (1974) language on 
reporting covert action operations "in a timely fashion" was 
shifted in 1980 to current Sec. 501(b) and Would now be 
eliminated. Current Sec. 503 would be slightly amended and re-
designated Sec. 505. The companion Senate bill, S.1721 would 
effect the same section shifts in the National Security Act of 
1947 with, in certain places, a few differences in proposed 
alternate language. Some of these differences are significant, 
but I will not take the time to address them here.

275 
For reasons previously discussed, I believe the consequences 
of striking the current Sec. 501(a) 'a lead or "preambular" clause 
altogether, and not replacing it, would be unfortunate. Also,. 
H.R. 3822's alternate language -- in its proposed new Sections 
501, 502 and 503 -- makes changes in current Sec. 501's tone and 
content that I respectfully urge this sub-committee to consider , 
carefully before endorsing them for enactment intolaw. 
Current Sec. 501 places on "the Director of Central 
Intelligence and the heads of all departments, agencies, and 
other entities of the United States involved in intelligence 
activities" the responsibility for keeping the intelligence 
oversight committees in both Houses of Congress "fully and 
currently informed" of all U.S. intelligence activities 
"including any significant anticipated intelligence activity" --
among other things, a euphemism for "special activity" or covert 
action. As spelled out in current Sec. 501(0's sub-paragraphs 
(2) and (3), this includes the responsibility for furnishing - 
information requested by either intelligence committee and for 
reporting "in a timely fashion", to these committees, any 
"illegal intelligence activity or significant intelligence 
failure" -- plus "any corrective action" taken. 
Prompted, I suspect, by quite understandable, legitimate 
Iran-Contra-fueled irritation at President Reagan, H.R. 3822's 
28

276 
proposed new language would divide this reporting responsibility 
and fix part of it on the President, by requiring him -- in new 
Sec. 501 -- to "ensure" that this reporting is done. In H.R. 
3822's text, however, this change is effected in language that in 
places is redundant, and hence confusing. New Sec. 501(a) 
assigns "ensuring" responsibility to the President; but new Sec. 
502(a) and'new Sec. 503(b) --the former with respect to 
"intelligence activities other-than special activities", the 
letter with.specific reference to "special activities" -- both 
pick up and repeat, with only minor changes, the language of old 
Sec. 501(a)4 which.essigne.the reporting responsibility to the 
DCI and other intelligence community-component heads. 
Since the actual reporting requirement and responsibility is 
clearly fixed in law, -as--it-has been since 1980, there seems 
little reason-to burden the President, formally, with "ensuring" 
that his intelligence community subordinates discharge their 
statutory responsibilities, in this regard. This is doubly so if 
one acknowledges any force or merit in the argument that a 
President's -- i.e. Chief of State's -- public connection with 
? covert action should be minimized, not enhanced. In any event, 
the redundancy of H.R. 3822's language on this point produces a 
measure of inelegant confusion that strongly suggests hasty 
drafting. For obvious reasons, intelligence oversight 
legislation should not be prompted by pique, or punitive intent. 
Nor should it be drafied in haste, or with anything but 
29

consummate, considered care and ,dispassionate craftmanship. 
Present Sec. 501's language has a measure of flexibility and 
creative ambiguity that may offend the tidy-minded, legalistic 
purist, but is enormously useful in any statute dealing with a 
subject as complex and important as intelligence, especially 
covert action, conducted by an open, democratic society. 
Unquestionably, the administration abused this flexibility 
throughout the Iran-Contra imbroalio. In current Sec. 501, for 
example, the denotation of "timely" may be a bit imprecise, by 
design, but it is clearly not intended to denote an interval 
measured in months. One can readily understand why some in 
Congress, both members and staff -- prompted by Iran-Contra 
irritation -- would want to curtail this flexible ambiguity. In 
any delicate sphere, however, people impelled by understandable 
emotions and admirable motives should be very careful of over-' 
reaction. . 
Current Sec. 501 requires the DCI and his intelligence 
community colleagues to keep the Congressional intelligence 
committees "fully and currently informed" of all manner of 
intelligence activities and information, especially "significant 
anticipated activities," but it is fairly,delphic about whether 
this need be done before or after the fact. In addition, current 
Sec. 501 gives the President considerable discretionary latitude 
with respect to "prior notice" -- latitude that was also clearly 
30

278 
abused during Iran-Contra. In erecting unambiguous barriers 
against any recurrence of that particular abuse, however, H.R. 
3822's proposed alternative for current Sec. 501 sets the stage 
perhaps inadvertently -- for other, future problems of equal if 
not greater magnitude. 
THE MATTER OF "FINDINGS" -- PERTINENT 
CONSIDERATIONS. INCLUDING SECURITY AND  
GERMANE FOREIGN ATTITUDES  
Presidents since Washington, certainly since Jefferson, have 
conducted covert actions or "special activities," or directed 
that they be conducted, whenever they felt the interests of the 
United States would be served by, or required, such activities --
without feeling any particular need for Congressional involvement 
or, often, knowledge, let alone Congressional direction or 
legislatively-conferred authority. H.R. 3822's proposed Sec. 
503(a), would seem to break new Constitutional ground by 
stipulating, in a statute, that a President 
"may authorize the conduct of a special activity by 
departments, agencies, or entities of the United States 
Government only when he determines such an activity is 
necessary to support the foreign policy objectives of 
the United States and is important to the national 
security of the United States" 
Proposed Sec. 503(a) then goes on to add "which determination 
shall be set forth in a finding that shall meet each of the 
'following conditions," of which there are five. 
The National Security Act of 1947's current Sec. 501(a) 
requires the Director of Central Intelligence (et al.) to keep 
31 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

279 
the intelligence committees "fully and currently informed of all 
intelligence activities .... including any significant 
anticipated special activity" -- i.e. covert action -- but does 
not stipulate how this is to be done. Current sec."501(a)(1)(8) 
adds that:, 
"if the President determines it is essential to limit 
prior notice to meet extraordinary circumstances 
affecting vital interests of the United States, such 
notice shall be limited to the chairmen and ranking 
minority members of the intelligence committees, the 
Speaker and minority leader of the House of 
Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders 
of the Senate:" (the so-called Gang of Eight) 
How this notice is to be given, however,-ie not specified. 
Current Sec. 501(b) says: 
"The President shall fully inform the intelligence? 
committees in a timely fashion of intelligence 
operations in foreign countries, other than activities 
intended solely for obtaining necessary intelligence, 
for which prior notice was not given under subsection 
(a) of this section and shall provide a statement of 
the reasons for not giving prior notice." 
But once again, current Sec. 501 does not prescribe any 
particular form or manner for doing this, though the phrase 
"provide a statement" certainly suggests something in writing. 
Section 662 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the 
"Hughes-Ryan Amendment" -- which H.R. 3822 would repeal, then 
incorporate in that bill with slightly modified language --
stipulates that: 
"No funds appropriated under the authority of this or 
any other Act may be expended by or on behalf of the 
Central Intelligence Agency for operations in foreign 
countries, other than activities intended solely for 
obtaining necessary intelligence, unless and until the 
President finds that each such operations is important to 
32

280 
the natibnal security of the United States."' 
Hughes-Ryan, however, does not specifically say that the 
President's finding, itself, must be given to Congress, nor does 
it specify how the "description and scope" of each such operation 
is to be reported.2 
H.R. 3822 would change all that. The first of its proposed 
Section 503(a)'s five conditions is that: 
"(1) Each finding shall be in writing, unless immediate 
action by the United States is required and time does 
not permit the preparation of a written finding, in 
1 As mentioned above, "Hughes-Ryan" orginally continued "and 
reports, in timely fashion, a description, and scope of each 
operation to the appropriate committees of Congress"; but this 
thought, and most of this language, was shifted in 1980 to the 
National Security Act of 1947's current subsection 501(b). The 
1980 change also pared the number of committees to whom these 
reports must be made from "Hughes-Ryan's" eight to the two 
intelligence committees specified in current Sec. 501(b). 
2 Hughes-Ryan was originally added to' the 1961 Foreign 
Assistance Act, as Section 662, in 1974. Section 654 of that 
Act, added in 1971 -- "Presidential Findings and Determinations" 
does say that: 
"In any case in which the President is required to make 
a report to the Congress, or to any committee or 
officer of either House of Congress, concerning any 
finding or determination under any provision of this 
Act, the Foreign Military Sales Act, or the Foreign 
Assistance and Related Programs Appropriation Act for 
each fiscal year, that finding or determination Shall 
be reduced to writing and signed by the President." 
Section 654, however, deals primarily with unclassified 
"findings and determinations", to be published in the Federal 
Register. It was part of a package of provisions directed at 
controlling re-programming (prompted by irritation at the way aid 
to Cambodia had been handled). Prior to Iran-Contra, no one ever 
thought of applyinTMection 654 to Section 662 intelligence 
findings, or to the informing and reporting required by the 
National Security Act of 1947's current section 501. -

281 
which case a written record of the President's decision 
shall be contemporaneously made and shall be reduced to 
a written finding as soon as possible but in no event 
more than forty-eight hours after the decision is 
made." 
I will pass over the fact that a written, permanent record 
account Of a decision that may have been taken in a complex, 
fluid situation and that affects a range of significant U.S. 
interests is not a document that should be slapped together in 
haste. Care and thought should go into any such permanent 
document's drafting, a degree of internal coordination within the 
executive branch may be required, and properly preparing such a 
document for he President's approval and signature within 48 
hours or, indeed, within two working days -- even if the 
President and the congress arein Washington 7- may simply not be 
possible. I would like the sub-committee to focus, instead, on 
considerations more important than operational details. 
While an internal, written record of such decisions --
shoeing precisely who was .directed or authorized to do what, and 
why 7 should be made and kept, at least within the executive 
branch, whether the official accounts of such decisions, i.e. 
"findings", should be personally signed by the President of the 
United States is far more debatable than some who participated in 
the drafting of H.R. 3822 might be willing to acknowledge. 
Particularly in the wake of Iran-Contra, the desire of many 
members of Congress, including members of this Committee, to hold

282 
a President personally Accountable for all covert action 
operations which that PreSident directs or authorizes is 
eminently understandable; but germane here are two considerations 
previously mentioned -- one, of extraordinary delicacy. 
First, under our Constitution and governmental system, our 
President is not only the chief executive, a political figure 
chosen in an inevitably partisan, contested election. Our 
President is also our nation's ceremonial, symbolic Chief of 
State -- all of whose actions, particularly with respect to 
foreign affairs, are hence our nation's, in a very important 
symbolic sense. In Most parliamentary governments, partly for 
this very reason, chiefs of state -- -whether put in office by 
heredity or some other form of selection -- are supposedly 
apolitical, "above politics". Chiefs of state can disavow or 
even, at least technically, depose prime minieters and confer 
their office on others, but not vice versa. In our system, 
conversely, a single individual, during that individual's 
presidential term, simultaneously plays both roles., 
Secondly, covert action is a very delicate tool of 
statecraft,-though one that all other nations employ -- many of 
them, against us -- and we hence should feel no compunction about 
using it, judiciously and deftly, to protect or further our own 
national interests. Covert action's delicacy derives in no small 
measure from the awkward but inescapable fact that its employment 
almost invariably involves infringing upon, or directly

283 
violating, the laws of some other nation or nations, usually 
those of the nation at which a specific covert action operation 
is targeted. 
A covert action "finding", as that term is employed in,H.R. 
3822, thus easily can be a document authorizing or directing some 
component of the U.S. intelligence community to ignore the laws 
of a nation with which we are not in a state of war and with 
which, indeed, we may have treaty relations whose spirit, at 
least, the "special activity" in question unarguably violates. 
In my opinion, it is highly debatable whether it is in our 
national interest for any such document to be personally signed 
11 by our symbolic, ceremonial Chief. of State -- the President of 
the United States --'thus.laying an undeniable paper trail that 
runs directly into the Oval Office. Though all other nations,. 
including our closest allies, frequently engage in covert action, 
few -- if any -- are imprudent enough to make covert action 
authorizations or directives a matter of written record, and none 
would ever consider having any such authorization or directive 
carry the personal signature of its ceremonial chief of state. 
In any event, such a document -- particularly one signed by 
the President -- is clearly a document of the highest delicacy 
and sensitivity. Particularly in this age of Xerox machines, 
having more than one record copy of such a document -- let alone. 
circulating plural copies, to anyone -- is an enormous security

risk. R.R. 3822, however, would require not only that such a 
document be Prepared, in writing, for every special activity, and 
personally signed by the President, it would also require -- in 
its proposed Section 503(c), which I will address in a moment --
that in every instance,, two copies of each "finding", signed by 
the President, be provided to Congress, one to the Chairman of 
each intelligence oversight committee. 
I am not for a moment defending all that was done, or not 
done, during the course of Iran-Contra -- when the spirit of 
current Section 501 was clearly ignored by the administration, 
and its letter arguably violated. Furthermore, I am not denying 
that in the complex, highly delicate sphere of covert action, 
close -7 though diecreet -- cooperation between Any 
administration and at least the leadership in Congress is 
essential if our national interests are to be well served. 
Nonetheless, I do Most respectfully urge this Committee to weigh 
and ponder the considerations I have just discussed before moving 
forward with proposed,sub -section 503(a)(1) of H.R. 3822, as that 
?..!,,proposed sub-section is currently phrased. 
-The fifth condition which H.R. 3822 stipulates that every 
finding "shall meet" (Sub-section 503(a)(5)) is: 
"A finding may not authorize any action that would violate 
any statute of the United States." 
This relates to the extraordinarily delicate considerations just 
discussed in connection with the first condition (503(a)(1)). A 
treaty is not a statute, but H.R. 3822 is here skating where the 
37 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
285 
legal ice gets very thin; for some findings are going to direct, 
.or authorize actions that certainly impinge on treaty 
relationships. Whether all this should be spelled out in open 
legislation is, to my mind, a very debatable question. 
H.R. 3822's second condition (Sec. 503(a)(2)) is: 
"A finding may not authorize or sanction special activities, 
or any aspect of such activities, which have already 
occurred." 
This has an obvious Iran-Contra impetus, and Congressional 
distaste for retroactive findings is quite understandable. This 
condition's phrasing, implications and consequences, however, 
merit further consideration; for as it stands, this condition 
could easily be construed as a Ring Canute-like directive. 
Actions that have already taken place can not be undone, any more 
than waves can be rolled back, by decree. Also, this condition, 
proposed Sec. 503(a)(2), is not entirely consistent with the 
immediately preceding one, proposed Sec. 503(a)(1), which 
. . ? 
explicitly addresses situations in-which "immediate action by the 
Utited States is required and time does not permit the 
preparation ofa written finding". A later finding, even one 
only 48 hours later, is still retroactive. 
This particular-inconsistency is not serious, but it is yet 
another indication of hasty drafting -= something that should not 
mark intelligence oversight legislation, especially such 
legislation dealing with the complex, complicated subject of 
covert action. All in all, proposed Sec. 503(a)(2) might perhaps

286 
best be dropped. 
The third of H.R. 3822's five necessary conditions for a 
valid finding (Sec. 503(a)(3)) is: 
"Each finding shall specify each and every department, 
agency, or entity of the United States Government 
authorised to fund or otherwise participate in any 
significant way in such activities: provided, That any 
employee, contractor, or contract agent of a 
department, agency, or entity of the United States 
Government other than the Central Intelligence Agency 
directed to participate in any way in a special 
activity shall be subject either to the policies and 
regulations of the Central Intelligence Agency, or to 
written policies or regulations adopted by such 
department, agency or entity, in consultation with the 
Director of Central Intelligence, to govern such 
participation:" (emphasis in original) 
This is obviously another Iran-Contra inspired ratchet-tightener, 
intended to prevent covert action free-wheeling by U.S. 
Government groups or entities, such as Lt. Colonel North's NSC 
staff office, which are not under the CIA's direction, or under 
guidance in which the DCI has formally concurred, and thus 
potentially outside the oversight jurisdiction of the 
Congressional intelligence committees. 
The fourth of H.R. 3822's five conditions for a valid 
finding (Sed. 503(a)(4)) is that: 
"Each finding Shall specify whether it is contemplated 
that any third party which is not an element of, or a 
contractor or contract agent of, the United States 
Government, or is not otherwise subject to United ' 
States Government policies and regulations, will be 
used to fund or otherwise participate in any 
significant way in the special activity concerned, or 
be used to undertake the special activity concerned on 
behalf of the United States:" 
This also has a clear, eminently understandable Iran-Contra 
39

287 
inspiration; but no matter how reasonable and defensible this 
condition's intent may be, its language contains the potential 
for more problems, of greater severity, than those engendered by 
all of the other conditions combined. As it stands, this fourth 
condition's language can be construed as being either trivial Or 
extraordinarily dangerous, on security grounds, or both. 
Virtually no foreign intelligence operation, certainly no 
covert action operation or "special activity", can be 
successfully conducted without the cooperation, and utilization, ? 
of foreigners -- including individuals, entities or 
organizations, such as Intelligence services, governments, or 
some combination of any or all of these. No sensible U.S. 
intelligence officer or service, could plan a "special activity" 
without, at a minimum, "contemplating" that one or more foreign 
individuals, organizations, services or governments might be used 
"to fund or otherwise participate", in some-significant way, "in 
the special activity concerned on behalf of the United States". 
Foreign individuals or organizations who cooperate with a 
U.S. intelligence service might be styled "agents" of the United 
States or even, if there is some compensation agreement for 
providing that cooperation, as "contract agents". Also, by 
.forcing language .a bit, it might be argued that such "contract 
agents" are, to some extent - under their "contracts" --
"subject to United States Government policies and regulations." 
But theseare exercises in irrelevant casuistry. Few if any of 
40

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
288 
the foreign individuals or entities -- "third parties" -- bound 
to be participating in some "significant way" in any given 
"special activity" could be meaningfully or accurately described 
as "an element of, or a contractor or contract agent of, the 
United States Government... subject to United States Government 
policies". 
If sub-section (4) is construed as requiring only a general 
statement, then it is Virtually meaningless; for if it is so 
construed, it can be satisfied by a standard, boiler plate 
sentence mechanically .incorporated in every finding and Saying 
something along the lines of\"The special activity herein 
described of course contemplates the use and participation of one 
oi more non-U.S. individuals, persons, organizations or 
entities." If sub-section (4) is supposed to mean more than 
that, however, 'particularly if it is intended to require giving 
some specific indication of What types of non U.S. government 
"third parties" will be participating, and in what ways, in the 
"special activity" covered by a particular finding, then that 
condition lays down a security minefield impossible to traverse 
unscathed. 
The language of the final sentence of H.R. 3822's proposed 
sub-section 503(e) could easily be read as supporting a broad 
construction of this fourth condition of sub-section 503(a). 
That sentence says (in language evoking Gertrude Stein): 
"A request by any agency or department of the United 
States to a foreign country or a private citizen to 
41 
r ?

conduct a special activity on behalf of the United 
? States shall be deemed to be a special activity." 
/f H.R. 3822 is enacted, as currently drafted, this sentence 
could certainly be construed as meaning that the executive branch 
is required to write and submit a separate finding on each and 
every, request to a. foreign government, and each and every 
recruitment pitch to a foreign national, for assistance in a U.S. 
covert action oieration.3 
Should proposed'Sec.. 503(a)(4) ever be given this type of 
broad construction, now or in the future, satisfying its 
requirements would inevitably involve security risks so grave 
that no prudent U.S. President, administration, or Director of 
Central Intelligence -- not to mention foreign individual, entity 
or government -- would want 'to run them. 
Consider, for a moment, the position in which a broadly-
construed Sec. 503(a)(4) would place any Director of Central 
Intelligence. ThaNational Security Act of 1947's Sec. 
102,(d)(3), as mentioned earlier, makes the DCI "responsible for 
protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized 
3 A broad construction of proposed sub-section 503(a)(4) of 
the National Security Act of 1947 goes directly against the grain 
of the clause in section 6 of the CIA Act of 1949 which reads: 
the Agency [i.e., CIA] shall be exempted from ... the 
provisions of any other law which require the publication gr 
, disclosure gf the organization, functions, games, official 
titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the 
Agency. (emphasis added) 
This, however, is a complication that may have escaped the 
drafters of proposed 503(a)(4). 
42 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

290 
disclosure". 1.11t. 3822's proposed Section 501(e), rePeating the 
language of current 501(e), stipulates that: 
"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority to 
withhold information from the intelligence committees 
on the grounds that providing the information to the 
intelligence committees would constitute the 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information or 
information relating to intelligence sources and 
,methods." 
In addition to engendering difficulties already discussed, 
however, this sentence does not solve the problem a broadly 
construed 503(a)(4), as proposed, would create;, because subtle 
but very important semantic distinctions here come into play. . 
The National Security Act's Sec. 102(d)(3) makes the DCI 
"responsiblq for protecting intelligence sources and methods from 
unauthorized disclosure" (emphasis added). Note that Sec. 
102(d)(3), furthermore, is quite specific. It makes the DCI 
responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods 
themselves -- not just "information relating to intelligence 
sources and methods" -- from unauthorized disclosure. 
Section 501(e), both current and proposed, does not absolve 
a DCI of this responsibility. It only denies a DCI the authority 
to withhold information "on the grounds that providing the 
information to the intelligence committees would" -- i.e., of 
itself -- "constitute the unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information or information relating tp intelligence sources and 
methods." (Again, emphasis added.)

291 
If broadly construed, proposed Sec. 503(a)(4) would require 
a DCI, in the case of each "special activity", to approve or, at 
a minimum, concur in a written "finding", to be signed by the 
President, specifying the fact and nature of all non-U.S. 
participation in that "special activity", with a minimum of two 
copies of that document being sent to Congress for permanent 
retention on Capitol Hill. Such a written reporting requirement 
could easily put a conscientious DCI in an impossible position. 
In a given case or in connection with any particular covert 
action operation, a DCI might feel that the very existence of the 
document required under a broad construction of Sec. 503(a)(4) 
would put specific, sensitive intelligence sources and methods at 
unacceptable risk. In such an instance, the DCI would have no 
authority to block the preparation or transmission of that 
particular document, even if that DCI felt his or her 
responsibility for protecting the intelligence sources or methods 
in question made it mandatory for that DCI to do so. 
In this whole context, I respectfully urge this Committee to 
consider over two centuries of relevant American reflection, 
experience and precedents. 
As John Jay observed in the previously quoted passage in 
Federalist 64: 
"There are cases where the most useful_ intelligence 
may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be 
. relieved from apprehensions of discovery. Those 
apprehensions Will operate on those persons whether 
they are actuated by-mercenaryor.friendly motives.; and ,. 
there doubtless are many of both descriptions who would

292 
rely on the secrecy of the President, but Who would not 
confide in that of the Senate, and still less in that 
of a large popular assembly." 
Just over a half century later, President James Polk, in 
refusing to disclose confidential intelligence expenditures to 
Congress, forcefully argued in a letter to the House of 
Representatives: 
"In no nation is the application of such sums ever made 
public. In time of war or impending danger the - 
situation of the country may make it necessary to 
employ individuals for the purpose of obtaining 
information or rendering other important services who 
could never be prevailed upon to act if they 
entertained the least apprehension that their names or 
their agency would in any contingency be divulged." 
Only a year ago, on 8'April 1987, in testifying before this 
very committee, Representative Norman Y. Mineta -- a staunch 
proponent of strict Congressional intelligence oversight --
confirmed and acknowledged that the Canadian government did not 
want its 1980 role in hiding, protecting and safely exfiltrating 
American hostages from Iran to be reported to Congress by 
President Carter in a finding -- at least while that operation 
was in train. 
In this whole matter, furthermore, H.R. 3822 attempts to 
draw a distinction which may sound very simple, neat and tidy in 
a proposed statute; but which in the real world is Very difficult 
to draw, and often does not exist. In the actual conduct of 
intelligence activities abroad, the cooperating institutional and 
individual assets ("agents", if you will) used in "special 
activities" and those used in normal, albeit sensitive, 
45 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
293 
intelligence collection activities are often the same -- the same 
institutions, the same organizations, and the same people. Given 
the real world's exigencies and complexities, consequently, there 
is often no way you can meaningfully distinguish -- for purposes 
of reporting to Congress -- betweeen foreign institutions and 
individuals who assist in the conduct of "special activities" and 
those who assist in the conduct of intelligence activities in 
general. 
I know from my own experience as Chairman of the U.S. 
Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee in Germany, from 1976-1979, 
how skittish my-WestGerman, Israeli, and other friendly foreign 
service counterparts were about sharing sensitive information, 
especially operational information, on common concerns and 
targets -- such as terrorism -- because of their worries about 
how such information, after I reported it, would be handled back 
in Washington, particularly if it was passed to Congress. The 
--strong, almost universal perception of my foreign counterparts 
was that in the United States, we were manifestly incapable of 
protecting even our own secrets, hence we could hardly be relied 
on to protect theirs. We may consider such foreign perceptions 
unwarranted and inaccurate, but their widespread existence and 
their force are facts that American intelligence professionals 
can not ignore or brush aside when planning operations -- of any 
nature -- in which cooperativcvforeign participation is 
essential. 
46

294 
Such foreign perceptions and concerns would be inflamed and 
exponentially increased if H.R. 3822's proposed sub-section 
503(a)(4) should ever be enacted into law, and then broadly 
construed. Should it ever come to be widely believed abroad that 
U.S. law required -- or even that there was a serious risk that 
U.S. law might require -- the identification in a written 
document, of which at least two copies would be sent to Congress, 
of all non-U.S. individuals and entities, including governments, 
cooperatively participating in any U.S. "special activity", our 
pool of essential foreign assistance and support would swiftly 
evaporate. The extent and speed of that pool's evaporation, 
furthermore, would be increased by the fact that few foreigners 
would note, and even fewer would pay attention to, any American 
legal distractions between "special activities" and other 
intelligence activities. In this sphere, foreign perceptions and 
beliefs -- not our assessment of their accuracy or validity --
would be controlling. 
From the perspective of 26 years' experience in the 
profession of intelligence, / can state flatly that should H.R. 
382241 proposed sub-section 503(a)(4), or anything like it, ever 
be enacted into law, few foreign individuals or entities, 
governments again included, whose cooperation and assistance we 
wduld need to conduct "special activities" -- or, for that 
matter, any intelligence activities of any consequence -- would 
be willing to put their fortunes, reputations or, in the case of 
individuals, their freedom and even their lives hostage to the

discretion,or,secret-keeping capability of the Congress of the 
United States. 
NOTIFICATION TIMING PERTINENT I-S AND PROBLEMS ? 
In H.R. 3822, "findings" are the official mechanisms by 
which Congress, through .its intelligence oversight committees, is 
apprised of "special activities" -- i.e., covert action 
operations -- conducted by the executive branch, the intelligence' 
community generally and, specifically, the CIA. Let us now put 
aside the mechanics of notification and turn back .to the matter 
of precisely who in Congress must be notified, and when: At what 
point in a covert action operation's planning, development or 
execution must that operation's existence, Mature and scope be 
reported, must a "finding" about it be submitted, and to whom? 
As mentioned earlier, these are .matters about which there is 
a measure of flexibility and creative ambiguity in current 
practice and legislation, including "Hughes-Ryan" and the 
National Security Act of 1947's current section 501. During 
Iran-Contra, the administration patently abused this flexibility 
and ambiguity, provoking amply justified ire in Congress 
generally and in the intelligence oversight committees, including 
-- specifically -- this sub-committee's parent committee. To 
prevent these particular abuses from recurring, H.R. 3822 would 
curtail that flexibility and clarify the relevant ambiguities; 
but as also mentioned earlier, H.R. 3822's proposed solutions to 
48 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
296 
what are perceived as current problems would create new ones of 
at least equal gravity. 
H.R. 3822 would repeal "Hughes-Ryan" and strike current 501, 
thus eliminating the "in a timely fashion" flexibility, of which 
the administration took such politically inept advantage during 
Iran-Contra. That done, H.R. 3822's proposed language would nail 
shut all such "loopholes" and move briskly, purposefully and - 
rigidly in the direction of "prior notification." 
H.R. 3822's proposed subsection 503(c)(1) begins: 
"The President shall ensure that any finding approved 
pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reported to the j 
intelligence Committees as soon as possible after such 
approval and prior to the initiation of the special 
sctivitv authorized by the finding." (Emphasis added.) 
This is somewhat attenuated, in the next sentence, by the . 
proviso: 
"That if the President determines it is essential to 
limit access to the finding to meet extraordinary ' 
circumstances affecting vital interests of the United 
States such finding may be reported to the Chairmen 
and ranking minority members of the intelligence , 
committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the 
House of Representatives, and the majorityand minority 
leaders of the Senate." (The so-called Gang of Eight.). 
This proviso is inimediately followed, however, by a sentence 
Stipulating: 
"In either case, a copy of the finding, signed by the 
President, shall be provided to the chairman of mgh 
intelligence committee." (Emphasis added.) 
Thus are mandated the two Capitol Hill copies! of each finding, 
referred to and discussed above. 503(c)(1) then concludes: 
"Where access to a finding is limited to the Members of , 
Congress identified above, a statement of the reasons 
for limiting such access shall also be prdVided."

Section 503 continues: 
(c)(2) "In circumstanCes where time is of the essence 
and the President deteraines.that it is important to 
the national security interests of the United States to 
initiate a special activity before the notice required 
by paragraph (1) can be given, such activity may be 
initiated without such notice. 
(c)(3) "The President shall ensure that notice of a

Members of Congress identified in paragraph (1), AA

(emphasis added)

committees, or, if applicable, the Members of Congress 
specified in subsection (c), are notified of any

findings are reported pursuant to subsection (c).

(f) "No special activity may be conducted if it is 
intended to influence United States political 
processes, public opinion, policies, or media." 
All of these stipulations merit some comment, starting with the 
last one. On quick reading, proposed Sec. 503(f) might seem only 
to repeat, in almost identical language, a thought inherent 
sub-section 3.4(h) of Executive Order 12333: 
"but which are not intended to influence United States 
in 
and 
'do not include diplomatic activities or the collection and 
production of intelligence or related support functions." 
(emphasis added) 
Actually, however, an easily overlooked shift in mood -- from 
declarative to imperative -- produces a potentially very 
significant shift in meaning between H.R. 3822's proposed 503(f) 
and E.O. 12333's 3.4(h). 
Executive Order 12333's Section 3.4 is titled "Definitions", 
its sub-section 3.4(h) is a definition of "special activities", 
and the words following "but which are not intended to" are 
simply part of that definition. 
H.R. 3822's proposed Sec. 503(f), conversely, is a 
prohibition -- not. part of a definition. It says, as quoted 
above, 
"Nc special activity max bg conducted if it la intended to 
influence United States political processes, public opinion, 
policies or media." (emphasis added) 
This mood shift makes the intent of the special activity in 
question a threshold test of permissibility in H.R. 3822's

proposed Sec. 5.03(f), not simply one defining characteristic of 
"special activities" as is the case in.sub-section 3.4(h), of E.O. 
12333. , 
A properly conceived, soundly managed and effectively run 
covert action operation or "special activity" -- by definition --
will attempt to influence the course or evolution of events, in 
some important foreign region, in a manner beneficial to U.S. 
interests. If that operation is successful, its results are 
bound to be widely reported in the media -- even if the U.S. hand 
or the full extent of U.S. involvement in helping bring about 
those results can be concealed. If such concealment proves 
impossible -- as, in time, will usually prove to be the case 
the fact of U.S. involvement will become a major part of the 
story or, indeed, the major story itself. If a covert action 
operation is successful, furthermore, its success is bound to be 
politically advantageous to the U.S. administration then in 
office -- and even more so if that administration's role in that 
success becomes a matter of public knowledge (something any such 
administration, of any party, would be strongly tempted to 
ensure). If the operation in question is a failure, conversely, 
or publicity about the U.S. hand in it becomes an embarrassment, 
this is bound to have at least some adverse impact on the 
political fortunes of the administration which planned and 
launched that operation.

Whether a success or i failure, in sum, a covert action 
operation or "special activity" of any consequence even if it 
was planned,. approved and run with only foreign objectives in 
mind -- is bound to have some degree of effect or influence on 
"United States political processes, public opinion, policies, ? or 
media". This being the case, in real world life, proposed sub-
section 503(f) -- as presently drafted, (without any legal 
penalties for its violation) -- would be very hard to construe 
and apply (or enforce) in concrete situations, and could be 
employed by opponents of covert action in an effort to block 
"special activities" altogether. This was doubtless not the 
drafters' purpose. Indeed, their objective semi reasccably 
clear; but when this passage is couched in the imperative mood, 
as a prohibition, the verb "intend" has to carry more weight than 
it may prove capable of bearing. 
Where definitions are concerned, there is also a serious 
problem in proposed Sec. 503(e) -- one addressed and discussed in 
some detail by DCI William Webster in his testimony before this 
sub-committee, and its parent full Committee, on 24 February 
(1988). Proposed Sec. 503(e) 'defines "special activity" in one 
way with respect to Central Intelligence Agency "operations in 
foreign countries" and a different way with respect to the 
activities of "any other department or agency of the United 
States". This produces precisely the confusion and difficulties 
that the DCI forcefully and accurately described.

301' 
There is another semantic problem, also an important one, a 
bit earlier in proposed section 503. Proposed Sec. 503(c)(2) 
says that: 
"In circumstances where time is of the essence and the 
President determines that it is important to the 
national security interests of the United States to 
initiate a special activity before the notice required 
by paragraph (1) can be given, such activity may be 
initiated without such notice." 
Proposed Sec.,503(c)(3), however, says; 
"The President shall ensure that notice ,of a special 
activity undertaken pursuant to paragraph (2) is 
provided to the intelligence committees, or to the 
Members of Congress identified in paragraph (1), as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than forty 
eight hours after the special activity has been 
authorized pursuant to subsection (a) -"-
(emphasis added in both of the above quotations.) 
There is a latent contradiction between (2) and (3) which 
could become very important in certain situations. In the real 
world, there is frequently a delay of at least 48 hours, often 
longer, between the authorization -- in Washington 7- of a 
complex covert action operation or "special activity", and its 
initiation half a world away. In such a situation, the short-
term tactical flexibility given the President by proposed 
503(c)(2), "in circumstances .where time is of the, essence", is 
taken away by proposed 503(c)(3). 
This is by no, means a purely hypothetical problem. The 
previously mentioned 1980 exfiltration from Tehran of six 
American Embassy personnel, who hid for several weeks in the 
54

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Canadian Embassy there, provides a perfect illustration of a real 
world situation that would put a President directly in the cross-
fire between proposed 503(c)(2) and proposed 503(c)(3). 
Exfiltrating American citizens -- in this case, U.S. 
government employees who had escaped from a U.S. Embassy seized 
by hostile local elements who were holding, as prisoners, the 
other U.S.. personnel in that embassy -- might not be what the 
term "covert action" would normally suggest or denote to most 
people. Nonetheless, at least for the CIA, this would clearly be 
a "special activity" within the definition given in proposed 
503(e);.for such an operation would patently be something "other 
than" an activity "intended solely for Obtaining necessary 
intelligence". 
In the 1980 Tehran situation, however -- as mentioned 
earlier and as Representative Mineta explained to this very sub-
committee's-parent committee on 8 April 1987 -- the Canadians, 
for their own security and protection, made their essential 
cooperation contingent on Congress' n2t being told about what was 
in train, or what the Canadians were doing, until after the 
operation was concluded. In the 1980 Tehran situation, 
furthermore, the period between the "authorization" and the 
?initiation" of the "special activity" in question --
exfiltrating the endangered Americans Was measured in weeks, 
not hours.

Had H.R. 3822, as presently phratied, been on the statute 
books in 1980; President Carter -- not President Reagan -- would 
have been directly impaled on the horns of a very difficult 
dilemma. He would have had to either: 
(a) ignore the law, or 
(b) tell the Canadians that he could not lawfully meet 
the conditions they imposed on their essential 
assistance, even though declining that assistance 
clearly put American lives at risk. 
I can not believe that any member of this sub-committee, or 
of the full House oversight committee, would want to put any  
American President, of whatever party, in such a situation. This 
is far from the least of the reasons why I respectfully urge this 
sub-committee to reconsider the language of H.R. 3822, and all of 
that language's implications, before recommending that this 
proposed bill, as it now stands, be enacted into law. 
$0148 RAMIFICATIONS OF ',PRIOR NOTIFICATION,' 
In its conduct of Iran-Contra, as previously stressed, the 
Reagan administration clearly abused the discretionary latitude 
afforded any administration of any party, in conducting covert 
operations, by the flexibility and ambiguity of some of the 
language in current statutes dealing with these matters. As the 
legislative history of the pertinent statutes quite clearly 
demonstrates, however, much of this flexibility and ambiguity was 
56

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1

JO% 
deliberately inserted into the.statutes in question, .for 
excellent reasons. Particularly where matters as complex as 
covert action are involved, even the most astute, discerning 
legislators and staff drafters of legislation can not possibly 
foresee, or codify in advance, all the concrete contingencies and 
difficult real life dilemmas that are bound to arise. Sound 
legislation in such spheres, consequently, has to give both the 
executive and the legislative branches of our government some 
measure of wiggle-room. 
For reasons that are quite understandable but nonetheless, I 
respectfully submit, seem focussed on an event (Iran-Contra) 
unlikely to re-occur, H.R. 3822 would remove the ambiguity and 
virtually eradicate the flexibility of the relevant current 
statutes. Doing that, however, could easily prove procrustean 
and generate serious problems in future contingencies or 
situations not now forseen. 
By reducing -the permiseible,exceptions to a bare minimum, 
not always .inconsistent ways, H.R. 3822 would also push Congress 
far deeper into the "prior notification" thicket. In the light 
of Iran-Contra, this might seem desirable; but it is a punitive 
move that would probably be rued by future Congresses, as well as 
by future Presidents -- regardless of party.

For one thing, making "prior notification" the required norm 
for all but the most time-urgent "special activities", and then 
, 
adding an inflexible 48 hour notification strait jacket for them, 
would exponentially increase the difficulty of keeping covert 
actions covert. As the witting circle on Capitol Hill widens, 
with respect to staffers as well as actual members of Congress, 
there would be a concomitant increase in any given "special 
activity's" vulnerability to being torpedoed by a pre-emptive 
leak, even if a majority of both oversight committees endorsed 
the "special activity" in question. 
In the preceding sentence, the verb "endorse" was used 
advisedly, for here involved is an irony to which I respectfully 
direct this Committee's attention. The risk in question -- of a 
pre-emptive leak torpedo -- is increased, not diminished, by the 
last sentence proviso in H.R. -3822's proposed 501(a), which 
repeats, in slightly altered language, the thought of current 
501(a)(1)(A): 
"Provided, That nothing contained in this title shall 
be construed as requiring the approval of the 
intelligence committees as a condition precedent to the 
initiation of such activities." (emphasis in original) 
The clear intent of this q,  is Constitutionally 
admirable; but its practical effect, in the real world, is likely 
to be complex. 
Most "special activities" will be controversial. The more

OVO 
-important or significant those activities potentially are, and 
ditto the regions of the world on which they focus, the more 
controversial they are likely to be. In any given instance --
particularly with respect to an activity that, for any reason, is 
highly controversial no matter how many members, or staffers, 
of either or both intelligence Oversight committees may .think the 
operation in question is wise, even necessary, there are bound to 
be some members, and staffers, who have reservations about it or 
oppose it strongly. 
As we all know, in real world situations -- personal, 
professional and political 7- informed silence is frequently 
construed, by others, as tacit assent. If a given, controversial 
"special activity" goes sour or retrospectively becomes 
politically unpopular, the argument that "Yes, I knew about it 
and yes, I kept silent about it, but I really didn't approve of 
it -- honest)." is not likely to carry much weight in debates with 
opponents or (perhaps even less) with friends, in the voting 
booth, or in some cases, with the individual consciences of 
certain members or staffers of an oversight committee. 
Even if legally impeccable, the language of proposed Sec. 
30l(a)'s last sentence proviso is pragmatically ambiguous. It 
purports to buttress executive branch authority,-or at least to 
.refrain, explicitly, from derogating that authority; but what it 
actually -- or also -- tries to do is absolve Congress of

responsibility. 
As is unfortunately the case with all of us, however, 
members of Congress, and of Congressional. staffs, simply can not 
have it both ways. They can not insist on prior knowledge of, in 
this instance, special activities but disclaim responsibility for 
the consequences of activities, or of actions, that they knew 
about in advance and did not demonstrably try to prevent. 
Particularly in a charged, partisan atmosphere such as that now 
prevailing with respect to many important issues (e.g. Central 
American policy), this is a consideration that members of 
Congress Or staffers, strongly opposed to any given proposed 
"special activity", would be disinclined to brush aside. It 
would always provide a handy, conscience-salving rationale for 
breaking discipline, ignoring secrecy pledges and attempting to 
sandbag, by a leak, a contemplated, reported special activity 
that Congress or an intelligence oversight committee, 
institutionally, was not inclined or willing to oppose. 
By insisting on almost universal prior knowledge of 
projected "special activities", in short, Congress inevitably 
assumes responsibilities it may not. wish to assume.-- including a 
responsibility for increased security hazards. _While it may 
disclaim responsibility for the consequences of special 
activities it did not explicitly approve, furthermore, Congress 
can not altogether avoid or deny that responsibility and must

avid 
assume at least some of it if Congress is going to insist on 
being informed, in writing, of virtually all such activities in 
advance of their initiation. All of this, in turn takes Congress 
into constitutionally murky waters, getting it deeply involved in 
tasks it is not structured to perform and can ill-spare the time 
to undertake, particularly when Congress has demonstrable 
difficulty in discharging some of the responsibilities that the 
Constitution clearly does assign to it -- such as passing 
appropriations bills. 
Once again, as President Carter's, not President Reagan's, 
Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs, David Aaron, put 
the matter quite neatly when testifying before the House 
intelligence oversight committee in September 1983 in connection 
with "special activities" legislation: 
"It was the purpose of [current] Sec. 501 to ensure 
that the Congress had sufficient access to information-, 
in a timely way, to be able to exercise [its proper] 
functions in the field Of intelligence Activities. It 
was not [one of] the goals of Sec. 501 to make the 
Congress a co-decision-maker on covert action 
operations." 
THE DANGERS OF HASTY. EMOTION-INPELLED REPO.= 
Drafted in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Contra 
Report's preparation, H.R. 3822's language, at least to this 
reader's eye, reflects an eminently understandable desire to rap 
Ronald Reagan's knuckles and tie ,his hands. But Ronald Reagan 
leaves the Oval Office, permanently, in January 1989 less than

309 
a year hence -- and none of his successors, of whatever party, is 
likely to forget or ignore the lessons of Iran-Contra. 
Furthermore, if H.R. 3822 or any similar bill gets enacted, there 
is no way of telling what future President's hands that law may 
tie, under what particular circumstances, with what adverse 
impact on U.S. interests. 
Legislation affecting Congressional oversight of 
intelligence activities, particularly "special activities", is 
invariably complicated; for it inevitably involves the judicious 
weighing and balancing of a myriad important, complex and often 
conflicting considerations and equities. Such legislation should 
not be drafted or enacted in haste or under the influence of 
strong emotions, including pique. Nor is it wise to draft, 
debate and enact such legislation amid the distractions and 
pressures of an election year, including an election year's 
temptations to adopt or endorse_poSitions, on controversial 
issues, that are poll or popularity-enhancing in the short run, 
but not necessarily, in the long-term best interests of the United 
States. 
Such considerations apply with particular force to issues 
involving "reforms"; for reforms drafted and adopted under such 
conditions almost invariably prove to have unintended, undesired 
consequences. Also, they frequently get those who implement the 
reforms in question, or supervise their implementation, emeshed

in the micro-management of others' responsibilities -- such as 
the Presidency's. 
.During my own career in government, I was privileged to 
develop a close association with the Honorable Birch Bayh, the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's second Chairman. We 
differed on many issues, as we still do, but became and .remain 
good friends. He visited me in Germany, as a guest in my home 
where he was a great favorite with my children -= while I had 
overall responsibility for the U.S. intelligence community there 
and he was Chairman of the Senate oversight committee: On one 
evening during that visit, I assembled a representative,, cross-
sectioned group, of my abler young officers who were deeply and 
personally involved in our efforts to combat. terrorism and other. 
threats to the security of the United States. We sat up all ' 
night (literally) having a frank; suitably lubricated, no-holds-
barred, give-and-take discussion. ;During that discussion, my - '-
front-line colleagues endeavored to explain, by citing a 
succession of concrete-examples, how difficult it was to apply on 
the banks of the Rhine -- and of other rivers around the world 
the sweeping, "thou shalt not, aver, under any circumstances" 
reform restrictions of the'mid*1970, which sounded so splendid 
when proclaimed, passed, issued or endorsed along the banks of 
the Potomac.

As my young colleagues kept recounting their frustrating. 
first-hand experiences with the results or consequences of these 
"reforms", the good Senator kept repeating, like an antiphonal 
response in a' Nigh Church Anglican service, "But this was never 
the intent of Congress!" my equally antiphonal response was that 
in the field; we did not have the luxury of trying to divine 
Congressional intent. Instead, we had to be guided, and were 
circumscribed, by what the government's lawyers, including the 
CIA's, construed to be the meaning of the language in statutes 
Congress enacted, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act, or in Executive Orders and internal CIA regulations strongly 
influenced by Congressional attitudes. 
MRAT OUGHT TO BE BONE 
Despite their often vexing complexity, Mt. Chairman, and the 
inordinate difficulty of conducting them effectively, let alone 
securely, in an open, democratic society such as ours, I doubt if 
any member of this sub-committee, or its parent, would waht to 
take serious issue with the conclusion of the Congressional 
Committees investigating the Iran-Contra Affair that "Covert 
operations are a necessary component of our nation's foreign 
policy". 
In this regard, let me also redirect your attention to the 
lead paragraphs in the "Recommendations" chapter (28) of those 
64

Committees' Report: 
"It is the conclusion of these Committees that the 
Iran-Contra Affair resulted from the failure of 
individuals to observe the law, not from deficiencies 
in.existing law or in our system of governance. This 
is an important lesson to be learned from these 
investigations because it points to the fundamental 
soundness of our constitutional processes. 
Thus, the principal recommendations emerging from the 
investigation are not for new laws but for a renewal of 
the commitment to constitutional government and sound 
processes of decisionmaking." 
No sensible person would contend, and I certainly do not, 
that our current laws dealing with covert action, and its 
oversight, can not be improved. This sub-committee and its staff 
are to be commended on the thought, care and effort that have 
clearly gone into the consideration and discussions of H.R. 3822. 
For reasons I have tried to explain, however, I do not believe 
that the end results this distinguished sub-committee or its full 
parent Committee wants to achieve, in the discharge of its 
Constitutionally-mandated responsibilities, are most. likely to be 
attained by moving forward with H.R. 3822 or any similar 
legislation, unavoidably drafted in some haste in the wake of the 
issuance of the Iran-Contra Report and under the influence of 
emotions which that unhappy affair inevitably engendered on 
Capitol Hill -- particularly when any such legislation would have 
to bee-liebated and enacted amidst the mounting, divisive and 
partisan pressuresof an election year.

Most respectfully, I commend an alternative course of action 
to your consideration -- one suggested by the distinguished - 
Chairman of the Senate's oversight committee, even though he is a 
co-sponsor of H.R. 3822'e Senate counterpart, S. 1721. 
In the thoughtful, previously mentioned 1 December 1987 
Washinaton post essay, co-authored with Senator Danforth, Senator 
Boren addresses foreign policy, generally, but his andhis co-
author's comments and suggestions have an obvious, direct 
applicability to the specific matter of covert action as Well. 
To underscore this point "covert action" is substituted for the 
orginal's "foreign policy" in the lines from that essay quoted 
below. 
"What is needed is both a general statement of =art 
action principles in the manner of the Vandenberg 
Resolution and an ongoing process for Working out ? 
specific differences as they arise, but before they are 
ripe for legislative action:* 
"If the views we have expressed make sense, then the 
question remains: Where do we go from here?. The 
answer depends on what tesponae, if any, we evoke from 
the administration and members of Congress., We would 
hope for an informal meeting of no more than a'handful 
of administration representatives and interested 
members of Congress for the purposes of 1) drafting a 
statement of agreed covert actio n principles, and 2) 
exploring a system for resolving covert action 
disputes. If the call is for volunteers to convene 
such a meeting, then count us in."4 
4 "Foreign policy" is used in the original in the three 
places where "covert action" appears in these two quoted 
paragraphs.

With respect to covert action, as well as foreign policy in 
general, I hope the Meagan administration, in its final months, 
has the wit and vision to take up the distinguished Senators' 
admirable suggestion. If it does, I hope you and other members 
of this Committee will also be willing to be "counted in". 
-The nation's essential. covert action capabilities, along 
with their proper oversight, will stand a far better chance of, 
being lastingly improved-by some procedure such as these two 
Senators suggest-than.by any legislation quickly drafted in the 
Iran*Contra Report's immediate aftermath, then considered and 
debated amidstthe steadily mounting pressures and distractions 
of an election year. 
The nation's interests would be far better served if,. 
instead, a small group of knowledgeable, senior administration 
officials, past or present, could beconvened to meet quietly 
with a.corresponding, and correspondingly small, bi-partisan 
group of appropriate Congressional leaders, from both Houses; and 
,then, over the course of several months' frank, private 
discussion, this joint body, working together, could not only 
draft "a statement of agreed principals" regarding covert action 
and explore "a system for resolving disputes", but also supervise 
the measured, careful drafting of. any new legislation thought to 
be warranted --.for formal introduction, debate, consideration 
and enactment after the 1988 electoral season, with its attendant

STATEMENT OF DR. GREGORY TREVERTON, SENIOR FELLOW, 
COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS 
Dr. TREVERTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be 
here this afternoon. 
I, too, have submitted a statement. I will pick several points that 
have been touched on by the previous speakers. 
I believe that from time to time the United States should engage 
in covert activity. It can be important for our national security. 
At the same time, I respectfully disagree with the previous 
speakers in that I strongly support the principles contained in the 
reporting requirements of H.R. 3822. I do so not as to the constitu-
tional argument; that is not my terrain. Instead, let me speak to 
what seems to me to be the important practical implications of 
those reporting requirements. 
As I look over the history of American covert action in the post-
war period, it does seem to me important that the Congress be noti-
fied as a matter of law in a timely way, not as a matter of execu-
tive discretion. There are two reasons why that reporting is impor-
tant. 
One is, as elsewhere, getting Congress into the loop imposes?or 
at least pushes in the direction of imposing a clearer process on the 
executive branch. We saw in the 1960's, and we have seen again 
here in the Iran-Contra affair how easy it is for officials in the ex-
ecutive branch?the CIA in the first case, White House staffers in 
the second?to protect the President through some mistaken notion 
of plausible denial. It is tempting for him to interpret his winks 
and nods, and so "protect" him by keeping him in relative igno-
rance of what is going on. Requiring a finding to Congress puts the 
President on the line and so makes the administration think and 
think again. 
The second reason why it is important for Congress to be in the 
loop as a matter of right, not of executive discretion, is that Con-
gress ought to be an important source of counsel to Presidents, a 
source of advice about what the broad mass of American people 
would find acceptable in the realm of covert action if they could 
but know about it. 
As Mr. Reagan himself said, the criterion for covert action ought 
to be that if it were disclosed, the American people would say "that 
makes sense." We have seen over and over again, with the Iranian 
arms sales most recently, how if Congress is cut out, the executive 
loses that source of counsel, it loses that judgment about what the 
American people would support if they could but know about what 
is proposed. 
That takes me to a final issue, which is the one that has been 
raised often this afternoon: what to do about the hardest cases, the 
cases like Canada. Now, I, like Mr. Carver, would not want the ex-
ecutive branch to have to make a finding to Congress every time it 
approaches a foreigner to involve that foreigner in a covert action. 
I doubt that is the intent of the committee. 
But it does seem to me that loopholes in the reporting-require-
ments, either letting the executive have an unlimited amount of

317 
time at its discretion to report or otherwise leaving a big loophole, 
that loophole will always arise in the hardest cases. And those 
hardest cases, it seems to me, tend to be precisely the most impor-
tant ones in which to apply some judgment about what the Ameri-
can people would find acceptable if they could know about what 
was planned. 
The loophole will arise in cases like the arms sale to Iran, a case 
that derived from the President's passionate feeling that they 
ought to get the U.S. hostages released. That seems to me exactly 
the case where you most want the Congress to be involved. For 
that reason, the principles embodied in H.R. 3822 are important. 
Giving the designated oversight committees of Congress access to 
information about covert action in a very timely way as a matter 
of right, not of executive discretion, is critical. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Statement by 
Dr. Gregory F. Treverton 
Senior Fellow 
Council on Foreign Relations 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
Hearing on H.R. 3822 
March 10, 1988 
Mr. Chairman: It is a pleasure for me to have this 
opportunity to appear before the Committee. I will confine 
myself to the requirements for reporting to the intelligence 
committees of Congress about covert action that are embodied in 
H.R. 3822. I strongly support the principles reflected in 
those requirements. They seem to me to provide the president 
with enough flexibility to respond quickly if need be to 
changing circumstances while assuring that Congress will have a 
serious role in the process through its designated committees. 
That role is consistent with our government of separated 
institutions sharing power, in Richard Neustadt's famous 
phrase. It also has proven to be a matter of simple prudence, 
as shown most recently in the negative by the arms sales to 
Iran. 
Conducting secret operations in a democratic society is a 
paradox. I first came to think about it seriously when I 
worked for the first Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
chaired by by the late Sen. Frank Church, where I spent much of 
my time examining American covert actions in Chile, 1963-1973; 
I then had the opportunity to reflect on covert operations from 
another vantage point while serving the National Security 
Council during 1977-79. These experiences led me to want to 
step back while in academic life and assess the sweep of 
American covert action in the postwar period; the result of

that project is a book, published last year, Covert Action:  
The Limits of American interventioD in the Postwar World. 
For me, the security interests of the United States in a 
world that often is not as we Americans would have it mean that 
we cannot unilaterally foreswear covert action. That 
conclusion, however, brings the paradox of managing those 
operations in a democratic society to center stage. I would 
like the standard for employing covert action to be set high --
when vital interests of the United States are at stake and no 
other instrument will suffice. Bringing Congress into the 
process is important both in principle, given our democracy, 
and in practice if administrations are to be pressed to think 
and think again before resorting to covert action. 
When the Church Committee began its intestigations in 
1974, it did so in the aftermath of Watergate and accusations 
of improprieties by intelligence agencies. At one point, 
Senator Church likened the CIA to 'a rogue elephant on the 
rampage.' In the event we did not find many 'rogue elephants,' 
at least not at the CIA. What we did find was a practice of 
'plausible denial that created a troubling looseness in the 
executive's review and control of covert action, even as in a 
pinch it seldom protected administrations in power. In the 
early days, the Congressional role amounted to the 'buddy 
system' -- informal conversations between the CIA Director and 
a few senior members of Congress. 
Plausible denial and the buddy system did not emerge because the

CIA had broken free of its political masters. They emerged 
because that was how both administrations and Congress wanted 
it at the time. 
The perils of that practice of plausible denial were 
graphic in the instances of the plots to kill Fidel Castro. As 
Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans and later 
DCI, restified before the Church Committee in 1975, he was 
almost plaintive in drawing implications of that practice: 
...it was made abundantly clear.. .to everybody involved in 
the operation that the desire was to get rid of the Castro 
regime and to get rid of Castro. .the point is that no 
limitations were put on this injunction... [but] 
one.. .grows up in [the] tradition of the times and ,I think 
that any of us would have found it very difficult to 
discuss assassinations with a President of the U.S. I 
just think we all had the feeling that were hired out to 
keep those things out of the Oval Office. 
If he had ever thought he would later have to testify before 
Congress about what he had done, Helms reflected, he would have 
made sure that his orders were clearly in writing. 
Accordingly, the Church Commitee and its parallel body in 
the House, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike, set about building on the 
earlier Hughes-Ryan act. The committees worked to two broad 
purposes. One, reflected in Hughes-Ryan, was to put an end to 
the dangerous way plausible denial had come to be practiced on 
occasion. The president would be required to sign a *finding," 
thus putting his name, and his reputation on the line. There 
would be no future wrangles such as those over assassinations: 
covert actions, wise or stupid, would reflect presidential 
decision; there would be no doubt that someone was in charge.

Or such was the hope. 
The other purpose was to attach Congress to the process in 
a way more systematic than the buddy system and at the same to 
create focal points for Congressional consideration of covert 
action. Congress would thus acquire information and 
responsibility to match; less often would its members be able 
to speechify in professed ignorance of covert action. That 
degree of responsibility was not, and is not always 
confortable; members of Congress have little incentive to take 
the responsibility, much reason not to. But it seemed 
imperative if the review process within the executive were to 
be held to a high standard of accountability and if the entire 
process were to reflect the sharing of power. 
We even hoped that in time presidents might come to see 
the oversight committees as a source of counsel. Perhaps that 
was naive. The constitution does not exactly prevent that sort 
of comity between executive and Congress, and it has occurred 
from time to time -- Truman and Vandenberg, or Johnson and 
Dirksen. But it is not easy. Still, simple prudence, we 
thought, would dictate that presidents would pay close 
attention to the views of the oversight committees as 
surrogates for the American people, as advice about what 
Americans would think about a covert action could they know of 
it. As President Reagan put it, the standard should be such 
that if a covert action is disclosed the American people will 
deem that makes sense. Including the oversight committees in 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23:

the process is a way to find out something about what those 
Americans would say without having to disclose the covert 
action. It would serve as a check on any "can-do ? attitude 
within the executive or on the temptations of White House 
staffers. 
The process is hardly perfect or tidy. But most of the 
time the process seems to have worked as it was intended. The 
congressional overseers have been informed of covert action and 
recorded their views; sometimes those views have prevailed. In 
others, they have expressed their concerns but then let the 
program go ahead despite their doubts. Most of the time, in 
either case, the process has remained secret. The Reagan 
Administration wanted to make use of covert action much more 
frequently than its predecessor, and the oversight committees, 
reflecting the mood of Congress and probably of the American 
people as well, assented to that expansion of covert action. 
The exceptions -- aspects of aid to the Contras and the 
arms sales to Iran -- are graphic demonstration of the dangers 
of excluding Congress. That role is no guarantee of wiser 
policy; perhaps the committees would have been seduced down the 
road from hostages to arms sales just as the Administration 
was. But at least then the aftermath would have been a joint 
exploration of policy failure, not recriminations. And I 
suspect that Congress would have pressed the Administration to 
judge the operation again in light of the President's 'makes 
sense criterion.

The principal argument against requiring that every major 
covert action be reported to the committees within 48 hours 
seems to be the fear of leaks. Surely it is appropriate to 
take that concern seriously, for lives can be at stake. 
However, as I read the history, the intelligence committees 
have not been leaky, quite the contrary. From the beginning, 
they have known that any leaks from them would only give the 
administration in power, never mind is party, justification for 
excluding the committees as 'leaky. They have been scrupulous 
about leaks, careful in their compartmentation; the numbers of 
people in Congress who know about any operation are few by 
comparison to those in the executive. 
In a curious sense, Senator Leahy's unfortunate case 
illustates the special concern of the oversight committees. He 
resigned, appropriately in my view, after leaking prematurely 
an unclassified report that was not yet released. Applying the 
same standard to the executive would, in my experience, 
decimate the top ranks of any administration. 
Concern over leaks, while appropriate, should not override 
the reasons -- of both prudence and principle -- for including 
Congress in the process of reviewing covert action. What is 
important is that the inclusion be a matter of right, not of 
executive discretion, and that the views of the oversight 
committees be heard in time to permit an adminstration to 
re-think its intentions.

Mr. McHum'. Thank you very much. 
As it happens, you three gentlemen are the last witnesses we 
will hear from in this series of hearings. I think it is appropriate 
for me to say that we have been very fortunate, I think, to have 
people of the background and experience and thoughtfulness that 
you gentlemen represent and the others we have heard from repre-
sent. It has been a very informative and interesting series of hear-
ings for me, and it is probably hard to focus on anything that is 
novel or new at this point as well. 
So if I repeat myself, please excuse me. 
Let me pose a number of questions to you, General Scowcroft and 
Dr. Carver, because as a proponent of this legislation I do have 
some differences, or at least questions. 
First of all, I think, as I have indicated earlier, the intent of this 
legislation is to clarify what we believe to be existing law. There-
fore, I would like to begin by asking whether there is any quarrel 
on your part with existing law. 
As you know, under current law the President is generally re-
quired to provide prior notice to the intelligence committees or, in 
particularly sensitive cases, to the small leadership group when he 
authorizes a covert operation. This is, he is required to give us 
notice before he begins implementing a covert operation. That is 
the general rule. 
Do either of you have a quarrel with that general rule, which is 
now part of the law? 
Lieutenant General ScowcRorr. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think it 
is of questionable constitutionality, but I don't have a quarrel with 
it as long as the President reserves the discretion to decide when 
and under what circumstances he has to do it. 
I am relaxed about the statute as it exists, but we have taken an 
unfortunate step forward with this particular bill. 
Dr. CARVER. Mr. Chairman, let me plug a couple of things?
which we could talk about all day but obviously won't. 
First, I know that the intent of the proposed law was simply to 
clarify what exists. But I do submit?and this I tried to take up 
both in this statement, and in the portions that I didn't cover (in 
my full statement)?with all due respect to its drafters, that this 
bill displays the evidence of hasty draftsmanship. There are inter-
nal contradictions in it. There are things that would raise major 
new uncertainties. 
For example, it drops the preambular clause of section 501(a) in 
a way that has riple effects which are quite confusing. It sets up a 
new criterion for protection of intelligence sources, limiting that 
protection to "sensitive intelligence sources," but in no way defines 
the limiting adjective "sensitive." 
There are a number of other difficulties throughout this bill. 
Hence, I think that whatever be its intent, this bill needs a very 
good clean drafting scrub by people looking for inconsistencies. 
On the other, larger question of law, there are certain battles 
that have been fought. I am just a private citizen, now retired and 
not a lawyer. I don't like some aspects of the present law, but I am 
not sure that change would necessarily be an improvement. 
One thing that I don't like about the present law involing an 
area where the present law is a little bit vague, and the way the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
325' 
bill you are considering would eliminate that vagueness I get very 
skittish about Presidents signitig findings, which are written docu-
ments, partly because in our system of government, our President 
performs two functions, which most other governments divide: He 
is the chief Political officer, a partisan political figure. He is also 
the ceremonial chief of state, the focus of national interest, who 
speaks for the United States. 
Most covert action, Mr. Chairman, involves violating some other 
country's laws, and I think the wisdom of having our chief of 
state's signature on a written document directing agents or agen-
cies of the U.S Government to violate some other nations' laws, in-
cluding nations with which we are not in a state of war, is a very 
debatable proposition, more debatable than many people would ac-
knowledge. 
I am also very skeptical about the advisability of insisting that 
all findings, even on the most sensitive matters, be reduced to writ-
ing. I am not at all opposed to folding Congress in more carefully 
than it has been folded. Certainly no one is defending Iran-Contra 
and what was done there; but what is written can be xeroxed, and 
when you start circulating, out of the Oval Office documents of 
that nature, you are asking for trouble. 
So, no, I am not uncritically supportive of everything in present 
law, but I would be extraordinarily skittish about changing it, par-
ticularly in the wake of Iran-Contra, and doubly so amidst the pres-
sures of an election year. 
Mr. McHuGH. In the interest of time, if we have differences on 
current law, our differences are broader than I would expect and 
therefore we might not be able to bridge them all. 
But from the perspective of the authors, assuming that current 
law is generally acceptable and current practices generally accepta-
ble, what we are doing here really is trying to define what we 
mean by timely notice, where the President in his discretion with-
holds prior notice; that is to say, where he chooses not to notify 
Congress before the implementation of a covert operation. 
The current law requires that he provide notice in that case "in 
a timely fashion," after the implementation begins. 
Now, what does that mean? 
In the case of the Iran arms sales, the administration interpreted 
it to allow no notice, at least for a period of 10 months. There was 
never any notice given to the Congress about this fundamental 
policy decision. 
Now, administration witnesses, reflecting upon those circum-
stances, have admitted here to a person that that was unwise. Con-
gress should have been notified. 
But the problem we face is that the legal opinion of the adminis-
tration is that that was fully authorized within the law, and that 
means, it seems to me,- at least theoretically, that any administra-
tion in the future could do the same thing and not be in contradic-
tion of the law, and that is not acceptable to those of us who think 
that congressional oversight is something to be taken seriously. 
I am not questioning the integrity or sincerity of the people who 
are not testifying from the administration, but I am questioning 
whether or not that legal opinion that we are facing is something

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
326 
which would provide for meaningful congressional oversight as in-
tended by current law, as at least it has been read until now. 
Dr. CARVER. Mr. Chairman, I am not a lawyer. I am not going to 
defend what the administration did. It was silly. 
"Timely" has a certain amount of creative ambiguity. It clearly 
does not mean time denoted in months, but I think any attempt to 
specify a time, particularly a near-term time?I mean 48 hours, 
even 2 days is ill advised. A finding is a very complicated docu-
ment. It is going to take internal preparation. It is going to take 
internal coordination. It shouldn't be slapped together. Putting one 
together in 48 hours, particularly if the President happens to be 
out of town, and getting it disseminated is going to be extraordinar-
ily difficult. 
I think in any attempt to specify 48 hours, 36 hours, 72 hours?
or whatever?you are going to find a hard case that straddles the 
specification. 
I would much rather Congress put a clear shot across this admin-
istration and its successor's bow by indicating "one more step out 
of line and we will tie your hands in ways that you really won't 
like," rather than by jumping in and trying to specify what you 
can't quantify. 
Mr. McHuGH. My time is about up. I will ask just one more ques-
tion. 
What we are really down to in a worst case situation, from the 
administration's perspective and yours, is requiring the President 
within a 48-hour period to tell eight people in the leadership of the 
Congress of the United States. That is what we are talking about. 
Lieutenant General ScowcRorr. Mr. Chairman, it is not quite 
that simple because the bill says those eight people, if you limit it 
to those eight people, it can be done only to meet "extraordinary 
circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States." 
Now, I don't know how many vital interests we have, but it cer-
tainly would not extend to the Canadian Embassy people. That is 
not a vital interest of the United States. It is to the people in-
volved, not to the United States. 
We probably don't have a half dozen vital interests. Vital means 
we cannot survive unless we protect them. That is an extreme re-
striction on alternative notification. 
Dr. CARVER. It is probably more extreme than the drafters in-
tended, Mr. Chairman, but once again the drafters use a lot of lan-
guage whose full implications I don't think they quite know. 
Mr. McHuGH. Dr. Carver, this is current law. What we are talk-
ing about now is current law. 
Dr. CARVER. That is right, but those drafters were equally--
Lieutenant General ScowcRorr. That does not much help the sit-
uation if one takes it seriously. 
Mr. McHuGH. I think as a practical matter that definition is left 
indeed in fact to the President's discretion, and it has never been 
questioned by either the Executive Branch or the Congress, and if 
the President chooses to limit his notification to those eight leader-
ship people, it has never been a matter of controversy between the 
two branches. 
Mr. Hyde is shaking his head.

327 
Mr. HYDE. I just think it is a sloppy way to legislate. The words 
have got to mean what they say. 
Mr. McRoca. Look, the bottom line?I will defer to my col-
leagues because I have taken more than my allotted 10 minutes?I 
think it is important to remember in this debate what the alterna-
tive is to doing what we are exploring here; that is, to try to make 
clear what we think is important by way of notification?and it is 
not a veto power we are talking about here. It is simply notifica-
tion to the Congress?the alternative to that is what we in fact got 
in the Iran case. 
Now, hopefully, that is an aberration and it is an exception and 
it won't happen again; but we are faced with a legal opinion and a 
position by this Administration and many others who are distin-
guished witnesses that that is the law and that we cannot expect, 
legally at least, anything more from an administration than what-
ever the administration chooses on its own discretion to decide to 
give to the Congress, even when it is a fundamental policy decision 
such as selling arms to Iran. 
Now, that is not, for some of us at least, an acceptable arrange-
ment and a reasonable balance between the two branches on mat-
ters of fundamental importance to the country. 
Lieutenant General ScowcHorr. But, Mr. Chairman, what- you 
are trying to do is to say the President can't go it alone, and I 
think if there is anything that has demonstrated that in his own 
self-interest, it is the Iran-Contra affair. He cannot conduct any se-
rious foreign policy on his own. Sooner or later, he has to come 
back to you. 
Now, if you know within 48 hours, 72 hours, does that really seri-
ously affect your oversight power? 
The implication seems to be that somehow if President Reagan 
had come up here and told you about the Iran affair you would 
have objected and he would have said, oh, my goodness, I didn't 
know that, well, I certainly won't do it. I think there is no reason 
to assume that he would have changed his mind had he gone 
through with notification as would be considered timely. 
He heard objections, serious objections, from members of his Cab-
inet, from his principal advisers. This is something about which he 
felt strongly, and it seems to me?and I am not a constitutional 
lawyer?that he was within his rights to do it. 
Mr. McHuGH. He was within his rights to do it. The question is 
whether or not he should have. 
Lieutenant General ScowcHorr. He should not have. We all 
agree. 
Mr. McHuGH. He should have notified at least a certain number 
of people in Congress under the law. 
Mr. HYDE. If the gentleman will yield. 
Mr. McHuGH. I'll be happy to yield to you, Mr. Hyde, and then 
to Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. HYDE. The question is, as a matter of law, do we, the Con-
gress, have the constitutional authority to invade the executive 
function which is given to him by the Constitution in broad terms 
and tell him legally, not as a matter of policy?but legally?that he 
must exercise that Executive power in a certain way, within a cer-
tain time frame?

CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
328 
I submit to you that we don't have the constitutional power, but 
we really don't need it. As a matter of policy, as a matter of 
common sense, any President who doesn't?and it should be more 
than notify, he should consult. He should talk to us and get our 
input. Not just say, "Here it is, boys," but in any event, we don't 
have the constitutional power to tell him how he must execute 
what is clearly his constitutional authority. 
We do have every justification in the world for suggesting it's 
stupid. He'll pay a fearful price politically, and President Reagan is 
still paying that price. 
And some candidates for President are going to pay a price, or 
are paying a price. And he's not getting away scot-free. We don't 
have to tighten up the laws. We have to tighten up enforcement. 
And they're going to be penalized. 
But, to tell the President he has to exercise what is essentially 
his authority within 48 hours is clearly unconstitutional, in my 
humble opinion. And I think we just have to realize that. Desirable 
as some may feel it is. 
Mr. McHuGH. Well, Henry. 
Mr. HYDE. That's just my strong feeling. 
Lieutenant General ScowcRovr. I certainly agree with that. 
Mr. McHuGH. Let me just say for the record that we do have 
constitutional experts who take a different view, Henry. This is not 
a self-evident issue. 
Mr. HYDE. I understand. 
Mr. McHuGH. And as a matter of record, we have people who 
have given us statements to the effect that the Congress does have 
the constitutional authority to ask the President in cases like this 
to share with members of the Intelligence Committee. 
Mr. HYDE. You said ask. We're telling him what he has to do. 
That's a big difference. 
May I just make a couple more comments? And then I'm 
through. 
Mr. McHuGu. Mr. Livingston has the time. 
Are you willing? 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Go ahead. 
Mr. HYDE. All right. Just very briefly. I think this has been mar-
velous testimony from all three of you. 
Dr. Carver, you have written a book here and it's not going to be 
wasted; I can assure you, I'll read every word of it. And I know my 
colleagues will, too. 
General Scowcroft and Dr. Treverton, you have made an im-
mense contribution. Let me just say this to you though, Dr. Trever-
ton. 
You are much more benign than I would be when you say, as I 
read the history of the Intelligence Committees they have not been 
leaking. Quite the contrary. 
Oh, Doctor, you know more than I, I'll tell you. And I serve on 
the committees. 
Page 26 of Dr. Carver's statement, and I wouldn't mention it but 
he does, says: 
Much more recent events here in March 1987, a former Chairman of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence relinquished his chairmanship only 2 months ear-

A 
lier and spoke to a group of potential suPportera convened in Florida in the wake 
and in the context of the Pollard affair. 
The former chairman, just 2 months away from his post, alleged to that audience 
that the Pollard case had been preceded in 1982 by a similar U.S. intelligence oper-
ation targeted against Israel. 
An allegation that both the United States and the Israeli Gov-
ernments immediately and -emphatically denied with some embar-
rassment?and haste, I might add. 
The Chairman of the Senate Committee, who still has problems 
with that disclosure, the Vice Chairman left under circumstances 
you mentioned, which you say were benign. 
OK. You mentioned the Pike Committee. You know the report 
was taken by Daniel Schorr, and he lost his job with CBS over it. 
We have leaks. I have a book of leaks this thick that I don't 
know who leaked them all. If my life depended on it, I could make 
some educated guesses?not as to the name, but as to the source. 
So I don't think you can say that the Intelligence Committee 
doesn't leak. We have yet to have a real good investigation of a 
couple of them that I think demand it. 
Dr. TREVERTON. Could I say a word about that? 
It's certainly true that there have been leaks from the Intelli-
gence Committee. But, as a comparative matter, looking at the 
time period since the committees were established, that they have 
been on the whole not more and probably a good deal less leaky 
than the upper echelons of administrations. 
Mr. HYDE. We made a study of that. And if you take the number 
of people in the Executive that have clearances and people in Con-
gress that have clearance, and then you look at the leaks pound for 
pound, Congress, it seems to me, is 60 times more likely to leak. 
And we've got some figures on that. 
Dr. TREVERTON. But they have been leaks from other than the 
Intelligence Committees. 
Mr. HYDE. Of course. And we all remember Leo Ryan's famous 
interview with Daniel Schorr, when he said: 
I have a duty to leak. If I don't like a policy, I think it's not in the best interests 
of our country, I have a moral duty to leak. 
I presume, when you're confronted with that, let me just say?
my last words, and I appreciate your indulgence?we are spending 
our time and our energy and our fervor and our zeal and our out-
rage on extracting better disclosures from the government, from 
the administration. OK? 
But we're spending no time on doing something about the leaks. 
We're not criminalizing the unauthorized disclosure. We don't 
bother with that. 
I've got a bill to have a joint committee of the Intelligence, fewer 
people within the loop, can't get hearings. I've had it since 1984. 
That problem we're not looking at. But we are looking at this 
problem, which I think doesn't need to be fixed, at least legally, in 
a way that I think squeezes the Constitution out of shape. 
Dr. TREVERTON. What would seem to me important, though, is 
confronting the argument that is made against these reporting re-
quirements on the grounds that the Intelligence Committees are 
leaky. That seems to me to be a red herring. There may be good

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1_30 
reasons to be against those reporting requirements, but leaks are 
not one of them. 
Mr. HYDE. I think, if we prosecuted the leaks and if we crimina-
lized the leaks, you know, human nature is not going to change. 
We have to be consulted as a matter of policy. 
But my problem is with mandating the President to do some-
thing within 48 hours. We just can't do it. I'm sorry. 
Lieutenant General SCOWCROFT. If I could just comment very 
briefly on this, I would agree with Gregg. I'm not sure that the Ex-
ecutive is not, in general, as leaky or more leaky than the Con-
gress. But that does not apply to covert action. 
The procedures in the executive branch on covert action and the 
seriousness with which they're taken, I think prevent leaks on 
covert action. They just don't happen. 
And the President does not have that kind of control over the 
Congress. Therefore, he's bound to be reluctant to share the kinds 
of things where people's lives?not only the policy against disclo-
sure, but people's lives are at stake?to a body over which he does 
not exercise any control. 
Mr. HYDE. Thank you very much. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Just a few loose ends I want to tie up. 
General Scowcroft has indicated very clearly that current law 
really is sufficient to cover the problem. What we have is not a 
legal problem, we have a political problem. 
If the President and the Administration made political mistakes, 
they have paid dearly for them. I would certainly hope that any 
future Administration would learn from those mistakes. 
Not to leave you alone, Dr. Treverton, you said--[Laughter.] 
You said that we don't need to leave loopholes, that the current 
law leaves loopholes. 
Well, the propsoed bill does more than plug loopholes. It puts un-
reasonable restrictions on the President by saying that he must 
consult with Congress in advance of any proposed covert action in 
all but the most exceptional circumstances. 
And as General Scowcroft says, in all circumstances except those 
which deal with vital security interests. Yet, President Carter took 
three months under then existing law. 
Now, you're essentially saying for two reasons. First of all, even 
if that were a vital instance of national security, the saving of the 
lives of some six people?even if that were vital?he was still long 
overdue by almost 3 months, less 2 days. 
And then, if you can accept the argument of General Scowcroft 
that that isn't even a vital security interest, to save the lives of six 
Americans, then he was wrong from the day that he committed the 
covert activity. 
Are you foreclosing that option? Are you saying to American citi-
zens who might be abroad, who might be jeopardized under similar 
circumstances, as they were under the Carter administration, when 
they were captured by Teheran, "Check off, folks, because you're 
not vital and you don't count, because if we saved you, that would 
be a loophole"? 
Dr. TREVERTON. I share your nicely old-fashioned sense that we 
ought to be careful about words. I would like us to do so as well.

But, as a practical matter, we- all know that covert action, like 
other matters of policy, is a tussle. It's going to be a struggle be-
tween the executive and Congress. 
What seems to be important is to impose the burden on the 
President to make him think, and think again. If Presidents are de-
termined to go ahead if they feel it's very important to go ahead, 
they'll do it. We all know that, 
But the burden should been the President to ask himself why he 
isn't going to consult with Congress on a proposed covert action. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Dr. Treverton, we're mandating it in law. It's 
not just a legal burden. It's not just a legal discourse, the discus-
sion. What you're talking about is placing the lives of American 
citizens in jeopardy. 
You know, for us to sit across the table going back and forth 
here and talking about that potential is academic. For the people 
who might be placed in jeopardy, it may be the end of existence. 
Now, are you telling me that for the sake of proposing that all 
future administrations conform to legal niceties, that future lives 
of American citizens don't matter? 
Dr. TREVERTON. No, of course not. But, we can all imagine par-
ticular cases that fit our purposes. But imagine that Mr. Carter 
had to go through the 1980 episode again under this law. Then it 
seems to me he would have had several options. 
He would have had one option to go back to Canada and say, 
Listen, under my law, I've got to tell at least eight Members of 
Congress. I'll tell them under the utmost secrecy. They'll sympa-
thize with the operation. Can I do that? 
If Canada still said no, then he would have had the option of 
either not doing it or of going ahead and--
Mr. HYDE. Getting impeached. 
Dr. TREVERTON. In those circumstances, he would have risked 
what people would say, OK, he broke the law but in exceptional 
circumstances. He was justified in doing so. I dare say no one in 
Congress would have moved to impeach Mr. Carter for getting six 
Americans out. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. They might impeach Mr. Reagan. 
Dr. TREVERTON. No one wanted to in the Iran-Contras case, and I 
can understand why. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. For Dr. Carver and General Scowcroft, do you 
see any redeeming qualities in the proposed bill, H.R. 3822? Or any 
of the proposed changes contained therein which really need to be 
made? 
Lieutenant General ScowcRoFr. I guess what I would say briefly 
is that I think that President Reagan has gone to extreme lengths 
to correct the problems within the executive branch, which let this 
unfortunate thing happen. That they are more than adequate. 
If I were in the Government and this bill came to the President's 
desk, I would strongly urge that he veto it on grounds that the leg-
islation demonstrates that it was not possible to cooperate with the 
Congress. And, therefore, he had to insist on his constitutional 
rights. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Dr. Carver.

Dr. CARVER. The present law was written by humans and can 
certainly be improved, as any human artifact can. But the short 
answer to your question, Mr. Livingston, is no. I really don't see 
any material advantage that could be gained by H.R. 3822 or S. 
1721. 
I can see a lot of disadvantages, some of them the unintended re-
sults, I think, of hasty drafting. And I certainly would much prefer 
that any changes in the law be made in a more leisured way, free 
from some of the pressures that are attendant on the current legis-
lation, which I think would be regretted even by those who drafted 
and enacted it within a matter of years, if not months. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you. 
Dr. Carver, perhaps this is best addressed to you. Any of the 
others may feel free to comment. 
How difficult do you believe it will be for us to assure those for-
eign participants that including a number of Members of Congress 
in the circle of knowledge in advance of covert actions does not sig-
nificantly increase the risk of harm to those participants; that is, 
under circumstances such as Canada. 
How easy would it be to persuade them, as Dr. Treverton pointed 
out, that law compels us to advise the Congress. And it's really not 
so bad, just go along with us. 
Dr. CARVER. It depends, of course, on the particular case and the 
particular foreigners. The short answer is I think it would be ex-
traordinarily difficult to persuade other foreigners, who are skit-
tish enough about America's ability to keep secrets, to persuade 
them to go along with increasing the witting circle, particularly in-
creasing it up on Capitol Hill. 
Fair or not, the perception exists of closed door hearings being 
held during the Iran-Contra with General Scowcroft and his col-
leagues and then people falling all over themselves to get to the 
microphones to tell what was going on in the closed door hearings. 
I don't mean to be indelicate, but things like the Durenberger 
episode sent a shock wave through the professional intelligence 
community around the world. And I think, as a matter of practical 
reality, that there is enough nervousness already about the Ameri-
can ability to keep secrets, and that nervousness would be materi-
ally increased at any intimation of passing further information to 
Congress, even if that increased nervousness were unwarranted or 
unjustified, particularly with regard to specific individuals. 
But the specific individuals can change. A given set of eight lead-
ers might be perfectly secure. But you can easily imagine a situa-
tion where of those eight, there might be one or two, on particular 
issues, about which particular governments would have certain 
concerns that might not be entirely unwarranted. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. By the Durenberger episode, you are referring 
to the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee? 
Dr. CARVER. Yes, sir, coming out 2 months after this chairman-
ship and talking about a covert operation. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. And he would have been one of the designated 
people? 
Dr. CARVER. He would have been one of the designated eight be-
cause he was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you very much.

Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Stokes. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Let me greet this very distinguished panel. It's a pleasure to 
have your appear before the subcommittee. I would just like to 
have some reaction from the panel regarding the Canadian situa-
tion. 
I think that we are forgetting here to acknowledge the fact that 
the currently existing law was not the law at the time that the Ca-
nadian situation arose, at the time that President Carter was con-
fronted with the Canadian situation. 
The Hughes-Ryan law was in effect, which would have required 
him, the President, to. notify eight committees in the Congress. 
That is a lot different from having to notify the two Intelligence 
Committees of the Congress, or in the alternative, notify the so-
called gang of eight. 
And a part of the consideration in the enactment of the 1980 law 
was to alleviate that situation. It was a cut-down from eight com-
mittees of the Congress to two committees in the Congress, and 
then a further cutdown to eight members of the entire Congress. 
So it would seem that we are not really confronted with the 
same situation any more that President Carter was confronted 
with in the Canadian situation. 
I would appreciate any comments that any of you might have in 
that regard. 
Lieutenant General Scowcxorr. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me 
that we are dealing with what is likely to be, in any case, only a 
very small handful of proposed covert operations, a very small pro-
portion. 
Really, those where people's lives are seriously at stake and 
where an operation may involve substantial advanced planning, 
maybe the implacement of agents in foreign countries, and so on. 
In those circumstances, it seems to me that it's important to 
leave it to the discretion of the President to have the authority to 
protect those lives. I think we all agree that timely notification was 
violated in the Iran-Contra Affair. There's no question about it. 
But, to be so rigid as to require notification, regardless of the cir-
cumstances, within 48 hours, not of executive but of the President's 
decision to go ahead, it seems to me does not leave him the flexibil-
ity to do what's required in some cases. 
Dr. CARVER. Mr. Chairman, may I follow up? 
I don't have the text of section 662 committed to memory, but I 
believe, sir, that that language of Hughes-Ryan did give him the 
"in timely fashion" wiggle room within which he didn't have to 
notify anybody. 
Certainly, I think that's the way he behaved. I believe that the 
curtailment of notification from eight committees to two?although 
again Appropriations and, to some extent, Armed Services, deal 
themselves into the act a little bit, as you know?that was a step 
forward. 
But the wiggle room, the ambiguity, the elasticity, the loophole, 
whatever you want to call it, of the "in timely fashion" enabled 
President Carter to get through that situation without violating 
the law.

If there had been a 48-hour notice requirement, even on notify-
ing the Gang of Eight, I don't think you would have been able to do 
so. And I think he would have been impaled on the dilemma we 
have discussed. 
I think, with all due respect, Mr. Chairman, that requiring a 
President, without exeception, to notify?even if he's dealing in a 
situation as he was then, where a foreign government?and it's 
they who are providing the embassy, they don't have to help us?is 
a mistake, the proponents may easily say, "I'm terribly sorry. 
Don't give me a lecture on your Constitution. I'm telling you the 
terms and conditions under which we will provide this assistance. 
Meet it or not meet it. If you want the assistance, meet it. If you 
don't, that's your problem, not ours." 
That's the kind of real life situation the President has to deal 
with, sir. And I think that, in that case, the flexibility of "in timely 
fashion" overrode?the advantage of the flexibility overrode the 
disadvantage of not having to inform the committees. 
Dr. TREVERTON. Mr. Chairman, I disagree with both the previous 
comments. I think the circumstances have changed since 1980. And 
I think the bill as proposed would provide the President enough 
flexibility to meet extraordinary circumstances. 
It's certainly true that other governments always worry about us 
being leaky, unable to keep secrets. If they had their druthers, 
they'd all like us to be very different, a very different kind of 
system then we are. 
But it does seem to me that the proposal, particularly the option 
of letting the President notify only eight Members of Congress in 
extraordinary circumstances, which hasn't been used to my under-
standing very often, does provide enough flexibility for a President. 
I think it would have provided enough flexibility for Mr. Carter 
in 1980; we can't know for sure but the existing state of the legisla-
tion and the proposals you 'have made are really quite different 
from what was in effect in 1980. And that is on important fact to 
bear in mind. 
Mr. STOKES. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. McHuGH. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. 
Let me, in closing, first reassure you, Dr. Carver, that the intent 
of the bill?and I believe the terms of the bill?would not require 
the President to tell us specifically which countries, or which 
agents were involved in the covert operation, but only whether, ge-
nerically, other countries were asked. 
And I share your concern about that. If there's any ambiguity or 
question about it, we should make that clear; because I can see 
that if other countries became convinced that we were providing 
specific names, that would be a problem. 
I don't think our bill does that. But we'll go back and look to be 
sure. And if there's a question, we should make it clear that that's 
not the case. 
Secondly, I want to reassure you also that we're not pursuing 
this in great haste. The first bill, which was the bill Mr. Stokes and 
Mr. Boland introduced, is over a year old?we began these hearings 
back in April of last year. And we have held five of them.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 
335 
And I think it was discussed on both sides rather dispassionately, 
so I hope that we're not pursuing that in haste. Any my hope is 
that we do go forward, that we'll do it objectively without the parti-
san type of debate we sometimes experience in Congress. 
General, I think I'm not quite as sanguine as you about future 
administrations of whatever party not repeating mistakes. We've 
had administrations repeat mistakes all too often. It's the human 
factor. 
The Oversight Act of 1980, as you know, was initially developed 
because of some fundamental abuses, or mistakes, if you wish, and 
I'm not so sure that a future administration might not, for what-
ever reasons, make mistakes. 
What we're trying to do here is avoid the ambiguity which per-
haps contributed to this mistake in the Reagan administration. 
And I've said earlier, we really feel strongly, some of us, that 
unless we make clear what we think reasonable consultation and 
notice is, it increases the prospects for misunderstanding our mis-
take later. 
And it's possible that if the Congress, if members of Congress 
were notified, I think members on both sides would have objected 
to arms sales to Iran. It's possible that the President would have 
gone ahead anyway. But it's possible that he might have thought it 
through a little more carefully. And it's possible that he would 
have chosen not to proceed, in which event he would have spared 
himself a great political embarrassment. But, more importantly, he 
would have spared the country some real damage, at least in the 
short term, in foreign policy. 
And I think it's in that spirit that we're offering this suggestion. 
I'm not sure that 48 hours is magic here and I'm not sure that any 
specific time period can be defended as absolute truth. 
But I do think it's important in the face of a legal opinion that 
not notifying Congress for 10 months is OK, that we try to do some-
thing to clarify the existing law, or I think we're likely to see at 
some future time an administration misunderstanding what we 
mean. 
Maybe it will look back at the history of this event and say, 
"Well, the Administration in those days took the position that 10 
months was timely notice, and it has taken that position legally. 
Therefore, in this case, some years later, it is okay to withhold 
notice for that period of time again." 
And we think that, in light of these circumstances, it is impor-
tant for us at least to address the issue in a nonpartisan objective 
way in an effort to clarify what we think the law is or should be. 
And so I hope it's seen in that spirit and in that context. 
We do appreciate, as we said earlier, your participation. You 
have given us food for thought on both sides and I'm sure the com-
mittee members will think very carefully about this before we pro-
ceed to mark up. 
Again, thank you for being with us. 
Mr. Livingston. 
Mr. LIVINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to 
thank the witnesses for their testimony. That was great input. And 
I want to thank you for your courtesy throughout these hearings.

This is the last hearing we're going to have on this subject, and I 
think it should be the last thing we'll have anything to do with on 
this subject. [Laughter.] 
But I doubt that will be the case. 
But, I think it's appropriate just as a finale to quote a September 
4, 1985, comment in the Congressional Record from former Chair-
man of the Intelligence Committee, Lee Hamilton, who noted that, 
lt. . . leaks are inevitable when so many people handle secrets 
. . . 
I think it's a very appropriate line and I hope that we remember 
it as we go forward on this legislation.

Mr. Stokes.

The Honorable Louis Stokes 
The Honorable Matthew F. McHugh 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , 
U.S. House of Representatives 
H-405 Capitol Building 
Washington, D.C. 
Dear Chairman Stokes and Chairman McHugh: 
I want to thank you for the warm reception that you and 
the members of the Committee extended during my testimony 
regarding H.R. 3822. 
In addition, I would like to expand on my response to two 
questions that arose during my testimony concerning my 
proposal for criminal penalties: 
-- First, Mr. Richardson asked whether the criminal 
penalties that I proposed would hinder the undertaking of 
covert activities. As I responded, criminal penalties, in my 
view, would not be a hindrance -- indeed, such penalties would 
help to keep covert activities on their proper, narrow 
course. Under my proposal, members of the intelligence 
community -- acting in good faith as nearly all do -- could 
rely on the risk of criminal penalties to insist on compliance 
with laws that the expedient few might wish to ignore. The 
threat of criminality would bolster the resolve of subordinate 
and superior officials alike in resisting directives that 
evaded the reasonable provisions for notifying the 
intelligence committees of covert activities. 
-- Second, Mr. Glickman asked whether the termination of 
funding for covert activities about which the President had 
failed properly to inform the committees might endanger U.S. 
interests or lives. As I seated, in my view, this would not 
occur. If a covert activity was underway and the President

and the intelligence committees felt that it should continue 
to be funded to avoid risk to U.S. interests or lives, the 
President simply could sign a finding authorizing continued 
funding and provide it to the committees according to the 
law. This finding of course would not retroactively authorize 
the past activity or absolve any officials of liability for 
that past activity. But such a belated finding and notice to 
the committees should be necessary to restore the covert 
activity to its proper course. 
-Finally, I enclose a copy of my resume, as requested by 
the Committee. 
Permit me to express my appreciation for the courteous 
reception that I received this morning. 
Sincerely,

The Hon. Ebb Livingston 
-
U.S. House of Representatives 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
Washington, DC 2051576415 
Dear Congressman Livingston: 
I have now had a chance to review (as you requested) tha testimony of 
Judge Webster before your caraittee on 24 February 198S and also the 
unclassified text of NSDD 286. In his t,..t.irmny, Judge Webster states that 
"any concerts about excessive delay in Congressional notification of a 
special activity have already bo.n addressed by NSDD 286 (pp. 6-7)." I do 
not share this view and think legislation, and specifically H.R. 3822, is 
still required to assure that Congress will be kept properly informed abcut 
covert actions andwill be notified before they are undertaken. 
As I read it, NSDD 286 clearly recognizes the need for Congress to be 
consulted about covert action operations. This appears to be the rationale 
behind the statement in the "policy oantgeort" section of the document that 
such operations "should be conducted only Lthen we are confident that, if 
they are revealed, the American public would find them sensible." Only 
Congress can really provide this insight; yet, it cannot do so if it is not 
given prior notice. 
Such insight is especially important in circumstances wlUch might pose 
such grave risks to the United States that they require virtually immediate 
action. I use the word "virtually" here because I can forsee of no 
circumstance in whiCh covert action would be employed without some prior 
planning being required and such planning (which is essential from an 
operational viewpoint) would allow time at least to notify the senior 
leadership of Congress. However, were such a circumstance to exist in 
which a covert .action by the U.S. government had to be launched 
immediately, I find the allowance of a grace period of two working days 
before the Intelligence Committees had to be notified anomalous to say the 
least. This grace period could in practice be extended to three days in 
the case of federal holidays or even longer if these holidays happen to 
coincidewithWastLington snowstorms.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/23: 
CIA-RDP91B00389R000200170001-1 353 
I also find it troublesome that while NSDD 286 permits notice as well 
as information about Some covert action operations to be withheld fram 
Congress, it widens the circle of those in the know in the enacutive branch 
and gives the Chief of Staff to the president a key role. This position 
has not been filled with persons who have had extensive foreign affairs or 
intelligence experience nor should it be. And I am uncomfortable with the 
liLwopwa-that a chief of staff without such experience night bwause of: 
close personal relations influence the president's decisions about covert 
action. Without the Cheek and balance of congressional oversight, under 
NSDD 286 the president could really be loft blind about the costs and risks 
of a covert action. 
In sum, judge Webster's testimony has not changed my view that the 
intelligence community as well as the country would benefit from passage of 
H.R. 3822. 
yours sincerely, 
Allan E. Goodman

Subcommittee on Legislation on February 4. However, my letter to you of 
31 March 1987 in relation to H.1013, published as Appendix H to the 
Hearings on that bill, is relevant also for H.R. 3822, and your 
Subcommittee may wish to take account of it. 
As you requested, I attach brief comments on the testimony on the 
same subject by Assistant Attorney General Cooper before the Senate 
Committee on Intelligence on S.1721, 
Sincerely, 
Louis Henkin 
Mr. Louis Stokes, Chairman 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
U.S. House of Representatives

Comment on Testimony of Charles 3. Cooper 
Assistant Attorney General 
before 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
December 11, 1987 
Mr. Cooper's testimony deals with a number of issues. For 
convenience and clarity, I address what appear to be the large 
constitutional positions that underlie Mr. Cooper's testimony, and 
indicate where he and I may differ. 
1. Invoking the Executive Power clause (Article II, section 1), Mr. 
Cooper's memorandum states: This clause has long been understood to 
confer on the President a plenary authority to represent the United States 
and to pursue its interests outside the borders of the country, subject of 
course to the limits set forth in the Constitution itself and to such 
statutory limitations as the Constitution permits Congress to impose by 
exercising one of its enumerated powers." 
It has long been understood that the President has "plenary authority 
to represent the United States"; it has not been accepted that he has 
"plenary authority., to pursue its interests outside its borders." 
Whether inside or outside the borders of the United States, there are 
many things the President cannot do even "to pursue [U.S.] interests.". 
2. Mr. Cooper's memorandum seems to equate "plenary" power with 
"exclusive" power. Some powers of the President are perhaps exclusive and 
not subject to comprehensive regulation by Congress. There are other 
powers that the President may exercise when Congress is silent but as to

2, 
which the power of Congress is concurrent, and Congress can regulate and 
control Presidential action. 
3. Mr. Cooper's memorandum does not distinguish among "intelligence 
activities." It appears to treat intelligence-gathering and other covert 
activities as constitutionally identical. 
In my view, they are different in critical respects. As I indicated 
in my letter to your Committee last Spring, covert activities are subject 
to regulation by Congress; some means for gathering intelligence --
notably through the diplomatic process -- may not be subject to 
comprehensive regulation by Congress (though they, too, may be effectively 
subject to the war powers of Congress, and to its power to regulate the 
Executive Si-inch under powers granted to Congress by Article II and the 
"necessary and proper" clause). 
It is accepted that, in John Marshall's phrase, the President is the 
"sole organ of the nation in its external relations". As sole organ, the 
President has exclusive power over ',communication" and "relations" with 
foreign states and over what is related to or implied in.the diplomatic 
process. The gathering of intelligence by some means is plausibly part of 
that process. As to such activities, the President can claim authority 
exclusive of Congress. 
Covert activities, in my 'view, are not part of the "sole organ"' 
function." If the President has authority to.authorize such activities 
without authorization by Congress, it can only be under some general

3 
"executive power", the scope of which is uncertain. There is no basis --
in Marshall, in Hamilton, in Curtiss-Wright, or anywhere else -- for 
suggesting that such power is exclusive and not subject to regulation by 
Congress. 
The power of Congress to regulate covert activities is clear. Covert 
activities are elements of "commerce" with foreign nations within the 
meaning of Article I, section 8 of the Constitution. Covert activities 
may be sufficiently related to war and peace to come within the enumerated 
war powers of Congress. They are within the unenumerated "power of 
Congress to deal with foreign relations," See Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 
44, 59 (1958). 
4. The memorandum confuses the legislative request to be informed of 
covert activities with the centuries-old issue between President and 
Congress as to executive privilege. The Nixon case cited by Mr. Cooper 
confirmed that the President has an executive privilege. The Court held 
that in relation to the administration of justice the privilege is not 
absolute; the Supreme Court may have implied that, in relation to the 
administration of justice, the privilege might perhaps be absolute where 
diplomatic or military matters are concerned. The Court did not consider 
at all the existence, character or scope of executive privilege in 
relation to Congress. 
I do not express here any views on the large issue of executive 
privilege. Except where the request for information may impinge on 
private rights of individuals, the power of Congress to obtain information

358 
may know few limits, but the President may have some executive privilege 
even vis-a-vis Congress. 
As Mr. Cooper indicates, Congress has long respected the 
confidentiality of the diplomatic process. Whether it has done so out of 
courtesy or from a sense of constitutional propriety is uncertain . One 
can argue that to the extent that the process is within the exclusive 
power of the President, he is entitled to withhold information if he 
reasonably thinks that to communicate the information to Congress, even 
under injunction of secrecy, would jeopardize the activity. But the 
internal confidentiality of the Executive Branch apart, the claims for 
Congress's right to know are strong. I agree with Mr. Cooper that where 
the President has constitutional authority to withhold information from 
Congress, Congress may not Properly use its Power of the Purse to compel 
disclosure. 
The request for information as to covert activities is a wholly 
different matter. Mr Cooper suggests that Congress "in the performance of 
its ligislative function does not require notification of virtually all 
intelligence activities within a fixed period of time." But the 
Congressional directive that its Committees be informed when covert 
action is undertaken is not a request for information for legislative 
purposes only. It is a form of regulation. In my view, Congress could 
prohibit such activities; a fortiori, it can declare that they may take 
place only if Congressional Committees are informed of them.
