 The recent decision by the United Kingdom to reduce its official oil prices by
 about $1.35 per barrel-on the heels of a decision by Norway to reduce its of-
 ficial prices-raises the possibility that oil prices could begin a general slide.
 London's decision could lead Nigeria-which produces similar-quality
 crude-to lower its official prices also. A price reduction by Nigeria would
 threaten the existing OPEC price structure, particularly since the United Arab
 Emirates already threatened to reduce its prices before the British and
 Norwegian cuts. At a minimum, OPEC also will need a rapid rebound in oil
 demand in the fourth quarter to avoid a further unraveling of prices. F-~
 The amounts of the Norwegian and British cuts are tied to spot oil prices,
 which have been weak since midsummer. Spot oil prices declined precipitately
 in late July and early August as oil companies chose to liquidate excess
 inventories and OPEC continued to produce at high levels in June and early
 July. Despite severe market pressures, the British and most other producers,
 however, managed to hold the line on prices. London's request that companies
 avoid further pressure on BNOC-the UK's national oil company-combined
 with a significant reduction in Saudi and other OPEC producers' output
 allowed spot oil prices to firm slightly in September and early October. I
 25X1
 Despite OPEC oil production of only 16.2 million barrels per day (b/d) in
 August and September, however, spot oil.prices have remained about $1.50 to
 $2.00 per barrel below official levels. The ready availability of oil and the
 difference between spot and official prices encouraged many buyers to reduce
 contract purchases with the United Kingdom and several OPEC countries. As
 buyers walked away from contracts, the volume of oil traded at other than offi-
 cial prices escalated, compounding price weakness. One industry source
 estimates that in recent weeks as much as 50 percent of oil trade has been at
 less than official prices-including spot crude deals, refined products, barter
 deals, and sales of natural gas liquids. As the volume of spot oil transactions
 continues to increase, spot oil prices have become an even more significant
 barometer of oil prices.                                          25X1
 The British reduction puts substantial pressure on OPEC; a similar-although
 not identical-sequence of events led to OPEC's oil price reduction of $5 per
 barrel in early 1983. As we see it, OPEC must act quickly if it is to be success-
 ful in forestalling an unraveling of oil prices, particularly since many industry

 purchasers probably will try to delay normal seasonal purchases until the trend
 in prices becomes clearer. A number of scenarios are possible:
 ? OPEC could choose to hold the line on oil prices either in a formal OPEC
 meeting or as the result of informal communication among members. Press
 reporting indicates that the OPEC Secretariat cabled all members, strongly
 encouraging that a formal meeting be held. The Saudis also are reportedly
 supporting a meeting within the next week or 10 days. This approach
 probably would be appealing to a number of OPEC members-such as Iran,
 Algeria, and Kuwait-but we believe it would require several OPEC
 members besides Saudi Arabia to reduce oil output. Saudi flexibility to
 further reduce its production is limited, since we estimate that output was 4
 million b/d at the end of September. OPEC members also would have to
 abandon effective price discounting through barter deals or other
 mechanisms.
 ? Unilateral decisions by OPEC members to reduce oil prices are also possible,
 particularly if other non-OPEC producers act quickly to lower their prices.
 Last year, for example, Nigeria followed a British price drop by an even
 larger price cut, forcing the formal OPEC price reduction in March 1983. A
 decision by Nigeria to reduce prices would have direct repercussions on the
 many other OPEC members also producing primarily light crudes.
 ? OPEC could agree to again reduce official oil prices. Saudi Arabia would
 play the crucial role in such a scenario. If OPEC opts to reduce the
 benchmark oil price, we would expect the reduction to be more sizable than
 the recent British price cut. OPEC could also choose to hold more serious
 discussions on the issue of oil price differentials.
 OPEC's approach in dealing with the pressure on oil prices will depend in part
 on whether the organization still expects-as do most industry sources-the
 increase in oil demand in the fourth quarter to materialize.

 19 October 1984
 Denmark became the newest European gas exporter when it officially
 inaugurated its gas grid this month. West Germany will buy 92 million cubic
 meters of Danish gas this year. Gas sales to Sweden will begin in June of 1985,
 and rise to 400 million cubic meters by 1989. Longer range ambitions include
 a northward extension of the gasline to Stockholm, capable of providing
 Sweden with 1.5 billion cubic meters annually. The prospect of future Danish
 gas supplies may have influenced the recent decision of the Swedish state
 natural gas supplier not to recommend a proposal to buy 1 billion cubic meters
 a year of Soviet gas. F   I
 Shell Canada late last month opened Scotford, the world's first refinery and
 petrochemical plant to specialize in the processing of synthetic crude oil. The
 complex, near Edmonton, will refine synthetic crude from the Alberta tar
 sands and produce styrene, a petrochemical used in synthetic rubber and
 plastics. Annual sales are expected to exceed $650 million, mostly from exports
 to the United States and Pacific Basin countries. Because the refinery can also
 process natural crude produced locally, it could be extremely important for
 future investment in Alberta's energy sector. Depending on the success of the
 project, Shell Canada reportedly will invest as much as $5 billion in the
 province between now and 1990.x-]

 Toyota, has begun to assemble a small number of similar trucks in a joint ven-

 the Soviet expressed interest in US equipment but considers it risky to',order
 items of US origin. Several US firms that can supply equipment from overseas
 plants have been contacted, according to the official. While the official '
 expressed willingness to accept direct bids, reporting for several months has
 indicated a general Soviet policy not to accept equipment from US sources. By
 using US firms only as subcontractors, Moscow probably believes it can hold
 the prime contractor responsible for any US export-control problems. F_~

 USSR Trade
 Surplus Up
 the USSR registered a $3.4 billion trade surplus in

 period of 1983. All the improvement came in trade with the developed West as
 a $2 billion deficit in first half 1983 shifted to an $800 million surplus in Janu-
 ary-June 1984. This reversal was due largely to a sharp decline in imports of
 machinery and equipment and large-diameter pipe from West European and
 Japanese suppliers. While completion of deliveries for the export gas pipeline
 are partly responsible for this drop, imports of nonenergy capital goods are also
 being reduced. In contrast, Soviet surpluses with LDC and socialist trading
 partners declined by nearly 30 percent and 17 percent, respectively. The sharp
 reduction in Soviet exports to the LDCs probably reflects a decrease in

 Mexico: Debt Burden Still
 Heavy After Rescheduling
 ILLEGIB
 Mexico's agreement last month with its major
 creditors for a multiyear debt rescheduling does not
 solve Mexico's financial problems. The debt service
 burden will remain heavy and constrain imports
 and economic growth throughout this decade. The
 agreement, covering $48.5 billion of the $68 billion
 public-sector debt, reduces amortization payments
 during the next six years by stretching payments
 out through 1998 and lowering interest-rate
 spreads. It does not apply to the estimated $28
 billion in private-sector debt. We believe Mexico
 City and- its Bank Advisory Group will be able to
 sell the agreement to Mexico's other creditors,
 despite strong opposition from some regional and
 West European banks.
 New Agreement for Public Debt
 The rescheduling agreement was negotiated by the
 Mexican Finance Ministry and 14 lead banks
 representing Mexico's commercial creditors, of
 which there are more-than 500. This Bank Adviso-
 ry Croup, has. seven US members, five West Euro-
 pean members, and one Japanese and Mexican
 member. The key elements of the restructuring are:
 ? A 14-year repayment period, beginning in 1985.
 ? The dropping of the US prime rate option in
 favor of the lower London Interbank Offered
 Rate (LIBOR) as the baseline for calculating
 interest.
 ? An average risk premium of 1.125 percentage
 points above LIBOR, ranging from a low of 0.875
 percentage point in 1985-86 to a high of 1.25
 percentage points after 1990.
 ? A one-time option for non-US creditors to con-
 vert up to 50 percent of US dollar-denominated
 debt to the creditor's domestic currency.
 ? The IMF role will be limited to performing
 semiannual reviews of the Mexican economy that
 will be provided to the banks.

 The proposed agreement will significantly reduce

 drop by an average of almost $9 billion annually in
 the 1985-90 period. In 1987, for example, the
 savings will be $12.3 billion and in' 1990 they will

 lines of the public debt rescheduling, principal
 payments would decline by $2-3 billion annually.
 Even with such a restructuring, however, total debt
 service payments would exceed $20 billion in 1990.
 Alternative Repayment Scenarios
 The rescheduling will give Mexico financial breath-
 ing room, but the debt-repayment burden will
 remain heavy. The rescheduling does not apply to
 the payment of interest, which would constitute
 roughly three-fourths of Mexico's total annual debt
 service. Fluctuations in world interest rates will
 determine the actual level of annual repayments.
 Barring a dramatic drop in interest rates, debt
 service payments will increase. If interest rates
 remain at current levels, principal and interest
 payments on public and private debts will rise from
 almost $18 billion in 1985 to over $24 billion in
 1990. Even with a modest decline in interest rates,
 our optimistic case, payments still would reach $23
 billion by 1990. Somewhat higher interest rates
 would boost repayments to $26 billion.

 A rescheduling of the $28 billion private debt
 would ease Mexico's debt service burden only
 slightly. If private debt is restructured along the

 19 October 1984
 Negotiations on private debt restructuring will be
 time consuming and cumbersome, and probably
 never totally completed. Unlike public-sector debt,
 each loan must be handled on a case-by-case basis.
 We know of only one Mexican company, the large
 chemical conglomerate Cydsa, that has tentatively
 rescheduled its $139 million in external debt under
 the government's FICORCA program, which guar-
 antees hard currency for private debt payments
 beginning in 1986. The government anticipates it
 will be able to reschedule the $12 billion in debt
 registered under FICORCA by late next year. The
 Cydsa rescheduling, which is in line with
 FICORCA's requirements, sets a precedent for
 other negotiations. The repayment period is eight
 years, with four years' grace. Cydsa negotiated an
 interest rate of 1.75 percenta a oints above
 LIBOR with its creditors.
 Details on the rescheduling of the estimated 57
 percent of private debt not registered under
 FICORCA are extremely sketchy. Some of this

 debt may not require multiyear restructuring be-
 cause it probably consists of supplier credits and
 other short-term instruments. In any event, we
 believe up to one-third of this debt may have
 already been written off by lenders as uncollect-
 able. F___1
 Implications of Rescheduling
 The heavy debt service burden and banker resist-
 ance to additional reschedulings and new loans will
 constrain Mexico's import capacity and economic
 growth into the 1990s. We estimate that over the
 1985-90 period Mexico's debt service would rough-
 ly consume its projected foreign exchange earnings
 from oil exports-about three-fourths of total mer-
 chandise exports. Under these circumstances, im-
 port capacity will be largely determined by nonoil
 export receipts, including earnings from tourism,
 and net new foreign loans from international banks.
 We expect that bankers will continue to limit new
 loans to Mexico and that net new borrowing will
 average about $3 billion annually in 1985-90. This
 compares with net borrowing of $21 billion in 1981.

 Lower Excess
 Oil-Productive Capacity
 Outside the Persian Gulf
 The underlying cushion of excess oil-productive
 capacity worldwide that is available to offset a
 Persian Gulf disruption is at present particularly
 thin. Recent price adjustments, unless they unravel
 the entire OPEC price structure, are not likely to
 change this situation. According to our projections,
 surplus capacity outside the Persian Gulf in the
 fourth quarter of 1984 will fall to about 2.3 million
 b/d-less than 20 percent of Gulf output. More-
 over, reporting from US Embassy sources and
 companies operating in producing countries sug-
 gests that only about 1 million b/d of this could be
 available within 30 days of a decision to raise
 output-the remainder would take up to 90 days to
 return to production. Libya and Nigeria account
 for most of the surplus outside the Gulf that could
 be brought back on line in 30 days. Nonetheless,
 the availability of considerable excess capacity in
 Saudi Arabia and the levels of consuming coun-
 tries' stockpiles-particularly government stocks-
 should enable the market to cope with all but the
 most severe disruption. F_~
 The Capacity Issue
 The Iran-Iraq war has focused attention on the
 availability of excess oil-productive capacity to
 offset a disruption in the Persian Gulf. The ques-
 tion of how quickly this spare capacity can be
 brought back into production in response to an
 emergency remains a key concern. The sooner
 alternative supplies are made available during a
 disruption, the lower the probability of a runup in
 oil prices.--
 Many elements influence the response time, such as
 the procedures used to shut in capacity, the level of
 maintenance performed, and other technical as well
 as financial and manpower considerations. Also, a
 decision by a producing country to raise output will
 be affected by perceptions of the scope and proba-
 ble length of the disruption, and possibly by politi-
 cal considerations. Many producers have not pro-
 duced near capacity levels for years and could not
 return surplus capacity to production, without a
 significant leadtime. Judging from reporting from
 US embassies                      less than    25X1
 half the surplus capacity in key oil producers
 outside the Persian Gulf would be available within
 30 days.F_~
 Distribution of Excess Capacity
 According to our projections, the already large
 share of excess capacity concentrated in the Persian
 Gulf will increase in the fourth quarter. Gulf
 countries will account for 4.6 million b/d of the 6.9
 million b/d of surplus capacity available within 90
 days-double the excess capacity outside the Gulf.
 Saudi Arabia alone will account for 2.8 million b/d
 of spare capacity, or 40 percent of the total surplus
 available worldwide.
 Outside the Persian Gulf, Libya and Nigeria with
 600,000 b/d each and Venezuela with 500,000 b/d
 account for the lion's share of the 2.3 million-b/d
 excess capacity that could be available in a 90-day
 period. Algeria and the United States with 200,000
 b/d each and Indonesia and Mexico with 100,000
 b/d each account for the remainder.F--]
 30-Day Availability
 The anticipated rise in fourth-quarter demand will
 use up much of the spare capacity available within
 a 30-day period, since producers are likely to
 increase production from areas that are most acces-
 sible. According to our projections and reporting

 Other countries outside the Persian Gulf with spare
 productive capacity-Algeria, the United States,
 and Indonesia-have a total of 500,000 b/d that
 could be available with a 90-day leadtime, accord-
 ing to fourth-quarter projections. The availability
 of any of this capacity within 30 days is not known.

 Nigeria could immediately increase production to
 1.9 million b/d, according to a mid-June assess-
 ment by the US Embassy in Lagos; however,
 higher output would require three months. Because
 we project Nigerian production to rise sharply to
 about 1.6 million b/d in the fourth quarter, 30-day
 surplus capacity will slip to 300,000 b/d. This
 projection assumes that Nigeria will be producing
 Venezuela can only bring an additional 100,000
 b/d on: stream very quickly, according to informa-
 tion recently obtained from the state oil company
 by the US Embassy in Caracas. Venezuela's re-
 maining spare capacity consists of heavy crudes,
 much of which has been shut in for over a year, and
 which requires more startup time. Since we do not
 expect Venezuelan output to rise appreciably in the
 fourth quarter from recent levels of about 1.8
 million b/d, the full 100,000 b/d should still be
 available.
 Mexico could immediately increase its production
 by 100,000 b/d if circumstances warranted, ac-
 cording to a statement by the director of PEMEX
 in late June to US Embassy representatives. Addi-
 tional output would require costly investment and
 take three to five months to bring on line, according
 to the director. Because we expect Mexico to use
 this immediately available capacity in the fourth
 25X1        quarter, no additional output probably would be
 available on a 30-day basis0
 The technical capability to raise output with a 30-
 day leadtime does not ensure availability. First,.a
 producer has to be persuaded that its interests are
 served by increasing production. Perceptions that a
 disruption will be too short to warrant investment
 in reopening shut-in capacity or that greater reve-
 nues can be garnered by first letting prices rise can
 make producers reluctant to forge ahead. Political
 considerations can also come into play. For exam-
 ple, Libya might be loath to help bail out Western
 countries if Iran precipitates a major disruption.

 Reopening unused capacity rapidly also hinges on
 technical factors. The leadtime depends heavily
 upon the manner in which capacity has been shut
 in; In some cases, wells are kept in production but
 volumes are reduced by choke valves. In other
 cases, production is rotated among different sets of
 wells every few days or so. Such rotation prevents
 crude oil with corrosive contaminants from sitting
 25X1    inwell lines too long. In both cases, production
 should be able to be restored well within 30 days.
 Fields or sections of fields also are periodically shut
 in for well workovers and other maintenance.
 While such maintenance can frequently require
 more than 30 days, areas are continually being
 returned to production while others are being shut
 in., By postponing maintenance in new areas, a net
 gain in available productive capacity can be real-
 ized almost immediately.
 during downtime.
 Facilities shut in for long periods.require longer
 leadtimes to restore to production. Such facilities-
 including well lines, pumps, stabilizers, and gas-oil
 separation vessels-are often drained of corrosive
 crude and sometimes refilled with a noncorrosive
 fluid. This equipment must be drained and, in some
 cases, tested before returning to operation. The
 leadtime required would depend on manpower
 availability and the level of maintenance performed
 In extreme cases, wells are plugged with cement
 and surface facilities are removed for use else-
 where. Iran has shut in much of its capacity in this
 manner both because of lower production targets
 and to reduce the vulnerability of some areas to
 war damage. Plugged wells must be redrilled be-
 fore they can be brought back on line, and can take
 nearly as long as new wells, depending on the
 accessibility and condition of surface facilities.
 Even after considering all these factors, our esti-
 mate of the surplus available is only an indication
 because the total capacity of an oil system can
 never be known until it is tested.

 Although demand growth in the fourth quarter will

 concerning the vulnerability of the oil market to a
 major disruption in the near term remain much the
 same as at .midyear. A Persian Gulf disruption not
 involving Saudi Arabia-for example, a cutoff of
 exports from Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait affecting less
 than 4 million b/d-still could be easily offset by
 other Gulf and non-Gulf producers and stock
 draws. If Saudi shipments through the Gulf are
 also interrupted-a low probability in our view-
 capacity elsewhere could not offset the loss, and
 stock draws could not be depended upon to avoid
 price increases. F_~

 Tunisia: Dealing
 With Disparities
 A prolonged period of economic development dur-
 ing the 1970s and the highest adult-literacy rate in
 North Africa-62.5 percent-created rising popu-
 lar expectations that Tunis has been increasingly
 unable to satisfy. The bread riots in January-
 ignited by government-subsidy cuts-are a dramat-
 ic example of strains in Tunisian society. Particu-
 larly ominous for the government are the widening
 gap in urban and rural living standards and the
 increased alienation of the country's youth. F__1
 Social and Regional Problems
 The riots first erupted in the rural southern Tuni-
 sian towns, where the rise in living standards over
 the past decade has lagged that in Tunis and the
 cities of the sahel, the eastern coastal area. The
 coastal cities have benefited from the development
 of tourism, commerce, and the oil industry, while
 the south and west have suffered from the govern-
 ment's neglect of agriculture. About one-third of
 the adult males in rural areas are unemployed.
 Average income in the south is as much as 40
 percent below that of the sahel and Tunis.F--]
 This economic imbalance between the coastal cities
 and the hinterland has prompted a growing migra-
 tion to urban areas. Over half the population now
 lives in urban areas compared with only 36 percent
 in 1960. Being unskilled, rural migrants often

 Political and generational differences exacerbate
 regional economic disparities. President Bourgui-
 ba's secular, pro-Western government is dominated
 by individuals from the francophone coastal cities
 and has little popularity in the south, where French
 influence is weaker than along the coast. Moreover,
 the regime has not forgiven the south for support-
 ing Salah Ben Youssef, a pan-Arabist rival of
 Bourguiba in the 1950s. About 70 percent of all
 Tunisians are under 26, and this group is hard hit
 by unemployment. Even college graduates often
 cannot find employment commensurate with their
 education, breeding further frustration and cyni-
 cism. The Embassy reports that Tunisian youth
 regard the President with indifference, Prime Min-
 ister Mzali with contempt, and government offi-
 cials as corrupt. Few of the young join the ruling
 Destourian Party, but many are attracted by the
 Islamic fundamentalists.
 Until now, political stability under President Bour-
 guiba allowed the government to pursue a flexible,
 pragmatic approach to economic management. The
 economy began to sour in the late 1970s, when
 Tunisia's main sources of foreign exchange earn-
 ings-petroleum, tourism, phosphates, and worker
 remittances-languished as a result of the interna-

 addition to the heavy indirect cost of extensive riot-

 The government has purchased labor tranquillity at
 a high cost with wage and price policies that have
 significantly increased real incomes. As a result,
 labor has come to expect major annual pay in-

 Inability to keep the budget under control is fueling
 a steady rise in foreign borrowing. Tunisia's total
 external debt is an estimated $4.4 billion, and
 repayments consume about one-fourth of receipts
 from exports of goods and services. Embassy
 sources state that the prospect of a rapidly rising
 debt service burden is prompting some officials to
 explore the need for debt relief over the next several
 years.0
 Economic growth has been insufficient to absorb
 the 3.8-percent annual increase in the nation's
 labor force. In addition, declining demand for
 foreign labor in Europe and wealthy Arab states-
 a traditional release valve for excess Tunisian
 labor-has helped push unemployment and under-

 about 50 percent of demand, will rise further.F_
 Political Dynamics
 Tunisia's pressing social and economic problems
 are compounded by the 82-year-old President's
 chronic health problems. He is spending less time
 directing public policy, and his political acumen
 has dulled considerably. For example, the US
 Embassy reports that Bourguiba removed the bread
 subsidies because he believed people were throwing
 bread away. In addition, Bourguiba refuses to allow
 the honest elections desired by many Tunisians. F_
 According to press reports, Prime Minister Mzali's
 interest in rural development has been sidetracked
 by his ambitions to be Bourguiba's successor. In
 our view, government infighting and Mzali's lack of

 the regime's moral authority. Following the riots,

 Oil revenues will decline as export volumes fall-

 Worker remittances-which supplied $345 million

 consumer unrest. Radical elements in Tunisian

 The US Embassy in Tunis believes that the govern-

 Prime Minister Mzali's ability to balance the ex-
 pectations of Tunisia's burgeoning population, mili-
 tary modernization goals, and dwindling domestic
 resources. The gap between consumption and pro-
 duction of foodstuffs will increase unless politically
 sensitive food subsidies are trimmed and price
 controls are eliminated. This, however, would again
 push inflation to double-digit levels.
 The government would be more pressed than it was
 last January if widespread unrest recurred and will
 increasingly rely on repression to remain in power.

 India: Gandhi's
 Election-Year Economics
 Prime Minister Gandhi is trying to keep economic
 issues from becoming a major theme in the national
 elections, which must be held by January 1985.
 Her goals, in our judgment, are to hold down prices
 of key commodities and to limit unemployment in
 the preelection months. She has also moved to
 obtain the support of key groups and acquire
 campaign funds for her Congress (I) Party. Several
 programs initiated during the past year have a
 populist slant but probably do not presage a left-
 ward shift in Gandhi's policies if she wins the
 election.)
 Gandhi has moved strongly during the past year to
 control the prices of a few key consumer goods and
 ensure their availability:
 ? The government authorized an increase in domes-
 tic sales from government-owned stocks of sugar,
 even though adequate supplies of higher priced or
 lower quality sugar were available on the open
 market. This required the government to import
 sugar.
 ? Despite record rice production in 1983/84, New
 Delhi arranged for a sharp increase in rice im-
 ports. Some imports were probably necessary to
 rebuild government stocks that had been depleted
 during the 1982/83 drought, and Gandhi may
 have been concerned that security problems in
 the Punjab would curtail the current crop. The
 decision to import rice, however, was in part
 designed to influence voters in southern states,
 where consumers prefer rice to less expensive, but
 abundant, wheat.
 ? New Delhi banned, for several months in early
 1984, exports of tea varieties consumed by low-
 income voters, and renewed restrictions in Sep-
 tember. Tea exporters contend that curbs reflect
 election-year politics even though New Delhi has
 traditionally sacrificed a foreign exchange wind-
 fall rather than risk a rapid rise in agricultural
 prices at home.
 ? New Delhi also plans to import a larger quantity
 of edible oil in 1984 despite rising world prices
 and increased production.F--]
 Gandhi, however, has tolerated price hikes that are
 less visible to consumers. During the past year, she
 permitted an increase in government-monitored
 prices of key industrial goods such as coal and steel,
 and raised import duties on most commodities:
 New Delhi left the internal prices of petroleum
 products unchanged even though oil import prices
 fell.)
 Other Populist Measures
 Several policy moves reflected Gandhi's interest in
 limiting unemployment-and thus enhancing her
 public image as an advocate for the poor. In August
 1983 she announced two new programs-a supple-
 mentary rural employment scheme for landless
 laborers, and a more limited program to provide
 self-employment among educated youth. In Octo-
 ber 1983 the central government took over the
 management of 13 Bombay textile mills shut down
 by an extended strike-but did not seek a job-
 rescue effort for jute mill workers in the state of

 West Bengal, which is governed by an opposition
 political party. More recently, Gandhi ordered
 restructuring of guidelines for India's next five-
 year plan to give more emphasis to employment
 and poverty programs. F_~
 Since last January, the Congress (I) has organized
 mass meetings in several parts of the country, at
 which commercial banks distributed small loans.
 According to press reports, the Deputy Finance
 Minister threatened to punish commercial bank
 officials who refused to cooperate in lending to
 borrowers identified by party workers. While ad-
 dressing a meeting of low-caste groups, Gandhi
 even asked why banks could not write off loans to
 the poor. In our view, many borrowers will expect
 to repay loans obtained at these rallies in votes, not
 money.0
 Favors for Other Groups
 Gandhi has also adjusted policy to appease the
 middle classes. The February 1984 central govern-
 ment budget reduced income tax rates and raised
 the ceiling on salaries and benefits that private
 corporations may pay their managers. In an earlier
 effort to stimulate the electronics industry and
 benefit consumers, Gandhi lowered excise taxes on
 goods such as TV sets and reduced import duties on
 electronic components; press reports speculate that
 she hopes to expand audiences for government-
 controlled programing.F--]
 We suspect an increase in political tampering with
 administrative decisions during the past year in
 order to swing votes in key areas. Press reports
 allege, for example, that the Railway Minister has
 changed the location of some projects to favor his
 hometown. The proposed route for a $1.5 billion
 natural gas pipeline has been revised to speed
 construction of a fertilizer plant near the constitu-
 ency of Gandhi's son. Some private businessmen
 who inquired about delays in obtaining licenses to
 25X1     establish plants were reportedly told to change the
 proposed location of their factories.
 Secret
 19 October 1984
 Gandhi has exploited government authority over
 economic activity to obtain campaign funds for her
 party. Changes in purchasing procedures and sup-
 pliers suggest political intervention in a large grain
 import contract last year. Press reports speculate
 that central government intervention in a major
 corporate takeover bid was prompted in part by
 Gandhi's interest in supporting a businessman who
 is alleged to arrange payoffs on foreign contracts.
 Disgusted Indian businessmen frequently complain
 that corruption has been on the rise. F--]
 Limited Impact on Economic Liberalization
 Efforts to ease bureaucratic controls on industry
 and foreign trade stalled during the past year while
 officials were preoccupied with the forthcoming
 election and with major internal problems such as
 violence in the Punjab. Gandhi's policy advisers
 may have been especially reluctant to expose her to
 opposition party charges that Gandhi is pro-busi-
 ness or to business complaints about increased
 competition. Even in a nonelection year, however,
 we believe Gandhi might have postponed major
 economic initiatives until the benefits from earlier
 liberalization efforts and the severity of forthcom-
 ing foreign exchange constraints become clear.
 Role of the Opposition
 In our judgment, both Gandhi and the fragmented
 opposition see much more voter appeal in jobs and
 prices in the local market than in national economic
 strategy. Most opposition parties have few firm
 views about alternative policy approaches and
 could not agree among themselves if they did. A
 January 1984 meeting of several regional and left-
 of-center parties called for a total restructuring of
 central government economic policies, but proposed
 nothing that Gandhi herself does not favor.

 Secret
 Leaders of regional and Communist parties still
 accuse Gandhi of unwarranted centralization of
 power and interference in state government affairs.
 They complained bitterly when she postponed a
 reallocation of taxes and grants distributed by the
 central government, thus depriving the leftist gov-
 ernment of West Bengal of additional revenue
 during preelection months. As the election heats
 up, however, opposition parties have emphasized
 Gandhi's political sins-moves to oust state leaders,
 for example-rather than her economic measures.
 Economic Impact of Gandhi's Policies
 Gandhi's efforts to enhance her election prospects
 through economic policies have placed additional
 but manageable strains on India's budget and
 foreign payments position. India can temporarily
 afford agricultural imports to please consumers.
 The revenue loss from income tax concessions is
 negligible. Even Gandhi's employment schemes,
 however ill designed and politically motivated, at
 least address real economic needs. In the longer
 run, the massive interference of the Congress (I) in
 lending programs may prove the most irresponsible
 of Gandhi's innovations; it not only generates bad
 loans but also encourages blatant abuse of the
 commercial banking system. F--]
 Gandhi has probably not succeeded in removing
 economic issues from the campaign. Domestic
 prices of tea and unrefined sugar are still rising.
 Farmers perennially demand higher prices for their
 crops and are even more vociferous in an election
 year. Government employment schemes are too
 small to have a major impact on job opportunities
 for the vast Indian labor force. Even Gandhi's
 efforts to buy votes and obtain campaign funds
 could backfire; a recent opinion survey in northern
 India indicates strong resentment of corruption.
 Nevertheless, Gandhi's policy moves-and two
 years of good weather-have probably helped con-
 tain prices and unemployment and advance her
 election prospects. F__1
 Gandhi's coddling of consumers probably will not
 last beyond the elections. Public statements of
 senior officials, and of Gandhi herself when not
 electioneering, show increasing concern about
 shortages of foreign exchange and government
 revenue. Hence, we doubt that any new government
 would continue to splurge on imports. Guidelines
 for the next five-year plan suggest a new emphasis
 on employment, but through more intensive use of
 agricultural land and industrial plants as well as
 government job programs. F_~
