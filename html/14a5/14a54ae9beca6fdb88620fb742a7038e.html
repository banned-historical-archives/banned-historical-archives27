 THE SOVIET WORLD ------------------------------------------------
 WORLD COMMUNISM.    COMMUNIST CHINA AND THE "LIBERATION" OF ASIA - Page 5
 Mao Tse-tung's "theory of the Chinese revolution" is not
 a Chinese Communist heresy but is the official Stalinist program
 for the "liberation" of East Asia.  The Chinese Communists have
 clearly received Soviet sanction for assuming the principal role
 in Asia's "liberation."
 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST THREAT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA ----------------- Page 7
 Persistent reports of a coming Chinese Communist invasion
 of Southeast Asia emphasize the continuing vulnerability of this
 area to conquest.  There is no firm evidence that the Chinese at
 this time intend to intervene directly and in force in Indochina
 or Burma.  The Korean experience is a reminder that the Communist
 practice of assisting'irdigenous "liberation movements" by covert
 means is not inflexible.
 CAPABILITIES OF THE EUROPEAN SATELLITE ARMIES      ^------ ------ Page 9
 Combat capabilities of the Eastern European Satellite armies
 developed markedly during the past twenty months.    Their total
 strength increased from 607,500 to 895,000 and from 54+ to 65 line
 divisions.
 MERCHANT SHIPS IN THE CHINA TRADE ------------------------------ Page 12
 China's foreign commerce continues to be carried largely
 by ships of Western registry.  Recent measures to embargo ship-
 ping to, Communist China have not been fully effective because
 of failure to secure joint action by the principal Western
 maritime countries.  Communist purchase and charter of Western-
 flag vessels and the diversion of Orbit shipping to the China
 trade have also helped the Chinese counterbalance the effects
 of Western shipping controls.
 SOVIET ORBIT ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY WESTERN EXPORT CONTROL PROGRAM -Page  15
 Recent developments point to a concerted Soviet effort to
 destroy the effectiveness of the Western export control program
 and to drive.an economic wedge between the'US and its allies.
 The disruption of reestablished East-West trade patterns as a
 result of US imposed export controls has provided the Soviet
 Orbit with effective economic' warfare weapons.

 POSSIBLE NEW TROUBLE SPOTS FOR T1  BRITISH --------------------- Pagel?
 The British position in a number of areas invites attack
 from rising nationalist sentiment like that now threatening it
 in Iran and Egypt.  Over the next year or so Great Britain
 seems capable of containing such threats in its own colonial
 territories, except Hong Kong, but may encounter serious dif-
 ficulties in a number of independent countries where it has
 special interests.
 THE IRANIAN SITUATION ------------------------------------------ Page 20
 With the suspension of Anglo-Iranian negotiations, the Iranian
 Government faces increasing economic and political pressure.  Should
 the present Prime Minister withdraw or be removed in a manner which
 does not lend itself to extremist exploitation, a capable, moderate
 government might be installed.  Failure to settle the oil issue
 and the resulting political and economic deterioration would be an
 invitation to the Communists to take over.

 THE SOVIET WORLD
 With the San Francisco Conference less than a week away, Soviet
 propaganda continues to obscure Russians precise intentions when dis-
 cussion of the draft peace treaty for Japan begins.  The tone of Commu-
 nist comment,: however, is one of assurance, and contains no hint of a de-
 fensive attitude.
 Moscow originally commented that 11a1l meth of good will" desire a.
 multilateral treaty, a statement which the Liter ,r gazette expanded by
 quoting Western and Indian opinion to prove the "extreme unpopularity"
 "revival of militarist forces in Japan and the permanent US occupation
 of that countrye90
 Most Satellite commentary follows the parent line.  The Paris paper
 Fuma.nite, however, asserted that Gromyko will arrive "equipped with pro-
 posals for a veritable peace treaty," and Hungarian propaganda media
 added that Soviet participation "will turn the conference into a power-
 ful forum of the peace fight;"
 Gromyko himself, upon arriving in New York, stated only that the
 USSR has Oita own proposals," and expressed the hope that "they will be sup-
 p    dtbjk a l those who are really interested in o   0a peace treaty for
 Japan which would lay the foundation for o , . normal relations between
 Japan and other countries, especially those who suffered most from
 Japanese aggression0"v
 His statement was an obvious appeal to those Asian nations that
 will come to the conference after experiencing varying degrees of dif-
 ficulty in accepting the prindiples of the draft treaty, and, beyonO
 them, to the two Asian 'nations, India and Burma, that declined invita-
 tions.  It also was a clear indication that when the conference opens
 Gromyko will promptly bring up the question oft Chinese Communist par-
 ticipation.  It seemed highly probable that the breakdown of the Kae-
 song negotiations would be one of the most potent weapons in his arse-
 nallo
 f US policy vis-a-vis Japan.  Other Moscow comment has rejected the
 The breakdown may have been designed in part to strengthen the
 USSRas attack on the Japanese treaty draft as a cover, for US aggression
 in the Far east, since the Soviet delegates could accuse the United
 Nations in general, and the US in particular, of lacking good faith to-
 ward the Korean peace nnegotiaations o
 The talks could also hors 'been broken off as a necessary preliminary
 to placing the conference under the stress of military events.  The
 launching of a full-scale Communist offensive prior to the conference, if
 it resulted in serious setbacks to the UN forces, might supply the Soviet

 Union with an effective weapon to disrupt the program for the Japanese
 peace treaty.
 More probably, failure to reach a Korean peace settlement will be
 portrayed by the USSR as an object lesson to the conference that Far
 Eastern questions cannot be solved without being discussed in their full
 context with the participation of Communist China and North Korea,  Mos-
 cow would therefore propose that the Peiping and Pyongyang regimes be
 invited to send delegations,, and the suggestion might be revived that a
 Big Four or Big Five meeting which included Communist China should en-
 deavor to reach a general settlement.
 If Soviet proposals at San Francisco were to be rejected,, a final
 breakdown of the Kaesong talks,, to be followed by a renewed offensive
 or actual expansion of hostilities, could be timed to.coincide with a
 Soviet walkout from the conference,
 In any event,, Moscow has retained for itself almost complete free-
 dom of action.  Although probably in substantial control of decisions
 taken in Peiping and Pyongyang, the USSR enters the conference still
 technically a neutral party,  In regard to its part in the Kaesong
 negotiations, the Kremlin appears in fact to be channeling directives
 through a Soviet military mission in the area to the North Koreans.
 Thus,, the more stubborn position taken by Nam Il may, in the final'
 analysis, prove to be a more correct reflection of Soviet policy than
 that of the Chinese Communist delegates, who have maintained direct con-
 tact with Peiping.
 As the climax to the international Five Power Peace Pact signature
 campaign, the Soviet Government is finally beginning to collect signa-
 tures throughout the USSR.  Another plank in the program proposed by
 the Soviet-controlled World Peace Council last February is expected to
 find expression in an international economic conference in Moscow later
 this year.  Invitations will be issued to foreign businessmen,, with
 practical spadework for reopening East-West trade the principal purpose
 of the conference.
 A significant trend in Eastern Europe is.the continued stress on
 overcoming popular resistance and on realigning the people behind the
 Communist regimes,  Poland is the most recent Satellite to resort to the
 mass deportation of political unreliables from its capital.  The victims
 are reported to be officers of the Polish Armed Forces who were members
 of the wartime underground, relatives of political prisoners, and
 businessmen deprived of their enterprises.  Although most of.the "un-
 realiableslB are being relocated within the country, ex-members of the
 anti-Nazi underground are being moved to undetermined destinations out-
 side of Poland.

 Mao Tse-tung?s "theory of the Chinese revolution" is not a Chinese
 Communist heresy but the official Stalinist program for the "liberation"
 of East Asia.  Sino-Soviet theoretical agreement on the strategy and tactics
 to be employed in the Stalinist conquest of Asia. is demonstrated conclusively
 by the pronouncements of an international Communist conference at Peiping
 in late 1949 and by the republication of Mao?s "theory" in the Soviet
 domestic press and in the Cominform journal in the summer of 1951.  The
 Chinese Communists have clearly received Soviet sanction for assuming the
 principal role in Asia?s "liberation."
 Mac Tae-tung?as "theory" is summarized for popular consumption in
 a recent article composed by Lu Ting.-'yi, the Chinese Communist Party0s
 propaganda director,, and reprinted and implicitly endorsed by the Comin-
 form journal.  Lu takes the approved line that the Soviet October Revolu-
 tion is mankind?e greatest event and the "classic type" of revolution in
 an "imperialist" country, while the. ascendancy of the Chinese Communists
 is history?s second greatest event and the classic in a "colonial or
 semi-colonial' country.
 Lu explains that a colonial area, as a result of imperialist exploita-
 tion and oppression, is necessarily backward and ill-prepared to struggle
 against the ruthless and well-armed imperialist enemy and his local lackeys.
 Lu asserts that it was Mao Tse-tung who showed Asian "liberation" movements
 how to win against such heavy odds.
 Lu?s article re eats Mac?a own definition of the "essence" of Ohineee
 Communist suooessa  (l) the creation of a disciplined Communist Party
 "armed with the theory" of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stal inj (2) the organiza-
 tion of armed forces controlled by the Party and possessing a territorial
 base and (3) the formation of a "united front of all revolutionary strata."
 With the achievement of national power through military action, this move-
 ment establishes a "people's demooratio dictatorship led by the working
 clans," and this dictatorship "unites with all international revolutionary
 fosses."
 In other words, Maas?s program envisages the leadership of the revolu-
 tion by an orthodox Stalinist Party, relying primarily upon its armed
 forces and willing to work temporarily with all disaffected elements
 of society, The state established by this movement is to be an orthodox
 Stalinist dictatorship by the Party, which by definition is the "most
 advanced" segment of the "working claas*A" even when its members, as in
 China, are predominantly of peasant origin, This state uses the
 bourgeoisie for its purposes for an indefinite period9 but emphatically

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/18: CIA-RDP79SO1 060A0001 00100001 -3
 discredits the concept of "bourgeois democracy."  Finally, this state is
 to be allied with, and in international affairs subservient tog the
 Soviet Union.  Mao?s "theory of the Chinese revolution" is thus an act of
 assent in the Stalinist capture and perversion of genuine revolutionary
 movements in Asia.
 International Communist strategy., was publicly outlined in an
 International Communist conference at Peiping in November 1949.  That
 strategy, recommending Chinese` Communist tactics for liberation movements
 throughout Asia, divided Asian countries into three blocs.  Bloc I comprises
 countries or areas under Communist control, regarded as "base areas"' for
 future comapigns8 Communist China and North Korea,  Bloc II includes
 countries judged vulnerable to Communist conquests South Korea, Indochina,
 Thailand, Indonesia, Malaya and the Philippines.  The Bloc III countries
 are those in which Communist victory is recognized as far distant.: India,
 Pakistan,'Japan and Burma.  This grouping should probably now be altered
 to place the Viet Minh in Bloc I and Burma in Bloc II.
 The Peiping conference statement assigns to the Bloc I 'dbase areas"
 theiask of assisting, by all practic able means, the Bloc II 4liberation?
 movements.  In the Bloc II countries, Communist-led military operations
 are given the highest priority.  Bloc III nations are scheduled for the
 early stages of political division and isolation, rather than for conquest
 by either internal or external military forces.  The conference statement
 leaves obscure the question of whether the armed forces of the "bass areas"
 would directly support each other or the "liberation' movements of Bloc`II.
 The Korean Communist invasion of South Korea in June 1950 was not
 technically an alteration of the November 1949 strategy, as North Korean
 forces could be regarded as an indigenous 'liberation' movement engaged
 in the first phase of the revolutionary effort, the struggle for total
 military  power in a single country.  Neither did Communist China?s inter-
 vention in Korea in late 1950 necessarily indicate that international
 Communism had abandoned its policy of placing primary reliance upon native
 Communist forces.  These developments made clear, however,. that the strategy
 permitted the provision of direct military support by Bloc I countries to
 "liberation?' movements of Bloc II countries suffering serious reverses or
 in danger of extinction, and raised the possibility of outright military
 aggression by Bloc 'I countries.  In any case, the leading role in East
 Asia devolved upon Communist China.
 It has thus been apparent for some time that Asian governments contiguous
 to Communist China would be obliged indefinitely to resist strong diplomatic
 pressure from Peiping, intensive Chinese Communist-subversive activities,
 and substantially Chinese-supported native ?8liberation" movements.  The more
 ominous possibility was and is that of a Chinese Communist invasion of
 Southeast Asia.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST THREAT TO SaJTHEAST ASIA

 The 200,000 Red Chinese troops within striking distance of the Indochina
 border are capable of inteening decisively against French-Vietnamese
 forces in Tonkin] and the 30,000 Or more now assembled along the Since
 Burmese frontier can easily destroy the defense forces in northern Burman
 Although there are no firm indications of an imminent Communist drive to
 the south, the Commu.riists maintain the capability of overrunning in a short
 time most of the Asian mainland,
 Thus far, Communist China u s involvement in the Southeast Asian power
 struggle has been almost entirely indirect and covert..  Aid to the rebel
 regime of Ho Chi Minh in Indochina has included the training in China of
 possibly 30,000 of Hoes troops, the provision of large amounts of arms
 and ammdnition, and the loan of an estimated 10,000 advisers and tech-
 nicians.  Less evident, but no less ,ominous, is the Chinese ,Communist

 preparing to penetrate northern Burma., Taos, and, finally, Thai.land6
 Military penetration of the last country is allegedly to be undertaken
 to eliminate a supply base of the Chinese Nationalist forces recently
 defeated by the Communists in Y nana  Even though Chinese Communists
 might have only limited present objectives 9 the temptation to press
 their gains would be strong once they were committed to overt action,
 Peiping and Moscow propaganda has frequently called attention to
 the activities of the French "imperialistsg"in Indochina and thus pre-
 pared a pretext for entry into that country.  In addition, three routes
 of access to Indochina have been fairly well developed.
 A pretext is likewise provided for entry into Burma by the presence
 of remnants of the--defeated -Chinese Nationalists, who the Communists
 charge were armed grid sent into Yunnan under Western directian.  It is

 CAPABILITIES OF THE EUROPEAN SATELLITE ARMIES
 Combat capabilities of Eastern European Satellite armies developed
 markedly during the past twenty months.  During this period., their total
 strength increased from 6079500 to 8959 0OIT`and from 54 to 65 line divisions.
 Intensification of training in Soviet tactics and ideology, reorganiza-
 tion to conform to the Soviet pattern, the presence of large numbers of
 Soviet advisers., and accelerated deliveries of Soviet materiel are steadi-
 ly bringing all of the Satellite armies., except the Albanian., closer to
 combat readiness.
 This process., which would better enable them to conduct coordinated
 operations by themselves or in support of Soviet units, now approaches
 completion only in Bulgaria and Rumania.  The organization of tank and
 mechanized divisions, the lack of defensive fortifications, and the
 nature of the training program indicate that the present military ex-
 pansion program is primarily for offensive purposes.
 The rate of Sovietization and expansion of Satellite armies ap-
 parently is governed by the degree of political reliability of each states
 and does not in itself reveal plans for war against any specific country.
 The current stress on the reorganization and reequipment of the Satellite
 armies strongly indicates preparations for eventual rather than imminent
 hostilities.
 The effectiveness of the Satellite armies will continue to increase
 throughout 1951 with the formation of possibly eight additional divisions
 for a total of 73.  At the current rate of expansion it is estimated
 that all the Eastern European armies, except that of Albania, will have
 completed their expansion and Sovietization programs by the end of 1953.
 At that time Satellite armies may total 115 to 117 line divisions, some
 of them armored or mechanized, totaling 1,500,000 men under arms and with
 additional trained reserves.
 The Satellite military picture looks as followed
 Bulgaria
 Bulgaria currently possesses the best trained army of all the Eastern
 European Satellites.  It is composed of 165,000 men, organized into 13
 line divisions, two of which are tank divisions.  A historic orientation
 toward Russia, and repeated postwar purges have made the Bulgarian Army
 relatively amenable to Soviet direction.  The advanced state of its train-
 ing, including army level:.maneuvers, as well as its nearly complete rem
 equipment with Soviet arms, gives the Bulgari4n Army a high degree of

 combat readiness.  Two additional divisions may be added this year.
 Bulgaria is the only Satellite with major troop.-;concentrations on the
 Yugoslav border,
 &Mania
 The Rumanian Army comprises 13 line divisions of 230,,000 men,  It
 is generally considered second to Bulgaria in degree of Sovietization,
 and probably has attained a relatively advanced 'state of combat readiness.
 Except for Bulgaria, Rumania was the only Satellite where the building
 of an effective army was well under way prior to 1950.  Reports indicate
 that throughout 1949 and 1950 new units were being established, training
 in Soviet doctrine was being intensified,, and a continuous flow of Soviet
 equipment was arriving in Rumania,
 The Rumanian Army?s mec~anized equipment is now believed-to be al
 most totally of Soviet origin, except for its motor transport, which is
 Czechoslovak.  Upon the completion of the 1951 training,,-the army will
 be capable of offensive operations.  At the present rate, the expansion
 program will have been completed by the spring of 1953, and the army will
 probably consist of 18 to 20 divisions,
 Hun ar
 The Hungarian Army in less than one year has expanded from 359000"to
 1009000 men and from three to nine divisions.  Corps headquarters,,, which
 will, enable the high command better to utilize existing troop strength,
 have been established.  In addition to its great expansion,, reorganiza-
 tion along Soviet lines., an accelerated training program, and increasing
 availability of Soviet, equipment are all contributing to a marked im-
 provement in Hungarian Army capabilities,
 The training of large numbers of signal,, anti-aircraft, and engineer-
 ing troops indicates an effort to create an army of relatively high tecbmi-
 cal skill.  Combat effectiveness has improved rapidly since the expansion
 program started in October 1950, and an intensification of the program
 could make the Hungarian Army capable of joining in joint Satellite-Soviet
 combat operations by the end.of this year.  It is estimated that the cur-
 rent expansion program will be completed by the end of 1952,, when the
 &-my will consist of 12 divisions,
 Czechoslovakia
 The Czechoslovak Army includes 10 line divisions,, embracing 15c5,000
 men,   It is a second-rate army hampered by poor morale,, the absence of
 strong leadership, lack of standardization, obsolescence of equipment,

 and questionable reliability.  Its incomplete reorganization to conform
 to the Soviet pattern., and its only rudimentary training in Soviet tactics,
 would render the Czechoslovak Army ineffectual in Joint operations at this
 time.
 Any appreciable expansion of the Czechoslovak Army would be at the
 expense of industrial and military production., since the economy is al-
 ready suffering from a manpower shortage,  The present army is incapable
 of successful aggressive action and it is unlikely that it would be en-
 trusted with any major combat assignment..   It is estimated that two more
 divisions will be added this year and an additional six by the end of,
 1953, at which time the current expansion program will have been com-
 pleted.
 ola.
 It is currently estimated that the Polish Army is composed of 200,000
 men., comprising 16 line divisions, a figure which may be increased to 18
 this year and to 22 by the end of 1952.  The reorganization of the army
 closely follows the Soviet pattern; four corps headquarters were newly
 identified during 1951, and four infantry divisions were converted to
 Soviet-type mechanized divisions.  Of the 16 divisions, an estimated six
 have been effectively trained in Soviet tactical doctrine and furnished
 with Soviet equipment.  By the and of 1951 limited offensive capabili-
 ties are expected, provided that the soviet Union continues to give large-
 scale logistic support,
 Albania
 The Albanian Army consists of 45,000 men organized in four divisions.
 It is being trained as a defensive force and remains weak because of poor
 leadership, low morale, and questionable loyalty.  Its present hetero-
 geneous collection of equipment is gradually being replaced by Soviet
 materiel.  It is incapable of launching a successful attack against any
 of its neighbors.

 Communist Chinas dependence on Western-flag shipping to transport her
 foreign commerce constitutes a major vulnerability that has thus far been
 only partly exploited by the West.                                vessels in
 the China and Yellow Seas last Februarys considered typical of recent months,
 about two thirds were identified as Western=flag ships.  The remainder were
 largely of unidentified registtyy only five per cent were known to be Soviet
 or Satellite.
 Current figures show no decline in the number of Western=flag ships in
 the China trade.  In June 19519 over Z50 vessels of 19000 tons or more, total-
 ling about 1.3 million gross tons, were engaged in the China trade (that is,
 called or were scheduled to call at a Chinese Communist port or at Hong Kong,
 which has served as an important transshipment point for goods going to the
 Communist mainland).  These figures approximate those of the preceding month
 and are in excess of those of earlier months of the year.  Preliminary esti-
 mates for July and early August indicate Western-flag tonnage in the China
 trade at approximately the June level.
 British-flag vessels in this trade are more numerous than those of any
 other nationality.  Panamanian-flag vessels, the next largest category, have
 figured prominently in recent months, their number more than doubling during
 the year ending in June.  British and Panamanian vessels combined have con-
 stituted the majority of the ships in the China trade.
 American-flag ships, which were about as numerous as the British in
 trade with mainland China when the Nationalists were in control,, have been
 forbidden to call at any Chinese Communist port since December of last year.
 With continued access to ships of other Western registry, the Communists
 have not been effectively handicapped by American shipping controls.  Recently,
 however, there have been further Western restrictions on ships in the China  -
 trade. A Pauamaniaz,decree of 18 August 1951 forbids Panamanian-flag ships
 from calling at Chinese Communist ports.  Still more recently, the Costa
 Rican Government cancelled the registry of a tanker en route with a load of
 kerosene to China.
 In an effort to meet their shipping requirements, the Chinese Communists
 have followed an active policy of purchasing or chartering Western-flag ves-
 sels.  Some of the recent acquisitions are ships which formerly carried
 Chinese Nationalist registry and then transferred to Panamanian registry
 after the Nationalists withdrew from the mainland.

 The decree forbidding Panamanian-flag ships from calling at Chinese; ,
 Conist ports will probably force a modification of some of the methods
 of concealing ownership.  Recent reports indicate that shipowners plan to
 transfer their vessels from Panamanian to other registry.  It is expected
 that new firms will replace the old 60paper' Panamanian corporations,
 The USSR has attempted to supplement the limited facilities of the
 Chinese Communists by increasing its own shipping in Far East waters.  In
 November 19509 Soviet merchant shipsq which had discontinued calls at Chinese
 ports at the outbreak of the Korean conflict, resumed voyages to Chino  In
 additionq the Soviets have chartered Western-flag ships., being reimbursed in
 turn by the Chinese for the coats of charter.
 Soviet commitments to step asp sharply the delivery of petroleum to China
 have resulted in active efforts recently to charter Western-flag tankers.
 The two Western tankers no far chartered this year may be withdrawn from
 their contracts if US pressure i$ successful.  Despite all obstructions,, the
 USSR is continuing its efforts to charter other tanker tonnages
 The Eat European Satellites have also been active in chartering Western-
 flag ships. for the China trade.  The Poles,, in addition- have been able to
 assign soma of their own ocean-g.ing fleet to the Far East,  The present
 ability of the Chinese to count on Polish shipping may enable them to lift a
 cargo of rubber from Ceylon which Western shipowners'had refused to handle.,,
 Although Polish ships en route to China are being handicapped by the refusal
 of oil companies at intermediate ports to supply bunkers, the Poles are making
 persistent efforts to overcome this difficulty.
 Although assured of cooperation from other Communist countries., China
 is largely dependent on Western shipping    a vulnerability which has not
 been effectively exploited by the West because of the failure io secure
 joint action by the principal maritime countries.  The withdrawal of US
 vessels from trade with mainland China did not effectively handicap the
 Communists., who had continued access to British and Panamanian ships,  Pan-
 ama?s decree will be largely circumvented by the transfer of Panamanian-flag
 vessels to other registry.  British merchant ships,, free from official re-
 striotion9 continue to call at Chinese Communist ports.

 SOVIET ORBIT ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY WESTERN EXPORT CONTROL PROGRAM
 At the current UN=sponsored East-West trade meeting in Geneva the
 Soviet Union has intensified its efforts to break up the Western export
 control program by demanding strategic commodities in exchange for
 materials sorely needed by Western Europe,  The USSR has already proposed
 in Geneva a revival of the 1949-1950 pattern of East-West trade,  The
 Soviet Orbit is offering coal, grain and timber for traditional imports
 from Western Europe which include a wide variety of strategic items on
 Western embargo lists.
 Evidence is available that Soviet efforts to split the West on the
 export control program might meet with some success,  The Western Euro-
 pean countries are showing signs of increasing restiveness under Ura;'o
 pressure for greater restrictions on strategic exports to the Orbit.
 Although trade with the Orbit amounted to.only 303 percent of Western
 Europe?s overall international trade in 1950,, the commodities involved
 (grain and coal) are much more important than this figure would indi-
 cate.  The newly imposed restrictions are disturbing historic trade
 patterns which were again forming under Western Europe's postwar eco-
 nomic rehabilitation under the Marshall Plan.
 The US observer at the Geneva meeting considers that close col-
 laboration among the Western countries is highly desirable in order to
 avoid the danger of blackmail inherent in the Soviet position, which
 bears the earmarks of a major Soviet trade and propaganda offensive,
 The Russians have mounted a heavy propaganda campaign charging the US-
 with erecting artificial East-West trade barriers which are disrupting
 the normal flow of world commerce in order to build up a militarized
 economy of scarcity.  This theme fits into the overall :Soviet Peace
 Campaign.
 The Satellites rather than the Soviet Union have borne the chief
 burden of the shortages resulting from the US sponsored embargo which
 has resulted in a widespread resort to clandestine trade.  The Orbit
 has apparently' been able to procure some of the strategic items it needs
 via covert channels, but only at exorbitant cost and great effort,
 The Soviet block in addition has used items in short supply in
 Western Europe as a bargaining weapon in trade negotiations.  The most
 specutacular example of hard trade bargaining by the Orbit has been
 Poland's exploitation of its coal surplus in negotiations with coal-
 hungry Western European countries.  The Polish trade agreement with
 Austria was made contingent upon continuing Austrian deliveries of

 substantial amounts of ball bearings on the Western embargo list.  Polish-
 Norwegian trade negotiations broke down recently because of excessive
 Polish demands for strategic goods in return for coal.  Current Swiss
 trade talks with Poland are in difficulties over Polish insistence on the
 exchange by Switzerland of large quantities of ball bearings and aluminum
 for coal and foodstuffs.  Poland is reluctant to deliver coal and coke
 to Finland because of the latter?s refusal to import aluminum and cobalt
 for resale to Poland.
 The usefulness of coal as a bargaining weapon against Western Europe
 is indicated by the fact that during 1950 some 8.5 million tons were ex-
 ported to Western Europe at a total value of approximately 112 mission
 dollars.  Since then the European rearmament effort has increased that
 regionQ.s need for coal without a corresponding growth of the available
 supply,  Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the
 Scandinavian countries will most quickly feel the pinch of curtailed
 coal exports from the Orbit,
 Eastern Europe has traditionally been an exporter of foodstuffs.,'
 and specifically grain.  This is another potent weapon in its economic
 arsenal against Western trade controls.  England, Belgium and The Nether-
 lands  are primarily susceptible to the use of food as an economic weapon
 against Western Europe.  The Soviet bloc has thus far been non-commital
 at the current East-West trade meeting as to the overall amount of grain
 available for export to Western Europe.  Soviet representatives pre-
 viously asserted that the USSR would be able to export 1.5 to 2 million
 tons of grain annually for 'a period of five years.  The favorable crop
 prospects throughout Eastern Europe should currently give the Soviet
 Orbit at least this capability..
 Differences of opinion on dealing with the Soviet bloc have already
 appeared at the current East-West trade negotiations.  A redirection of
 Western European trade away from the Soviet Orbit is opQn to serious
 economic and political doubts.

 THE IRANIAN SITUATION
 The breakdown of the Anglo-Iranian negotiations on 23 August was
 caused-in large part by Prime Minister Mossadeq's fear of extremist re--
 action, coupled with his .conviction that a British-controlled agency
 operating in Iran would exert undue influence in internal affairs.
 The Iranians may also have been influenced by a belief that the United
 s would eventually come to their aid by providing personnel to oper-
 ate the oil industry.
 While there is some sentiment in Iran for a negotiated settlement,
 nationalism is still in control;,., There is no indication that the'present
 government will become more yielding on the oil issue at any early date.
 M.ossadeq s i ntransioence on the oil issue has, for the time being,
 assured him of popular support.  The government's position; however, will
 weaken as political and economic pressures intensify.  Revenues from the
 oil industry constituted about forty percent of the government's annual
 income.- There is no adequate long-range substitute for this source t:  the
 government is' not likely to find either sufficient foreign technicians
 or adequate transportation facilities in the West to operate the industry
 at anywhere near past levels. -For the present, the government will not
 be inclined to seek or to accept Soviet help in operating the oil instal--
 lations, but may modify this attitudex,as internal pressures build up...
 Breakdown of the discussions will encourage those who have been
 working to remove Mossadeq and to install a new government headed by
 Seyyid Z3aj. either of whom would Presumably be more ame-

 it is quite

 from internal or ' etern$l pressure.
 The UK has indicated that it does not intend to use military force
 to retain the oil properties.  The British Government, however, is under
 pressure from the public and from the opposition to take a firm line,,,
 and it cannot be assumed that the British would not consider drastic ac-
 tion before accepting outright Iranian confiscation.
 Any effort to install a government recognized by the Iranians as
 more amenable to settling the oil dispute would be followed by widespr
 internal disturbances.  Any British display of strength in the Persian

 Gulf or an ostentatious readiness to apply military force is also likely
 to aggravate the situation.  British effort to use military force to pro-
 tect its nationals in the oil fields would be considered armed invasion
 by the Iranians.
 Should the present Prime Minister resign or be removed in a manner
 which does not lend itself to extremist exploitation.,, a more neutral
 government supported by the Shah and by the more moderate elements might
 be achieved.  Such a government would have to give considerable lip ser-
 vice to nstior lism and would have to be able to adopt a tough policy
 against the extremists.  Aged ex-Prime Minister Ahmed Qavamj, an astute
 and able politician,, might be the man to step into the breech,  His long-
 standing bitter quarrel with the Shah., however., provides an almost insur-
 mountable block.
 Unless the oil issue is settled in the relatively near future, there
 is a very grave possibility that the internal situation in Iran will de-
 teriorate to the extent that the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party will succeed in
 establishing a Communist-influenced or Communist-controlled government in
 Tehran.  Such a development would encourage widespread tribal revolt., es-
 pecially in the southwest, where influential Bakhtiari and Qa.shgai chief-
 tains., presumably counting on British support,,, would probably attempt to
 establish an independent state.
