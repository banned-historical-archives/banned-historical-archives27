 record performance, but slow progress on inflation and employment will
 make overall improvements in living standards difficult to achieve.
 With the 1981-85 economic plan finally in place, Beijing is focusing mainly
 on improving efficiency and energy conservation. The central leadership
 will have to maintain steady pressure to implement its economic plan
 goals-especially industrial growth and energy efficiency targets-in the
 midst of a far-reaching government reorganization. Planners have tight-
 ened central control over energy use, investment, and enterprise finances in
 an effort to avoid the unplanned fluctuations that have plagued the
 industrial sector for the past two years.
 The foreign trade sector will be boosted by a planned 40-percent increase
 in imports. We believe that declining world prices for oil and the possibility
 of a drop in domestic oil production will strengthen China's interest in
 acquiring US energy technology to support additional oil production
 capacity; oil exports account for 20 percent of China's foreign exchange
 earnings. Despite currently large foreign exchange reserves and planned
 slow growth of exports, falling oil revenues may lead the Chinese to try to
 boost exports of other goods to the United States and elsewhere as the year
 progresses.
 Beijing's planned record imports and current focus on energy problems
 should create opportunities for US exporters to expand sales of machinery
 and technology. China's imports of US agricultural goods probably will
 decline, however, especially if the textile dispute remains unresolved.
 Overall, US-China trade is likely to be down, and the trend toward a more
 even balance between US and Chinese exports should continue.

 China: Economic
 Outlook for 1983
 The Economy in 1982
 Preliminary data indicate that the Chinese economy
 grew by about 7 percent in 1982, substantially ex-
 ceeding plans for the year. Beijing was pleased with
 performance in the agricultural and foreign trade
 sectors (see table). However, the degree of overfulfill-
 ment of plans for investment and heavy industrial
 production underlined the continuing difficulties that
 central planners have in forecasting and controlling
 production and spending by local authorities.
 Figure 1
 Chinese Industrial Production, 1980-838
 500
 For the third successive year, investment ran far
 ahead of the annual plan. Total investment reached
 81 billion yuan, several billion yuan more than the
 1982 plan and 14.2 billion more than in 1981.'
 Demand for capital goods therefore rose sharply, and
 production in heavy industry overall was up by 9.3
 percent (figure 1). Following 1981's unplanned 4.7-
 percent decline, the 1982 plan target for heavy indus-
 try had been set at a low, I-percent rate of growth to
 encourage managers to focus on improving efficiency
 and reducing energy and raw materials consumption.
 Beijing may have raised the heavy industry target
 later in the year after recognizing that the 1-percent
 increase was inconsistent with investment needs.
 Demand for machinery in such key sectors of the
 economy as energy, agriculture, transportation, and
 construction rose sharply, however, boosting activity
 in the machine-building industry. Total machinery
 production rose by 15.9 percent, considerably more
 than the planned 5 percent. Output of power-generat-
 ing equipment was up by 20.2 percent, mining equip-
 ment by 16.6 percent, locomotives and freight wagons
 by over 20 percent, and walking tractors by 46.2
 percent. To support new construction efforts, cement
 output rose by 13.5 and plate glass by 16.5 percent.
 Chemical and metal production also increased and
 rolled steel production was up by 8.6 percent.
 The 1982 plan called for investment in capital construction to
 reach 44.5 billion yuan; actual spending was 54.5 billion. No plan
 target is available for total investment, but we presume-on the
 basis of the capital construction data-that total investment ex-
 ceeded the plan by about 10 billion yuan.

 In response to strong demand from factories in the
 heavy industrial sector, coal output rose significantly
 in late 1981 and early 1982, but output leveled off
 later in the year. With crude oil output stagnating,
 total energy production for the year was up by 3.8
 percent (figure 2). Energy shortages were especially
 severe in key industrial centers in the east and
 northeast, and the State Council announced that it
 would close plants where energy use was especially
 wasteful and impose tighter restrictions on power use.
 Light industrial production was the major exception
 to the pattern of overfulfillment in 1982. Output was
 up by 5.6 percent, less than the planned 7 percent and
 the slowest growth in over five years.

 bProjected figures.
 The State Council early in the year ordered cutbacks
 in the production of consumer durables outside the
 plan. Attracted by initially strong demand and the
 prospect of quick profits, numerous factories had
 shifted to the production of bicycles, radios, televi-
 sions, and other popular consumer durables. But
 many of these factories turned out low-quality goods
 that consumers refused to buy, and inventories piled
 up. Partly because of the State Council's actions, by
 yearend the output of radio sets had dropped by
 58 percent, and television production-which had
 been increasing at extremely rapid rates in recent
 years-was up by only 3.9 percent. Output of some
 other consumer durables nevertheless continued their
 rapid increases; the production of bicycles, for exam-
 ple, was up by 37.6 percent, and that of washing
 machines by 96.4 percent. Total cloth production rose
 by 5.9 percent, but cloth made with chemical fibers
 was down by 14.8 percent.
 Agriculture had an excellent year, with new records
 set for grain and most other crops. Meat and aquatic
 production edged up, and total agricultural output-
 including commune and brigade industry-was up by
 7 percent. The continuing success of its new agricul-
 tural policies led Beijing late in the year to announce
 a decision to begin dismantling the commune system.
 The communes, which combine government and eco-
 nomic functions, have been the centerpiece of China's
 rural development strategy for 25 years. They are now
 viewed as too large and inefficient to play a useful role
 under Beijing's increasingly market-oriented agrarian
 policies.
 Beijing's persistent budget deficit continued in 1982.
 Continuing cutbacks in state operations kept expendi-
 tures well below the peak levels of 1979-80, while
 revenues stagnated (see table). We estimate that the
 1982 deficit reached 9.2 billion yuan, triple the
 officially announced figures of 3.0 billion but less than
 half 1979's deficit of 20.7 billion yuan. The deficit
 was financed by increasing currency in circulation
 and by the sale of 4.2 billion yuan in domestic bonds
 and 5 billion yuan in foreign loans.
 Recent improvements in cash incomes-which Deng
 Xiaoping and his supporters expect to bolster their
 political position-have been partly eroded by infla-
 tion, and consumers are highly sensitive to further
 price increases. Unemployment, which may have risen
 in 1982, remains a problem in urban areas and is
 rising in the countryside as well.
 Foreign exchange holdings rose to about $10 billion
 on the strength of a record $6 billion trade surplus.
 Imports declined for the second straight year to about
 $16 billion, largely reflecting cutbacks in Chinese
 orders for machinery and equipment and industrial
 raw materials (figure 3). Exports were up by
 1 percent-the smallest gain in seven years-as sag-
 ging world demand kept textile exports down. Oil
 revenues were up by only 2 percent.
 The 1983 Plan
 Growth targets have been kept moderate (by past
 Chinese standards) to allow managers to focus on
 improving energy efficiency and productivity in the
 industrial sector (see table for details).

 ? Overall industrial production is to rise by 4 percent,
 the same target as in 1982, with heavy industry up
 by 3 percent. Steel production will be cut to help
 reduce inventories. This year's 5-percent growth
 target for light industry is the smallest increase
 planned for that sector since 1976.
 ? Energy production is to continue its slow growth in
 1983, with coal-the energy industry's mainstay-
 up by only 3 percent. Beijing anticipates a slight
 decline in oil output.

 growth overall. Grain and cotton-which had rec-

 remain at about the same level as in 1982. This
 implies that more rapid growth is planned for other
 economic crops, livestock production, and rural
 industry.
 ? In 1983 the budget will be in deficit for the fifth
 consecutive year. Expenditures are to increase by
 12.5 billion yuan to a near-record 126.2 billion
 yuan. To keep central revenues up, Beijing is taking
 back some revenue sources-profits and taxes-that
 it had previously given the provinces, and the gov-
 ernment will continue borrowing to finance part of
 the deficit and absorb excess purchasing power.

 ? Investment is to be cut by 8 percent, to 74.7 billion
 yuan. Budgeted capital construction expenditures
 are to be up by 12 percent, to 26.1 billion yuan; local
 spending from retained funds and other sources,
 which has been a major cause of the investment
 boom, is to be cut sharply.
 ? After two years of cutbacks, the 1983 plan calls for
 nearly a 40-percent increase in imports. The in-
 crease-to a record level of about $22 billion-will
 be led by imports of industrial raw materials,
 machinery, and technology. Exports are planned to
 rise by only 1 percent.
 Prospects for 1983 Economic Performance
 Beijing's most difficult task, this year as last, will be
 getting industrial managers and local officials to
 implement the plan in the midst of ongoing political
 and economic reorganization. In some cases the plan's
 targets-especially those calling for slower industrial
 growth and more carefully targeted investment-are
 contrary to the interests of local authorities. The
 center is likely to find it particularly difficult to cut
 back local investment spending, which in turn would
 continue to boost heavy industry's production and
 energy demand. Still, Beijing has tightened its control
 over some key economic planning levers, including
 energy use, investment, and finance, and may have
 improved its chances of avoiding the mistakes of
 1981-82.
 Planners are paying especially close attention this
 year to investment spending, which was far above
 target in 1981 and 1982. This year's total is planned
 to be smaller and directed more to key centrally
 approved projects. Beijing's Capital Construction
 Bank is to more closely monitor investment spending
 by local authorities and factories, but it is uncertain
 whether its staff has sufficient authority and experi-
 ence to keep spending under control. Economic man-
 agement reforms to improve efficiency will be extend-
 ed on a limited basis, but large-scale price
 readjustments and other needed broad reforms will
 not be attempted this year because of continuing
 political opposition.
 The planned growth target for heavy industry appears
 within reach, but the Chinese must continue to make
 substantial improvements in energy conservation.
 They are aware of energy's crucial role-as indicated
 by the large share of investment going to energy
 production and the leadership's stress on energy con-
 servation-but we believe they will have difficulty
 meeting their goals. We estimate that achieving the
 1983 targets will require a 3.1-percent rate of energy
 savings, following a substantial decline in 1982. Bei-
 jing will find it increasingly difficult to improve
 energy efficiency; previous gains were based partly on
 one-time adjustments from wasteful energy practices,
 and political obstacles prevent planners from reducing
 energy demand by raising energy prices to world
 market levels.
 How well Beijing controls the growth and mix of
 heavy industrial production will largely determine the
 degree of success in meeting energy conservation and
 efficiency goals in 1983. Because heavy industry
 appears to have caused planners the most trouble in
 1981-82, it will probably be monitored carefully to see
 that it stays on track. Enterprises will face even
 stricter rationing of energy than last year and tighter
 control over working capital, product quality, and
 costs. Plant closings and management demotion are
 threatened for the most inefficient firms. Neverthe-
 less, we have so far seen little indication that the
 central authorities are prepared to enforce their direc-
 tives with concrete action.
 Prospects for energy production depend mainly on
 coal, which accounts for over two-thirds of primary
 energy. Transport shortages will keep coal supplies
 tight. Onshore oil production is being maintained at
 just over 100 million tons per year by the use of
 increasingly expensive recovery methods. With off-
 shore production not scheduled to come on stream
 until later in this decade, we expect total oil produc-
 tion will drop-perhaps beginning this year-as the
 payoff from the intensive onshore recovery methods
 declines.
 This year's planned slowdown in light industry should
 provide an opportunity for producers of consumer
 goods to adjust their output to market demand. The
 seller's market that existed in 1979-80, when consum-
 ers hungrily snapped up anything that came into the

 store, has since become a buyer's market. In large
 urban areas, particularly, people want up-to-date
 styles and good-quality merchandise, and bank their
 money rather than buy unfashionable and shoddy
 items. This has led to a sharp rise in inventories of
 unsalable goods. Ironically, the growing selectivity of
 urban consumers and the slow growth in their real
 incomes may force manufacturers and retail mer-
 chants to seek new markets and accomplish what
 Beijing has been trying to do all along-increase the
 share of goods going to rural areas, where both the
 quantities and varieties of consumer goods are still
 extremely limited.
 The replacement of communes by village cooperatives
 is unlikely to have much effect on agricultural produc-
 tion in 1983. The change will be implemented experi-
 mentally at first, and agricultural responsibility sys-
 tems-under which individuals or groups exercise
 greater control over production-are already in place
 in most areas. According to the Chinese press, the
 new, freer agricultural policies have encouraged a
 shift away from grain production to more profitable
 crops; Beijing will attempt to keep grain acreage up
 this year.
 Living standards should improve more slowly than in
 past years. The leadership expects plant managers to
 hold wage increases below gains in productivity, and
 efforts to enforce this rule should have some impact.
 However, because of the bonus system and the ten-
 dency of managers to give in to workers' demands, we
 believe Beijing will have great difficulty controlling
 wages. Other factors that will moderate real income
 growth include: inflationary pressures, which remain
 strong; and unemployment rates, which will stay in
 the neighborhood of 10 percent because of the large
 number of new entrants to the labor force.
 With foreign exchange reserves at record levels, Bei-
 jing is in a good position to expand imports of
 industrial raw materials, equipment, and technology.
 With exports set to increase by only 1 percent, trade
 should be near balance in 1983 if oil revenues do not
 decline too sharply. The Chinese have announced that
 they will seek foreign credits-especially long-term,
 low interest loans-and that the Bank of China will
 begin extending export credits to promote sales of
 Chinese machinery and ships. These moves and the
 planned import surge indicate that in 1983 Beijing is
 again encouraging a large Western role in its modern-
 ization program.
 US firms should gain in 1983 from sales of fertilizer,
 machinery, and technology. US exports of agricultur-
 al goods and synthetic fibers to China, however, have
 been declining because of increasing domestic produc-
 tion and high US prices. China's criticism of recent
 US textile restrictions has probably had little impact
 on bilateral trade to date. If the issue remains unre-
 solved, however, sales of US agricultural products
 could be adversely affected later this year.
