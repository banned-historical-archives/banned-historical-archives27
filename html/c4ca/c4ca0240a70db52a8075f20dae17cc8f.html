 National foreign intelligence products are frequently judged by policymakers
 using the criteria of quality, timeliness, utility and relevance. This suggests that a
 product's value is assessed with favor when future events are predicted with
 reasonable accuracy; or, as a minimum, when policymaking officials are provided
 with insights, gained through intelligence sources and methods, that enable them to
 better understand and deal with dynamic or complex situations. Events surrounding
 the political succession in China following the deaths of Premier Chou En-lai and
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung have been cited as an instance in which the Community
 failed to meet these criteria due to analytical shortcomings.
 This study was conducted to assess the Intelligence Community's political
 reporting on China; however, the focus has been narrowed to allow in-depth
 examination of intelligence sources and methods applied to one aspect of political
 reporting: the political fortunes of two Chinese leaders between 1965 and 1975,
 notably:
 ? The rise and fall of Teng Hsiao-p'ing, and
 ? The rise of Hua Kuo-feng.
 In conducting the study it was further hoped that the findings and conclusions
 concerning the adequacy of sources and methods applied to these key targets from
 1965-1975 would produce meaningful judgments of general applicability regarding
 intelligence coverage of Chinese political developments.
 As a first step, an experienced CIA China specialist prepared a draft study under
 Intelligence Community Staff auspices on intelligence coverage of Teng Hsiao-p'ing
 and Hua Kuo-feng during the 1965-1975 period. As a second step, the Intelligence
 Community Staff sponsored a detailed review of the draft's contents and conclusions
 by convening a broadly representative panel of analysts and consumers of national
 foreign intelligence products on China within the National Security Council, Depart-
 ment of State, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This panel assessed the
 judgments made therein on the strength and weaknesses of intelligence coverage of
 the two personalities in focus, as well as conclusions offered on the adequacy of sources
 and methods on Chinese political developments in general. Results of this review have
 been incorporated in the study and its principal judgments.

 PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS
 1. Despite the weaknesses evident in predicting leadership changes, overall
 intelligence assessments on China have been reasonably accurate. A review of the
 sources and analytical methods used in these studies supports this judgment.
 2. The intelligence community has evolved a broad range of source data, a fairly
 good mix of media coverage, diplomatic contacts and clandestine collection despite
 the closed nature of Chinese society and the many complexities clouding the decision
 making process.
 3. Chinese leadership studies lean heavily on open media analysis. Use of the
 media has been complicated by obvious party factionalism over its control and
 Chinese penchant for masking controversy in abstruse analogy and innuendo.
 4. US intelligence appraisals need to be weighed against methods applied and
 conclusions drawn by other countries or sources. Illustrative of this, our interpretations
 involving the two cases under review parallel inferences drawn by the US academic
 community and foreign governmental analysts.
 5. The sheer range and volume of materials involved, uneven or delayed
 processing times, difficult retrieval, authentication, and coordinating mechanisms,
 combine to make the analyst's task a formidable one. The Chinese language itself
 becomes a near insuperable barrier when the regime chooses to backtrack through the
 centuries to shadow box by literary or historical analogy.
 6. Intelligence products dealing with China suffer from too much emphasis upon
 current analyses or long-term research studies. More emphasis needs to be applied to
 producing mid-term analyses, highlighting trends and assessing their potential impact
 on US policies.
 7. In the past few years, academic scholars have begun to question and to assess
 the various models and methods by which we interpret Chinese politics. The
 intelligence community should seek their contributions as we move into the post-Mao
 era.

 An Appraisal of Intelligence Sources and Analyses
 in the Fall of Teng Hsiao-p'ing and
 in the Rise of Hua Kuo-feng
 INTRODUCTION
 In late November 1975, intelligence memoranda in
 support of the President's trip to China identified then
 Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-p'ing as the man clearly
 slated to succeed ailing Premier Chou En-lai, as the
 man already running China on a daily basis and as the
 key figure in the PRC leadership picture after the
 death of Chou and Chairman Mao Tse-tung. En-
 trusted by Chou-Teng did greet, host, and talk with
 President Ford in his early December visit to Peking.
 The following month Chou died. Teng read out
 Chou's eulogy on 15 January and then disappeared
 from public view.
 In February, a relatively unknown leader, Hua
 Kuo-feng, was named Acting Premier. A propaganda
 campaign against Teng was touched off which
 climaxed in April 1976 when Teng was stripped of all
 his state and party posts. Hua moved quickly to
 consolidate his advantage. After Mao's death in the fall
 of 1976, Hua succeeded to Mao's leadership position
 and quickly purged Mao's wife and the Shanghai
 radical benefactors of the Cultural Revolution with
 her.
 It is fair to say that Teng's fall and Hua's rise took
 China watchers in the intelligence community wholly
 by surprise. What then, had happened? Given the
 limits within which we operate, were there not yet
 weaknesses which kept us from predicting Teng's fall
 from power little more than a month after he met with
 the President? Were there blind spots that prevented
 us from focusing on Hua's remarkable rise to the top?
 The question of Mao's successor has been a primary
 intelligence target for many years, yet no observers
 were suggesting Hua as a serious contender. Our many
 surprises in reporting the ebb and flow of Chinese
 leadership politics over the past decade and more-the
 demise of Liu Shao-ch'i, the fall of Lin Piao, Teng,
 and the "gang of four"-oblige us to look back on the
 validity of our sources as well as our methods of
 interpreting them. If we fail to come up with the right
 answers, are we then posing the wrong questions,
 gathering the wrong information, or approaching the
 target with faulty analytical assumptions or poor
 models?
 The purpose of this study is to examine the use of
 sources and analytical assumptions as they related to
 Teng's fall and Hua's rise to power. The data on these
 two leaders is treated separately in a way that is
 necessary artificial and delimiting, but the intent is to
 focus on possible problems with sources and methods
 relating to the broad issues of Chinese leadership
 analysis. These are surveyed at the conclusion of this
 paper. Appended is a sampling of biographic data,
 sources, and analytical comment on Hua Kuo-feng.
 Discussion
 A. The Rise and Fall of Teng Hsiao-p'ing. Teng's
 case is hard to isolate from the larger fabric of Chinese
 politics over the past few decades and is almost
 uniquely difficult to assess. There are no precedents in
 Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history for so
 dramatic a fall, return, then fall once again from high
 political office, Evaluation of the Chinese leadership
 picture presumes some general awareness of party
 history and the rich Chinese cultural milieu in which
 it unfolds. How does a proud, tough party veteran like
 Teng react to abrupt dismissal at the peak of his
 career, then to his recall to office at the age of 70?
 Whatever the external framework and the constitu-
 tional or political processes at play, much obviously
 depends on the personal character of the man himself.
 One of the party's hard-core veterans from Szechuan
 Province in the Southwest, Teng spent some early
 years in France with Chou En-lai; afterwards he
 distinguished himself with many years of successful

 administrative experience within the party and with
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
 By 1965, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution,
 Teng had long since become General Secretary of the
 CCP; with Mao, Chou, Liu Shao-ch'i and Lin Piao he
 was considered one of China's top leaders. But in the
 early stages of the Cultural Revolution, he was
 suddenly cut down as "number two capitalist roader"
 within the party after Liu-Shao-ch'i. While official
 media did not name or condemn Teng as it had
 Liu-the Cultural Revolution's principal target-
 scores of unofficial Red Guard tracts did hit at Teng
 by name in the context of struggle against the Liu-
 Teng line, attacks which spelled out Teng's crimes in
 almost every conceivable category. lie was accused of
 demonstrating unpardonable arrogance toward Mao;
 of maligning Mao's general line on the communes, the
 leap forward, on educational and cultural programs,
 and of shielding and promoting family, friends, and
 cronies. Subsequently, Teng was believed to have
 written a satisfactory self-criticism, but he dropped
 completely from public life. Red Guard publications
 in later stages of the Cultural Revolution, one
 attributed to Shanghai's radical leader Yao Wen-yuan,
 speculated on whether the likes of Liu or Teng could
 be rehabilitated at the Ninth Party Congress scheduled
 for April 1969. Teng was not reinstated at that
 Congress, but shortly afterwards rumors began to
 circulate as to his possible redemption. Then in April
 1973, Teng did make his dramatic but timid seeming
 re-entry onto the national political scene as a vice-
 premier, presumably with the concurrence of both
 Chairman Mao and Premier Chou. There was no
 public mention of Teng's prior mistakes or of his self-
 criticism. From that moment forward, Teng gradually
 gained power within the party hierarchy, which
 seemed even greater than he enjoyed in the past. By
 late 1975, it was generally presumed Teng was being
 groomed to succeed Chou as Premier or even to
 succeed Mao himself.
 Given Teng's vulnerability as a top-level victim of
 the Cultural Revolution, the obvious resistance to his
 return to power by the "Shanghai radicals" in the
 central leadership-those who had benefited by
 Teng's fall and were threatened by his return-was it
 too optimistic to assume Teng was a man slated to
 succeed? Examination of the available evidence
 strongly suggests that this was not the case.
 From the first day of Teng's return to grace there
 did seem to be indirect and guarded sniping against
 him in the media by innuendo through historical or
 literary analogy. Mao's wife, the focus for the
 Shanghai group, seemed to avoid appearing in public
 with Teng in the first few months of his return. Such
 tensions were noted and speculated upon by intelli-
 gence analysts. This had to be weighed against other
 open media evidence which clearly indicated Teng's
 star was on the rise. Diplomatic and clandestine
 sources were also confirming the strength of Teng's
 position on all sides. A number of sources relayed
 Mao's alleged pleasure with Teng's administrative
 talents, his desire to endorse Teng as Chou's successor.
 Making his initial appearance as Vice Premier of
 the State Council in the spring of 1973, Teng was
 restored to the Party Central Committee at the 10th
 Party Congress in August of that year. By January
 1974, Teng regained Politburo standing and a position
 as Vice-Chairman on the Military Affairs Commission.
 In January 1975, it was reliably, though not publicly
 reported, that Teng had also been named Army Chief-
 of-Staff. In April 1974, Teng's standing was measur-
 ably enhanced when he was chosen to head the PRC
 delegation to the UN General Assembly Special
 Session on World Resources, and, in May 1975, Teng
 made another prestigious trip, this time to France
 where he received head of state treatment and made a
 strong impression on French leaders with whom he
 spoke.
 Despite occasional media sniping which could
 be and was interpreted as an attack on Teng's return
 to  power,  the  open  and  obvious  evidence  of
 his restoration and grooming seemed incontestable
 throughout 1974 and 1975. On the international scene,
 Teng met foreign leadership delegations in company
 with Mao and/or Chou, one after another. As Chou's
 health worsened, Teng increasingly met and hosted
 heads of state, US t;ongressional, educational and other
 delegations-in  Chou's  name.  While  Teng  was
 deemed not so urbane as Chou, nor as knowledgeable
 on foreign affairs as Foreign Minister Ch'iao Kuan-
 hua, there seemed no question of his authority, poise,
 and confidence. He did not hesitate to lecture
 Secretary Kissinger on the US need to put the larger
 interests of NATO ahead of petty squabbling with
 France in order to counter the Soviet threat.
 Observations by USLO officers and many American
 and foreign visitors were uniform in concurring that
 Teng was the man "in the driver's seat."
 On the domestic front, Teng appeared equally
 authoritative. Most of his average 20 appearances a
 month through the year 1975 appeared devoted to
 meeting foreign visitors.  Clandestine intelligence

 informed us Teng was giving major speeches on
 national defense priorities and military reorganization,
 on national planning, science and technology, educa-
 tion and culture. He delivered the keynote speech for
 the National Agricultural Conference at Tachai in
 September, a meeting billed as the most important of
 its kind since 1949. Clandestine intelligence reported
 that Teng's speech was circulated at PRC embassies
 abroad for study. These sources also reported Teng
 giving speeches during 1975 sharply critical of both
 military and industrial departments, declaring them
 "lax and flabby" and not properly organized for
 defense or production. Teng was even reported
 instrumental in arranging the dramatic rotation of 8 of
 the 11 PRC's powerful military region commanders
 toward the end of 1973, a feat that allegedly won
 Mao's high praise. Again, Teng had not hesitated to
 send troops into Chekiang Province to quell serious
 unrest there after the youthful Wang Hung-wen of the
 Shanghai radical leadership faction was unable to
 solve the problem. Such activity may have generated
 rumors and gossip that Mao was urging Wang "to
 learn from Teng," conveying the outward impression
 that Teng had the inside track with the Chairman.
 All of this strongly suggested to intelligence analysts
 that Teng was being prepared step-by-step to succeed
 Chou as premier and perhaps ultimately, Mao as Party
 Chairman too. To be sure, Teng bore the stigma of his
 Cultural Revolution dismissal, but properly played,
 this could well have proved more an asset than a
 liability. Goals and methods of the Cultural Revolution
 had been publicly discredited; many of those most
 closely associated with it were purged, demoted, or on
 the defensive. At the same time, an ever growing
 number of party leaders dismissed during the Cultural
 Revolution were returning to positions of power and
 influence, sometimes with the insinuation they had
 been framed or sinned against by the Cultural
 Revolution.  As  a  group,  these rehabilitees  had
 experienced long, bleak years of personal humiliation
 and political isolation at the hands of Mao's Shanghai
 radicals. Their common fate might reasonably have
 forged a "Long March" bond among them; many
 would look to Teng as representative of their cause,
 the man who had lived through it with them.
 At least one PRC source reported that Teng's
 dismissal during the Cultural Revolution had been a
 mistake and that Teng had been "maliciously slan-
 dered" and framed by the Lin Piao faction. Another
 source abroad said Teng was victimized during the
 Revolution but had held his ground and been proved
 right. As the number of rehabilitated party and army
 leaders began to grow, analysts presumed Teng had a
 hand in redeeming many he had been close to
 previously to enhance his power base. Thus a number
 of high level rehabilitees in both the party and army at
 national and provincial levels were former Teng
 associates,
 Teng could also count on considerable strength
 within the PLA. He had served 17 years in commissar
 capacity with the Second Field Army and had directly
 commanded combined operations of the Second and
 Third Field Armies in crucial engagements in 1948
 and 1949. Many former army colleagues like Liu
 Po-ch'eng, Chu Te, Li Hsien-nien, Ch'en Hsi-lien, Li
 Te-sheng, and Su Chen-hua were staffing key
 positions in the Politburo, in PLA Headquarters, and
 regional commands as Teng resumed his rise to the
 top. It was not unreasonable to infer that Teng enjoyed
 the support and respect of many of the veteran army
 commanders, buttressed by his appointments as Vice-
 Chairman of the Military Commission and PLA Chief-
 of-Staff.
 Most of our intelligence then seemed to point
 overwhelmingly to the strength of Teng's position and
 to a carefully orchestrated program to insure his
 succession to the premiership. It was also the general
 judgment of Commonwealth, West European and
 Japanese leaders and diplomats visiting or stationed in
 Peking or Hong Kong. China watchers in the Soviet
 Union were also pegging Teng as the key man in the
 leadership, as were PRC diPhX*Z and representati
 abroad,
 conment
 Official PRC contacts in Hong Kong, Japan,
 Washington and Europe appeared as surprised as
 anyone when Teng was not named Premier. This was
 particularly true in Hong Kong where contacts seemed
 relatively more attuned to the leadership situation in
 Peking. In February 1976, PRC spokesmen were still
 insisting Teng "was not finished."
 Although Teng was endorsed by Mao and Chou,
 invested with key leadership positions with the highest ?
 international and domestic responsibilities, and pos-
 sessed a power base among the rehabilitated and in the
 higher reaches of the PLA, there were discernible

 obstacles in his path. His age was a mixed blessing, an
 asset in terms of experience and party respect for its
 elders, but also a liability in the wake of the illness and
 death engulfing. his generation of peers and protectors.
 While he received good press, there seemed little
 doubt that veiled swipes at his return to power did
 appear by way of inference and innuendo in many
 political campaigns waged after Teng resumed power.
 While the radical opposition presumably had to
 acknowledge Teng's return to prominence officially,
 they apparently made use of their access to the media
 to attack him indirectly. Especially pointed was the
 use of a Confucian setting to rail against the "Duke of
 Chou's- policy of "returning officials who had retired
 to obscurity." Obviously this was aimed at Chou's
 policy of redeeming party leaders struck down by the
 Cultural Revolution, chief of whom was Teng.
 A Canton source reported that the campaign to
 "restrict bourgeois rights" in the spring of 1975 was
 likewise meant to zero in on Teng, vulnerable as a
 former "capitalist roader." In the summer of 1975, the
 highly ambiguous but polemical attack in the classical
 novel Water Margin led to speculation that Teng was
 the intended target, as was publicly acknowledged in
 the spring of 1976. But it was not easy to tie this
 campaign to an attack on Teng at the time; indeed, a
 better case could have been made that the target was
 Mao himself. PRC contacts in Hong Kong and
 elsewhere purported not to know the real significance
 of the campaign, often denying that it was aimed at
 anyone in particular. One source even allowed how
 Teng was directing this campaign at Mao's behest. In
 late summer of 1975, still another campaign unfolded,
 this time against those backtracking on educational
 policies instituted during the Cultural Revolution. This
 attack was ostensibly directed at the Minister of
 Education, but the charges were similar to those
 levelled against Teng during the Cultural Revolution
 in  1967.  A  long-standing critic  of  the  party's
 educational policies insofar as he felt they hampered
 the development of skills needed to modernize
 Chinese society, Teng was probably justifiably accused
 of undermining these measures. By December 1975,
 current intelligence analysts had concluded that
 criticism on the educational front was in fact directed
 at Teng.
 Estimates of prospects for succeeding to the
 premiership were, of course, predicated on intelli-
 gence as to the strength of those opposing him. There
 were many unknowns in this area, particularly the
 stand of Mao himself, although both sources and
 analyses were pointing to Madame Mao and the
 Shanghai radicals as the opposition. Estimates seemed
 generally agreed, however, that while the radicals had
 great capacity for fomenting trouble, they had steadily
 lost ground since their peak period of influence during
 the Cultural Revolution. The PLA had restored a
 conservative order in the provinces at the expense of
 Red Guard factionalism; party leaders struck down
 were coming back to positions of power, and radical
 leaders and policies were phasing out. Above all, the
 men chosen by Mao to lead the Cultural Revolution,
 Ch'en Po-ta and Lin Piao, had themselves been put
 down as co-conspirators against the party.
 Good  intelligence  sources in  1974  and  1975
 indicated that Mao was attempting to put a damper on
 his wife's political ambitions and those of her Shanghai
 friends. It also appeared that Shanghai's Chang Ch'un-
 ch'iao was being counterweighted against Teng in key
 leadership roles and posed a potential threat to Teng.
 But reports of Chang's character and style as more in
 the mold of Chou En-lai led some analysts to
 conjecture that perhaps Chang had been co-opted by
 the moderate faction and that he was no longer so
 easily identified with the radical opposition. Chang's
 quick fall with the gang of four, however, seemed to
 render this assumption wrong.
 Teng's own personality seems the most complex
 variable in the estimate of his future leadership status.
 By most accounts, he comes off extremely able but
 equally abrasive. Teng obviously prefers to have his
 way and to stand his ground; he finds it difficult to
 toady or defer to those above or around him. In his
 earlier time of troubles, Mao complained that Teng
 paid him no mind and stood aloof. Reports of his
 administrative and diplomatic style all indicate he has
 more grit than graciousness. Far from being chastened
 by the Cultural Revolution, he seems bent on resisting
 all it stood for. Allegedly he blames the disorder and
 de-centralization of the national economy on policies
 of the Cultural Revolution. On resuming authority, he
 dressed down army commanders and fellow bureau-
 crats alike as lax and lazy. In all this he was
 undoubtedly a hero to some but a threat to others. We
 are left to speculate on whether a little more
 diplomacy or deference on Teng's part might have
 precluded his fall from power a second time.
 On balance,  it is hard to fault the general
 intelligence assessment of Teng's leadership position in
 the late fall of 1975. On the first page of the
 intelligence memorandum for the President's trip in
 November, Teng himself is cited as saying that the
 succession (to Mao) "whenever it occurs, is likely to be

 troubled." While the memorandum names Teng as
 Chou's successor, it also labels him "far more
 controversial than Chou ever was" and predicts that
 Teng will have trouble reconciling the various factions
 bidding for power after the death of Mao and Chou. A
 re-examination of the sources and methods working in
 the intelligence community up to the time of Teng's
 fall makes it difficult to believe that the assessment of
 Teng's position in November 1975 could have been
 substantially different from the one rendered.
 B. The Rise of Hua Kuo-feng. In September 1976
 Mao Tse-tung died, and, in the following month, Hua
 Kuo-feng succeeded him as head of the CCP and the
 PLA. Hua's take-over of Mao's position did not
 occasion as much surprise as his earlier appointment as
 Acting Premier, following Chou's death in January.
 Still this relatively obscure provincial leader seemed
 suddenly to rise up and assume all the top leadership
 positions in China, bumping odds-on favorite Teng,
 Mao's favored Shanghai radicals, and other more
 probable contenders as well. On the surface, at least,
 Hua has also appeared to spike prospects of a collegial
 or collective-style leadership in the post-Mao interim,
 a course of action many observers felt likely.
 As the annex to this paper shows, Hua's career was
 being passively recorded from provincial radio broad-
 casts in the late 1950s and 1960s as he worked his way
 up into the Hunan bureaucracy, as scores of other
 party cadres were doing in 30-odd other provincial or
 municipal units. But Hunan was Mao's native province
 and generally regarded as a more propitious place for
 a capable young cadre to be noticed. Hua was luckier
 still in that he worked in the vicinity of the native
 counties of Mao and Liu Shao-ch'i. He appeared to
 know how to take advantage of this situation and was
 placed in charge of a showcase irrigation project
 servicing both counties. Hua also initiated work on a
 railway spur to link Mao's village to the outside world
 and set about refurbishing and expanding commemo-
 rative halls in Mao's honor.
 During the 1960s and up to the Cultural Revolution
 in 1966, broadcast information made it obvious that
 Hua was indeed an activist in agriculture. He presided
 over meetings and gave reports on many aspects of
 farming as carried on the Hunan provincial capital
 radio at Ch'ang-sha. But it was also apparent that
 Hua's ambitions or talents lay beyond agriculture. He
 gave speeches on a variety of subjects, including
 public security, militia training, youth, education, and
 science and technology. Hua also met and feted
 foreign delegations that passed through Hunan, usher-
 ing them around Mao's native place. This undoubtedly
 provided Hua opportunities to polish or demonstrate
 his style and to get to know the high-ranking leaders
 from Peking who frequently squired important visitors
 to Hunan. Hua delivered a number of set speeches in
 this period against "US imperialist" activities in Viet-
 nam, charging that the bombing of North Vietnam
 posed a threat to China. In October 1964, Hua took
 part in a major public security "cultural festival"
 attended by Peking leader Yeh Chien-ying and senior
 security officials from six other provinces. Yeh and
 Central-South military leaders delivered "important
 instructions," and Hua spoke at the meetings too.
 While all those activities may have been common and
 prosaic enough, it does demonstrate that something of
 a grooming process was already at work, providing
 Hua with specialized experience in agriculture and a
 broader, generalized experience in both foreign and
 domestic matters that would equip him for higher
 positions later on.
 Not nearly enough is known of Hua's activities or
 relationships in Hunan during the hectic days of the
 Cultural Revolution (1966-69). Posters in 1974 would
 denounce him for suppression of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion in Hunan, but apparently, Hua managed to move
 through this troubled period relatively unscathed,
 surely a tribute to his instincts for survival. A June
 1976 source, a Ch'ang-sha university professor, re-
 called Hua's canny ability to switch back and forth
 between radical and conservative factions in Hunan
 during the Cultural Revolution, thus avoiding the fate
 of his friend and superior at the time, First Secretary
 Chang P'ing-hua.
 Hunan was a key area of Cultural Revolution
 upheaval, in part perhaps because it was the home of
 the two major antagonists, Mao and his first assumed
 successor, Liu Shao-ch'i. Beyond the intrinsic impor-
 tance of Hunan as Mao's home, the province also came
 under the administrative control of the Central-South
 Bureau, managed by its powerful chief, T'ao Chu
 from Canton. T'ao Chu vaulted to the "number 4"
 position in the Peking party hierarchy during the
 Cultural Revolution, just behind Mao, Lin and Chou.
 He had taken Hunan's First Secretary Chang with him
 to Peking to help manage the propaganda machinery.
 But in just a few months time both T'ao and his
 "Hunan agent" were cut down as Liu Shao-ch'i's
 agents from the Central-South. Also, Hunan was under
 the administration of the Canton Military Region
 (MR), reputedly the stronghold of Defense Minister
 Lin Piao at that time. Military leaders presumed loyal
 to Lin were later moved into Hunan to help settle

 down Cultural Revolution excesses there. Again, that
 Hua was able to navigate through these treacherous
 waters and avoid the stigma first of T'ao Chu and later
 of Lin's men, seemed a tribute to his flexibility-or to
 the standing of his patrons in Peking.
 Ilua had appeared with T'ao Chu in June 1966 at a
 ceremony to open the highly publicized irrigation
 works to water the home counties of Mao and Liu.
 T'ao praised the project (overseen by Hua) as one of
 the principal irrigation efforts in China. Fifteen
 months later, in a September 1967 Red Guard
 publication, T'ao and the June irrigation ceremony
 were criticized as bad. In August 1970, Hua had
 seemed to go out of his way to praise Lin's loyalty to
 Mao. At that very time, it was subsequently charged,
 Lin was plotting to overthrow Mao and the party. But
 Hua did not appear hurt by his relationship with T'ao
 Chu nor by his praise of Lin; in fact, it rather
 appeared that after Lin's fall, Hua's star as a national
 leader first began to rise. It was also at this time China
 watchers began taking a closer look at Hua's political
 fortunes.
 Even before this, in May 1969, OCI analysts had
 noted that Hua's election to the Central Committee of
 the Ninth Party Congress in April had boosted him
 over his nominal superior in Hunan, First Secretary Li
 Yuan, who had only been named a Committee
 alternate at this congress. Hua was in Peking for
 National Day in October 1969, then returned to
 Hunan where he continued to meet foreign delega-
 tions and give "important speeches" and instructions.
 In January 1970, OCT had inferred friction between Li
 Yuan and Hua over the PLA's political role in Hunan.
 Li, Commander of the 47th Army, had come into
 Hunan in August 1.967 as a stabilizing force during the
 Cultural Revolution. By May 1970, Hua Kuo-feng had
 quietly supplanted Li Yuan as First Secretary in
 Hunan.
 Shortly after Lin Piao's demise in September 1971,
 Hua was called up to Peking. In November 1971, the
 Hong Kong ConGen saw Hunan as a model and
 pacesetter in calling the first provincial party congress
 after Lin's fall. OCT analysts pointed to him as "a
 provincial leader moving up," citing his vague official
 identification as a "leading member of various
 departments" in Peking. Hua began appearing in top
 leadership groupings from this time, ranking about
 10th among the top dozen leaders making appearances
 in Peking.
 In June 1972, Hong Kong ConGen observed that
 Hua was gaining more prominence after Lin Piao,
 and, while he held no official title at the center,
 appearance of his name, clustered with two others and
 listed above those with ministerial functions, suggested
 that all three men may have been elevated to
 Politburo status. In July, a Canton TV intercept
 showed close-ups of Hua with Chou En-lai and other
 top leaders awarding prizes to participants. A Hong
 Kong USIS assessment of Hua in October 1972
 reviewed his rise to power in tandem with Shanghai
 radical Wang Hung-wen, noting Hua's activities
 associated with Mao's name and his outmaneuvering
 of Li Yuan, his rival in Hunan.
 In November 1972, Hua acquired an additional
 regional title as Political Commissar of the Canton
 MR. OCT and ConGen observers saw this as a
 stratagem to strengthen Hua's hand as a civilian
 central leader with respect to pro-Lin Piao influences
 still lingering in the Canton MR. Previously, the
 Canton MR's Deputy Political Commissar, Pu Chan-
 ya, outranked Hua in Hunan and was regarded as a
 Lin Piao man. Hua's new title was seen as a way to
 edge Pu out and extend Peking's control over the
 Canton bailiwick of Lin. This, of course, implied great
 trust in and more power for Hua. By the end of 1972,
 Hua was identified as Party First Secretary in Hunan,
 Acting Chairman of the Hunan Revolutionary Com-
 mittee and Political Commissar for the Canton MR,
 concentrating the party, government and military
 powers of Hunan in Hua's hands, in addition to his still
 unspecified duties at the center.
 In early 1973, Hua left Peking and returned to
 Hunan. Initial speculation by OCT was that Hua may
 have been returning to Hunan permanently, with his
 new title but "to ride a smaller horse." In May,
 however, a Hong Kong British intelligence report
 cited a poster observed in Hunan which indicated that
 Pu Chan-ya had been ousted there as pro-Lin Piao. At
 about the same time, the UK Regional Information
 Office in Hong Kong was suggesting that Hua had
 come back to Hunan just long enough to unseat Pu
 and install his colleague Chang P'ing-hua as Hunan
 Secretary-in-Charge before returning to Peking. In the
 summer of 1973 Hua had returned to Peking and was
 busy meeting several foreign agricultural delegations,
 prompting Hong Kong ConGen to speculate that Hua
 was becoming the regime's authority on agriculture. A
 good intelligence source in July had picked up Chou
 En-lai's remark to a Japanese visitor that it was
 necessary for the younger generation of Japanese
 leaders to meet their counterparts on the Chinese side,
 the Chinese successor group. Hua Kuo-feng was one of
 five named by Chou as future leaders of China.

 Scarcely a month later, at the CCP 10th Congress,   sixth of 12 vice-premiers under Chou En-lai after the
 Th t
 a
 Hua was elected to the Politburo.
 If Hua's rise to prominence seemed clear sailing up
 to the 10th Congress, he nonetheless met with a few
 jolts during the turbulent summer of 1974. USLO and
 Hong Kong reported that Hua was the target of poster
 attacks that summer, both in Hunan and Peking. The
 posters charged Hua with responsibility for killings in
 the late stages of the Cultural Revolution in Hunan,
 for suppressing results of the revolution, and for
 ignoring leaders who had come to power during the
 revolution. Mention of criticism against Hua came
 from several quarters, including posters allegedly seen
 from a train window in Ch'ang-sha by the Soviet
 military attache, but posters attacking him by name
 were quickly removed. Press criticism of a Hunanese
 opera titled "Song of the Gardner" said to vilify
 educational policy since the Cultural Revolution was
 interpreted by an AFP correspondent as an indirect
 attack on Hua. Hua apparently weathered all this
 criticism well and in June, OCI theorized that
 criticism of Hua originated with the radical left in
 Hunan, and it strongly suggested that Hua was not in
 the radical camp.
 Hua continued active in 1974, despite the criticism.
 Intelligence reports in April claimed Hua traveled in
 Canton in connection with an investigation of Lin
 25X1 C    Piao's former PLA Chief-of-Staff, Huang Yung-sheng.
 In July of 1974, - assessments of the Chinese
 leadership to USLO contacts saw Hua as definitely the
 party boss for agriculture; they also saw Chang Ch'un-
 ch'iao and Wang Hung-wen of the Shanghai faction as
 being groomed for Premier and party boss respec-
 tively. The ConGen added that Hua took center stage
 for meetings involving agriculture and that the
 Minister of Agriculture deferred to him on such
 occasions. In August, OCI also reported that Hua was a
 member of the State Council, holding some unspeci-
 fied position in the upper bureaucracy. Intelligence
 collected in September 1974 said Hua was a co-
 chairman of an investigatory commission to determine
 whether the PRC was ready for another leap forward.
 A Tokyo message in October pointed up Hua's
 expressed interest in exporting coal and oil to Japan.
 Hua was twelfth in the leadership turnout for Army
 Day in August and third among three leadership
 groups mingling with the masses for National Day on
 1 October, after Chu Te and Yao Wen-yuan. In
 evening celebrations, Hua was eleventh in the lineup.
 In 1975, Hua took on significantly more political
 clout when he became Minister of Public Security and
 National Peoples Congress (NFU) in January.
 same month a Soviet contact in Peking observed that
 abolition of the Procurator General's Office (with
 judicial  and supervisory functions) had greatly
 strengthened Hua's hand as Minister of Public
 Security, already the strongest arm of central control
 in the PRC. He judged Hua to have been Mao's man
 early on and predicted that Hua was strategically
 positioned for the coming showdown between radicals
 and moderates. (Later, in March 1976, a Soviet
 diplomat noted that the Public Security Ministry
 enjoys a control function within the PLA; thus, Hua
 would have his watchdogs in the army, some known,
 some not.)
 Hong Kong ConGen comment on the results of the
 NPC was that Chang Ch'un-ch'iao, Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing, and Hua Kuo-feng emerged as the men to
 watch. It also found it curious that Hua continued to
 retain both agricultural and public security responsi-
 bilities in addition to his controlling hand in Hunan. In
 February, a New Zealand agricultural minister visiting
 Peking found Hua a very engaging politician; "if he
 had the steel fist, he wore a velvet glove." Hua's
 remarks led the New Zealander to believe that he was
 extremely knowledgeable in agriculture and was not
 in the radical camp. Comment on this New Zealand
 impression by OCI in March concluded that power
 was concentrated in a very few hands in Peking and
 that Hua was very busy and very important in this
 regard.
 Hua maintained his high level visibility throughout
 1975, quickly moving into the Liaoning earthquake
 area with Teng on a comfort mission in March. He
 brought attention to his new role as Public Security
 Minister by signing off on the release of the captured
 Soviet helicopter crew. An April intelligence item
 contained the view that PRC cadres sensed Hua was
 highly regarded by Chou En-lai. Hua's stature was
 boosted considerably as the man presiding over the
 major agricultural conference at Tachai that fall. A
 Hong Kong Bank of China official stressed the Tachai
 meeting as a fundamental turning point for China and
 noted the significance of the report delivered there by
 Hua. An NCNA official in Hong Kong volunteered
 that Hua did a variety of jobs because that was normal
 procedure for a Vice-Premier and that Hua was
 "among the Vice Premiers in the best physical
 condition." In leadership turnouts in 1975, Hua was
 tenth on May Day, sixth at an Army Day reception.
 Early in January 1976, Chou En-lai died, and Hua
 appeared tenth on the funeral committee after Mao.

 Teng gave Chou's eulogy on 15 January and was
 almost universally expected to assume the Premier-
 ship. On 23 January, however, an NCNA official in
 Hong Kong conjectured that perhaps neither Teng nor
 Chang would become Premier. Hua was "unfathom-
 able" but active and much trusted by Mao. On 26
 January, the New  Zealand Ambassador to China
 claimed that he was far more impressed with Hua
 than Chang Ch'un-ch'iao and had long heard that Hua
 was a man to watch but had not believed it until he
 met him. In early February, an experienced Japanese
 source had been assured through his CCP liaison
 connection that Teng would succeed Chou. On 7
 February came the surprise announcement that Hua
 was named "Acting Premier."
 The Soviets, travellers from Canton, the French,
 were all taken completely by surprise. A Peking junior
 official alluded to Hua as a "nobody." Japanese
 officials were dubious of Hua's staying power, his lack
 of experience in industrial matters, and his lack of
 finesse in foreign affairs. A PRC electrician exiting to
 Hong Kong said that 99 percent of the common
 people in China had never heard of Hua and that
 Teng should have been the rightful Premier.
 Perhaps enough has been drawn from Hua's file to
 indicate that he did not come as a complete surprise to
 the intelligence community however unfamiliar he
 was to the man in the street. Sources and analysts had
 Hua in reasonably close focus; by 1975, most analysts
 would have judged Hua among the top five to ten
 leaders in the PRC. The importance of agriculture is
 generally recognized and so too is the public security
 portfolio. But Hua was, after all, a sixth-ranking Vice-
 Premier and eleventh ranking on the Politburo. There
 were more senior leadership candidates in front of
 him, and there seemed no question that the rehabili-
 tated Teng was being groomed to assume Chou's
 mantle as Premier. Were Teng to falter, one of the
 Shanghai Cultural Revolution group leaders, Chang
 Ch'un-ch'iao, appeared to have the inside track.
 Beyond Chang were old associates of Chou, Li Hsien-
 nien and Yeh Chien-ying. Other military commanders
 were in the running too; all probably would have been
 regarded as more seasoned and sophisticated choices
 for Premier than Hua, a relative newcomer from the
 provinces.
 It is also well to remember that this was the PRC's
 first succession and transfer of power. Mao as founder
 and leader of the Party, had held sway for nearly half
 a century, albeit with some difficulties over the last
 two decades. It seems probable that the innermost
 Approved For Release 2001/09
 councils of the CCP were simply unable to effect a
 smooth transition process not having predicted how
 losing the two pillars of power in the same year might
 affect the delicate balance within the party. We have
 only to recall how Teng disappeared the day after
 giving Chou's eulogy and how the "gang of four"
 disappeared less than a month after Mao's death to
 gauge the desperate leadership scramble as these two
 titans passed from the scene.
 It has been rumored that when the Politburo met to
 select a Premier to replace Chou-En-lai, it voted 7 for
 Teng, 6 for Chang, and 1 for Hua. Mao allegedly
 broke the deadlock by opting for Hua. This, of course,
 was not "hard intelligence," close to the decisionmak-
 ing process, but if such a report were genuine, it would
 not have occasioned much surprise among those
 watching the CCP leadership. Accessible sources-
 cadres, overseas functionaries and diplomats, travellers
 and the like-are apparently not on the receiving end
 of such sensitive decisions either.
 Clearly, the succession crisis surrounding-the loss of
 Mao and Chou has had no precedent in PRC politics.
 It is reasonable to assume Peking has had more
 difficulties resolving it than we have had in gathering
 and evaluating intelligence on it. There are as yet no
 discernible patterns to test or to provide guidance.
 Will Hua's successor come out of Hunan (by way of
 Shansi),  hold sway over agriculture and public
 security, and use the premiership as stepping stone to
 Party Chairman? Perhaps not, but, should all these
 factors be working for one man in the future, we may
 at least have something to go on. (In June of 1977, Hua
 relinquished his position as First Secretary in Hunan to
 an obscure secretary there named Mao Chih-yun. It is
 the same surname as the Chairman's and he appar-
 ently comes from the Chairman's home county.)
 Finally, a review of the sources and analyses
 relating to Hua's rise to power during this crisis period
 leads to the conclusion that the surprise over Hua's
 nomination was largely a function of Teng's failure to
 win the Premiership.  Better sources and better
 analyses would probably not have led us to conclude
 that Hua was the Premier-designate before Chou died.
 Just as with Teng's failure to be named Premier in
 February 1976, knowledgeable PRC sources seemed as
 genuinely nonplussed as other serious China watchers
 in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Europe and the Soviet
 Union. We were not analyzing against the tide.
 If Hua's prospects were largely obscured by
 intelligence tracking of more likely candidates, this
 was not to say that Hua was a cipher in the
 Approved For Release 2001/09/06 : CIA-RDP82M00311R000100170001-3

 intelligence file. The source net had been catching
 Hua up some 20 years earlier, and, as demonstrated in
 this paper, our biographic sources reflect Hua's
 activities and gradual rise to prominence in Hunan up
 through the Cultural Revolution and the death of Lin
 Piao in September 1971. Thereafter, Hua moved
 swiftly to national prominence, marshalling his powers
 as agriculture spokesman, retaining his power base in
 Hunan, grooming for the Politburo, picking up the
 Ministry of Public Security and so on, a matter of
 record and close scrutiny in the intelligence process.
 C. Sources in Support of Leadership Analysis. Hua
 did not fall from the sky nor emerge from behind a
 stump. He was clearly keyed into the leadership
 development process in China, and analysts were
 aware of his presence and potential. Similarly, there
 were seemingly enough sources to trace Teng's
 progress, if not his demise. Would a wider or deeper
 source base have improved analytical assumptions
 concerning Teng's fall or Hua's rise to power? Surely
 more might have been gathered, but let us first review
 what has been available and how it has been used.
 How do we look at the leadership in a closed society
 like the PRC where great efforts are made to
 dissemble and conceal infighting not only from the
 outside world but from the Chinese populace as well?
 Our primary data base derives from press and radio
 accounts of leadership activity. Major congresses,
 meetings, communiques, speeches and leadership
 turnouts, plus media commentary, provide the base
 line for establishing a leader's standing and function in
 the hierarchy. Careful monitoring of daily press,
 radio, and television tells us how often he appears in
 public, in what pecking order, in what capacity, and
 with whom. Television appearances or live recordings
 of a speech sometimes display surface leadership
 style-flair, assertiveness, authority, policy position,
 deference patterns or lack of them, and so on.
 The appearances of several hundred national and
 provincial leadership figures in the PRC are chrono-
 logically recorded with cumulative computer printouts
 available for several years running. These compilations
 have proved especially useful in measuring patterns of
 behavior, progress, and prominence.
 Such overt sources tell us whether a leader's role is
 broad or narrow, whether he holds party, state and
 military office or responsibilities, national and regional
 positions concurrently, and whether he addresses both
 foreign and domestic policy issues. In retrospect, as in
 the case of Hua Kuo-feng, it can track the grooming of
 a potential leader. The Chinese themselves have
 demonstrated the importance of media analysis in
 assessing the position and strength of various players
 within party and governmental leadership, most
 notably in regard to graphics revealing the juxtaposi-
 tion and alignment of the leadership in television cuts
 or official photographs in newspapers and magazines.
 Charges that anti-party elements have cropped or
 altered leadership photos to promote their cause or to
 undermine someone elses, alert us to the need of
 watching for small or abrupt shifts of patterns in
 "family  portraits." The Chinese have displayed
 considerable sensitivity in recalling or removing
 photographs or speeches of disgraced leaders.
 Beyond the media, Hong Kong and Peking prove
 valuable listening posts for gathering information on
 Chinese leaders. At the American Consulate in Hong
 Kong, biographic data are regularly compiled in the
 Political Section from daily press scanning. The
 Defense Liaison Office there contributes additional
 data on PRC military personnel, all of which plugs
 into  the  Washington  file.  Black market media
 materials, that is PRC press and journals not openly
 available outside China, are acquired and exploited at
 the Consulate. Post officers from State, CIA, DIA, and
 USIS have access to an exceptional array of sources in
 Hong Kong, which include official and social PRC
 contacts in media, banking, or business and liaison
 with diplomatic counterparts at other consulates,
 which often lead to briefing or debriefing of high level
 visitors to China and the informal exchange of ideas
 and information, American businessmen trading with
 China or traveling to trade fairs and exhibits in Canton
 or Peking, sometimes detect leadership attitudes
 toward foreign trade, a key area of leadership
 controversy.
 There is close rapport with the British mission in
 Hong Kong, including the use of refugee debriefings
 and association with the UK Regional Information
 Office, which maintains a small but excellent staff of
 Chinese analysts, who have kept close tabs and good
 records on the China leadership picture over many
 years. The experience, insight, language facility and
 continuity of key members of the Consulate's own
 Chinese professional staff have been a valuable asset to
 analysis and interpretation of PRC leadership behavior
 there. The Press Monitoring Unit has been translating
 and indexing PRC newspapers and journals for more
 than a quarter century.
 Clandestine collection in Hong Kong often sheds
 light on leadership tensions and relationships between
 Peking and its party or military cadre in the provinces.

 Reports of or receipt of numbered Central Documents
 from local or mainland cadre briefings often signal
 major changes in personnel or policy in advance of
 media announcement or clarify the significance of
 campaigns already underway. Sources often supply
 gists of leadership speeches or documents meant for
 cadre indoctrination but not for media dissemination.
 In Hong Kong there have been longstanding China-
 watching operations like Jesuit Father La Dany's
 China News Analysis, the Far Eastern Economic
 Review, and independent Chinese-language newspa-
 pers like Ming Pao, all with their own sources of
 information. Western and Chinese newsmen trade bits

 With the USLO Mission in Peking, there is now the
 opportunity to witness major political events first hand
 and to participate directly in US official, academic, or
 business interviews with Chinese leaders. Chinese
 language officers at the post travel around Peking and
 to other cities, view posters and rallies as they appear,
 gauge crowd moods, public security tensions, and the
 use or presence of troops. They also browse through
 bookstores and coordinate publications procurement
 with the Hong Kong Consulate. Excellent reports have
 come from USLO officers on leadership behavior at
 meetings they themselves attend or through diplo-
 matic exchange with members from other missions. In
 particular, there are contacts with Soviet and East
 European diplomats who do not have Consulates in
 Hong Kong. Access to the tightly held PRC army
 newspaper, Liberation Army Daily, has been one
 benefit from such contacts. Meetings with a few carry-
 over American or European residents in Peking add
 perspective and insight by dint of their long and
 trusted associations with Chinese friends or students.
 Exchanges with AFP and Reuters correspondents are
 Approved For Release 2001/09/0
 useful, together with stories filed by them and the
 Japanese news services in Peking. Gossip from Chinese
 staff or servants can be helpful too.
 Apart from Hong Kong and Peking, there has been
 some good third-party intelligence access to PRC
 diplomatic or other representations from Rangoon,
 Singapore and Tokyo to Geneva, Tehran, Cairo and
 the UN Mission in New York. In Taiwan and Japan,
 keen interest in Chinese developments, coupled with
 cultural affinities and political familiarity with senior
 leadership figures in the PRC, has also been of value in
 our intelligence assessments.
 Diplomatic intelligence, our own and that of other
 services, often gives us an index to a leader's posture
 and relationship with his peers: how does he handle
 himself at briefings of foreign visitors; is he comfort-
 able with them, knowledgeable on matters under
 discussion; is he alert and in good health; does he defer
 to others, hew woodenly to cliches and well-worn
 lines; does he speak with conviction and confidence?
 In my judgment, most of these source opportunities
 have been exploited with considerable skill and
 ingenuity in recent years, and, barring some mass
 defection at the "gang of four" level, better source
 data in the HUMINT category is not apt to refine the
 intelligence product on leadership issues. This is not so
 much to say our sources are good or sufficient as to
 acknowledge how difficult it is to reach to the inner
 recesses of PRC decisionmaking. We are often left
 with the feeling we know more than the man in the
 street in Peking and almost as much as the highly
 placed PRC provincial cadre or diplomatic representa-
 tive abroad, which, unfortunately, is still to say, "not
 much. "
 D. Dangers Inherent in the Source Material. We
 have a broad range of overt and covert sources then,
 and, depending on analytical background or experi-
 ence in reporting, we sometimes ascribe more weight
 to one type of source than another. In fact, all
 categories of information, properly sifted and evalu-
 ated, can usually complement or corroborate one
 another and help to refine or reform analytical
 judgments. With clandestine sources there exists a
 continuing need to shake down gossip and hearsay, test
 source reliability and access, and insure they are not
 just selling things you want to hear. Clever forgeries of
 "important" documents or speeches sometimes are
 contrived for sheer market value. Other forgeries and
 disinformation may originate with the Soviet Union,
 the Chinese Nationalists, or other activists for varying
 political reasons. Beyond this, source information may

 SECRET
 originate inside the PRC, yet still be the work of
 "rumormongers" in the provinces at odds with
 policymakers in Peking or reflect a dissident line with
 Peking. The experienced case officer or analyst must
 constantly evaluate what he acquires, trying to
 confirm it with alternative or overt sources of
 information. The Hong Kong Consulate has developed
 considerable skill in sniffing out forged documents.
 Recently, machine and mathematical computations
 have made some headway in verifying authenticity of
 leadership speeches acquired through clandestine
 sources.
 In the use of overt sources like press and radio, we
 have had a sense of at least holding the lowest
 common denominator of official information, a base
 line of credible data on a totalitarian society in which
 we assume the media is carefully screened and
 dominated by the one ruling party. In the decade
 since the Cultural Revolution, however, this sense of
 security has been repeatedly undermined. Articles in
 the press complain that the media have been
 susceptible to massive and subtle manipulation by
 anti-party forces. The party paper then does not speak
 with one voice, and cultural and educational props
 have frequently been criticized as spears turned
 against the leadership as well as party programs and
 goals. Those closest and most loyal to Mao have been
 found guilty of "waving a red flag to oppose the red
 flag" and so on.
 Similar precautions are necessary in using sources
 which evaluate a leader by first hand observation,
 often on the basis of superficial diplomatic contact.
 We have had what appear to be astute assessments by
 objective reporters, but political and cultural prejudice
 or personal vanities may color or distort value
 judgments. Some of the best political observations of
 Chinese leaders might occasionally come from Soviet
 diplomats.  We might expect special cultural or
 political insights from Japanese or overseas Chinese
 visitors, but it is a fine line to draw between giving
 such observations more or less credit than they
 warrant. A New Zealand official schooled in Chinese
 history and current leadership politics might be better
 qualified to comment on Chinese history and current
 leadership behavior than a Southeast Asian diplomat
 of Chinese extraction with no particular knowledge of
 Chinese politics, yet the latter might detect certain
 cultural quirks or slights that could prove significant.
 Whether he would think them worth relaying or
 explaining to a Western colleague is still another
 matter.
 A warning note might be sounded too, with regard
 to contacts with PRC overseas diplomats and their
 outlook on leadership politics at home. Presumably,
 the PRC diplomatic staff is carefully chosen and
 operates from roughly parallel guidelines in discussing
 PRC politics with foreign contacts. Most PRC diplo-
 mats who have chosen to speak with outsiders appear
 to be strongly pro-Chou or Teng in political orienta-
 tion; this might merely be the line or it could also
 mean that those who don't talk to foreigners so readily
 might hold a different view of leadership politics. If
 the two-line struggle is reflected in the posting
 complement of overseas missions, onesided access to a
 friendly line could inject a distorting effect into our
 value judgments on leadership politics. These are but a
 few of the pitfalls faced in using the leadership sourceSTATSPEC
 available to us, whether open or confidential.

 Another source of raw data has been the Hong Kong
 Consulate translation of newspapers and periodicals
 from the PRC. The great strength of this service has
 been the range and depth of source material with a
 quarter century of good indexing. The great weakness
 from the intelligence viewpoint has been its slow
 distribution time, which often makes such materials of
 little value to current intelligence.

 its own reporting requirements. This study was,

 however, based largely on data in the leadership files
 of the Office of Central Reference, where each
 recorded appearance, speech, intelligence report or
 commentary on an individual leader is kept on 5x7
 cards and listed chronologically. While the volume of
 chaff with each kernel sometimes overwhelms, the
 material is readily accessible and reference personnel
 are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. In general,
 rapport and communication among analysts, data
 managers and collectors appear to be good.
 F. Some Assumptions in Leadership Analysis. In
 looking at the Chinese leadership situation over the
 years, it is apparent that many of the assumptions are
 identical to those used to assess any other leadership
 group; others are uniquely Chinese. A few of the more
 common measures of leadership appraisal are summa-
 rized here.
 Often, we define a Chinese leader's status in terms
 of his power base, which might derive from a
 prominent party history, participation in the Long
 March, distinction as army commander or commissar
 or, after 1949, sustained high level administrative
 experience in one or more provinces or in planning
 and ministerial responsibilities at the center. To have
 survived successive purges in the party speaks well for
 a leader's prowess or agility. A man on the rise in
 Peking, the provinces, or the army gradually comes to
 recognized plateaus of attention and influence within
 the party apparatus.
 First secretaries of key provinces, PLA regional
 commanders and commissars are characteristically
 seen as having reached a point where they are
 building or seeking to maintain their "power bases" to
 rise in the leadership hierarchy. Ideally, the base
 should not seem too powerful lest it degenerate into its
 political converse, the "independent kingdom." A
 great many political careers in China have terminated
 on the charge that leaders have assembled forces or
 followings that ignore the larger interests of party or
 state. Lin Piao, whose power base included a brilliant
 military record, close association with Mao, and
 command of the PLA, seemed a model of selfless
 deference to Mao and the revolution. After his fall, his
 modesty was said to be simulated and his military
 reputation fraudulent. Teng's arrogance alone was a
 factor in bringing him down. Clearly, it is not easy to
 become a leader in China. CCP infighting over half a
 century has developed a rich litany of political
 deviations identified as either left or right opportun-
 ism, and an analyst must have some appreciation of
 how these errors relate to present day leadership
 controversy over foreign or domestic policy. Even
 today, familiarity with Mao's interpretations on these
 matters is indispensable.
 Seasoned leaders at the center, those responsible for
 introducing key policy issues or campaigns, those who
 become regular interpreters of, national planning and
 who meet high level foreign visitors, especially those
 from fraternal parties who regularly appeared with
 Mao or Chou, obviously enjoy high leadership
 prospects. Where leaders stand in relation to one
 another at national ceremonies or with foreign guests
 is indicative of their status, but such alignments
 sometimes seem more fluid than static. A given leader
 may appear fourth or fourteenth, and his position may
 depend on the event, the visitor, or on which or how
 many other Chinese leaders appear. There may also be
 additional matters of protocol of which we are not
 aware. Tensions among leaders do not prevent them
 from appearing side by side; protocol surely insists on
 a facade of unity, and it is probably important to keep
 tabs on what your opponent is up to and not allow
 your supporters to think you have lost ground. Close
 monitoring of leadership activity on TV sometimes
 betrays leadership differences. I had the opportunity
 to witness the Chou En-lai funeral in the company of
 one of our Chinese staff members at the Hong Kong
 Consulate. An essay might have been written on his
 observations of the true and false grief displayed by
 Chou's politburo colleagues at the funeral. In the past
 certain leaders, including Mao and Lin Piao, would be
 absent from public view for months with no apparent
 effect on their political status. They might have been
 ill, traveling, training, under political investigation or
 pouting. Peking seldom tells, though feigned illness
 seems a time-honored political strategem.
 Cumulative biographic data, including psychologi-
 cal studies based on information from all sources can
 often span several decades. It catalogs highlights of a
 leader's early civilian and military life, provincial and
 national level responsibilities, past associations with
 others in the hierarchy, and so forth. Guarded
 assumptions can be drawn as to the strength of a man's
 power base in terms of regional affiliations, high level
 patrons in Peking, and past relationships and positions
 within the party and the army. Assets and vulnerabili-
 ties can be assessed in light of how a man fared in
 previous party controversies or major political upheav-
 als, factors which indicate differences or grievances on
 volatile issues. Regime personnel assignments might
 consciously place rivals in an offsetting position in a
 troubled province or military region to counterbalance
 or dilute political tensions.

 and innuendo are classical weapons of political
 infighting in China and have been repeatedly invoked
 to mask debate over high level political issues. The
 Cultural Revolution got underway with Yao Wen-
 yuan's attack on prominent Peking historian Wu Han,
 who allegedly contrived a Ming Dynasty play to
 criticize Mao for having dismissed Defense Minister
 P'eng Te-huai. This time-honored political tactic of
 indirect criticism is known as "pointing at the
 mulberry to revile the ash." Some appreciation of how
 and why these literary and scholastic weapons have
 been used, before, during, and after the Cultural
 Revolution should be a rather basic component of the
 China watcher's analytical equipment. Too often, such
 historical controversies are dismissed as non-sensical or
 contradictory by Westerners, even though Chinese set
 great store by them.
 In the early stages of our leadership analysis, the
 Long March camaraderie of the Chinese leaders was
 invoked as proof of unanimity at the center and of
 Mao's commanding presence in the leadership picture;
 party, people, pen and sword were harnessed to one
 goal. In retrospect, it is doubtful that the analytical
 model was ever quite so monolithic. After 1959,
 Peking was at pains to cleanse the party of impurities
 at the highest level. Political enemies challenged Mao's
 judgment, criticized his errors, and called his steward-
 ship into question. These enemies were charged with
 attempting to subvert party and state, capture the
 army, seize control over the media, and install Soviet-
 style revisionism in all spheres of activity. For such
 crimes, heads rolled among senior members of the
 party and army bureaucracy.
 Events in China sometimes seem to outrun our
 analytical assumptions regarding the leadership strug-
 gle there. This is not necessarily to say models or
 techniques are invalid or even that better ones are
 available.  For the present,  however,  we should
 recognize that our assumptions cannot remain static
 and are in constant need of testing and definition. The
 traditional concept of monolithic leadership in China,
 with all that it implies in terms of foreign policy,
 national planning, regime stability, and media con-
 trols, probably outlived its usefulness long before Mao
 died.
 However much the charges and countercharges re-
 echo through the various line struggles, it hardly seems
 justified to dismiss policy issues as largely irrelevant, as
 mere sticks in the power struggle. Surely the Chinese
 leadership does wrestle with problems of war and
 peace, foreign policy and trade, S&T, national plan-
 ning priorities, defense strategy and budget alloca-
 tions, regionalism, and so on. As part of our under-
 standing and appraisal, it should be worthwhile to
 separate real issues from slander and revenge. Much of
 this regime's near-term energies will be spent deflat-
 ing Maoism, while preserving Mao. Never appreciat-
 ing Moscow's de-Stalinization, Peking will try to
 blame the "gang of four" for Mao's sins; thus, the gang
 carried out "fascist dictatorship behind Chairman
 Mao's back." Already, the first 17 years of Communist
 rule (1949-65), largely written off during Mao's Cul-
 tural Revolution as under the sway of the Liu-Teng
 line, is being quietly reassessed.
 The Chinese themselves have consistently invoked
 the concept of "two-line struggle," Mao's revolution-
 ary line in life and death struggle with a Soviet-type
 revisionist opposition. Whatever the distortions or
 dissembling inherent in this model, it has come closer
 to explaining the rounds of high level purges and
 continuing tensions within the Chinese leadership over
 the last 20 years than anything else available. It was
 clearly Mao's belief that the Chinese revolution
 needed two-line struggle to avert bureaucratic atro-
 phy. He never came round to tolerating a "loyal
 opposition," however, and it is doubtful his successor
 will either.
 It may be too soon to judge Hua Kuo-feng's
 leadership style, other than to note that he apparently
 means to steer clear of the "collective leadership"
 many thought likely to bridge the gap left by the loss
 of Mao and Chou. It has yet to be determined whether
 the highly centralized leader image Hua now projects
 is the wisdom of ancient polity, symbolizing a united
 empire, or the style of an adroit politician. Our
 cumulative file on Hua suggests he is a well-grounded
 opportunist, more disposed to accumulate and hold
 power than to delegate it and a man who shrewdly
 dispensed with all likely rivals at both the provincial
 and national levels while securing the backing of the
 army and public security apparatus. As a relatively
 young, competent, and experienced administrator,
 with no strong factional history, Hua has seemed to
 cash in on disarray in Peking following the demise of
 Mao and Chou. We may wonder whether the media's
 repeated description of Hua's quick and decisive
 dispatch of the "gang of four" is not meant to contrast
 with Mao's inability to cope with the gang and
 whether the smooth, conciliatory, and patient Hua
 portrayed in other propaganda themes is not meant to

 contrast with the unbending and abrasive image of
 Teng Hsiao-p'ing. There may be a new leadership
 style in the making despite Chairman Mao's long
 shadow.
 CONCLUSIONS
 I would conclude that sources, services, and analyses
 on the Chinese leadership problem have been
 surprisingly good and resourceful despite the opaque
 and complex character of our target. There is need to
 widen perceptions and perhaps better apply or digest
 what we now have, but China analysts had zeroed in
 particularly well on the key issues of the radical-
 moderate controversy in China, and its principal
 protagonists were well known. Analysts had hold of
 the very journals and papers (Shanghai's Study and
 Criticism, Historical Research, Kwangming Daily),
 the very articles and pseudonyms, that are now
 denounced as instruments of the "gang of four." In
 August, 1976, an OPR study on Teng predicted that it
 could only be a matter of time after Mao's imminent
 death that the radicals would be unseated by centrist
 and rightist forces in China. In September Mao died,
 and, in October, centrist and rightist forces unseated
 the Shanghai radicals.
 One thing that the fall of Teng and the rise of Hua
 should have taught us, however, is a need to approach
 the target with reserve and caution, not to pretend to
 more knowledge than we have, nor to rely too heavily
 on favorite models or pre-conceived notions of how
 the decisionmaking process works. Some of our
 assumptions have come under increasing challenge in
 recent years and may be more challenged in the post-
 Mao era. Policymakers should resist asking the
 impossible and analysts should resist providing it.
 For example, we would like to assume that party
 media come under centralized party control and that
 lines and policies may be authoritatively validated at
 any given time. But the March 1977 issue of the CCP
 theoretical journal Red Flag carried an article that
 denounced Yao Wen-yuan's use of the journal to
 attack Mao, Chou, and the party. In June 1958, Mao
 invested this journal as the voice of the party, and its
 first chief-editor was Mao's close advisor Ch'en Po-ta.
 Ch'en later headed up the Cultural Revolution Group.
 Later still, the same Ch'en was named arch-accom-
 plice and co-conspirator with Lin Piao in plots
 directed against Mao and the CCP. Ch'en, Lin, and
 %Yao were all reckoned particularly close to Mao. Not
 too many intelligence scenarios for China adequately
 cover such perplexities, and it is probably best to
 acknowledge it. There have been sharp differences of
 opinion among China analysts in government and
 academic life as to what such things signify. These
 differences can help sharpen perceptions and improve
 intelligence products.
 Finally, it should be noted that this study is
 restricted to the narrow facet of leadership politics,
 possibly the most difficult part of China-watching in
 terms of predictability. But considerable analysis goes
 on in other spheres too-economic planning and
 production, foreign policy, military strength and
 posture, relations with the US and the Soviet Union,
 Science and technology, regionalism, and so forth.
 Often the data base for such subjects is not much
 better than for studying the leaders. Still, these
 collateral studies contribute significantly to our overall
 assessment of leadership politics in China.

 : highly
 re are  in   unan a er restoring agriculture there in
 early 1960's; personally commended by Mao, regarded
 able administrator with Mao's support; respected by
 intellectuals whom he protected during Cultural Revolu-
 tion; also protected Chang P'ing-hua; regarded as moder-
 ate but active behind scenes, no factions; Mao felt Hua
 needed to preserve agriculture and no enemies in Hunan
 or Peking. Shy, effective in small groups
 Japan: Report that PRC first secretary in European
 embassy found it difficult to believe that Teng had done
 anything  wrong-in  context  of  Hua's  surprise
 appointment
 Businessman's report on return from trip to Peking of
 remarks attributed to Teng after the Tachai Conference
 in October: Teng spoke of Hua's bigger responsibilities in
 future, of Hua's role at Tachai, his vision, indefatigable
 spirit, so essential to great work load and responsibilities
 he would have to bear in the future
 Soviet diplomat notes that public security ministry has
 controlling function within PLA; Hua has his watchdogs
 in the army, some known, some not; information supplied
 by PLA border crossers into USSR
 European NCNA official says Hua solid; predicts Hua
 will take over all Teng's functions, including military
 Hua appointment as premier and first vice chairman also
 suggests he will succeed Mao. No power base may be an
 asset; has Mao's favor and is an able administrator
 st Hua's easy and
 sincere manner wit  Teng, w ho too clever and always
 puts you on guard. Very favorably impressed with Hua
 Hua appointment sheer luck; 99
 percent o common people in PRC never heard of Hua.
 He thought Teng should be rightful premier
 British impression: Able administrator in job far too big
 for him; spoke extemporaneously yet seemingly from
 pre-set script; not flexible, unwilling to depart from script
 Lee Kuan observation: Hua very anti-Teng; surmised
 Hua instrumental in Teng's removal (Lee admittedly not
 well versed in PRC internal politics)
 Hua could join either side; can't be classified radical or
 moderate
 Malaysians impressed with Hua's authority and confi-

 to Ch'iao Kuan-hua for foreign affairs
 Japanese say Hua solid but not yet in Chou's league;
 cautious, lacked knowledge in foreign affairs, as Hua

 ing from one faction to another. After Chang P'ing-hua
 fell in 1966-67 as Hunan First Secretary, Hua shifted to
 red guard faction supported by Lin Piao. But Shanghai
 group in Peking sponsored more radical faction and Hua
 switched again; faction enjoyed Chiang Ch'ing support
 hence Hua did not suffer Chang's fate. Mao visited
 Ch'ang-sha in September 1967 & publicly praised Hua;
 in 1974 Hua sent to investigate Pu Chan-ya role in
 30 Jun    ACG/HK
 25X1A
 Jul
 25X1A
 Hunan; Pu close to Lin Piao group; Hua submitted report
 accusing Pu complicity with Lin & Pu dismissed as result
 levation of Hua
 to premiership came as total surprise; asked group of
 students there who new premier was to be and no one
 came up with the right answer
 Australians found Hua impressive; good face, handled
 questions smoothly, with or without Ch'iao Kuan-hua
 Hua shrewd, capable, keeps
 options open; does not rely on Ch'iao for foreign affairs;
 still retains public security reins; would not cross swords
 with Shanghai crew while Mao still alive; his sanction of
 anti-Teng campaign would not extend to criticism of
 Teng's supporters
 Senior PRC spokeman warns against taking signed arti-
 cles like those of radical Liang Hsiao too seriously; not
 necessarily authoritative
 No question but what Hua would succeed Mao success-
 fully; Hua solid and respected
 Views of Soviet Sinologist: To US academic; recalls
 association with Hua in 1959-60; thought to be pragmatic
 and on good terms with Chou En-lai
 Hua a natural choice for Chairman (to succeed Mao)
 Collective leadership likely; with Hua, Chang, Yeh; Hua
 would relinquish Premiership to Chang, if pressed. (Sur-
 mise of HK leftist)
 Hua's high status as responsible for editing Mao's works;
 Japanese newsmen dubious of Hua's capabilities only an
 accident of circumstances, has no power base
