 SECTION IIe    DEVELOPIMNTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS
 Preliminary rehabilitation estimates for Ja an Korea  and the R     s       "R"
 The Department of the Army has formulated preliminary estimates as to
 the aunt of Government and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA) funds that
 will be available for economic rehabilitation purposes in Japan, South Korea,
 and the Ryukyus:  It has decided to allot within the first 6 montbs of the
 fiscal year 1949, $75,000,000 of the Congressional GARIOA appropriation of
 $1,300,000,000 subject to re-examination, in two or three months with a view
 to determining whether additional GARIOA funds can be made cvailable for
 coonomid rehabilitation purposes and whether or not it Is desirable to
 request supplementary appropriations at the next session of Congress.  The
 $75,000,000 its broken down as follows:  Japan $51,400,000; South Korea
 $20,200,000; Ryukyu, $2,400,000; ($1,000,000 is being withheld for a special
 project)o  The Department stresses that although its estimates cover only
 the first six months of the fiscal year 1949, these funds may be the only
 ones available for the entire fiscal year.
 Thus, the allotment for economic rehabilitation is exactly one-half of
 that originally requested of Congress by the Department of the Army.  On the
 other hand insofar as Japan is concerned, this sum is supplemented by
 favorable Congressional action on a $150,000,000 revolving fund.

 Philippine-Japanese trade  9li.o  announced b  President Quirtno
 During A 29 July press conference, Ptceideut Quirinb made the first
 official declaration concerning his Government's policy regarding the hotly
 disputed Philippine-Japanese trade issue.  Quirino said that limited trade
 with Japan. based upon benefit to the Philippines, would be continued.  The
 president announced that, although the Philippines would adhere to Far
 Eastern Commission policy of dealing with Japan as a subjugated country
 under SCAP, the Philippine trade mission in Japan would be raised to a con-
 sulate.  Quirino also indicated that the Philippine Import Control Board
 (which at present controls only luxury and nonnossential imports) may be
 used to implement the newly-announced trade policy.
 Filipinos have been acutely sensitive about dealing with their former
 enemies largely because of the widespread feeling that trade relations might
 contribute to Japanese industrial and military resurgence.  For example UN
 Ambassador Carlos P..' Rbmulo,, during e- recent twip to. the Philippines. public-
 ly declared that reparations and indemnification for victims of Japanese .
 aggression should be prior considerations to the resumption of any relations
 with Japan.  Romulo also maintained that the "regeneration' of Japan will

 'begin only after a peace treaty is signed and that the Philippines should
 "go very slowly" in resuming trade relations.
 Although Quirino's policy statement clarifies the Goverm ent's position,
 it can be expected that the principle of Philippine-Japanese trade will be
 the subject of a continuing and often bitter public controversy in the
 Philippines.
 Prohibition of FIl9.T announced by Siamese Goverment                            "B"
 r.ww.'.rrrsw+ar
 The chronic Chinese problem in Siam has recently been Intensified by a
 governmental announcement of the prohibition of the Kuomintang (KMT) as an
 illegal, unregistered and alien political party.                                                                            A responsible government
 official stated further that the KMT would not be registered even upon
 application.  To date, the brunt of Siamese antagonism and increasing anti-
 Chinese sentiment has been directed at the local Chinese Cammaniets.  The
 banning of the KMT, in view of the inability of Chinese Nationalist'Gov?rn'-
 ment and local Chinese to make effective representations at present, may
 signal the resumption of an extensive anti-Chinese cempaign marked by arrests
 and deportations directed at all Chinese elements in Siam.

 favorable issue for winning popular support for an A.t#ark nm nnnu-natten
 policies*     Openly challenging the le a:ifiz of the order, Communist-don-
 wd unions have demanded the resignation of the RS: IDA Cabinet and the
 i?i:nsolution of the Diet.  The new labor restrictions have assisted Co.., -
 ani st promotion of a conanon labor front by forcing more moderate leader-
 ship to choose between a pro or anti-government stand..
 SCAP's action embarrasses the Socialists who, because of their
 participation in the Ashida coalition cabinet, must share responsibility
 for ii..plementing the measure in the face of ivi de--spread labor disapproval.
 Socialists leaders have claimed that they can protedt labor's interests
 better by remaining in the government than by permitting the conservative
 domination of the government Which would result from Socialist withdra val.
 Doubt as to the ability of the Socialists to maintain this claim has been
 reflected in losses to the party in Diet membership and in set-backs
 suffered by the Socialist-sponsored anti-Communist movement in labor*
 In the present crisis the government has stated that it is carrying
 out the wishes of o lcupati.on authority but the question arises whether
 the Socialists can continue to associate themselves with actions so
 injurious of party fortunes.  Although the cabinet's ordinance contains
 a sop to its Socialist members in pro vi.di.ng for government employees!
 grievance machinery such a limited gain will hardly halt falling Social-
 1st prestigeo
 Communist threats leave open to question whether the unions will obey
 the cabinet ordinance,  The JCP may elect to provoke the Occupation into
 physical suppression of Japanese labor, thereby acquiring the Cloak of
 martyciom. In the event of the Occupation's suz,.p ression of communist
 inspi red violence, hoV.ever, there is a chance that Japanese respect for
 author! ty :;could cause the JGY to lose prestige and permit some Socialist
 re cover; of the initiative in the labor movement.

 in Peiping, is abetted by the belief of native %wa'urlan leaders that
 the military power of Chiang Kei?shek is rapidly crumbling.  This discontent
 might crystalize in the latter part of this month into a move to establish
 #n ?'emancipated regional gcYernaeat".  In such an event, the local Nation-
 ,Y.liets troops under Kai ii.?hua ng probably would refrain from attempting to
 yell the movement by force, since street fighting on a large scale might
 enable the Chinese Communists to seise the city.
 The Nanking Government, which hitherto has done little to answer
 IL-mnkurian complaints, is now attempting belated measures of pacification.
 An open break between )fukden and Nanking might prompt like action elsewhere,
 especially in North China where there are strong similar tendencies.  Such
 regional regimes presunsably would be anticComaunist, although they would
 probably be inclined to seek an and to actual fighting through negotiation.
 (See CRS 12-48 sProapects for a Negotiated Peace in Chinas, 3 August 1948.)
 In contrast to the dismemberment threatening the National Government, the
 Chinese Communists confidently assert that they will soon consolidate their
 four liberated areas north of the Yellow River, and that their military
 forces are now strong enough to Werwhelm any Nationalist fortified city.
 Chinese mule Crit. WWsm of the US std "r gram continues to mount,
 despite the National Government's insistence on the necessity for additional
 aid.  Although an overwhelming majority of the Chinese masses are either
 ignorant of the aid program or apathetic to it, many articulate Chinese feel
 that present US aid will accomplish little of a beneficial nature, and will
 merely prolong the civil war and postpone the fall of the present unpopular
 National Government.  Among the merchants and businessmen, except those
 affiliated with government-controlled economic agencies, resentment stems
 from the belief that the aid program will be handled not by private traders
 but by the Government to the profit of the "Four Yamilles" who have a
 virtual monopoly control over Chinese economic life.  The Chinese laboring
 class, although unaware of the complex aspects of the, aid program, is
 affected directly by the devastating inflation and therefore is particularly
 receptive to Communist charges that the US aid program with its allegedl,v

 the Communists' ability to reach that goal. The broadcasts emphasize the
 great strides taken by the Communist forces, in the past two years and predict
 that, under the "correct" guidance of Mao Tse-tung, further strides will be
 -made deep into Kuomintang territory.. The Communist Army, it is pointed out,
 bee captured thousands of US-.supplied Nationalist artillery pieces and are
 now capable of overwhelming any Nationalist fortified city.  The Communists
 claim that almost one-fourth of China's area and over one-third of its people
 are now under their sway and promise that the day when the four liberated
 areas north of the Yellow River -- now separated by Nationalist holdings
 along the Peiping-Suiyusn and Peiping.-Chinhsien railways and by a half dozen
 or so isolated Nationalist cities -- would be joined is  not far off".' In _

 hoodwinked by any "fake peace" achieved through the efforts of a bogus "anti

 of vital industries, utilities and communications, due to financial diffi-
 culties.  In the opinion of the Economio Counselor, US Embassy Nanking,
 inflation is in its "final stages" with prices rapidly becoming meaningless;
 also Embassy sources have verified the critical nature of the Central Bank's
 foreign exchange position and.the claims of thh Bank that it is unable to
 repay loans now due the Export-Import Bank, Bank of China, and most other
 commitments.

 Extreme shortage of currency was responsible for temporarily retarding a
 renewed runs-'way price wave which is expected to develop in a matter of
 days.     The ON $ blackmarket interest rates of from 60 to 90 percent per jUMQ
 drew currency from commodity markets into money markets.  The US dollar began
 to climb on the blackmarket over the week end,.reaching a high of CN $9 mil-

 reforms will be instituted this week no far-reaching improvement is seen for

 recent actions by the Indonesian Republican Government indicate greater
 distrust of the motives of the Dutch and pro-Dutch factions.
 (!n 2S July the Republican Government endorsed a nNational Program"
 which had been drafted by major political organizations including the
 leftist People's Democratic Front,  The Republican Government announced
 officially on 31 July that it could not support the resolution drafted
 and approved at the Bandoeng Conference attended by the heads of "n-
 Republican regimes.  The Rdpublie argued that the resolution allowed the
 Dutch to retain an of their former authority during the period prior to
 the establishment of a United States of Indonesia,  Failure of the Republic
 to consider this plan may widen the breach between Republican and non-
 Republican Indonesians since the latter group had counted heavily on
 Republican support in forcing the Dutch to make more liberal concession
 to Indonesian rulers?
 As an i miediate result, of these actions, leftist groups, which have
 been ozcluded from the present moderate government, may be expected to
 exert a greater influence in Republican areas.  Such a development will
 further complicate the work of the UN Good Offices Committee.

 SECTION III.   DIGEST OF IMPORTANT STUDIES AND ESTIMATES
 ,  n c s for a N   tiated Puce in
 The prospects for a negotiated peace in the near future between the    $RAa
 Chinese National Government under its present leadership and the Chinese
 Communists appear remote.  This does not preclude, however, an early
 cessation of hostilities in some of the presently active military theaters
 as a result of regional arrangements between opposing commanders.
 War-weariness and defeatism are widespread throughout Nationalist China,
 and although these sentiments have not yet been crystallized into a strong
 political force, no Nationalist leader can afford to ignore them.  So long as
 Chiang Kai-shek remains in office, however, compromise between the National
 Government and the Communists appears virtually impossible, Chiang being
 opposed to negotiations with the Communists and they with him.
 Chiangde position to-steadily deteriorating and his Government is in
 such "a precarious situation that its collapse or overthrow could occur at
 any time.  His ultimate fall is apparently inevitable, but the prospects of
 any single leader succeeding to a position with power comparable to that which
 Chiang now holds are remote.  Any successor to Chiang, in order to secure
 peace, would have to be willing to negotiate on the terms the Communists
 would demand, and would have to possess the leadership and military support
 to hold the central government together while promoting such a policy.  At
 the present time, no such leader has appeared.  Assuming that Chiang will not
 be replaced by any effective successor, and assuming further deterioration of
 the National Governaentee position, the probability is that before any peace
 negotiations can be undertaken, the Government will split into regional fac-
 tions which will be forced to capitulate separately to the Communists.
 Vthile the tralk of the people in Nationalist China feel that continued
 resistance against the Communists is hopeless and therefore pointless, to
 Chiang and his immediate followers, the fortunes of the Government may appear
 in a different light.  It ms  be a matter of years before the Communists can
 achieve total military victory, and before that time comes, Chiang probably
 fools that he can count on the incentive of presently guaranteed US aid,
 possible increased aid that might come.from a new US administration, and an
 "inevitable" US.-Soviet war in which the US would become his active ally.
 The Soviet Ambassador-has already made some overtures concerning a peace
 settlement to certain National Government officials.  Given an, opportune
 moment, the USSR would undoubtedly extend its good offices and attempt to
 exploit the dual advantages of a peacefully communized China, and the pro-
 paganda value accruing from apparent advocacy of world peace.
 A negotiated peace would have real advantages for the Communists.  But
 since they hold the military initiative and feel sure of final victory, they
 would probably insist on terms that would ensure their ultimate control of China.
