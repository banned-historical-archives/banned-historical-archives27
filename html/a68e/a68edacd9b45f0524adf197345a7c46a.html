 DCI BRIL:FINI FOR HOUSE
 AR"ILD SERVICES COMMITTEE
 Before turning to the subject of Communist China,I
 want to discuss briefly those elements of the
 Soviet political and economic situation which
 have a direct bearing on national power,  and
 then the Sino-Soviet dispute and the situation
 along the Sino-Soviet border.
 The Soviet Leadership
 I. The men who threw out Khrushchev more than two
 years ago have now had time to establish their
 policies, their relationships, and their method
 of operation.
 A.   What has emerged is essentially a collective
 leadership.
 1.  There has been a steady enlargement in
 the position of the Party Ceneral Secre-
 tary, Leonid Brezhnev.
 2.  The present leaders, however, are a blend
 of mixed interests and authority. They
 have held together remarkably well, but
 they have done it with undramatic,

 middle-of-the-road policies. The
 guiding principle appears to be: "Don't
 rock the boat."
 B.   Decisions are determined by compromise, and
 implemented with caution.
 1.   This avoids the erratic initiatives of
 Khrushchev's time,  and minimizes the
 risk of major failures.
 C.   The present leadership has not vet demonstrated,
 however,  that  it has designed a durable
 governmental machinery which can make the
 hard decisions and still avoid the tendency
 toward the one-man rule of the Stalin and
 Khrushchev eras.
 1.   Such highly political problems as economic
 reform and resource allocation have not
 been resolved.
 2.   And while the Kremlin outwardly maintains
 an image of collective leadership, the subtle
 struggle for power and position continues.
 Soviet Lconomy
 II.   The Soviet economy in some ways symbolizes this
 temporizing on the part of the leadership.   The
 same problems are still there; reforms are being
 attempted cautiously and gradually.   As an example,

 the U.S.S.R. is already in the second year of
 a  Five-Year Plan period, and the plan has not
 yet been put in final form and approved.
 A.   The Soviet economy is somewhat less than half
 the size of ours, and the Soviet Cross National
 Product in 1966 was about 45 percent of the
 U.S. CNP.
 1.  The CNP growth rate in Russia last year
 was 7 1/2 percent, but this was due to
 the largest grain crop in Soviet history.
 2.  The average growth rate of the preceding
 five years was 4 1/2 percent, and the
 outlook from now through 1970 is for
 about 4 to 5 1/2 percent increase each
 year.
 B. hhatever the problems, and whatever the
 achievements, we expect that the economy
 will give the military establishment whatever
 is considered necessary by the Kremlin for
 national security.
 Military Expenditures
 III.    Soviet spending for military purposes and space
 remained fairly stable from 1962 through 1965, but
 it increased an estimated 7 percent in 1966.   Its
 appears that another 4 percent will be piled on top

 of last year's increase in 1967.
 A.   The Soviets have announced a military
 budget for 1967 which  is the highest since
 l','orld Pear Ti.   It amounts to 14.5 billion
 rubles--an increase of 1.1 billion over
 the published figures for 1966.
 1.  The announced defense budget,  however
 includes only about 60 percent of the
 actual military expenditures.
 2.  !;c estimate that total Soviet defense
 spending in 1967 will be about 19.8
 billion rubles, or about 54 billion
 dollars in comparable terms.
 13.   Soviet spending for advanced military and
 space systems--and particularly for Research
 and Development--is growing much faster than
 the total defense budget.
 1.  As this chart shows, it more than doubled
 between 1958 and 1966.
 2.  These programs demand the best and
 scarcest resources in plant, material,
 and skilled technology.   The military
 demand for these resources highlights
 the whole resource allocation problem in
 the Soviet Union.   But we expect that the

 military and space ; ro,,rai,is will continue
 to have first call on available resources.
 Soviet Relations with the United States
 I1'.  I want to touch on just two facets of Soviet
 foreign policy--.Soviet relations with the United
 States, and the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 V. On the question of relations with the United
 States, the public stance of the Soviet leaders
 at present is that it is difficult to make any
 progress in resolving issues with a nation which
 is attacking their Communist brethren in North
 Vietnam.
 A. This position is dictated to a degree by the
 role which support of the North Vietnamese
 has come to play in the Sino-Sovict dispute.
 1.   It is also, of course, a handy pretext
 by which the Russians can require the
 overtures to come from us.
 B.   In fact, however, there has been some progress
 on issues not affecting Vietnam--for instance,
 the recent civil air and space agreements, and
 the  indications that it may be possible to
 agree on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
 C.   In private, Soviet leaders have used numerous
 opportunities to emphasize that they want to

 Approved For Release 2003/10/0SE,W82R00025R000800030004-1
 avoid any showdown with Washington over the
 Vietnamese issue.
 D.   The Kremlin leaders realize that if there is
 going to be any meaningful progress along the
 lines of their national interests in such
 matters as European security, arms control,
 and East-West trade, sooner or later they are
 going; to have to resume the dialogue with the
 United States.
 E.   I have no doubt that the Soviet leaders are
 delighted to see the United States bogged
 down in Southeast Asia, and that they will
 continue to give the North Vietnamese any
 aid which involves no major risk for the
 Soviet  Union.
 F.   They do not, however, wish a direct Soviet-U.S.
 confrontation, and it is clear that they want
 to keep their lines of communication with
 Washington open and working.
 The Sino-Soviet Dispute
 VI.   As for the Sino-Soviet dispute, the dominating
 factor in Soviet foreign policy today is that
 relations between Moscow and Peking have hit
 rock bottom.

 A.   The Chinese have done their hest in recent
 weeks to goad  Moscow into making a full
 diplomatic break.
 1.  In mid-February, Peking eased up a bit
 on some of the harassing tactics,
 but the Chinese had already demonstrated
 that they had it in their power to force
 every last Russian out of Peking---and
 they can exert that power at a moment's
 notice.
 2.    Each side would prefer not to take the
 final step in breaking diplomatic
 relations, but the Soviets probably have
 the most to lose.
 3.    A complete break could greatly complicate
 Moscow's problems in getting military aid
 through China to North Vietnam.
 4.    Virtually all Russian arms aid has taken
 this overland route, largely because of
 Soviet reluctance to risk a confrontation
 with the U. S. on the high seas.
 B.   If the Chinese can force the Soviets to break
 relations, they can then charge that the Soviets
 are to blame for any interruption in the delivery
 of military aid to North Vietnam.

 1.   China has already tried to exploit Soviet
 unwillingness to use the alternate sea
 route, charging the Russians with cowardice.
 2.   The Chinese probably believe that in a pinch
 the Soviets would still refuse to ship by sea,
 and thus would discredit themselves in Hanoi.
 C.   Moscow is preparing for the worst, carefully
 documenting the record in an effort to blame
 Peking if aid to Hanoi is disrupted.
 1.   An official Soviet statement on February 9
 accused Peking of "preventing, the solution
 of concrete questions," and Moscow has pub-
 lished charges that the Chinese are diverting,
 sabotaging, or re-labeling Soviet war materiel
 passing through China to North Vietnam.
 2.  Soviet propaganda media have blamed Chinese
 intransigence for the resumption of U.S.
 bombing on February 14.
 25X1 C          3.
 says Laos has granted
 overflight rights for Soviet aircraft to and
 from Hanoi as long as they carry no war
 materiel. One Soviet IL-18 transport went
 home by this route on February 10 when Peking
 was harassing Soviet flights, but no air route
 would be a feasible substitute for rail ship-
 ments through China.

 VII.  The Soviets would like to hang on in Peking,
 and may still hope to ride out the current crisis.
 A.   They would prefer, if at all possible, to
 keep some representation in China, on the
 slim chance that at some point they could
 exert some influence on the direction of the
 current upheaval.
 B.   Perhaps more important, Moscow clearly is
 unwilling to make it easier for China to deny
 it overland access to Hanoi.
 C.   The USSR has already gone to great lengths
 to maintain a presence in China,.
 1.   When the Soviet embassy in Peking was
 placed under virtual siege, most of the
 dependents were flown home, but the same
 aircraft brought in tons of food, and
 tough young guards to patrol the embassy
 grounds.   The Russians even turned their
 swimming pool into a water reservoir in
 case the Chinese should cut off utilities.

 I. The situation along the Sino-Soviet border provides
 evidence that ^'ioscow considers the dispute with
 China a genuine cause for concern.
 A.   The Soviets have been strengthening their
 military positions along the border For the
 past 18 months.
 1.   The build-up has been gradual, and looks
 more like a reflection of contingency
 planning than a crash effort in reaction
 to recent developments.
 2.   We have no hard evidence of any major
 clashes along the frontier, although there
 have been persistent reports from both
 'loscow and Peking of scattered incidents.
 B.   The Russians have added as many as 35,000
 ground troops and several thousand border guards
 to their relatively loan military positions near
 China and 11ongolia since 1963. The bull: of the
 build-up has taken place since October, 1965.
 1.   The four military districts bordering on China
 now have about 275,000 ground force troops.

 DCI BRIEFING FOR HOUSE
 ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE
 COMMUNIST CHINA
 Introduction
 I.  Before I take up Communist China's advanced weapons
 and conventional military forces, I want to discuss
 the "cultural revolution" that has been shaking the
 country, because it provides a fantastic background
 for the continued progress of Peking's military
 establishment, and at the same time imposes certain

 B.   This is what is known as "Mao's thoughts."
 In China today, they are credited with almost
 miraculous power, although for the most part
 they are a collection of tired old cliches
 like "all power comes out of the barrel of a
 gun," or "be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and
 and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

 C.   Even the Russians, who have been known to quote
 Marx and Lenin, find Mao's thought a bit silly.
 Pravda cited the case of a Chinese who commented
 that if a man didn't know how to climb a pole,
 studying Mao's thoughts would hardly help
 him do it.   The man was denounced and purged
 because evervbodv in China knows that "a study
 of Chairman Mao's work gives immediate results."

 doctors successfully sewed back a finger
 which had been cut off because they had

 were therefore able to shoot down a

 an arm, a leg, and several ribs in a fall

 Chinese Political Developments
 1. Communist China is being racked by the  great-
 est political convulsions since Mao Tse-tung
 took control in 1949.
 A.   Mao, at 73,  is aging, sick, and more and
 more inflexible.
 1.   He is clearly concerned that his Com-
 munist Party is losing the revolu-
 tionary zeal of its early days, and
 cannot be relied on to keep China on
 the right track after he is gone.
 2.   The teen-aged millions of the Red Guard
 are supposed to re-kindle that zeal
 with their youthful and unbridled en-
 thusiasm.
 B.    To Mao Tse-tung,  the cultural revolution
 is             primarily a drive to re-shape
 the Communist Party, or replace it with a
 more reliable, more fanatical, and younger
 version.

 C.   But for the men who aspire to succeed Mao,
 it has become a naked struggle for power
 and for survival.
 II.  It is difficult to determine from day to day
 where the cultural revolution stands, who is
 on which side, or who is going to come out on top.
 A.   The prime mover for several months was
 Defense "sinister Lin Piao  (Lin Beeow),
 Mao's designated successor.
 1.   As soon as Lin was proclaimed Mao's
 heir-apparent last August, he began
 driving to unseat any potential rivals.
 2.   His immediate targets were the two men
 who have been at the top of the party
 machinery, Chief of State Liu Shao-chi
 (Lyew Shaho-chee) and the general secretary,
 Teng Ilsiao-ping (Dung Shecow-ping).
 3.   Lin appeared to have won a victory when
 Madame Mao and other leaders began denoun-
 cing Liu and Teng savagely at rallies in
 Peking last December.
 B.    Subsequent developments, however, suggest that
 Liu may have lost the initiative to Premier
 Chou En-lai (Joe Un-lie).
 1.   Lin hasn't made a major public speech since
 early November, and dropped from public view
 in late November.

 2.   Lin's name shows up in print much less
 now than it did last fall.
 3.   Lin has been in chronic poor health for years,
 and this may have contributed to his apparent
 political decline.
 C.   Chou En-lai, on the other hand, has been the
 dominant figure in Peking in recent weeks.
 1.   lie has been issuing directives on how to
 conduct the "cultural revolution," and has
 even been ordering Lin's troops around to
 settle disputes between Red Guards and local
 authorities.
 III.   Early in January, the leadership struggle entered
 a critical phase.
 A.   Evidence began appearing that the army was
 less than monolithic in its loyalty to Mao
 and Lin.
 1.   On January 11, for instance, the cultural
 revolution group which was supposed to be
 purging the military leadership was itself
 purged, and was replaced by a new and
 presumably trustworthy group of 18 men.
 Within a week, however, two or three members
 of this new group were themselves under
 attack on ideological grounds.
 B.   At about the same time, several military commanders
 in crucial positions were denounced for having
 Approved For Release 2003/10 95
 Approved For Release 2003/10              T00025R000800030004-1
 plotted a coup. They included the commander and
 the political commissar of the Peking garrison,
 the commander of armored forces, a member of the
 party's powerful Military Affairs Committee, and
 a number of key commanders in the provinces.
 C.   A number of top regional party officials were
 accused of having joined in the plot.   The most
 important was Tao Chu (Taho joo) who was both the
 party boss of the Central-South region, in Canton,
 and number four man for a while in the inner circle
 of Peking leaders.   'l'ao was very active in Pekin
 right up to the time of his downfall at the end
 of December.
 D.   We don't know the full story, but we suspect that
 ?Jao and Lin may in fact have had a very close shave
 in December or January.
 E.   The opposition aligned against then was a formidable
 group, and it did not give up without a struggle.
 1.  For several weeks after the turn of the year,
 there were disorders throughout China, as Tao's
 opponents incited strikes and riots, and managed
 to disrupt transportation and production.
 F.    It is now evident, however, that the opposition
 has been largely suppressed.   T1any of its leaders
 have been arrested, or are in hiding, and Peking
 is working out an accommodation with several
 provincial leaders.

 1.  Reports of fighting and disorder dropped
 off sharply in February.
 2.  'lost of the incidents now involve clashes
 between groups of unruly Red Cuards.
 3.  The army has been ordered to bring these
 groups under control, and some of the more
 militant Red Guard organizations are being;
 disbanded.
 IV.   This return to a more orderly situation indicates that
 most key military commanders remained loyal to the
 present political leaders in Peking.
 A.   The course of developments indicates, however,
 that their loyalty was secured only after Peking
 shifted to more moderate tactics in the power
 struggle.
 1.   It is also significant that in January,
 before the army took an effective role, the
 major responsibility for running the cultural
 revolution shifted to Chou, who is not only
 a competent compromiser, but more flexible
 and more reasonable than either `lao or Lin.
 B.   The steam does seem to be going out of the cul-
 tural revolution. Its excesses could be attributed
 to a considerable degree to the volatile and unruly
 youngsters who made up the Red fuard.

 1.   Now a February 19 directive of the Central
 Committee has ordered the secondary schools
 reopened on March first.  What's more, the
 schools have been told to concentrate on the
 academics and not spend too much time studying
 Mao's writings when they do reopen.
 C.   A word of caution is in order about the day-to-day
 reporting of the recent turmoil from Tokyo, from
 Hong Kong, and from the handful of foreign
 correspondents in China, who are virtually
 confined to Peking itself:
 1.  The Chinese Communists do a great deal of
 their talking in metaphor and hyperbole.
 Some of the reports of pitched battles may
 have arisen from the use of military language
 to describe what was essentially a street brawl
 between opposing political factions.
 2. Much of the reporting has relied on wall
 posters. Premier Chou Fn-lai's latest speeches
 have described them as irresponsible.
 3.   A great deal of this reporting can neither
 be confirmed nor refuted by the hard intelligence
 we get on what is actually happening.
 V.   There is little doubt, however, that many officials
 have fallen victim to the purge.
 A.   Order is being gradually restored, but it is too
 early to conclude that the situation has been

 Approved For Release 2003/SE  IA   PT2R00025R000800030004-1
 stabilized,
 B.   Mao's victory has been won at great cost--if
 it has been won. The party apparatus is all but
 shattered, and the purge has left a legacy of
 mistrust and bitterness among the surviving
 leaders,
 C.   If Chou En-lai manages to consolidate his position,
 and emerges as the dominant figure, the trend of
 recent weeks toward moderation and reasonableness
 will probably continue.   It is conceivable that
 Chou has already achieved a considerable degree
 of control.
 D.   At this point, however, there is little hard evidence
 that Mao has lost his ultimate control to the
 more moderate elements.
 1.   As long as Mao remains the leader of Chinese
 Communism, he can be expected at any time
 to renew his attempt to reshape society along
 radical lines.
 2.   This would certainly renew the turmoil and
 the infighting among top leaders.
 VI.   Thus the long-range effect of the cultural revolution
 remains up in the air, but there are two points which
 we can make:
 First, until 'lao goes and a new leader has firmly
 consolidated his succession, China's leaders
 will be divided and in conflict.   They will find

 it difficult to agree on any new policy lines,
 so we do not expect any radical departure from
 existing policies.
 Second,  whoever wins, we can see no reason to expect
 any dilution of Peking's implacable hostility
 toward the United States.
 For some time to come, however, the Chinese Communists
 will probably suffer from a cultural revolution
 hangover that could limit their capacity to engage
 in foreign adventures.

 I.     The Chinese Communists are making a concerted
 effort--on their own and with overriding priori-
 ties--to develop modern weapons for strategic
 attack.   They are devoting increasing resources
 to missiles and nuclear weapons.
 A.     In 1966,  they conducted their third,  fourth

 weapon for the IL-28 BEAGLE light jet
 bomber.  The Chinese have about 250 of
 these aircraft, which have a better chance
 of reaching a defended target than the
 BULLs.
 3.   At present, the Chinese have a very
 limited supply of fissionable material.
 Until the Yumen facility comes into
 production, China is in poor position to
 carry on an active testing program, and
 build any substantial stockpile of weap-
 ons at the same time.

 any weapons they might make now would be crude
 and inefficient by our standards. By Far
 Eastern standards, however, they are a
 significant addition to Chinese military
 prestige.

 CHINESE CONVENTIONAL MILITARY FORCES
 I.      Despite Chinese progress in advanced weapons,
 the military power of Communist China for some
 years to come will derive primarily from the
 numerical strength of its enormous ground forces---
 about 2,300,000 men---and great reserves of manpower.
 II.      There are more than 100 infantry divisions and
 about a dozen armor and artillery divisions in the
 Chinese Communist Army, concentrated in the heavily
 populated regions of eastern China.
 A.   The Chinese Army probably has the capability
 to overrun any of its mainland neighbors,
 provided it does not run into significant
 opposition from a major power.
 1.   It has demonstrated its ability to move
 and fight with primitive transportation
 and rudimentary logistic support.
 2.   The Chinese are hampered by shortages
 of armor, heavy ordnance, mechanized
 transport, and fuel.

 CHINESE EXPECTATIONS OF WAR
 1.      Peking's public stance remains as belligerent
 as ever, but behind this posturing the Chinese
 have been cautious to hold down the risks of a
 direct military clash with the United States.
 A.   This is not to say that Peking has been
 bluffing.   We believe that there
 are three situations in which the. Chinese
 would feel obliged to intervene:
 1.   One of these would arise from U.S..
 air strikes against targets in China.
 In May 1965, Chinese Foreign Minister
 25X1 C
 to pass along a warning to this
 effect.
 2.   The second circumstance which would
 trigger Chinese intervention would be
 a major U.S. invasion of North Vietnam.
 Chinese leaders passed this word to a

 3.   In addition, if the collapse of the Hanoi
 Government should seem imminent, China
 would probably move into North Vietnam
 to "restore order."
 B.      It is always dangerous to assume that the
 Chinese are going to be guided by rational
 decisions, but we believe that Peking is
 bound to feel that the domestic political
 turmoil and the intensification of the
 dispute with Moscow leave  China less
 ready than it might otherwise be to engage
 in direct hostilities with the United States.
 C.   Another factor which would contribute to
 increased Chinese caution would be a growing
 conviction in Peking that the United States
 is determined to persevere, over the short
 run at least, in the Vietnamese war.
 D.   We think,  therefore, that the threshold of
 sensitivity--the level at which Peking would
 feel forced to fight--has probably been
 raised a degree or two.
 1.   For example, a shallow incursion by US
 troops into the DMZ might be less likely
 today to trigger an immediate Chinese reac-
 tion than it would have been in 1965.

 II.    There are no indications that the Chinese regard
 a US attack as a likely contingency in the near
 future--either as a result of a US initiative,
 or by a US reaction to some new Chinese move.
 A.      Chinese military deployments reflect deliberate
 efforts to carry out long-range plans to
 strengthen Chinese defenses, rather than
 urgent preparation for war.
 B.      We have also noted that Chinese air defense
 preparations do not reflect any of the
 "crash" nature they might have if the
 Chinese believed war to be imminent.
 1.    Defenses are being prepared around key
 factories, and there have been instances
 of relocation to the interior.
 2.    Some cities,  in fact, have implemented
 programs aimed at the evacuation of
 non-essential residents.  This, however,
 reflects a continuing campaign to combat
 the population movement from the farms
 to the cities.
 3.    By and large, there is no-     general and.
 concerted civil defense preparation.

 C.    Even along the southern border with Vietnam.
 Peking has been very cautious in its reaction
 to US air operations.
 1.   On many occasions Chinese aircraft have
 not reacted to limited U.S. overflights
 of Chinese territory.
 2.   On May 8,  1966, Chinese MIGs crossed
 the border for the first time to attack
 US fighter-bombers over Vietnam.   Peking
 was apparently trying to probe the U.S.
 reaction to an extension of the Chinese
 air defense umbrella a short distance over
 North Vietnam.
 3.   An inadvertent overflight of Chinese
 territory by U.S. aircraft four days
 later, during which a Chinese MIG was
 shot down, was apparently taken by Peking
 as a deliberate U.S. warning that we
 would not tolerate Chinese air protection
 of North Vietnam.  Since that time, the
 Chinese have been even more cautious in
 their reaction to US flights.
 D.    Chinese propaganda concerning Vietnam has
 decreased in volume over the past twelve
 months.

 1.   Chinese statements concerning the
 "inevitability" of war with the US
 now appear only infrequently.
 2.   Peking has made no mention of "volunteers"
 for Vietnam since the fall of 1965, except
 for brief flurries last summer and again in
 December. after bombinss in the area of
 Hanoi and Haiphong.
 3.   Peking has always said that the Vietnamese
 must bear the primary responsibility for
 fighting;  in recent months this theme
 has been given more emphasis.
 In June 1966, Foreign Minister Chen Yi asked the
 to pass to the United
 States Government the following :four points which
 Premier Chou En-lai had made earlier in an interview
 with a Pakistani journalist:
 A.   Peking will never start a war with the US.
 B.   China will continue to support countries
 "threatened" by the US.
 C.   China is prepared for an escalation of the war.
 D.   If the US extends the war to China, there will
 be a war without limits.
 E.   We think these four points are probably an
 accurate statement of Peking's current position.
