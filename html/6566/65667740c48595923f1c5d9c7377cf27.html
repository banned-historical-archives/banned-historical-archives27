By Rlorested E. Vivira 
Despite press 'speculation a 'peace 
agreement for Vietnam may soon be con-
cluded, there is concrete evidence indicating 
the U.S. is planning to prolong the conflict 
.and will attempt to subvert any peace ac-
cords. 
U.S. procrastination in - Paris, intensified 
bombing and the huge shipments of arms to 
Saigon, among other developments, are all 
indicators that the ,White House has no 
desire for true peace and has not abandoned 
its neo-colonial designs in Indochina. 
An even more ominous proof of U.S. 
intentions of maintaining its puppet regimes 
in Indochina, .was the apparent effort by 
presidential envoy Henry Kissinger to press 
Saigon's "demands" in Paris at the end of 
November, which would have virtually 
scrapped the agreement reached in October 
by Kissinger and Le Due Tho of the DRV: 
_ 
There have been various hypotheses put 
forward in the Western press concerning 
Kissinger's seeming about-face on behalf of 
Saigon, after proclaiming in October before 
the world that "peace is at hand." Nearly 
every possible explanation has been 
proposed by the pundits except the most 
plausible one. The U.S stalling in Paris does 
not represent any deference to its Saigon 
puppets, but rather it is for the purposes of 
U.S. policy and the Saigon regime is merely 
an instrument. U.S. expressions of "support" 
for Saigon's policies, now as in the past, to 
the extent they are not fictions for deceiving 
American opinion, are fundamentally ex-
pressions of the aims and designs of the U.S. 
G nira time 
In essence, American procrastination in 
Paris has been an effort to gain time for 
augmenting Saigon's war machine and 
setting up a hype clandestine network of 
"civilian advisors" which will attempt to 
pitOlorig the iarunnle in Vietnam, as well as in 
the rest of Indochina, after formal peace 
anretraents have been reached. 
"Even as the U.S. military is packing up 
for its expected exit ' from Vietnam, 
American officials here are secretly plan-
ning a major postwar presence of U.S. 
civilians in Vietnam, with many of them 
doing jobs formerly done by the military," 
wrote Fox Butterfield in a report from 
Saigon in the Nov. 27 New York Times. 
Without' alluding to the delay in Paris, 
Butterfield noted that the U.S. is in the 
process of augmenting its "civilian advisory" 
force in Vietnam, from 5000 to 10,000, its 
peak level at the stage of maximum U.S. 
military presence in Vietnam. But it should 
be apparent that this "advisory" apparatus 
could not be assembled overnight, anymore 
than the enormous flow of 'U.S. arms could 
be brought to Saigon in a day. Saigon's air 
force was increased , two-fold, from ap-
proximately 1030 to 2030 aircraft during the 
pest two montias, to give only one item of 
U.S. supply effort. 
To place recent developments in their 
proper perspective, it must be noted that 
there has been a major shift in U.S. strategy 
ect in motion last spring in the wake of tine 
lone-sustained offensive by the Liberation 
Armed Forties in South Vietnam. . 
DeEpite administration efforts to play 
down the Strength of the offensive, it is 
evident that once again the whole. U.S. 
strategy for victory in Vietnam was smashed. 
Only the most drastic U.S. measures of the 
war prevented the complete collapse of the 
Salp,on regime and its armed forces: the 
blockade of the DRV, the greatest aerial 
escalation against the DRV and liberated 
areas of South Vietnam (while heavy 
bombing of Laos and Cambodia was 
sustained), and unprecedented' aerial tac-
tical and logistics support for the Saigon 
forces. 
The augmentation of the U.S. air logistics 
support .fer� Saigon's forces during the of-
fensive surged from a monthly average of 
about nine million pounds of cargo before 
the offensive to 60 million pounds in-May. 
Auraented U.S. "support" for Saigon after 
the offensive began, raised total U.S. ex-
penditures on the war by an annual rate of 
approximately 510 billion or nearly double 
the rate .prior to the offensive. 
� The Nixon administration concealed this 
augmentation by requesting additional war 
funding only for the period ending Sept. 30. 
At about the same time the administration 
presented Congress with a request for these 
funds in June-, Air America and Continental 
Air Services, the CIA contractual "civilian" 
airlines, began stepping up recruiting among 
Air Force personnel in Indochina, according 
to a Dec.1 report of Dispatch News Service, 
by John Burgess. He quoted from a con-
fidentinl recruiting brochure which, among 
other points, stated; 
Cletsdestiaac warfare � � 
"The flyina, is non-military; in other words, 
civilian flying. You are flying for the U.S. 
government, that is government amencjes 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO27924 
sucn as Li um. uonfu, uoio, etc. vv iile 
these agencies may be under CIA direction, 
you don't know and you don't care. The 
government agencies direct the routings and 
schedulings, your company provides the 
techinical know-how and you fiy the air.-
The brochure makes it clear that "civilian 
flying" is merely a cover for clandestine 
military activity: "Although flights mainly 
serve U.S. offiical personnel movement and 
native officials and civilians, you sometimes 
engage in the movement of friendly troops, 
on of enemy captives; or in the transport of 
care() more potent than rice and beans! 
There's a war going . on. Use your 
imagination!" 
In what Burgess describes as a 
"hastily"addcd postreipt, the brochure 
states: "Foreign aid situation unclear 
pending outcome military situation in Rvil 
(Republic. of Vietnam), but it looks as if we'll 
finish the war (and peace terms favorable for 
our side); if so, it is expeeted that a boom 
among contract operators will result. ... . " 
In other words, here we have the first 
.concrete indication that the White House 
was jinplicitly admitting defeat of its 
"Vietnernitettion" program and reverting to 
a less costly program of clandestine warfare: 
The U.S. strategy shift was probably equally 
dictated by a desire to further diminish the 
polltieaiimpeet of the war on American 
opieion -and finally by a desire to diminish 
tite blow to U.S. prestige in the event of 
if:tit-mete failure, that is the collapse of the 
peeinet regimes. 
.1 U.S. is clearly trying to stave off this 
development as long as possible, but it also 
wants to avoid the impression of being 
engaged in direct and large-scale U.S. in-
tervention at the time, which sooner or later 
Nixon and Kissinger must know is inevitable. 
Even if they cannot face this reality, they 
are now in deadly earnest about maintaining 
support for the puppet regimes, regardless of 
any peace -agreement. If the U.S. honestly 
adhered to a peace agreement, Saigon's 
political collapse would quickly follow. That 
is why the U.S. is stepping up clandestine 
support for the Saigon regime, military aid 
disnuised as civilian "contractual" aid, 
provided mainly by U.S, private military 
contractors. 
There is a relationship between the U.S. 
arms build-up Indochina and the program 
or secret contractual aid. Before the Dc' 
tober peace agreement, the U.S. made little 
effort to. keep the program ' secret. In 
testimony before the Senate Appropriations 
Committee on Sept. 13,.Air Force Maj. Gen. 
Joseph It. DeLuca explained in detail U.S. 
, plans for contracting for personnel to train 
Saigon Air Force members. In the area of 
maintenance alone, the U.S. was planning to 
make contracts for $54 million of one to 
three years to train Saigon personnel, ac-
cording to DeLuca.

No doubt some kind . of simulated cease-fire will ix 
patched up in Vietnam, and probably before the end 
of the year; failure to achieve anything would be too cm-
barrassing for the Administration. It will be a militan 
stand-still without a political foundation or, . in propel 
bureaucratese, infrastructure. So it is quite natural that, 
in an adaptation of Clausewitz's famous saying,. it wil: 
be war carried on by other means. A .recent report from 
Saigon by George McArthur, headlined in the Los Angelo 
Times: "Vietnam Future: U. S. Planners Thinking Big," 
gives .a printout of the future. 
McArthur leads off his dispatch with the not veri 
surprising news that, while the negotiations proceed by 
fits and starts in Paris,. U. S. bureaucrats in Saigon "arc 
confidently using the time to blue-print empires in South 
Vietnam." Some of them have acquired villas there; they 
find the climate congenial, and would like to stay on, 
enjoying the good life to which they have grown accus-
tomed. It is impossible to get any accurate estimate 
of how many U. S. civilians are hanging out in South 
.Vietnam with some kind of official connection with 
the American Embassy, or the armed forces, or intelli-
gence, or whatever, else in the way of ."programs" may 
be Under way. And if. that is impossible, how can any-
one estimate what number of bodies will be required 
to carry on a simulated peace? The only thing certain 
is that proliferation is under way; the bureaucrats are 
"thinking big." "No single person or headquarters," 
writes McArthur, "seems to be running the show. Things 
are just growing, strangely enough, in a somewhat 
microscopic .replay of the great buildup of 1965." Of 
course, .microscopic can turn into macroscopic. The 
planners, at first stunned by Kissinger's forecast that 
"peace" was close at hand, are regaining their vigor and 
redoubling their efforts. They intend to stay on.� 
Clothes may not make the man, but they can make 
him look different, and by all indications such transfor-
mations will be taking place on a large scale. It takes 
only a few minutes and some pieces of paper to change 
a colonel in uniform into a civilian bureaucrat in color-
ful sport shirt and slacks. Or he may. be nominally a 
civilian already, a Central Intelligence Agency type, striv-
ing to win the hearts and minds of the people. In ad-
dition to CIA, AID, CORDS and other organizations 
whose full names are rarely used, the United States now 
has four consulates in South Vietnam. McArthur pre-
� diets that these peace-loving, offices, complete with mili-
tary attaches, State Department political officers, CIA 
operatives, et at., will be installed permanently 'at Can 
Tho, Nha Trang, Bien Hoa and Da. Nang�"by cointi-
dence" the present locations of headquarters for. the four 
Army corps of the million-man South Vietnamese Army. 
Four consulates may be thought a reasonable number, 
since. in France, with 50 million Frenchmen and hordes 
of U.S. tourists, we have five consulates in all. 
There is also a legal side to this. orgy of preparation 
fOr "peace"; it centers in Washington. Having had prac-
tically nothing to say about the start of the war, Con-
gress may want to be in at the finish. Constitutionally, 
this is no simple matter. Since we do not recognize North 
Vietnam, except for the purposes of killing and bombing; 
an agreement with Hanoi would not be a treaty and the 
Senate would have nothing to say about it. But we do 
recognize South Vietnam, so if they sign, wouldn't that 
constitute a treaty? Some lawyers think so, but it is a safe 
bet that President Nixon will not. As Commander in Chief 
he can order a cease-fire at his pleasure. 
Sen. J. William Fulbright thinks an agreement to e.nd 
the war should be submitted to the Senate for its scru-
tiny. But the Senate wants a cease-fire and will doubt-
less be reluctant to appear to be meddling in the inter-
minable negotiations. All the same, the time will come 
when the Senate must insist on 'a say. "I would assume," 
Senator Fulbright observes, "any agreement would in-
volve obligations to spend several billions of dollars, a 
commitment that should be submitted to the' Congress." 
And. further, "with these' secret agreements, we find so 
often that they, have obligations on our treasury or to 
send troops abroad, so it seems only fair that Congress 
have a chance to examine them." If Congress hopes to 
maintain some degree of control over what happens in 
Vietnam after a cease-fire, it should note what is happen-
ing there now. 'The bureaucrats are "thinking big" and 
will no doubt set programs in motion without initial 
Congressional approval, and then, as in the past, gamble 
that they can induce the Senate and House to continue 
and even expand them. So the time for vigilance is now.

New LS Buildup in Vietnam� 
President Nixon has reduced the American mill= 
tary forces in Vietnam from almost 600,000 in the 
'.first months of his Presidency to 25,200. The num-
ber now is frozen pending clarification of where the 
- - 
Paris peace talks are going. But the remaining 
troops are organized for withdrawal on a 57-day 
.schedule to conform with the 60-day limit written 
Into the nine-point peace plan tentatively agreed on 
two months ago. 
At the same time, the United States is quietly and 
� slowly building up its civilian forces in South Viet-
- nam, actively recruiting additional personnel, re-
portedly authorizing the transfer of some soldiers 
to civilian status, alerting Indochina experts now in 
other posts that they soon may be sent to Vietnam. 
� � Unofficial estimates indicate that a civilian force of 
as many as 10,000 Americans is being prepared for 
� Vietnam. 
There is no official explanation because, official-
.)y, there is only a denial of such a buildup. But it is 
clear from some of the categories being recruited 
.that the new band of Americans in mufti will be 
- doing in the future some of the things that Ameri-
cans in uniform are doing now, including such 
tasks as operating computers for the Saigon milita-
' ry 'command, advising troops in action, repairing, 
.servicing and perhaps flying combat and transport 
aircraft, and assisting with espionage and sabo-
'4age. 
To put it bluntly, there is evidence. that the 
American government has no intention of ending 
�American involvement in Indochina, that it is only 
_working to convert the involvement to the form.. 
that prevailed before the massive buildup and di-
-red; battlefield role of 1965 and 1966. 
If this is the intention, it is time for Mr. Nixon to 
be very clear about it. It must be explained. It must 
,be debated. The ultimate decision must represent 
the will of Congress, a national consensus. 
As matters now stand, we know of no good rea- . 
� 
son to justify the buildup. 
Of course, it can be argued that there are not 
enough skilled Vietnamese to operate the sophisti-
cated Weapons and instruments of war that were 
given.them by the United States. But the point is 
that peace, not war, is to be waged now. 
Of course, it can be argued that President Nguy-
en Van Thieu will be weaker without the Ameri-
cans, more vulnerable to overthrow, and it can be 
anticipated that there will be cheating on a cease-
fire, and perhaps no absolute peace for years and 
years. But it is no more reasonable to propose a , 
prolongation of the American commitment than to 
advocate the right of Hanoi to recruit advisers 
from Moscow and Peking. 
Aid there must be, aid both to the north and the 
south, a reconstruction of Vietnam, regardless of 
ideology and political commitment, but not aid that 
is a screen to preserve American influence and pro- . 
long American commitment. 
It is not in the American interest to talk, as 
American officials now are talking, of enlarging 
the number of U.S. consulates in South Vietnam 
and placing them just where U.S.- Army corps � 
headquarters have been operating. It is a travesty 
to suggest that the military attache in the U.S. Em-
bassy requires "hundreds" on his staff. There is no 
logic to recruiting a 100-man team of Americans to 
monitor the cease-fire unless the United States 
would be looking for an excuse to reenter the hos-
tilities. It is follylo leave even a suspicion that the 
reconstruction contractors may be operatives of 
the CIA. 
Mr. Nixon sought office in 1968' and reelection in � 
1972 on a commitment to get out of Vietnam. That 
is what the American people understand is being 
arranged in Paris. That is what the American peo-
ple have shown so clearly that they want. 
� They want to get out not just because they are 
weary of the war, not just because they now recog-
nize the madness of the war. They want to get out 
because they now know that this is not and never 
was their business. It is not for the Americans, it is 
for the Vietnamese to decide the future of Viet-
nam�the Vietnamese by themselves, not through 
the-mask of a new and clandestine army of Ameri-
cans.

Ever since the Supreme Court held 
that the relationship between aereporter 
and his sources was not privileged (that 
is, protected from scrutiny on the model 
of the lawyer-client connection), there 
has been a great deal of discussion 
- about curbs on freedom of the press. 
This controversy was intensified when 
the Supreme Court held that a Harvard 
assistant professor, Samuel Popkin, had 
to answer a grand jury's questions on 
the Pentagon Papers or go to jail for 
contempt. A handcuffed Popkin was 
seen en route to prison. (He was sub-
sequently freed.) 
There are two aspects of this problem, 
one of which has been almost entirely 
overlooked. Understandably, emphasis 
has been placed on the moral obligatioa 
� of a ,newsman to protect a confidential 
source.. (Or, in Popkin's case, on the 
duty of a...scholar to safeguard his infor-
mants.) But very little has been said 
about the inherent dangers � to journal-
ism as to scholarship � of using unveri-
fiable sources. 
Let us look first at the legal issue, 
which is historically simple. In the 
American majoritarian tradition there 
Were no inherently privileged relation-
ships. Indeed, the very foundation of a 
democratic order is that every citizen is 
a cop, that laws are enforced by the citi-
zenry not by the police. This major-

vigilantism, would only tolerate privi-

utory approval. Given the role of law-
yers in politics, the first privilege to re-
ceive general acceptance was - that be-
tween lawyer and client. 
Contrary to supposition, the doctor-pa-
tient and minister-parishioner relation-
ships have largely rested on custom, not 
statute. Indeed, a case can be made that 
to privide special privilege to the priest 
or minister Icould violate the separation 
of church and state. In practice it is 
hard to conceive of a grand jury throw-
ing a priest in jail for protecting the se-
crets of the confessional. However, not 
more than a year or so ago in New York 
a psychiatrist was forced to testify, the 
state courts holding (correctly) that only � 
a statue could'provide immunity. 
The answer to the press' (and Dr. 
Popidn's) problem then (as the Supreme 
Court pointed out) is an act of Congress 
stipulating immunity for the reporter or � 
the scholar. In the meantime reporters 
or professors who choose to protect their 
sources just have to take certain risks, 
and in the process thank God they are 
not dealing with British judges, who 
really throw the contempt power around. 
But what about the other side of this 
matter the growing use of unverifiable 
"confidential sources"? Of course, jour-
nalists have done th'is routinely for 
years. 
It is a practice I try to avoid because, 
having been one, I are suspicious of the 
motives of "high White House sources,"

who are normally trying to play the 
press like a salmon. However, with: the 
advent of "instant history," we now find 
whole volumes whick at crucial eviden-
tial points rests on a "confidential 
source." Or worse perhaps, on no eitred 
source whatsoever 
Imagine my interest when, in Herbert 
Parmet's "Eisenhower and the Amen-
can Crusadcs," I learned that "one- of 
Dulles' closest confidants" had reVealed 
that Ngo Dinh Diem was "discovered" 
by the CIA and "rammed" into office in 
1954 by John Foster Dulles. Later V:T 
are told that during President; Eisen-
hower's 1955 heart attack. Dulles was 
the "quarterback," that `!nothing, was 
done without . his approval." This is in-
teresting because 1) it sounds like Dul-
les' view of his own role, and 2) it is in 
contradiction to what others have said. 
Good, let's find out check footnote 
"Confidential source." Thanks a lot; ; 
Parmet, however, is a small-time Op-
erator when it comes to "confidential 
- Sources." David Halherstam has just 
turned out a 665-page book on the Ken-
nedy-Johnson era in which a number of 
people are quoted in extraordinary fash-
ion, and even more non-people (a "John-
son aide," a "Kennedy confidant," etc.) 
turn up saying the strangest (but sing-
ularly useful from Halberstam's view-
point) things. There is not a single foot-
note in the book! I suppose if you can't

the victor marchetti story 
by jams otis 
"I'm a scoutmaster" says Victor 
Marchetti. He is, in fact, more than a 
scoutmaster. 
Until 1969 he was executive assis-
tant to the deputy director of Central 
Intelligence, Admiral Rufus Taylor. 
More 'recently, he has been the subject 
of a legal case which could crack open � 
the darkest recesses of America's clan-
destine government. "I am the kind 
of a guy who manages Little League 
teams," he goes on. "Well, my scouts 
and ball players began to grow up on 
me and they became draft age. They 
let their hair grow; they changed. Now 
I know these were good boys, and 
they started to get to rue. They began 
saying, 'I'm not going to go and get 
shot in Vietnam, because it's an unjust 
war.' " Doubts, gnawing doubts about 
Vietnam and the CIA's role in foreign 
affairs. He -says that he saw himself 
becoming a lifer, an intelligence bu-
reaucrat, and he "didn't want to play 
the game any longer." After 14 years 
as 'a spy for America, Marchetti quit. 
That was 1969. Now, in August, 
1972, in Washington, D. C., he sat in a 
Chinese restaurant � known as a place 
frequented by CIA agents. Far from 
the taciturn and glamorous killer, Mar-
chetti looked stolidly middle class, of 
conservative mien and � talkative 
manner. As he spoke, he furtively 
sized up the occupants of the other 
tables and mentally chronicled the 
comings and going of all patrons, pre-
sumably out of habit. Did he think the 
interview was being bugged? "It's not 
beyond them," he replied, his face a 
mixture of edginess and resignation. 
It had not always been like this. He 
had left the agency on the best of 
terms, his boss assuring him that he 
"had a home to come back to." "In 
the first year I was away, it was just as

if I was at the Agency. I was going to 
dinner parties ... we'd sit around and 
talk. In fact, I saw as much of Agency 
people as I did when I was working." 
But somewhere along the line he 
got the notion that he wanted to blow 
the whistle on the CIA: "I would go 
down to a shopping center and walk 
around. For the first time in 15 years, 
I began to look at a check-out clerk as 
a human being, instead of a check-out 
clerk. I got interested in people and 
my ideas about the Agency became 
firmer and sharper, and I began to 
Marchetti: Blowing the whistle 
focus on precisely what was bothering 
me." 
Victor Marchetti decided to write a 
book. While the process of writing can 
be a solitary and private experience, he 
could scarcely expect to scribble away, 
merrily exposing his former em-
ployers, without it coming to their 
horrified attention. True, the CIA's 
record has been afflicted with tragi-
comic vicissitudes, but it can pre-
sumably keep tabs on its own. � 
Within weeks of his book outline 
being shown to various New York 
publishers, the CIA obtained a copy 
through a source within the industry. 
It immediately sought, and received, a 
court injunction against any further 
revelation of the book's contents. The 
order additionally restrains Marchetti 
from even discussing the as yet un-
written book with his literary agent, 
publishers, or wife. It is an injunction 
of unprecedented scope�never before 
has the government gone to court to 
prevent former employees from speak-
ing or writing. At the heart of the case 
lies a basic conflict between the First 
Amendment guarantees of free speech 
and the government's interest in keep-
ing a lid on its various clandestine--and 
often illegal�activities. Provoked by 
the wave of "whistle-blowing" atten-
dant on Daniel Ellsberg's release of the 
Pentagon Papers, the conflict arises 
because of official activity which of-
fends the moral sensibilities of rather 
ordinary, and very loyal, publio ser-
vants like Victor Marchetti. If the Su-
preme Court backs Marchetti's right to 
talk, it could open a floodgate for a 
torrent of revelations about the ne-
farious activities of American spy 
agencies. If it upholds the CIA, it 
could cut down on the trickle of infor-
mation which currently keeps the In-
visible Government on its guard. 
Aside . from the broader implica-
tions of the case, the CIA has good 
reason to fear what Marchetti himself 
might reveal about his erstwhile em-
ployers. He is unquestionably the 
highest-ranking intelligence official to 
threaten exposure of the Agency's 
more questionable endeavors. He 
knows where the skeletons are hidden. 
Indeed, Marchetti is given credit for 
developing the surveillance techniques 
which led the CIA to discover Russian 
missiles in Cuba and thereby provoked. 
the 1962 Missile Crisis. 
As Marchetti tells the story, "After 
I was with the Agency for five or six 
years, I was assigned to the Cuban 
problem. This was exciting and per-
sonally very satisfying because another 
fellow and I evolved a strange analyti-
cal working tool which we called 
crateology. With it we were able to 
identify the merchant ships that were 
arms carriers.. Over a period of time, 
since the Soviets were very methodi-

A profile of Mai. Gen. 
By Stanley Karnow 
As he walks his poodle along 
the shaded street near his split-
level Alexandria home, Maj. Gen. 
Edward Geary Lansdale resembles 
any number of retired officers 
pasturing in the Washington sub-
urbs. He is still lean and erect de-
spite his 64 years, and, like so 
many military, pensioners, he 
finds life somewhat tame after his 
adventurous career. 
But in contrast to the .superan-
nuated colonels who reconstruct, 
battles at the dinner table, Lans-
dale's experiences Were of a high 
order. For he was in times past a 
dynamic, , influential and often 
controversial figure who single-
handedly managed foreign gov-
ernments and v.vhose behind-
the-scenes counsel helped to 
shape U.S. policy and practice at 
critical junctures , in recent his-
tory. 
In the Philippines during the 
early 1950s, for example, Lansdale 
Virtually directed the campaign 
against the Communist-led Huks 
in his capacity as special adviser 
to Ramon Magsaysay, then that 
country's defense secretary. In 
Saigon not long after, he effec-
tively kept South Vietnamese 
President Ngo Dinh Diem in of-
fice by conspiring to crush his do-
mestic foes while . persuading 
Washington to support him. 
Later, as the Vietnam war esca-
lated,Lansdale was instrumental in 
convincing President Eisenhower 
and Kennedy that the United 
States and its Vietnamese clients 
could defeat the Vietcong by rely-
ing on counterinsurgency techni-
ques. Some of these techniques, 
as disclosed in the secret Penta-
gon Papers, have revealed him to 
be considerably less savory than 
the public image of him as an ide-
alist. 
Little of' the exotic drama that 
Characterized LanSclale's career is 
apparent in his present man ner.He 
� 
Edwin' Lansdale, the original "Ugly America 
is a gray, unassuming man whose 
subdued style borders on self-
effacement. Some of his friends 
suggest that he has lost, much of 
his verve since his wife's death 
last spring, and he himself con-
cedes that her passing has left 
him lonely and dispirited. Except 
for occasional evenings with old 
.cronies, many of them Asia veter-
ans like himself, he leads a rather 
secluded existence. 
Other friends point out that he 
is weary after years of battling 
bureaucrats who oppose his un-
conventional ideas; and Lansdale 
himself substantiates that view 
with bitter humor when he says 
that "the knives going in don't 
seem to hurt anymore. Yet, as he 
Speaks, it is clear that he still 
burns with a hard flame that is 
nearly religious in fervor. His reli-
gion, he explains, is not formal. It 
is his faith that the United States 
could have successfully played 
world policeman by propagating 
its political philosophy. 
At the core. of Lansdale's doc-
trine is the conviction that Com-
munist guerrillas can be defeated 
in brushfire wars by "winning the 
hearts and minds' of people. In 
Vietnam, according to this thesis, 
the United States should have 
exported American democratic 
principles along with guns; mon-
ey, machinery and food. ."We 
couldn't afford to be just against 
the Communists," Lansdale has 
written. "We had to be for some-
thing." 
Lansdale's proposals often pro-
voked the fury of Establishment 
strategists, some powerful 
enough to block his advance-
ment. He has also been derided 
as a dreamer whose perception of 
reality was, at best, blurred. At 
the same time, though, he in-
spired a coterie of disciples who 
regarded him as nearly infallible. 
The debate over him polarized 
several years ago in two cele-

validity of their arguments, a 
least endowed him with a meas 
ure of literary immortality. 
ham J. Lederer and Eugene Bur-. 
dick portrayed him in The Ugly 
American as Col. Edwin Barnum 
HilJendale, whose sweet harmon-
ica purportedly stimulated rural 
Filipinos to oppose Communism. 
Graham Greene, on the other 
hand, depicted him in The Quiet 
American as.AIden Pyle, the naive 
U.S. official who believed that he 
could mobilize Vietnamese peas-
ants to resist the Communists by 
instilling them with the precepts ' 
of Town Hall democracy. 
Although the old soldier has 
faded away, the debate lingers 
on. Just as Lederer and Burdick 
approvingly quote their hero as 
saying that "if you use the right 
key, you can maneuver any per-
son or nation any way you want," 
so Lansdale's disciples still con-
tend that the United States could 
have attained its objectives in Vi-
etnam by developing psychologi-
cal warfare methods more effica-
cious than those employed by the 
Communists. This view, which 
became popular during the Ken-
nedy Administration, is best artic-
ulated in the articles of Lansdale's 
close friend, Robert Shaplen, the 
New Yorker correspondent in Sai-
gon, who has long asserted that 
the United States and its South Vi-
etnamese proteges could have 
beat the Communists by 
preempting the revolution. And 
just as Graham Greene indirectly 
reproved Lansdale by declaring 
that Vietnamese "don't want our 
white skins around telling them 
what they want," so his present-
day critics claim that he never ac-

a 4, 
�Washington 
The pending cease-fire agreement, as so 
far disclosed by Hanoi and Washington, 
is like a delicate watch, intricately 
fabricated to make sure it won't work: 
No agreement ever had so many in-
genious provisions calculated to keep it 
from Succeeding. If by chance one 
spring doesn't break down, there is 
another in reserve that almost surely 
will, and if by some unforeseen mishap 
that one also Should work, there is still 
another which will certainly go blooey 
sooner or later.. 
The fragility of the agreement to 
.end the second Indochinese war is put 
in better focus if one compares..it with 
the eease-fire which ended the first, at 
Geneva in 1954. The only signed 
document that emerged from the 
Geneva conference was a cease-fire 
agreement between the military com-
mands on both sides. It was accom-
panied by a . final declaration which 
nobody signed and to which the 
.United States and the separate state 
the- French.. had created in the south 
objected; theh as now the puppet was 
more obdurate than the master. 
The first Indochinese war ended, as 
the second seems to be doing, with a 
cease-fire but no political settlement. 
The prime defect, the "conceptual" 
flaw, to borrow a favorite word of 
Kissinger's, lay in the effort to end a 
profoundly political struggle without a 
political settlement. A cease-fire then, 
.as now, left the political problem 
unresolved and thus led inevitably to a 
resumption of the conflict, It will be a 
miracle if the new cease-fire does not 
breed � another, a third, Indochinese 
war. � 
A political � solution was left to 
mailana 'and "free elections." But the 
'Geneva cease-fire agreement, . dis-
appointing as its results proved to be, 
was far more precise in its promise of 
free elections than is the new cease-
fire. It set a firm date�July, I956�for 
the balloting; specified that the purpose 
of the elections was "to bring about 
the unification of Vietnam"; provided 
for the release within thirty days not 
only of POWs but of "civilian in-
ternees"; and made clear that it meant 
political prisoners defining civilian

... all persons who, having in any 
way contributed- to the political 
and armed struggle between the 
two parties, have been arrested for 
that reason and have been kept in 
detention by either party during 
the period of hostilities.l _ 
Nobody knows how many thousands 
of political prisoners are in Thicu's 
jails. The most famous is.Truong Dinh 
Dzu, the peace candidate who came in 
crippled. Arrests have been ihtensified 
in preparation for a cease-fire. 
The fate of the political prisoners 
figured prominently in the peace nego-
tiations. The seven-point. program put 
forward by the other side in July of 
last year called for the dismantling of 
Thieu's concentration. camps and the 
release of all political prisoners. The 
eight-point proposal put forward by 
Washington and 'Saigon last -January 
left their fate in doubt. It called for 
the simultaneous release of all POWs 
and "innocent civilians captured 
throughout Indochina.'' The ambiguous 
phrasing seemed designed to -exclude 
politicals since these were neither "cap-
tured" nor, in 'the eyes of the Thieu 
regime, "innocent." 
The new cease-fire terms do not 
bother with such ambiguity. Dr. Kissin-
ger in his press conference of October 
26 seemed to take satisfaction in 
the fact that the return of US 
POWs "is not conditional on the 
'disposition of Vietnamese prisoners in 
Vietnamese jails." Their future, he 
explained, will be determined ."through 
negotiations among the South Viet-
namese parties," i.e., between Thieu 
and the PRG. So the politicals will 
stay in jail until Thieu agrees to let 
them out. This may. easily coincide 
with the Second Corning.. 
This is only one of the many built-in

The new cease-fire agreement gives him . 
far more pOwer than he would have ' 
had under the proposals he and Nixon 
made jointly in January. Under Point 3 
of those proposals, there was to have 
been "a free and deniocratic presi-

' BY GEORGE 11IcARTHUR 
Times Staff Writer 
SAIGON�While cease-fire 
ne-
gotiations proceed with questiona-
ble progress in Paris and elsewhere, 
the U.S. .bureaucrats of .Saigon are 
confidently "using the tie to blue-
print- future. empires in South .Viet-

� As of .now, their vision is unset-
tling, � � 
Although past American exper 
ienees-in Laos and Cambodia can 
hardly be called successful, the plan-
ners are casually using those coun-
tries as partial models for. the Viet-

� 
President 'Nixon's senior 
wordsmith, H erbert G. Klein, 
has denied plans to station "either 
civilian or Military advisers" with 
South Vietnam's army after a cease-
fire. He was treading a semantic 
tightrope, according to all the 
evidence in Vietnam. itself. 
The American military population 
has at least � temporarily levelled off 
at about 27,000 men. But the overall 
.presence in South Vietnam 
once . gain has started .to - slowly 
'grow. Civilian technicians have ar-
rived in significant numbers and ci-
vilian* contractors are stepping up 
�operations in dozens of areas like 
training, maintenance and supply. . 
. Impossible to Get Estimate . 
; At this Moment' it is imposSible to 
"get an accurate estimate of the num-
ber of U.S. civilians in South Viet-
nam with some kind of official con-
nection with the U.S. Embassy, mili-
.4ary, intelligence Or others. 
No single person or headquartecs 
seems to be running the show. 
Things are just growing, strangely 
enough, in a somewhat microcopie 
replay of the great. buildup of 1965. 
No one seems to expect this civilian 
�2 9 NOV -,371 
, 
minibuildnp to get Out of hand. But 
nobody has yet said. "stop." 
Part of the problem is that. Wash-
ington has not stepped in to nrOvide 
answers to some specific bureau-
cratic questions. 
� With Saigon's military warehouses 
bulging with liquor, PX goods and 
other supplies for some 30,000 men, 
the supply officials naturally want 
to know "how long?." and, more sup-
plies are en route by ship already. 
Planners Regain Vigor 
Meanwhile, the planners, who 
were stunned by the mid-October 
revelation that a cease-fire was near, 
have regained their vigor. Having 
been frozen out of earlier planning 
by the secrecy of .the talks, they are 
tedoubling their efforts. 
"Plans are proliferating prodi-
giously," admitted one staff colonel, 
who retained a sense of. humor and 
perspective despite a tiring and un;-
ending round of 'committee meet-
ings. 
The plans,. -partial plans, contin-
gency plans and perhaps some wish-
ful dreaming on paper now provide 
for � a South Vietnam with a pro-
nounced American .govermental 
east. While many of the new experts 
or technicians (or advisers) will be 
wearing civilian sportshirts, the sus-
picion is strong that underneath 
they will have dogtags, or at least 
retirement papers, And, 'the civili-
ans already here, including many/ 
Central Intelligence Agen-
cy types, will simply 
change titles and continue 
what they are doing, and 
possibly do more. � 
One.staff officer, already 
sporting civilian clothes 
much of. the time, admits 
that the biggest change in 
his office will be the remo-
val of some awards and 
military knickknacks, in-
cluding a mounted enemy.

'one colonel admitted, "ho-

The new plans seem in 
so:me measure to be an

Dloodbuths, 
or allegations? 
To the Editor: 
In his zeal to reassure him-
self and his readers of the 
soundness of past literature 
on North Vietnam, John S. 
Carroll ("After we get out, 
will there be a bloodbath in 
South Vietnam?", Oct. 15) 
violated the first rule of 
honest argumentation, which 
is to represent with reason-
able accuracy the text which 
you wish to refute. Having 
-chosen my "revisionist" cri-
tique of past and present alle-
gations ' of a "bloodbath" in 
North Vietnam as his target, 
,Carroll manages nevertheless 
to avoid. reference � with a 
single exception--to any of 
the specific evidence which 
I have offered in the two 
publications which he cites. 
I object, of course, to his 
taking out .of context my re-
mark that I no longer wish to 
rest my case against Nixon's 
bloodbath allegations on the 
International Control Commis-
sion reports alone, and using 
it to conclude that "at least 
one of the principal assump-
tions on which the revisionist 
history rests is not even be-
lieved by its own author." I 
made the remark in the con-
text of a long, fully docu-
mented study of the North 
Vietnamese land reform 
which I was then completing. 
As 1 explained to him at that 
time, in comparison with the 
evidence I had found of a 
general distortion of the 
North Vietnamese land-reform 
qampaign in both primary and 
secondary sources available 
to Americans, the I.C.C. re-
ports simply receded in 
Importance: 
As a matter of fact, I did 
not and do not "acknowledge 
that the original I.C.C. ap-
proach is weak." Carroll has 
completely misrepresented the 
nature of the evidence to be 
found in the International 
Control Commission reports�
evidence to which he never 
specifically refers. It is nec-
1 
essary, therefore, to repeat 
it here: From April, 1955, to 
February, 1961, during which 
time the Diem Government 
was actively pressing charges 
of Vietminh violations of the 
Geneva Agreement with the 
I.C.C., the French Government 
and Diem submitted only 43 
complaints of political re-
prisals in the North alleging 
a total of 56 incidents of re-
prisal. However, of the first 
12 complaints, three were in-
vestigated and it was found 
that there was in fact no 
damage to life or property 
to the alleged victims. And of 
the 18 cases of reprisal by 
D.R.V.N. alleged to have oc-
curred in the December, 1955-
y, 1956, period�the height 
of the land reform campaign 
�only one involved alleged 
loss of life. 
� Even more important, dur-
ing this same period of time, 
the population of the North, 
which submitted many thou-
sands of personal petitions to 
fixed and mobile teams of the 
I.C.C. complaining of viola-
tions of their freedom of 
movement, submitted only 41 
petitions complaining of po-
litical reprisals. This evidence 
thus has nothing to do with 
the D.R.V.N. land-reform law 
or the I.C.C.'s inability to in-
vestigate airfields. As much 
as Mr. Carroll and others 
would like to believe that 
mass reprisals were carried 
out against former French 
and puppet Government per-
sonnel. the evidence indicates 
that the worst thing to befall 
the former civil servants, sol-
diers and policemen of the 
French regime in Vietnam 
was that they were shamed 
into, accepting the same low 
salary that Vietminh cadres 
received. (See Duong Chau, 
"The Seventeenth Parallel," 
Saigon, 1958, p. � 147.) The 
former resistance fighters in 
South Vietnam did not fare 
so well during the same 
period. 
I am even more disap-
pointed that Mr. Carroll did 
not see fit to deal seriously 
with my study of the land re-
form. lie cites all the usual 
sources alleging a "blood-
bath" in the North (Buttinger,

odology and conclusions of 
these works do not stand up 
under careful analysis. An en-
tire 'chapter ,of my 60-page 
study is devoted, for exam-
ple, to an analysis of how 
Bernard Fall systematically 
misunderstood the socio-
economic background of the 
land reform in arguing that 
. it was economically unjusti-
fied. But Carroll repeats Fall's 
argument that there were no 
"real" landlords as though it 
were unchallenged. 
I have also documented 
how Mang Van Chi's sup-
posedly "authoritative" ac-
count has been the primary 
source for virtually every 
secondary .source on the land 
reform (including Fall), but 
there is . no mention in 
Carroll's article of this 
dependence. . 
But most important, Carroll 
ignores the evidence that 
Hoang Van Chi's account was 
written for the explicit pur-
pose of advancing a propa-
ganda campaign against the 
D.R.V.N. behind which were. 
the U.S. and the South 
Vietnamese Governments: the 
repeated instances in which 
Chi fabricated evidence where 
none existed for a policy of 
massive executions of inno-
cent people; Chi's close rela-
tionship with the U.S. and 
Saigon propaganda organs 
and the C.I.A., all of whom 
funded and promoted his 
writings; the significant 
change between 1958 and 
1964 versions of his charge 
of "landlord quotas"; and his 
lack of qualifications to write 
from personal experience 
about. the party's policy on 
land reform. 
Carroll attempts to defend 
Hoang Van Chi's "loose" 
translation of Vo Nguyen 
Giap's statement by citing 
the opinions of unnamed ex-
perts that the Communists 
normally used the terms in 
question as euphemisms for 
terror and execution. But re-
gardless of the opinions of 
such unnamed experts, the 
fact is that the Communists 
did not use the word in ques-
tion to mean "execution." � 
And if Carroll had bothered 
to ask me, I could have cited 
numerous usages of the word 
in Communist documents in 
contexts which � make this 
clear beyond any doubt. 
Finally, his flippant dismis-
sal of the documentary evi-
dence used in 'my study 
indicates that Mr. Carroll is 
simply unfamiliar with schole 
arship on Communist affairs. 
Most of the documents which 
I cite, primarily the party 
newspaper Nhan Dan, were 
intended to communicate with 
an audience of party members 
and general public in. North 
� Vietnam what the general 
political line and specific pol-
icies of the party were during 
the land-reform period. These 
are precisely the documents 
with which any serious 
scholar would begin in a 
study of the land reform cam-
paign. Moreover, the D.R.V.N. 
history of the land reform, 
which is based on official pol-
icy directives and statistical-
surveys of the land-reform 
period, is in no way incon-
sistent with these earlier � 
doctiments. 
As for the estimate of 800 
to 2,500 executions during the 
land reform, which I have 
suggested on the basis of the 
available data, it is entirely 
consistent, as I point out in 
the study, with statistics on 
death sentences in several 
provinces in the North dur-

4�Despite years of fighting

of their political apparatus 
with what many well-Informed 
Vietnamese and American of-

Tet offensive of 1968, thou-

when they came out in the 
open to lead what they thought

As one intelligence officer

the Central Committee's Office 
for South Vietnam, American 
intelligence sources say. 
The office is believed to 
be located in Kratie Province 
in northeastern Cambodia, a 
sparsely populated and heavily 
forested region long --under 
Communist control. . The top 
officials, most of whom are-
thought to be North Vietna-
mese, are the leaders of the 
People's Revolutionary party I 
and also members of -Hanoi's' 
elite Politburo or of the larger 
Central Committee, according: 
to American analyst 
� 
For example, Phan Hung, 
who is believed to be the head 
of the office, is also the ruling 
secretary of the party and a 
member of the Hanoi Politburo. 
He is a North Vietnamese. His 
second-in-command, who uses 
the psueclonym of Muoi Cue, 
Is also a northerner and a mem-
ber of the Central Committee. 
American officials say that 
the Vietcong's titular leaders 
;such as Nguyen IIuu Tho 
!chairman of the front, or 
Itiuynh Tan Phat, the Secre-
tary General of the front, have 
ibecome, progressively less pow-
� erful. 
Most experts agree that one 
reason for the Vietcong's mili-
.tary decline is the enormous' 
'shift of South Vietnam's pop-
ulation away from the country-
'side and into safe urban areas 
to escape the war. At least a 
.third of South Vietnam's vil-
lagers are estimated to have 
:left their homes, often depriv-
ing Vietcong units of bases for 
recruitment, supplies or taxa-
tion. 
Some allied oficials are con-
cerned that this trend may be 
reversed under a cease-fire and 
that thousands of villagers may 
conic home � providing the 
Vietcong with a renewed source 
of power.' 
But no :natter how badly the 
Vietcong have been hurt mili-
tarily, several recent American 
studies have shown that their 
political organization remains 
intact. 
The organization withstood 
the vaunted Phoenix program, 
established by the Central In-
11' , ' 1967 
cifically to eliminate the Viet-. 
cong cadre. Though more than. 
20,000 were' killed under the 
Phoenix program and another 
40,000 jailed or persuaded to 
defect, officials connected with 
it admit frankly that it has 
been a failure. 
A recent study for the Rand 
Corporation found that in 
Dinntuong Province, in the 
nem. or Me populous mown& 
'delta, the Vietcong have pre-
served a core of about five 
cadremen per village. "Despite I 
the decline in military capa-I 
bilities," the study said, in! 
part, "the N.L.F. in Dinhtuong, 
has managed to keep the nu-. 
cleus of its movement intact." 
The study also found a large 
measure of "latent support" 
for the Vietcong among vil-
lagers. This continuing sym-
pathy for the Communists, the 
study reported, was not in evi-
dence where the Saigon Gov-I 
ernment forces were strong, 
but it could easily reappear, 
should Saigon weaken. 
For example, the study noted 
that before the 1968 Tet offen-
sive, many Vietnamese and 
IAmerican officials thought that 
the Vietcong in Dinhttiong 
i.were on their way to defeat. 
l'But, once the Communists gave 
!their sudden order to attack, 
lj'almost the entire rural pop-
itilation in the province was 
:mobilized and coordinated in 
support of the attack," the 
study concluded. 
� The highest cadre concentra-
tion, according to Vietnamese 
and United States intelligence 
estimates, is 25.00 in the Me-
kong delta, Militery Region IV. 
These sources n-port that the 
second largest renter of Viet-

,been complicated this year by 
Idle invasion across the demili-

for indoctrination. 
The area around Saigon, 
Military Region III, has always 
had the lowest number of Viet-
cong cadre, analysts say, be-
cause of the numbers and alert-
ness of, the Government police 
in the capital. But while there 
are fewer than 10,000 Commu-

men in the Saigon area, they 
are said to be the best in the

NO SECRET WAR 
-- An Associated Press report yes-
terday from Saigon that the United 
States is planning to keep a mili-
tary advisory group of American 
civilians in South Vietnam after 
regular military forces are with-
drawn is disturbing� 
The � report quoted military 
sources as saying that the ad-
visers would be employed by 
ci-
vilian firms under contract either 
_ to the Defense or State Depart-
ments. 
Whether such activities would 
be covered by a Vietnam peace 
agreement or e.xcluded froth them 
remains conjectural. There is as 
yet no signed peace agreement. 
The. U.S. is insisting upon reach-
ing _certain mutual understandings 
concerning the basic accord that iS 
being worked out. - 
The implication of this report is 
quite clear � the continuation of 
American clandestine operations 
in Vietnam after the uniformed 
7egulars are withdrawn, the kind 
operations being. conducted in 
the "secret wars" in Laos an 
Cambodia. 
Nobody in the U.S. government, 
of course, is going to confirm that 
CIA el' taeiL, agents will remain 
behind to do what they can secret-
ly to prevent Communist takeovers 
in Indochina. Obviously a number 
, of American civilian officials will 
stay in Laos, Cambodia and South 
Vietnam in various capacities. 
The New York Times reported 
this week, for example, "In conver-
sations in recent days with Prime, 
Minister Souvanna Pheuma of 
Laos and others, Nixon has 
stressed that he would seek to Con-
tinue American economic and other 
assistance to Laos, Cambodia, and 
South Vietnam because he believed 
it was important to maintain non-
Communist governments in South-
east Asia." 
It would be all too tempting to 
use "civilian" aid officials, for ex-
ample, for _covert operations. It 
would be naive to suggest that 
the United 'States have no intelli-
gence agents in Indochina after a 
peace agreement. But the .U.S. 
should not shift its involvement 
in Vietnam from an open war to 
,.an underground war. waged by

HEROIN AND THE C 
by Flora Lewis 
THE POLITICS OF HEROIN IN SOUTH-
EAST ASIA 
by Alfred W. McCoy 
Harper & Row, $10.95 
One fact is beyond dispute: heroin 
.is flooding into the United States in 
sufficient quantities to support an 
ever growing number of addicts. Esti-
mates about the drug traffic are unre-
liable, but trends are painfully clear 
in mounting deaths, young zombies 
stimbling through city streets, crime 
- 
to the point of civic terror. There are 
� said to be some 560,000 addicts in 
America now, twice the number esti-
mated two years. ago and ten times 
the level of 1960. 
Another fact goes unchallenged: 
suddenly, in 1970,- high-grade pure 
white heroin, which Americans prefer 
to the less refined drug more nor-
mally consumed by Asians, appeared 
in plentiful and cheap supply wher-
ever there were GI's in Vietnam. The 
epidemic was a vast eruption. It took. 
the withdrawal of the troops to douse 
it, for the fearful flow could not be 
staunched. 
Beyond those facts, the sordid story 
of drug trafficking has been a shad-
owy, elusive mixture of controversial 
elements. It was obvious that there 
must be corruption involved. It was 
obvious that there must be politics in-
volved, if only because the traffic con-
tinues to flourish on such a scale de-
spite the energetic pronouncements 
of powerful governments. It takes a 
map of the whole world to trace the 
drug net. 
Since the United States suddenly 
became aware of the sinister dimen-
sions of the plague and President 
Nixon bravely declared war on drugs 
(unlike the persistently undeclared 
war in Indochina), it has been cus-
tomary for U.S. officials to pinpoint 
the .poppy fields of Turkey and the 
clandestine laboratories of Marseille 
as the source of most of the American 
curse. Nobody denied that the bulk of 
the world's illicit opium (some say 70 
percent, some say 50 to 60 percent) is 
grown in Southeast Asia and partic-
ularly in the "golden triangle" of 
mountains where Burma, Thailand, 
and Laos meet. But the U.S'. govern-
ment insisted; and continues to insist 
in the 111-page report on the world 
opium trade published in August, 
that this supplies natives and seldom 
enters American veins. 
Not so, says Alfred W. McCoy, 
who spent some two years studying 
the trade. And further, it is certain to 
become less and less so as measures 
which the United States demanded in 
Turkey and France take effect in 
blocking the old production and 
smuggling patterns. This is of crucial 
importance for two reasons. One is 
that firm establishment of an Asian 
pattern to America means that the 
crackdown in Turkey and France will 
be next to futile so far as availability 
of heroin in the United States is con-
cerned. The second is that focusing 
attention on Southeast Asia would 
bring Americans to understand that 
the "war on drugs" is inextricably in-
volved with the Indochina war, and 
has to be fought on the same battle-
ground from which President Nixon 
assured us he was disengaging "with 
honor." 
� McCoy, a twenty-seven-year-old 
Yale graduate student, worked with 
immense diligence and considerable 
courage�for the opium trade is dan-
gerous business and the combination 
of opium, politics, and war can be 
murderous�to document the facts of 
the Asian pattern. 
A good deal of it has been common 
gossip in tawdry bars of Saigon, Vien-
tiane, and Bangkok for years. But the 
gossip mills of Indochina are a long 
way from the streets of Harlem and 
the high schools of Westchester 
County. The general knowledge that 
the rumors reflected is a long way 
from preCise, confirmed detail. So the

The writer was born in Thanhoa, 
-North Vietnam, later lived in South 
Vietnam, and is currently an associate 
professor of economics at Howard 
Uni-
versit.y. � 
tisAFFICIALLY, it is clear, a settle-
ment of the Vietnam war is about 
to be reached. But in the minds of 
Hanol's leaders, the cease-fire and 
.political accord that now appear im-
minent. will not mean the end of 
. the struggle. Rather, to them such de-
velopments will mean only that yet an-
other phase in the war between North 
and South has been opened. 
. It must be understood that in the 
Hanoi politburo there are no "doves" 
on the question of unifying Vietnam 
under communism; all are "hawks." 
' What they differ substantially on is 
the method of -accomplishing this aim. 
Thus the main key to iinnoi's increas-
ingly accommodating stance at present 
and to what may happen after a set-
tlement is signed can be found largely 
in the power struggle within the Ha-
noi politburo. 
The struggle is between one faction 
'headed by he Dunn, a Southerner and 
secretary-general of the Communist 
Party, and another led by Truong 
Chilli], a Northerner and chairman of 
the standing committee of the National 
Assembly. Their rivalry dates back to 
the 10-10s, when they competed for the 
,mind and confidence of the late Presi-
dent lio Chi Minh. The rift was greatly 
intensified in 395G when President Ho 
effectively replaced Truong Chinh 
'with- Le Dunn as secretary-general of 
the party, a post Chinh had held for lh 
-years.. . . . 
� 
Truong Chinh Emerges �:-
y? ECENTLY THEIR CONFLICT 
1.0e has extended to three broad is-
sues: the economic performance in the 
North; the ideological direction regard-
ing economic policy, and, above all, the 
conduct of the war in the South. 
he Duan's faction called for immedi-
ate conquest of the South at all cost, 
and he strongly supported Vo Nguyen 
Chip's big-battle and total-uprising 
strategy. Clap, spoiled by the Dien-
blenphu victory and obsessed with the 
thought of becoming a Vietnamese. Na-
poleon, provides Le Duan with protec-
tion against the powerful police force 
. Tran Quoc Haan, an ally of Truong, 
Chinh. . 
J./ 
As�in all Communist countries, no 
leader would dare express himself 
openly on so sensitive a question as 
party factions. Nevertheless, based on 
each politburo member's past record, 
position, performance, and on the Viet-
namese pattern of behavior, one can 
speculate on the current power align-
ment in Yorth Vetnam fc;lows: 
' LE DUAN FACTION 
� 'Vo Nguyen Giap, strongman of the 
army. Giap is a long-time, bitter enemy 
of Truong Chinh. Ills hatred for Chinh 
sterns from two sources�Chinh's favor-
able attitude toward Chinese interven-
tion in Vietnamese affairs, and Chinh's 
undermining of Giap's authority by ap-
pointing political commissars to share 
responsibility side by side with mili-
tary commanders. 
� Pham Hung, director of the war 
in the South. Like Le Duan, Hung is 
a Southerner. Although he remains 
director of COSVN, the armed forces 
in the South, he was removed as first 
deputy on June 10, 1972,- after the Na-
tional Assembly, election. 
TRUONG CIlII FACTION 
� Le Due Tito, currently adviser to 
Hanoi's delegation to the Paris peace 
talks. Tlio's hatred of Le Duan dates 
back to 1950 when he was sent by Ho 
Chi Minh as an inspector to the South. 
Be became engaged in a bitter dispute 
with Le Duan on the conduct of the ' 
war. Duan was summoned to North 
Vietnam in 1951, while 'rho remained 
in the South for some time thereafter. 
� Nguyen Duy Trinh, foreign affairs 
minister, supports Triton; Chinh be-
cause of their common agreement with 
Chinese policies. 
� Hoangi Van 'loan, Chinh's right-
hand man in the standing committee, 
of the National Assembly. 
� Le Thanh Nghi, an economist, fa-
vors industrialization and is close to 
Chinh's position on rebuilding North 
Vietnam. His point of view is sup-
ported by important technocrats, such 
as Vice Premier Do Muoi. 
� Tran Quoc Hoan, responsible for 
security and internal order. Ile con-
trols all police forces and possesses all 
secret information on leading figures 
in .North Vietnam, His lining up with 
Truong Chinh is explained by his sus-. 
'picion of Vo Nguyen Giap's ambition 
to dominate the internal security, 
domain, His recent appointment to full 
membership of the politburo causes 
alarm to Giap. 
� Van Tien Dung, chairman of the 
army's chiefs of staff, appears to be 
close to Chinh. A hero of Dienbienpim, 
Dung is said to be displeased with 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
Truong Chinh, on the other hand, 
Wants to pursue a guerrilla strategy; 
accompanied by political and diplo-
matic efforts to help the National Lib-
eration Front seize power in the South. 
For should the South fall under the 
thumb of the NU% unification of the 
country under communism would be 
Inevitable. Chinh's strategy is sup-
ported by Giap's lieutenant, Gen. Van 
Tien Dung. 
Recent events in North Vietnam sug-
gest . that the politburo battle had 
been greatly intensified and that 
Truong Chink has begun to emerge as 
the clear leader, capable of filling the 
power vacuum left by Ho Chi Minh's 
death in 1969. The effect of Chinh's 
emergence and the resulting change in 
Hanoi's power structure has been a 
reversal of Hanoi's policy on the war:� 
from intransigence at the negotiating 
table to a more concessionary attitude; 
fronr conventional warfare to guerrilla 
and terror tactics; from an emphasis 
OIL decisive military victories to politi-
cal and diplomatic offensives. 
It is consistent with Truong Chinh's 
policies for Hanoi to agree to a cease-
fire in order to recover from the war, 
and. to prepare for new efforts to 
achieve final victory. 
The-Power Alignment 
TN ANALYZING' the Hanoi rivalry, it 
I. 'is essential to know the strength 
of each faction under the existing 
power structure. According to an un-
published study by Saigon educator 
Nguyen Ngoe Bich on the North Viet-
namese assembly election in April, 
1971, Truong Chinh skillfully used the 
occasion to weaken Le Duan's faction 
by eliminating the 87 Southern depu-
ties in the National Assembly. These 
deputies had been staunch supporters 
of he Dunn in the legislative branch. 
The power center in Hanoi, though, 
Is not the assembly but the politburo. 
It Consists of ,nine full members and 
two alternates. Recently (about August 
or September of this year), the two al-
ternates, Tran Quoc Hoan and Van 
Tien Dung, were promoted to full 
membership on the pretext that, they 
were to fill the seats vacated by IIo 
Chi Mirth's death in 1969 and by Ngu-
yen Chi Thanh's death in 1967. Roan is 
minister of public security, which is 
the -equivalent here to the director 
of the FBI, chief of all local police 
forces and director of the CIA corn-
binedeDung is army chief of staff and 
a Dienbienphu hero. Apparently their 
appointments were made as a result of 
TrtfOng Chinh's influence.

By Richard E. Ward 
A congressional subcommittee has 
charged the Pentagon with failure to 
investigate charges of war crimes 
carried'out under the U.S.-sponsored 
Phoenix program in South Vietnam. 
The criticism of the Pentagon was 
made in a report by the House of 
Representatives Foreign Operations 
and Government Information sub-
committee, which noted that many of 
the so-called "Vietcong" killed under 
the Phoenix "pacification" program 
were innocent civilians. The report 
also expressed reservations about 
U.S. support for a program that 
"allegedly included torture, murder 
and inhumane treatment of South 
.Vietnamese civilians." 
The report, not approved for public 
release by the parent Government 
Operations Committee, was sum-
marized in an Oct. 3 UPI dispatch. 
According to the news agency, the 
Department of Defense refused to 
investigate the charges when they 
were brought to the attention of high 
officials. 
Public release of the cautiously 
worded subcommittee report has 
apparently been delayed because 
members of the full committee are 
. less than enthusiastic about con-
fronting the issue of U.S. war crimes. 
In July 1971 at the time of hearings 
that constituted the basis for the 
report, two subcommittee members, 
Rep. Ogden R. Reid (0-N.Y.) and Rep. 
Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) charged 
' outright that the Phoenix program 
had. been. responsible for "in-
discriminate killings" and the illegal 
imprisonment of thousands in South 
-Vietnam. - 
In September of this year, during a 
hearing before the Senate Refugee 
rrcrrir 
� 
tmrl 
ti-ip) 
�-siLl
 LJU TJa, 
�G'')' � 
subcommittee, a top Defense 
Department official described the 
Phoenix. program as an intelligence 
operation. He was challenged by Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) in a 
surprisingly sharp interchange. 
Kennedy asked how the more than 
20,000 "Vietcong" were killed and the 
witness insisted that the deaths oc-
curred during "military" operations. 
'Intelligence operation'? 
During the 1971 'hearings the 
House subcommittee heard testimony j 
� from William E. Colby who headed the / 
"pacification" effort from mid-1968 to 
mid-1971. Colby stated that under the 
Phoenix program 20,587 members of 
the "Vietcong" infrastructure" were 
killed from 1968 through May 1971. 
Colby, who had been a top CIA of-
ficial before serving in Saigon on 
assignment from the White House, 
insisted that the Phoenix program was 
"entirely a South Vietnamese 
operation," although he conceded it 
had been originated by the CIA. 
Colby tried to portray the U.S. role 
as primarily an "advisory" one, but he 
also admitted that U.S. personnel 
participated in the naming of suspects 
and the capture of prisoners. Ad-
mitting "occasional" abuses�the 
assassination of civilians�had oc-
curred, Colby stated that "we put a 
stop to this nonsense" in collaboration 
with the Saigon authorities. 
With a facade of candor, Colby's 
testimony actually was riddled with 
lies about the Phoenix program, which 
was initiated- under President 
Johnson and expanded by the Nixon 
administration. Essentially, ' the 
Phoenix program attempted to 
identify and then assassinate cadres 
of the National Liberation Front, the 
political leaders on a local level of the

anti-U.S. resistance in South Vietnam 
,The program had access to secret 
-CIA :funds as well as large ap 
propriations from the U.S. military and 
economic assistance -programs. 
Assassination teams of mercenaries 
and U.S. agents who compiled lists of 
persons to be assassinated were 
secretly, funded. 
These aspects of the Phoenix 
program were revealed in testimony 
before the same House subcommittee 
in August 1971 by K. Barton Osborn, 
who served as an intelligence agent 
assigned to provide information to the 
Marines and who also worked for the 
CIA Phoenix program. Based in 
Danang, Osborn supervised agent 
networks for 15 months beginning in 
1967. 
Osborn contradicted Colby's 
disclaimers of direct U.S. respon-
sibility for the Phoenix program and 
made it clear that U.S. personnel 
participated in murders and tortures. 
He said U.S. "advisors" were really 
directing the program. 
Osborn also described atrocities he 
witnessed, including seeing Viet-
namese pushed from helicopters, a 
practice known as "airborne in-
terrogations." He also described how 
Marine intelligence offi:ers held a 
Vietnamese woman prisoner in a small 
cage at their headquarters and 
starved her to death, refusing to give 
her either food or water. 
These and other examples given by 
Osborn provide only a small glimpse of 
the war crimes committed by the U.S. 
in South Vietnam. The atrocities were 
an intrinsic part of the Phoenix 
program directed by the highest U.S. 
authorities on White. House orders. 
Obviously the Defense Department is 
not going to investigate these war 
crimes.

Why No Peace? 
The men most responsible for the continuing carnage 
in Indochina are Nixon, Kissinger and Nguyen Van Thieu, 
whose role is explored in a just issued 108-page pamphlet, 
"Aid to Thiel'," by Le Anh Tti and Marilyn McNabb 
of the American Friends Service Committee, 112 South 
16 Street, Philadelphia 19102. Backed by 273 references 
and notes, the pamphlet is a calm account of tyranny, 
oppression and mass murder, carried on with vast 
amounts of American money, military aid and the partici-
pation of the CIA. The last paragraph of the text reads: 
The demand that the U.S. cease its aid to Thieu 
is reasonable from the point of view of Vietnamese 
who want peace and national independence. It is im-
perative from the point of view of Americans who 
want to bring this country's expensive and bloody 
adventure in Indochina to an end. 
The Nixon Administration locked itself into an alliance 
with Thieu at a time when that seemed the only alterna-
tive to military defeat. With his four "no's," Thieu is 
now the principal obstacle to a negotiated peace. Getting 
rid of him is the problem of Nixon and Kissinger. If they 
persist in keeping Thieu in power no other conclusion can 
be drawn than that they are determined to win the war 
militarily, regardless of the moral and material conse-
quences,.to the American and Indochinese people.

bombing is not on the agenda 
of forthcoming conferences on 
disarmament, it should be. The 
experience of the United States 
aerial warfare in Indochina con-
firms the experience of the Ko-
rean War and the Second World 
War that strategic bombing is 
essentially a means of terror 
and genocide, and that its effect 
on the military outcome of a 
conflict is minor. 
During seven and a half years 
of bombing Indochina, the U.S. 
Air Force dropped three and a 
half times more tons of bombs 
than were dropped by all the 
Allied Powers in all the thea-
ters of the Second World War. 
Yet.� a military victory for the 
United States and its Saigon pup-
pet regime is not in sight. while 
Saigon is now threatened with 
encirclement. 
In both Korea and Indochina 
the U.S. Air Force has had full 
command of the air. Neither the 
North Koreans nor the Indochi-
nese have been able successfully 
to challenge the U.S. control of 
their air space. although North 
Vietnam's defenses have become 
formidable. 
In both cases. the U.S. Air 
Force slaughtered thousands of 
civilians, mainly children, wo-
men and the elderly. In Indo-
china the extensive use of na-
palm, poisonous chemical defo-
liants. and anti-personnel bombs 
produced biocidal results. that 
is. the extermination of all living 
things. 
Military analysts draw a dis-
tinction between strategic bomb-
ing and the use of air power as 
an auxiliary arm of the army 
and navy. The distinction is 
pointed up by the contrast be-
tween the U.S. and British use 
of air power and that of the So-
viet armed forces in World War 
Military historians note that 
the Red Army never employed 
strategic bombing. but used its

air power for purposes of aerial 
reconnaissance and as a form of 
artillery supporting the troops. 
On the other hand, the English 
and Americans cold-bloodedly 
dropped tons of bombs on heavily 
populated cities, as in the case 
of Dresden. to terrify the people. 
drive the workers out of their 
homes, and hopefully bring about 
a reduction in the nazi arms 
production. 
Yet. except for the distorters 
of the war's history who falsely 
claim that the U.S.-British alli-
ance NV011 the war in Europe. it 
is generally known that the nazi 
war machine was smashed on 
the Eastern Front. And although 
the nazis also employed strate-
gic bombing with genocidal ef-
fects against the Soviet Union. 
they went down to defeat before 
the onrushing might of the Red 
A rmy 
Strategic bombing fails to dis-
criminate between civilian and 
military personnel and installa-
tions. Hospitals, churches, schools 
and the homes of workers and 
peasants are wantonly destroy-
ed. Civilians who survive are 
driven in flight to refugee cen-
ters. Some eight million or more 
Indochinese have now been herd-
ed into such centers or pacifica-
tion zones, where they are sub-
jected to CIA supervision and 
control by Thieu's police. 
What is more, strategic bomb-
ing has been used mainly by 
highly industrialized imperialist 
powers against underdeveloped 
small peoples seeking independ-
ence from colonialism and neo-
colonialism. Nowadays the Por-
tuguese colonialists are using 
strategic bombing. along with 
napalm. phosphorous bombs. de-
foliants and anti-personnel bombs 
pcotected in Indochina and pass-
ed on via NATO. Their victims 
are the peoples of Mozambique. 
Angola and Guinea-Bissau who 
are seeking to throw off the 
yoke of colonialism. 
Who knows what small �Third 
World" country, striving to 
strike off chains of imperialism. 
will be the next victim of an 
imperialist bombing attack? Will 
it be South Yemen, Odle, So-
malia, Burma. Syria. Peru? 
Clearly, it is in the interest of 
the national liberation movements 
of "Third World" countries that 
the bombing of strategic bomb-
ing should become part of the 
struggle for disarmament. 
To claim, as the Maoists do, 
that '"I� hird World" peoples have 
no interest in disarmament. is to 
speak nonsense. In view of, the 
growing poverty gap between the 
developing countries and the de-
veloped industrial countries. what 
"Third World" country will be 
able to construct effective air 
defenses against bombing raids 
of which the United States, Bri-
tain. France and even South Afri-
ca are capable? 
There should be no illusions 
concerning the scruples�now or 
as along as imperialism domi-
nates U.S. society�of the gene-
rals and politicians responsible 
for the destruction of life in In-
dochina. Typical of Nixon was 
his hypocritical call tor an in-
ternational treaty against terror-
ism at the very moment of his 
escalation of the 13-52 strategic 
bombing raids against Vietnam.

(Anyone who doubts the military capa-
city for blatant evasion of Presidential di-
rectives might refer to all official government 
history, Science cn:ci. the Air Fc%rce, published 
in 1966. At one time, the book points out, the 
Bureau of the Budget decreed that the Air

nonetheless�by charging the costs off to de-

� Budget Bureau knew," the book gloats, "the 
f.,4.7-million it approved was for research con-
nected with the development of this aircraft, 
clearly within the realm of applied re-  rclr�
But In reality, this money was handed over 
to OSR [Office of Scientific Research] to use,, 
as originally planned, for basic research.") 
While Mr. Nixon may well be credited 
With cautions good intentions concerning 
CBW, the military apparently is having 
trouble kicking the habit. It is puzzling that 
the administration itself chooses to inter-
pret the 1925 Geneva Protocol as exempting 
tear gases and herbicides; in this regard 
McGeorge Bundy, in the course of his con-
tinuing descent from the hawkish role that 
he occupied as President Johnson's national 
security adviser, told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee in March 1971: 
"Useful as herbicides and tear gas have 
been In particular situations in Southeast 
Asia, I know of no senior military commander 
who would claim that in the wide perspective 
of the course of the war as a whole their 
value has been at all critical, In General 
Westmoreland's authoritative book-length 
report on his military operations between 
January 196.1 and June 1968, there is only the 
briefest reference to herbicides and riot con-
trZil agents. Seen in perspective, they are 
clearly marginal instruments." 
As far as herbicides are concerned, Bundy's 
point is supported by a still-unreleased study 
of herbicide usage in Vietnam, conducted by 
the Army Corps of Engineers. The three-
volume work, one volume of which is classi-
fied secret while the others are in the "official 
use only" category, indicates that com-
manders in Vietnam plate little military 
value on the use of herbicides. Although the 
battlefield use of tear gas may figure in War 
College scenarios, experience in Vietnam has 
demonstrated that the enemy can easily 
equip his troops with, or train them to 
improvise, breathing apparatus that renders 
the gas ineffective. Why, then, does the mili-
tary persist fn retaining the option for 
herbicides and tear gas, continue to rein-
force its capability for chemical warfare, 
and though the matter is uncertain, to 
dabble further whit biological agents? 
The answer is twofold: As Soviet-American 
arms agreements tend toward effective re-
t�trietions on the development of ultimate 
weapons, the military value of other weapons 
systems rises commensurately, just as the 
banning of firearms would elevate the mili-
tary value of bows and arTOWS. And, as is 
clear from public. Indifference to the savage 
air offensive that has replaced American 
ground operations in Vietnam, the problem 
is not to avoid war; rather, it is to avoid 
shedding any great amount of American 
blood. Hence, in the age of the nuclear stand-
off, the Pentagon is looking hard for highly 
lethal, non-nuclear, low-manpower systems 
that satisfy both military necessity and pub-
lic opinion. And CBW, Presidential protesta-
tions notwithstancliv� fits in nicely with 
t hat quest. 
Negotiations for arms-control agreements 
With the Soviets have freque ntly foundered 
on the issue of inspection, with the U.S. in-
ststing that its own inspectors, or perhaps an 
international group, have the right to con-
duct on-the-spot cheeks of compliance. Yet 
back home, the U.S. government seems un-
concerned about verifying whether its army 
is in fact abiding by Prcendential directives 
to engage only in "defensive" research. The 
Executive's disregard fr-r Congress in mili-
tary and foreign affairs has been so thor-
ouehly demonstrated as to eliminate any 
realistic prospect for defective Congreenoe.al 
scrutiny. V.'hen Com.ress has questioned the 
military use of weather, modification In 
Southeast Asia, for example, Defense's long-
standing reply has been, in effect, that it is 
none of your business. 
If there is ever an inspection agreement 
with the Sot-lets on CBW, it will have an - 
Ironic benefit: The American public will have 
rea.son to believe government accounts of

.AID TO TRIEU 
Mr, GRAVEL. Mr. Preident, there has 
been a great deal of controversy over 
whether or not the United States should 
continue its programs of military and 
economic aid to the South Vietnamese 
Government of President Nguyen Van 
Thicu. It is a question of central impor-
tance to the peace negotiations in Paris, 
and the answer finally given will be cru-
cial to the direction U.S. foreign policy 
following in the future. 
In spite of the great importance the 
resolution of this issue one way or the 
other will have, very few Americans are 
actually aAvare of the extent of this aid 
or the purposes it serves. Recognizing 
this lack of information. Le Anh Tu and 
Marilyn McNabb of National _Action /Re-
search on the Military-Industrial Com-
plex have prepared a special report, en-
titled "Aid to Thieu", which traces the 
history of U.S. aid to South Vietnam as 
well as the ongoing day-to-day programs 
in that country which U.S. dollars fi-
nance. I think members of the Senate 
and their constituents will find this re-
port of interest, and I ask unanimous 
consent that. it he printed in tbe REcoRD 
at this point. 
There being no objection, the report 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

The Paris peace talks often ridiculed as 
"propaganda forums," have actually re-

States, the Saigon government, the Provi-
sional Revolutionary Government of South 
Vietnam' (called the "Vie�teong" in the 
American press) and the Democratic Repub-

ciple to the withdrawal of U.S. forces, the

2. THE SenING ROUND-UPS 
Most news reports on the spring 1972 of-
fensive told of dramatic military clashes. 
Less mention was made of certain actions 
taken by the Thieu government which were 
made possible only by U.S. aid. 
While U.S. bombers were pounding the 
contested and "enemy"-controlled areas of 
Vietnam, Thieu's police, accompanied by 
American advisers, = were rounding up thou-
sands_ -of suspected "Communist sympa-
thizers" in the so-called "secure" areas., The 
spring offensive increased the regime's fear 
of trouble from internal dissenters. On May 
26, 1.372 the Buddhist Student Aseociation 
In Saigon announced the arrest and im-
prisonment of the entire leadership of many 
student organizations and civil rights groups 
in South Vietnam. 4 Relatives of known polit-
ical activists have also been taken into CUS-
LOCIY, and held as hostages.' 
A former New York Times Saigon corre-
spondent and veteran observer of the war, 
Tom Fox, describes the far-reaching effects 
of this crackdown: 
"Nearly everyone known to have been an 
outspoken critic- of the Thieu government�
and not protected by international recog-
nition�has suffered at the hands of the 
powerful National Police In recent weeks. 
"In Hue alone, more than 1500 have been 
arrested and most have been taken to Con 
Son prison iSland, an island which for dec-
ades has confined critics of French and 
American supported governments. Vs'omen 
and children have been rounded up among 
the 'political suspicious'�and taken by 
police to Con Son. 
"We've arrested the entire student body 
of Hue," 'loans, -Duo Nha, President Thieu's 
press secretary recently stated flatly... 
"In many cases people have been arrested 
solely because they have relatives in the 
ELI' or in North Vietnam 
"A louver house Deputy front a Delta prov-
ince said the police have come into villages 
and picked up men in their eighties who 
have not left their home for years, forcing 
them into small prison cells. 'Even village 
and hamlet chiefs and officers in the Saigon 
army are being arrested and interrogated,' 
Ile added." 
The ground for these arrests, having "Com-
munist sympathies," are broadly interpreted. 
They extend to all political opponents of the 
Thieu regime. especially those having credi-
bility anti influence with the general pop-
ulace. Those arrested include student or-
ganizers, religious leaders, and newspaper 
editors. 
"In Longxuyen Province, an area dominated 
by the lies Mao religious sect, seVeral hun-
drecl university students held a rally to pro-
test a decree tinder which most of them 
would be drafted. Although anti-American 
banners were dieplayed�"The students and 
people will not die for the interests of the 
imperialists"�the police clict not intervene. 
Later, however, leaders of the tally were 
reportedly arrested. 
"Other arrests of student leaders appear 
to have had little to do with public demon-
strations.

he conservatively estimated that nine local 
leaders of the Catholic Labor Youth Move-
ment had 'been arrested and that half a

Lon Nol's dilemma 
By Edith Lenart 
Paris: President Richard Nixon wrote a 
personal letter to his Cambodian coun-
terpart, Lon Nol, shortly after last 
month's National Assembly elections, 
asking the Marshal to nominate a vice-
president and to include Opposition 
.members in the new government. What 
had already disturbed the White House 
was the fact that Lon Nol had not 
bothered to take a running mate: the 
Cambodian Constitution invests much 
power in the president, and Lon Nol is a 
.very sick man. The Americans were dis-
turbed further when Sink alatak and In 
Tam � leaders of the Republican and 
Democratic parties respectively � decid-
ed to boycott the poll because they con-
sidered the electoral law unconstitu-
tional. 
if President Nixon's demand for a 
multi-party government upset the Lon 
Nol-Lon Non duo's plan to consolidate 
their position, his request for a vice-pre-
sident doubtless gave them splitting 
headaches. Apart from Nixon's need to 
see a more efficient and representative 
government in Phnom Penh, his demand 
for a vice-presidential nominee may in-
dicate a desire to prepare Cambodia for 
the possibility of a negotiated settle-
ment to the Indochina War. 
The choice of a vice-president and im-
portant Cabinet figures involves per-
sonal, elan and party interests: who can 
be useful, who can be trusted and who 
can be manipulated. There would ap-
pear to be four candidates for the vice-
:presidency: Son Ngoc Thanh, Sink 
Matak, In Tam and Au ChNoe. 
If the political scene in fundamental-
ly apolitical Cambodia is highly compli-
cated, Son Ngoc Thanh's position seems 
-

Letter from Washington. 
even more so. Born in what is now 
South Vietnam, he is remembered for 
his anti-French and pro-Japanese posi-
tion; his anti-monarchy stand; his co-
operation with the Vietminh; his long 
exile in Saigon; and his connections 
with the CIA. Although he is currently 
Prime Minister, it is not clear whether 
he is working for the Lon Nol-Lon Non 
combination Or simply using it for his 
own ends. Apparently he has the back-
ing of a group of Phnom Penh republi-
cans and intellectuals who would rather 
have an accommodation with the Khmer 
Rouge than see Norodom Sihanouk 
back in Cambodia; this group has been 
encouraged by Soviet promises that, in 
the event of a settlement, Moscow will 
see to it that North Vietnamese and 
NLF forces withdraw and that Sihanouk 
does not return to the country. 
Sink Matak's position is much clear-
er. Considered an agile politician and a 
capable administrator in Cambodian 
terms� he has the backing of business in-
terests and some sectors of the military 
as well as that of the Americans, the 
Japanese and the French. Because he is 
a member of the Sisowath branch of the 
royal family, the republicans suspect 
him of royalist leanings � if not for 
Sihanouk, then for himself, 
This leaves In Tam and Au Chitloe. In 
Tam, a former general, has considerable 
popular support � especially in the 
countryside � because he is a simple 
and honest man who fought side-by-side 
with the people instead of directiniathe 
�-��:-�"'ef�-.� 
war from an armchair in Phnom Penh. 
But since he has no political or .clan 
backing, he would have to fall in with 
one of the other contenders for political 
power. Au Chhloe has little to recom-
mend him; an adviser to Lon Nol, he 
served Sihanouk in several cabinets. 
Should he be chosen as vice-president; 
the post would be deprived of every ves-
tige of power.

must have been an intensely uneasy

Cambodia the clay before � a coup 
designed specifically to depose 
Sihanouk And reverse his politics of 
neutrality. It was not until they 
actually reached the airport and the i 
Russian leader was certain that the 
Prince would definitely board the 
plane for Peking that he shared his 
secret with Sihanouk. The Soviet 
Chairman must have been well aware 
that the Right-wing, military in-
stigators of the coup, led by General 
Lon No!, had let out the bath-water 
and he was determined not to be left 
holding the baby. Let's see how the 
Chinese comrades cope with this one, 
he must have thought. 
The Chinese have shown a re-
markable ability to embrace the 
glaring contradictions  raised by the 
presence in their midst of the 
descendant of Cambodia's God-
kings � the incomparable, irrepres-
sible, unpredictable, laughing and

role he has played in political life, 
October 22 will be only his 50th 
birthday. Besides which, guided by 
his stubbornly optimistic nature, he 
has chosen not to resign himself, but 
to fight. 
It looks as if the time is fast 
approaching when Sihanouk will be 
able to return to his country. He is 
convinced of it, and the Chinese tend 
to regard his stay with them as akin 
to that of de Gaulle in London during 
the war. The comparison fits in more 
ways than one. Sihanouk's relation-
ship to Cambodia has always had 
much of the nationalistic,  
paternalistic passion which de Gaulle 
fostered for France � both of them 
finding it extremely difficult to 
separate their identity from that of 
the State. 
Hardly a month goes by in 
Peking without some public tribute 
to the prince. Portraits of the veteran 
Marxist-Leninist hero, Mao Tse-
tung, hang � beside those of the 
descendant of the Lord of the 
Universe, Sihanouk. At official 
banquets, the rather austere Prime 
Minister of the People, Chou En-lai, 
is often to be found seated next to

does so, as always, with a smile. His 
sense of humour has rot deserted 
him, nor has he abandoned his 
habitual frankness. The thoughts of 
Sihanouk, intensely personal and 
often outrageous, make a striking 
contrast with the thoughts of Chair-
man Mao. He is no Communist and 
the Chinese know this. He admits to 
a profound confusion over Marxist 
ideology, a tendency to lose himself 
in what he sees as the complex maze 
of differences between contending 
schools of thought. His own Socialism 
is compounded of a mixture of 
Buddhism, anti-Imperialism and a 
totally subjective, fierce love of 
Cambodia. 
He has, nevertheless, chosen to 
act as the unifying symbol of the 
revolutionary guerrilla forces which 
are, at the moment, literally rocket-

now come not from international 
court circles but from the Marxist 
International.

Mr. Cook,. a long-time contributor to The Nation, is the 
author of many books, including the iecently published The 
Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe 
McCarthy � (Random House). 
. � 
The, most damning document to come out of the war in � 
Vietnam has now struggled into the light in this. election 
year It Was indeed a struggle: the disclosures were , 
squelched for years by the highest arms of the American 
bureaucracy; the pith of the message was ignored by the 
Senate .subcommittee, headed by Abraham RibicofT, which 
exposed the PX scandals; the revelations were verified by 
one of Life's top journalists-7-and pushed iside in favor 
of the incident on the bridge at.Chappaquiddick; the truth 
-set forth was too much, for major American .publishing 
houses, and in the end was published in Great Britain, 
coming to the American market on the rebound through 
the David McKay Company. 
This bombshell is The Greedy War, 'a 278-page book 
Written by the British journalist James Hamilton-Paterson 
and detailing the Vietnamese experiences of Cornelius 
Hawkridge, a dedicated anti-Communist who spent seven 
and a half horrible years in Russian and Hungarian prison 
camps before' escaping' to the United States, Hawkridge 
and Hamilton-Paterson call the war greedy and' the con-
tents 'of this book fully justify the epithet. Hawkridge 
was born in Transylvania, the son of a Hungarian mother 
..and a British father, _a . colonel in the Hungarian police 
force: His passionate hatred of. communism and the Rus-
sians led him intoprotests and guerrilla actions�and into 
those long years in prison. He Came to America believIng 
all the dogmas of the cold war and eager to aid as a 
security offiper in What he considered a holy crusade. 
The Dominican upheaval in 1965, in which Hawkridge 
could not find the Communists President Lyndon B. John--
son assured us we were opposing, was the first disillusion-
ment. Then Came Vietnam. Hawkridge's first day in the 
field there in 1966 was a shocker. Hehad.his nose rubbed 
immediately in the stinking squalor of the refugee camps 
of Qui:MI(3n. More than 2,000 refugees were living in pa-
Per shacks built largely of discarded American packing 
cases. Three contaminated wells provided the only drinking � 
water. There were no -sanitary facilities. "The inmates 
defecated between the rows of pa-per homes and the sloW 
seep of ordure crept up the pulp walls." Hawkridge asked 
,a -Priest what had; happened to all the USAID. "Stolen," 
the priest said simply. "It's taken by the ;Vietnamese Gov-
ernment.� 
Hawkridge. soon discovered that virtually everything 
was being stolen. Only the smallest trickle of supplies 
and war materiel being shipped to Vietnam in such 
prodigious, multibillion-dollar amounts ever reached their 
intended destinations. The Qui Nhon marketplace, an- area 
.of a good-sized block next to the refugee tamp, was .. 
stocked with "C-rations, K-rations, drink, clothing, guns, 
cannons, shells,. cases of grenades, television sets, washing 
machines . . the mounds seemed limitless." So Hamilton-
Paterson writes describing H awkndge s dIscoveria. Won-
&ring. what limits there were he asked a Vietnamese 
stallholder whether he could buy a tank, Tanks are a bit 
difficult right now,' this man admitted, but how about 
some armored personnel carriers? Or helicopters, of course. 
, Or how about a heavy-duty truck?" - 
'What the hell goes' on?, Hawkridge thought. And he 
rushed to' tell American authorities what he had ..found. 
They were bland, uninterested. Washington, in .its holy-
crusade delusion, had concluded agreements with the 
South Vietnamese that tied the hands of any security 
agent who tried to put an end to the- national pastime----
wholesale looting. Two provisions were critical: trucks 
could be driven only by South Vietnamese drivers; arid 
only .South Vietnamese police could make arrests. Even 
if an Anierican security agent 'like Hawkridge trapped 
hijackers. in the act, he was forbidden to lay' a finger on 
them; he had to call in the South Vietnamese police. Arid 
when they arrived, they-simply collaborated in the looting. 
Here, in capsule form, are some of the .things Hawk-
ridge learned and some of his experiences: 
liSouth Vietnam all �but. sank into the sea under the
of the tons of black-and-white televiSion sets, 
radios, spin, driers, untaxed diamonds and odier com-
modities produced by a society of conspicuous consump-
tion and -shipped off to Vietnam to win what must be 
one of the most curious wars in history. 
-The port of Qui. Nhon was clogged with shipping, a 
fleet that spread out to the horizon, Some of the - ships 
\\railed for.nionths to unload; meanwhile small boats plied 
out to their) in the night and sometimes in the clay; and 
so, when they finally reached a pier, some 60 per cent of 
their cargoes had vanished. 
SiThe United States shipped enough cement into South 
Vietnam to pavC the entire nation, but there was a chronic 
shortage of cement to extend airfield runways and erect 
facilities.. And the Vietcong always had 'a superabundance 
with which to build their individual bomb shelters. 
�On one occasion a truck containing several hundred 
TV sets was hijacked, tracked down in Tu Due and turned 
.over to the South Vietnamese police. Rawl:ridge went to 
reclaim this .U.S. property, but was told he would have to' 
get a .Vietnamese driver to take the truck away. By the 
time be had 'found a driver, the truck had been stripped 
of its contents right in the police compound. 
SOne night Hawkridge was following a hijacked truck, 
-mystified because the Vietnamese were ripping open pack-
ages in disgust and tossing them into ditche,s at the rout-
side. Hawkridge kept stopping and picking up the 
packages. They were a consignment of aircraft parts for 
fighter squadrons at Bien Hoa. When Hawkridge arrived 
at the air base, he was hailed almost as a _savior because 
.several jets had been grounded for lack of spare parts. 
�Another time, Hawkridge chased a hijacked truck 
right into a compound belonging to the South Vietnamese 
Security Police. The panicked driver sped across the com-
pound,'forgetting there was a river on the other side, and 
braked to a. halt at the last second with the front wheels

T-DE AMERICAN SOLDIERS who work 
� With them inNietnam speak re-
spectfully of the "ROK Marines." 
Technically, ROK indicates their 
place of origin----the Republic of KO-
. rea (South Korea); But the Amer-
icans utter the term as if it were 
"Rock," and as though it referred to 
their , physical ,.conditioning and the 
state .of their sensibilities: as soldiers 
they are brutal, licentious and they get 
�results. Militarily, they arc trusted by 
the American high command, which�
. in the current fighting�has 'assigned 
them the responsibility of keeping the 
vital: An Khe Pass !open and preventing 
South Vietnam, from being split in half. 
Some 37,000, of these troops .are 
presently engaged in South Vietnam. 
: Referred to pretentiously as "allies," 
their involvement is said to, arise from 
ideological commitment to the cause 
a freedom, national self-interest, or 
some other self-serving platitude. In, 
fact, they are latter-day Samurai, hired 
guns of the Orient, who have sold their 
services to Washington for the dtira-
'lion. 
. To be specific, the normal salarY of 
� a ROK army private i's $1.60 a month. 
But if, that private elects to serve in 
Vietnam, he can earn 23 times that 
amount, or $37.50 a month. In one 
day, he earns almost as much as he 
would have made in a whole . month 
had he remained in his homeland--
courtesy, to be sure, of the American 
taxpayer. The middleman of this op-
eration is the government of South 
Koica,� which receives a kickback of 
well over $300 million per year for t:.a 
service. ' 
. Such - "allies" are to mercenaries 
what a "protective reaction raid'' is to 
an unprovoked strike and what an "in-
cursion" is to � an invasion�namely, 
the same thing. � 
For some time now, persistent' re-
ports have linked these mercenary Ko-
reans to brutalities in Vietnam which 
- would make Rusty Calley, blush. In 
'June, the Alternative Feature. Servicg 
by James Otis 
Activities in RAND Interviews," and 
thereby made public What the Amer-
ican government has known for at least 
six years. The 1966 document is re-
plete with these stories of barbarity 
whin Americans have learned how to 
take in and ignore: 
O "When they Came to the VC-con-
trolled areas ... they raped the women 
in those areas. There. were times they 
killed the women after they had raped 
them. I heard just rec'ently women 
were raped and killed. The people Were 
so frightened of the Korean troops, 
they didn't dare to stay in their hoines 
but moved away." (from a 'National 
� .� � ' 
Liberation Front deserter) 
* ". . . only 50 villagers still lagged 
behind. Most of them .were women, 
children and elderlY people. The Ko-
rean soldiers rounded them up in one 
place. The people thought: that they 
were to be evacuated to the GVN-con-. 
trolled areas by helicopters. . . . The 
Koreans suddenly pointed their gunS at 
the crowd and opened fire. .Only two 
babies of two and three survived. They 
crawled on their mothers' bellies." 
(from a refugee) 
". � when the Korean troops 
came, they called all the old women 
and children down in the trenches to 
come up. Then these people were told 
to sit in circles. Afterward, the Ko-
rean troops, machine-gunned them." 
(from an NLF prisoner) 
O "Everybody agreed that the Ko-
reans Were barbarous., They went on 
operations without interpreters .going 
along. They killed at random without 
distinguishing between the rights and 
wrongs. Some people said it. was be-
cause the VC mixed themselves with 
the villagers, and thus the Koreans 
.couldn't help. making a mistake. I don't 
think their reasoning was right. I don't 
J. 
see why the Koreans 
children. 'Kids of two, three, or even 
five or 'seven years weren't VC. They 
also burned the paddy and the people's 
houses. They burned the cow-pens and 
the animals inside too. Cows are cer-
tainly not VC!" (from a refugee) . 
The introduction to the document 
notes that "no effort has been made to 
ascertain the. veracity of the statements 
made by the interviewees." And AFS 
quotes former RAND analyst Melvin 
Gurtov as saying that the report was 
"a draft circulated for comments . 
as opposed to a published study." It 
would be. a mistake to surmise, how-
ever, that this report outlines the full 
extent.of the U.S.. government's infor-
mation about South Korean murders 
� in Vietnam. On the contrary, Amer-
ican . officials have received at least 
three other major reports on the sub-
ject. 
Oh January -10, 1970, A. Terry Ram-
bo, a graduate student at the. Univer-
sity � of. Hawaii, told the New � York 
Times that he had reported the exten-
sive killing of civilians by South Ko-
rean troops to U.S. Army officers in 
Vietnam in 1966, but the information 
had been suppressed. Rambo and two 
colleagues, Jerry M. Tinker and John 
D. Lenciir, Were researchers for Hu-
man Sciences Research (1-ISR), Inc., 
McLean, Virginia, on a refugee inter-
view 'project for ' the Pentagon's Ad.:. 
vanced Research PrOjects Agency. � 
Rambo took the atrocity information 
to American officials in Vietnam. He 
� briefed a "group of ranking American 
officers in . Saigon about the report." 
The 'result: Rambo was "ordered by a 
general officer of the MACV [Military 
Assistance Command, Vietnam] staff 
to cease; investigating the Koreans�
and. no mention of it was to be made 
in our reports." 
� The Rambo team prepared two re-
ports, one without atrocity informa-
tion, one with it. This was done, ac-
cording to. Tinker, because they "knew 
that if our report contained anything. 
about murders it would be classified

the 
Editor's note. � The Nixon administration has been striving to foster the Nguyen Van 
Thieu regime as a tool for the " Vietnamization " of the war. But no glossy veheer can hide the 
hater's nature as a traitorous clique, a gang of robbers trading in prostitutes, drags and war means, 
a band of political speculators, blach-marketeers and endlesztcrs who have been plundering "aid 
� lands and the salaries and wages of their own civil servants and soldiers -- all this under American. 
protection. The following inquiry by Thanh Nam exposes part of this corrupt and rotten US-puppet 
-regime. 
SAIGO.N, in early 5972. 
Tens of thousands of Honda and Suzuki 
motorbikes and Mercedes- and Dats-tin sedans 
of every colour and hue rush along, belching clouds 
of exhaust fumes which ruin the foliage and flowers 
'of the trees lining the streets. 
The 3.6 milliOn people of Saigon live crowd-d 
in eleven districts. High-rise US-style buildings of 
nine, ten, eleven storeys tower insolently in Doug 
Klianli and Ngayen Hue avenues while along muddy 
and refuse-strewn odic!) s in workers' quarters at 
Chtiong Duong, Binh Dung and Cholon. whole fami-
lies are crarmned into shanties of thatch, tin and 
card-board. 
� 
.The number of Americans in military uniform 
has decreased a great deal. More and more snack-
bars, �Turkish-bath establishments and massage 
parlors catering to the. American soldiery are 
closing down. American military police continue 
to stalk about, but in dwindling numbers. 
' And yet, while the war is being " Vietnamized,." 
the American presence remains intact, overwhelm-
ing, in this city. It seems to have grown even 
heavier., more stifling:The scream of American jets 
keeps coming from the Tan Son N hut airfield. 
Crowds of American civilians and air force officers 
continue to throng Tu Do boulevard. The ..Ainerican. 
hand, the tricks oi old Bunker, the desperate 
moves of President Nixon to avoid checkmate, zis 
well as the histlionics of Utica, Ituong, ihiiiss and 
Co. are still daily topics of discussion for the 
Saigonese. People talk about the fiasco staring 
Nixon' in the face, the inevitable departure of 
Nguyen Van Thieu, the collapse of " Vietnamiza-
tion. " For the last seven or eight years, the 
Saigonese people have had their ears full of the 
" lofty mission of the Americans" in this country 
and the " stability " of the " Second 'Republic. " 
More and more clearly, the truth is appearing to 
them. 
� 
The .fortress in the city 
Everyone in Saigon knows about the new Amer-
ican fortress embassy, Bunker's residence. The old 
embassy at the corner of Ham Nght and Vo Di 
Nguy streets now serves only for the reception of 
ordinary visitors and the delivery of passports 
and visas. The new embassy is white-painted and 
six storeys high, with a helicopter landing strip 
on its terrace roof; where a chopper and its pilot 
-are standing by. -at all hours of the day 
and. night. The box-shaped building is set back 
�some distance from the street, surrounded- by a 
solid ferro-concrete wall, equipped with air-condi-
tiOners, electronic computers and a hot telephone 
line linking it to the White Ifouse in Washington, 
� and defended by machinegun nest. it is s'erved. 
by a power-house in .the backyard. Military police 
stand guard day and night. The Americans boast' 
that all building materials catim from the United 
States and that plans were drawn and construction 
supervised by a renowned American military 
engineer, at the cost of 2.25 million dollars. In 
early 5975, in an interview with a French journal-
ist, Bunker bragged about the solidity of this 
" White Ifouse " on the eastern shore of the 
Pacific. The unimpressed Frenchman replied with 
a wry smile: " Mr Ambassador, in my opinion, 
the fortress style cf the �embassy building suits . 
your name rather than ambassadorial. functions. " 
Bunker's face showed that he was not amused by 
the play on word. In fact, Bunker was no ordin-
ary ambassador and the unusual style of his 
residence indeed fits his unusual assignment. 
Bunker has been in Saigon for six consecutive 
years. His is the most difficult. and dangerous job 
ever held by an American diplomat in any period 
of American history. Political circles in Saigon are 
rife with stories and rumours about the man and 
the policies he has been pursuing. in spite of his 
76 years, Bunker is very fastidious about his clo-
thes, and the expensive caux de Cologne he uses 
vary according to the season-and the occasion. He 
has been, before his appointnwnt to Saigon, ambas-
sador to Argentina, Italy, India and Nepal. 
The American press considers him as a skilful 
trouble-shooter who shows cold toughness not only 
to his adversaries but also to his allies. Saigon 
politicians nickname him The Old Fridge, while 
the Saigon press has dubbed him the Proc msul. 
His business is to pull the strings on which Nvyen 
Van Thien dances, and he seems to perform it. 
well. Even when the ping is 'hard, he knows how . 
to smooth away the obstacles. For instance he 
would lower his voice and call Thieu by his name � 
(instead of Mr President) and tell Inth : " ii he 
United States is a great country, but one of her 
foibles is to laek patience. So you should realize 
that there arc. limits to American forbearance. " 
Or he would say bluntly : " This has been decided 
in Washington. Once our President has taken a 
decision, there is no turning back. " Then the only 
thing Thieu can du is to shut his mouth and stay 
.quiet. If he doesn't, Bunker will have this clin-
, cher : " You know, Mr Thieu, Congress has become � 
rather restive. They might reduce or even- cancel 
some of the aid appropriations...'' And that settles it. 
� The above are part of what the world press calls 
the tactics of pressure-and blackmail, the main-
spring of Anierica a diplomacy. � 
In fact, " Fridge " Bunker still has one more 
trick reserved for when Thieu is really intractable. 
He would smile and give- the latter a gentle tap on 
the shoulder and say softly : " Mr Thieu, we happen 
to know that you and Mrs Thieu have some person-
al financial- affairs to-settle. We should be glad to

In spi.te of its name,- United States Military Ad-

knows that it is the supreme headquarters of all 
military forces under American command in all 
battlefields in Viet Nam and tndochina. Once

that olficers in the Pentagon by the Potomac river

admitted here on special occasions are either girl-
friends of American generals or Saigon strip-tease 
artists. 
The conversations overhead in the club amidst 
the clouds of cigarette smoke and the fumes of 
whisky supply facts that are at odds with those 
mentioned in MACV communiques. For instance 
the following bits could be recorded on a Saturday 
evening of February 1972: " Those s.o.b.'s (meaning 
the Saigon troops) at firebases Hotel and Bravo 
refused to go on patrol outside the camps." � " That 
general Lam of the First Army Corps doesn't give 
a damn about military plans. He only seeks to 
feather his nest in Da Nang." �"Modern weapons 
entrusted to those loafers who prefer gambling to 
going to war are wrecked in no time."----"The CLA 
is purblind and the war is going down the drain 
in face of an adversary who shows miraculous 
stamina and resilience before the terrifying fire-
power of the American air forces..." 
In spite of all the nasty words uttered by the 
Americans concerning the Saigon army, � the Amer-
ican troops can't be said to have outshone it. 
Whenever Abrams gets to the fourth floor and 
peers. into dossiers kept by the Personnel Depart-
ment, he would feel greatly disheartened. Heroin-
addiction among American Gis has increased to a 
horrifying rate. Fragging is rampant, i.e. the kil-
ling by GIs, black and white, of officers they 
don't like by means of fragmentiou grenades. 
Hundreds of GIs have been disciplined for refusing 
to go on patrol. Thousands have been jailed for. 
hold-up, theft, rape... There are also the dossiers 
of 248 American deserters whom the military police 
have failed so far to track down in spite of the 
cooperation of the Saigon city police. Bat some 
Saigonese know quite a few things about them.

NEWCOMERS to Saigon could hardly imagine 
that even more feverish activity is reigning 
elsewhere than at the fortress-embasy and 
the MACV headquarters. The seat of this tremen-

Thoi Nhiem street, next door to the Na Loi pagoda. 
It is the headquarters of USAID (US Agency /or 
International Development). Outside stand rows

Viet Nam, if there is one. .Wnat ,loes our Econom-
ics Ministry do ? The only job of the Minister, 
Mr Pharn Kim Ngne, is to go each year to Wash-
ington to beg for nirl aniounting to 500-700 mjiliOn 
dollars. After that, USAID will take care of every-
thing concerning the distribution, utilization, regu-
lation, transfer and control of these funds. 
The USAID headquarters is divided into innume-
rable "hoards." the 15 essential ones being staffed 
with 1,500 ranking American experts. The Ameri-
can heads of those boards assume in fact the func-
tions of Cabinet ministers in charge of economics, 
finance, trade, industry, agriculture, communica-
tions and transport, security, administration, labour 
organization, planning, culture and - education, 
health, information and propaganda, etc. Each 
board is again divided into sections staffed with 
" experts " of numerous branches. There are two 
large documentation departments and a huge library 
equipped with electronic computers and crammed 
with maps, diagrams,. models and blueprints, as 
well as statistics of the most diverse kinds. USAID 
has its. own printing-office, the biggest. in Saigon, 
which turns out documents and communiques in 
English and Vietnamese. 
A Saigon official said : " It will hardly make any 
difference whether Vietnamization will be complet-
ed or not. This is the American go' ernment-gener-
al for South Viet Nam, many times bigger than the 
former French colonial government-general. Viet-
namiza.tion ? One can see that plenty of Americans 
are around, and more are coming ! " 
The Saigoneae know that the sharp increase in 
commodity prices, the cost of living and the 
rates of unemployment, inflation, and taxation 
springs from plans worked out by USAID. 
This super-government, which tops "�Prime 
Minister " Khiem's in that way, is thus very active.. 
But how effective is it ? This is a rather big ques-
tion mark, Saigon politicians have relished a recent 
disclosure of their American " friends. �' in Sep-
tember to 7t, Colby, deputy � 0101!,issinler in 
charge of the USA ID or four years returned 
in the US and revealed that of the two billion 
dollars ,stribintes-1ttv USAID in Sin:ill Viet Nam

reached their destination. The Jest, ',Soo million 
dollars, had vanished like the morning mist under 
the tropical sun into the pockets of Americans and 
Vietnamese at various levels in various places. 
Finally, to gloss over this eie and ugly story, 
and to " avoid putting weanans in the hands of 
Americans '\ h' are against the nar in Viet Nam 
the blame was put on the war and the attendant 
lack seeurity, a situation for which no one held 
hinaselt� resp.inaible. 
There is Still another government in Saigon, one 
which is invisible yet ubiquitous. It is the CIA 
(Central Intelligence Agency) whose name the 
Saigonese pronounce in a way wnich makes it 
sound like the Vietnamese word meaning " excre-
ment. " How many are the CIA men, taking into 
account both professionals and collaborators ? 
50,000 ? tooanoo ? No one knows for sure. Accord-
ing to some people in the know who become talkative 
under the influence of alcohol, the American CIA 
men are quite numerous. They may include ambas-
sadors, deputy ambassadors, journalists, tourists, 
senators on inspection tours, infantry generals, air 
.force colonels, Green Beret sergeants, businessmen 
or college professors. .None would' admit to being 
CIA men, but any American could be one. They work 
for CIA, either Inn or part time, without ceasing 
to be members of other military, administrative, 
�diplomatic, or political services. What about the 
native CIA men? They may comprise Cabinet 
-ministers, department heads, parliamentarians, 
churchmen, business executives, trade union lead-
ers, members of locarmaffias... Who are the CIA 
top men ? They are very :few, and very discreet. 
They don't live in ostentatious high-rise buildings 
but in cosy villas along Cong Ly, Had L'a Trung 
and Truong Ming .Giang boulevards�one - storey 
Structures with private gardens, tennis courts 
and swimming - pools. These are the resOrts of 
such men as Golley American ambassador and the 
adviser to yang Pao, both of them top CIA men in 
Laos. Saigon is rife with rumours about CIA deals 
on drugs and weapons all over Southeast Asia. 
There are CIA-run channels linking Saigon to 
Bangkok, Singapore, Vientiane, Long Cheng, 
Manila, Hong Kong, Tokyo, etc., through which 
foreign exchange, gold, diamonds, intelligence, pros-
titutes and what not are travelling. CIA spending 
are enormous, and so are its revenues. The CIA men 
in Saigon spend a great deal of money. Life behind

'dream of. 
CIA professionals are proud of their organiza. 
tion, which encompasses the whole "free world" 
and has deep roots in aliimst all capitals, anion:, 
people of all skin colours. They say : "Our country 
is CIA. CIA is a world-wide government." A mem-
ber of the opposition in Saigon scoffs "Their 
country is rather money, drugs. and costly pros. 
titutes. " 
The most noteworthy CIA exploit was the 
overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem. Of course they 
later denied any role in it, until the publication 
of the Pentagon's secret papers made everything 
plain enough. It was a Colonel, a CIA man, 
who as early as August 1963 hal been personally 
entrusted by Kennedy with working out plans for 
the toppling of Ngo Dinh Diem. Even now, men 
like Nixon and Goldwater still deeply regret the 
loss of Ngo Dinh Diem and have harsh word 
for CIA on this score. Rumour has it that ever 
since he knew the detailed truth about Diem's 
liquidation, "President"' Thieu often has had to 
resort to heavy doses of tranquilizers to get some 
sleep at night. 
The NFL's' great offensive of Spring r96S gave 
the CIA a slap in the face. It showed that the 
latter had been completely in the dark about the 
preparations and manpower movements for that 
tremendous undertaking. Another hard blow came 
in March. this year when Saigon troops suffered 
terrible setbacks along Highway 9 and in Quang 
Tn. � These. are two bigs stains on CIA records. 
Many Americans said at the time that CFA men 
had been too busy with sex and drugs. Others 
.ascribed the fiasco to antagonisms between the 
CIA, MACV and the American embassy on problems 
of 'policy in Viet Nan. They recalled that CIA 
men hated Westmoreland's search for military vic-
tories over the Viet Cong main force, a dream 
which never came true. For the CIA would rather 
stake all on the program for "winning hearts and 
minds" and "pacification," which they considered 
the only fighting-front. 
In the. 1964 - 65, the CIA fully approved of the 
_bombing of North Viet Nam. But in 1967 it coin-
pletelydissociated itself from the policy of war 
escalation. A top CIA man once said to Admiral 
Grant Sharp, the commander of US forces in the 
Pacific, who was passing through Saigon "When 
You start hitting, pull no punch. Don't you know 
that, you a militaryman ? Gradual escalation can 
only be frustrating."

4 � THE LAM SON � � . 
� THEATRICAL COMPANY 
THE topmost task of-- the proconsul Bunker and 
of MACV, CSAID and the CIA in Saigon is to 
promote a "model democracy" there. 
The "Second Republic," made in the USA, should 
have its typical representatives. So let us go to 
Lam Son square which faces Le 1,0i boulevard, 
and attend a session of the Saigon "Lower -House-
of Parliament. " The building is still called by its 
old name of Municipal Theatre and the Lower 
House has received the popular nickname of " 159-
member Theatrical Company. " 
Indeed- many sessions of the House can stand 
comparison with the most hectic scenes ever acted 
on the stage, with plenty of ''suspense " worthy of 
the mostc'breath-holding. gangster films or crazy 
whodunits. The worst abuse keeps streaming from 
one parliamentarian to another. Here are a few 
specimens recorded by shorthand during-a. session 
held in April 1970:-. 
" Shut up or ,break your jaw ! " 
" Embezzlement and incompetence are limited to 
no one individual. Those who denounce others as 
dung-eaters are swallowing things that are even 
dirtier. " � . 
" Go home, Mr Speaker, and wash your wife's 
panties rather than stay here and rave ! "-
However there are things that shorthand records 
can never adequately describe. On one occasion, one 
woman parliamentarian rolled up the legs of her silk 
trousers and, picking op one of her stiletto-heeled 
shoes, brought it down smack on the head of a 
male colleague some twenty years older. On another, 
a representative whipped out a pistol and a gre-
nade, which he unpinned and threatened to hurl at 
his opponent : all his colleagues were seized with 
understandable panic and quickly made themselves 
scared. 
- The - Saigonese people have all heard about 
their " representative" Tran Kim Thoa, who 
championed "equality between the sexes. 
When called to. account by her colleague 
Ho Huu Tuong about the pocketing of 5 out of the 
25 million piastres entrusted to her for the print-
ing of documents for a conference of the Asian 
Parliamentary Union in Saigon, she choked with 
anger and spat out between clenched teeth : " 
I'll-
tear you scoundrel to pieces and cheek up your bits 
with salt and pepper for seasoning._ -'-' To the House 
in uproar she explained : . " knock him dead. 
- lie is even dirtier than I ever was!" - 
Saigon democracy, the handiwork of the magi. 
clan Bunker, also .shines -abroad. One day in early 
1971, Dr Nguyen c72uang Luycn, who " represented " 
Gia- Dinh-province, -went on a mission to Thailand. 
He neld quite important. functions: deputy Speaker 
' of the Saigon Lower -'5.-Iouse of Parliament and 
, Chairman of the Viet- -Nam- branch of the Asian 
Parliamentary Union. Yet, at Bangkok airport, cus-
toms officers of that "friendly country" determin-
edly seized his suitcase and opened it. Their eyes 
goggled out of their heads : it contained no less 
than fifteen kilograms (more than thirty pounds) 
of illegal gold. So, he was whisked off to a police 
station in spite- of his twofold immunity -- diplo-
matic and parliamentarian ! 
- Another case Representative- Phan --Chi Thien 
was a priest turned politician. Completely disregard-
ing' his dignified demeanour, the police searched 
his bag and found four kilograms (more than eight 
pounds) of heroin worth tens of thousands of 
dollars. Caught red-handed, he tried to get. aWay 
with it by declaring that it was a business under-
taking whose returns were to go to a presidential 
'candidate's electoral lunch,� so after all it was no. 
dirty drug-smuggling but a political act.. This did not 
prevent the police from carting him off to prison.. 
Innumerable parliamentarian "missions" have been 
carried out in the same way. Saigon "representati-
ves" went to South Korea, Taiwan, Paris, Rome, 
etc., nominally for "State affairs" but in fact for 
fruitful deals in gold, diamonds, heroin- or porno- - 
graphic materials. . 
Sonic of the House sessions are rather gloomy 
affairs. They perfunctorily deal with "the people's 
life." Not many representatives attend. Their num-
ber is even surpassed by that of the "public" look- - 
jug on froin the upper gallery: police, plainclothes 
men, secret agents, and American "friends," 
most of them political advisers to the American-
embassy and journalists: 
The jolliest and most important session ever 
held was that during which it was decided to increase 
the parliamentarians' allowances to more than a 
million piastres a year apiece; so that freed from 
material cares they could wholeheartedly devote 
themselves to working for the welfare of the people 
Following the one-man election of Thien in ate 
1971, the relationship between the legislative and 
executive powers in Saigon has displayed even more 
histrionics likely to provide entertainment to the 
Saigonese. For - instance, the Saigonese "senators" 
were unable to stomach Thieu's one-man race and 
voted to cancel his election. For his part, Nixon 
didn't bother to wait for the Saigon "Supreme 
Court" to decide on the issue, and _immediately se'it 
a telegram of congratulation to his flunkey. The 
Saigon press wrote that Thiel) was not elected by 
the "5,goo,000 ballots east by 9.1.34 per cent of the 
electorate" as lloasted by official propaganda or-
gans (after all the magician Bunker could have 
. �- - 
conjured up any numbers of voters he pleased) but 
by a single ballot sent over from the White House 
across the Pacific ! The paper -Dart Chit Moi (New 
Democracy) likened Nixon's message of greeting to 
an imperial edict bestowing investiture upon a vassal. 
The new Saigon bower House of Parliament held 
its first session in early 1972. The new faces are no � 
cleaner than the old ones. Immediately after his 
election, Representative Diep Van Hung was caught 
in the act of smuggling prohibited goods into the 
country by Tan Son N'hut airport police. But no 
one any longer . paid any attention to such. trifles 
which had become routine business. The new thing

tnat nappenect with the Lam Son Theatrical 
Company was the heightened tension between the 
socalled "opposition" and the valets of the regime. 
New scophants replaced Trail thi Kim Thoa and her 
ilk in the unending task of "expressing gratitude to 
our great ally the USA". 
, In the eyes of. the Saigon People, both the Sai-
gon Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament are 
but cheap gewgaws for a new kind of "democracy": 
one-man rule, Thieu's rule ! 
Relations between the legislative and executive 
� powers in the Saigon regime are not in the hands 
of the Speaker, old Nguyen Ba Luong formerly, 
Old Nguyen Ha Can at present. 
They arc the preserve of Nguyen Cao Thang, 
-a � former druggist who has become political 
assistant to "President" Thieu and is considered to 
be in charge of the President's secret funds, stuffed 
with -American greenbacks. Political observers in 
Saigon hold that in major votings the parliament-
arians always keep an eye on the ballot box and 
the other on Mr Thang's billfold. None other than 
Nguyen Cao Timm; himself has admitted that Law 
_10-70 was passed at the cost of 15 million piastres 
in "gifts" to Messrs Representatives. The rewards 
were brought to the homes of the co-operative 
voters in fat envelope's accompanici by a letter of 
thanks from the Presidential Assistant, signing for 
the President. 
But money is not the only string linking the leg-
islative to the executive powers in the Saigon regime. 
Beware, Messrs Representatives of the "Opposition" ! 
Remember the fates of such oppositicmists as Truong 
:Dinh Zu and Au Truong Thanh. The former is still 
in prison. The latter after a few months in police 
custody was forced into self-exile abroad. Each time 
they look out into the Lam Som square, the "oppo-
sitionists" cannot help feeling uneasy. A monu-

Combatants" with their weapons trained on the 
Parliament building reminds them that the any law

5. THE PIMP MAYOR 
THE Saigon regime which nestles in the shadow 
of the American Embassy is worthily repre-
sented not only by the Lam Son theatrical 
troupe but also by the 39,372 officially registered 
prostitutes aged 16-45. Indeed the professional 
whores number more than 70,000. If one adds to 
them the semi-pros�most of them masquerading 
as " waitresses " in the more than 300 " snack-
bars " '� the figure will surpass the zoo,000 mark I 
A thriving industry of the regime I A figure all the 
more eloquent if one recalls that the total number 
of college and school teachers, medical doctors, 
engineers and pharmacists in Saigon is less than 
.one-tenth of it. 
US culture has also brought Saigon more than 
� one hundred Turkish baths, to which Formosan 
culture has contributed 370 young women special-
izing in " scientific " massage. Along Nguyen Van 
Thoai and Vo Tanh streets as well as Tran Hung 
Dao and Tran Quoc Toati boulevards there have 
mushroomed mot.ley signboards carrying suggestive 
drawings and inscriptions in English advertising 
steam-baths and cabarets with such names as 
"Lovely Bath," "Queen Bar," "Moon Bar," etc. 
The army of harlots is the product of the war 
imposed by foreigners. Its numbers have skyroc-
keted since 1965-66. Following each "sweep, " each 
'plan for setting up " strategic hamlets, " each 
operation for " special pacification, " " accelerated 
pacification " or " complementary pacification, " 
each � displacement of civilians, each spraying of 
toxic chemicals, population figures in the towns 
and cities would shoot up. Carrying their belong-
ings on their backs, the refugees would stream on 
foot, or in crowded buses and sampans, into the 
towns, where, failing assistance from relatives or 
friends, they . would pitch camps on sidewalks, 
waterfronts or in bus stations and public squares. 
The girls would fall preys to pimps and brothel. 
owners, who would give them some money for cos-
metics and dresses and entertain them with special 
films and novels aimed at arousing base passions 
and desires. Country girls with pure hearts and 
simple minds would soon be acquainted with I.ewd 
scenes on the streets of Saigon and pressed by 
material enticements and soaring prices into selling 
their bodies. A lawyer with some concern for social 
morals has observed: "In this city of Saigon teem-
ing with Americans, the fact that the men have 
become cannon-fodder and the girls have been 
compelled to offer the use of their bodies in order 
to eke out a living, is only a matter of course. " 
But the leaders of the regime look at things from 
a quite different angle. Minister for Social Affairs 
Tran Ngoc Lien has gleefully declared : " In this 
country, prostitution has developed into one of the 
best - organized trades ever ! " A representative 
blurted out in the Lower House of " Parliament" : 
" The Americans need girls ; we need dollars. Why 
should we refrain from the exchange? It's an inex-
haustible source of US dollars for the State. " And 
so important personages have set up big organiza-
tions dealing in human flesh covering whole districts 
and ranging from cheap brothels to the supply of 
deluxe .courtesans of various nationalities � Viet-
namese, Japanese, Thai, Formosan � to wealthy 
customers : American ambassadors and deputy 
.ambassadors, CIA chieftains, as well as Saigon 
presidents, vice presidents and Cabinet ministers. 
In the 1969-70, Saigon was shaken by anguishing 
news: girls of 13 or 14 were kidnapped and taken 
to .sinister dens. So-called Okinawa V.D. microbes, 
resistant to ordinary anti-biotics, were on the 
rampage after being introduced into the country by

Sept 1972 
American soldiery. The city was rife with all sorts 
of rumours about the wives of such and such Saigon 
civil servants, officers, professors or representatives 
catering for the lusts of the Americans and being 
paid by the day or by the hour.' Unbelievable 
things happened : mothers and sons, brothers and 
sisters ran into each other in brothels ! 
Who stands at the top of this prosperous and 
shameful industry? The Saigonese have come to 
know the answer to this intriguing question : he is 
none other than the Mayor of their city, Do Kien 
Nhieu. 
Nhicu is a native of Long An province. In French 
times, he was a constable and later became 'a cor-
poral in the native auxiliary troops. He was known 
as a drunkard and a debauchee. Under Diem, he 
made a profitable career for himself by " extermi-
nating Communists" and massacring innocent 
people. Later he was promoted chief of Long Xuyen 
then An Giang provinces. When Diem and his 
brother Nhu were made away With through CIA ma-
chinations, Nhieu bitterly grieved at the bad news. 
In June 1968, Thieu appointed Nhieu Mayor in 
replacement of Van Van Cua and promoted him to 
be a full colonel. He is Thieu's right-hand man and 
reigns despotically over the 16o square kilometres 
of the city's area. All the pimps and brothel-owners 
of the eleven city districts have been put under the 
unified control of his own aunt and elder sister. 
Other 'relatives of his have been entrusted with 
other busincs ses in human flesh. For instance pro-
viding " wives " to GIs; transfering " wives " from 
departing GIs to newly-arrived ones, supplying wom-
en seduced by American officers with marriage 
certificates and helping ' them acquire American 
citizenships, etc. 
Nhieu also holds indirect sway over such "cul-
tural activities as cabaret singing, strip-tease danc-
ing, at such " cultural . centres " as Kilby Dance 
Hall in Nguyen Hue boulevard, Ritz Restaurant 
on Tran Hung Dao street, Maxim's Theatre in Tu 
Do avenue, or Melody Dance Hall in Cho Lon. 
The owners of these profitable businesses have to 
pay him fat kickbacks. 
With lioang Thi Tho, who has brought the " art 
of presenting decadent, psywar-oriented music and 
singing to the level of a profitable industry respon-
sible for the moral ruin of a whole generation of 
city youth, Nhieu entertains special relationship, 
that between two professional panders.. 
Owing to the Mayor's solicitude and the effective 
assistance of American advisers, Saigon has witnessed 
the coming into existence Oi a host of strange 
characters calling themselves " local hippies " and 
numbering over ro,000 early this year. They are 
playing a very efficient role in diffusing the 
"culture" of the "free world" in this enslaved part 
of our country. 
Most of them are children of VIPs � ministers 
or generals... � or wealthy families who by fits 
grow tired of life only to become crazily pleasure-
seeking at the next moment. The boys grow long 
hair while the girls wear it very short ; both sexes 
wear drain-pipe trousers and gaudy shirts, make 
love in the streets, quarrel noisily in public, dash 
along crowded streets on their Honda or Yamaha 
motorbikes at breakneck speed, linger in cabarets 
and nightclubs where they perform wailing and 
syncopated outlandish music, are inveterate mari-
juana and heroin addicts, and indulge in looting 
and riots. They set up garbn7S carrying such evoca-
tive names as " Dust of Life, " " Black Star, " 
"Bloody Hand, " " Human Skull, " etc. Indeed 
they greatly contribute to the moral pollution of 
the already heavily-polluted atmosphere of Saigon.

Recently, owing to the departure of sizeable num-
bers of Gls, the prostitution industry has been on 
the downgrade. The massage parlors and opium 
dens are facing a dwindling clientele. Nevertheless, 
Do Kien Nhieu, the Mayor, after four years in 
business, has amassed a great fortune. Once during 
a drinking bout, he noisily boasted : " I am richer 
than any brigadier or major general in this coun-
try ! I am a millionaire in... US dollars ! " As a 
matter of facts, Nhieu holds fat accounts in Hong 
Kong banks. He has readjusted his business activi-
ties to fit new nine urgent economic measures 
decreed by Thieu. Score of new taxes have been 
promulgated aimed at sucking dry the cityfolk. 
Do Kien Nhieu, a major public figure in Saigon, 
is also a typical representative of the Thieu regime. 
This pander-cum-black marketeer is still doing a 
thriving business. He will no doubt be promoted 
general by his " President " very soon. But together 
with the latter, he is heading for inevitable ruin.

" INTEGRITY" 
� � To get a job as a longshoreman on the wharves at 
Chuang Duong .or Thuong Cang, one. must offer 
the superintendent a bribe ee..uivalent to two months' 
wages. A highschool gradui.te who wants to be a 
clerk in a government del)artinent will have to 
cough up between 100,000 and 500,000 piastres, 
depending on what kind of job he is after. lf he 
wishes to enter an American agency, he will have 
to offer money to a multitude of people.: from the 
district police to the personnel chief of the agency 
concerned. � . . 
. . � 
� A father who wishes his Son Or daughter to enter 
a general-education school must offer presents to 
the head-master and to officials of the City educa-
tional service. man who falls ill and needs some 
kind of 'treatment at the- hospital will have to 
give the doctor in, charge a shot of Vitamin /It 
(A/ for money) before he could hope to get some 
care and medicine in return. The military hospi-
tals are so crowded that wounded soldiers who arc 
fortunate enough to be brought back to Saigon from, 
Say, An LOc, lie on the cement floor in the verandas. 
Whether one such soldier wants a glass of water 
to quensh his thirst after an operation, or a pill to 
soothe his pain, or a new bandage to replace the 
.stinking old one, he will have to pay fen. it. If he 
.can't afford it, he will. lust lie there and moan 
out vain pleas for help. . 
�� � � 
A bus ticket to Central Trung Bo for instance 
generally costs three times its normal price. A trip 
to France will cost it stowaway about r,000 US 
dollars for a hiding-place on a ship. A regular exit 
visa costs 5,000 US dollars : everything can be 
bought provided you have the money. 
Children of wealthy parents never bether to study 
hard for their exams. They spend their time at 
seaside resorts with their sweethearts, or go for 
pleasure rides on their Honda motorbikes. About a 
week before the exams, they can buy the subject 
of the tests for between loo,ocio and 200,000 pias-
tres. The only condition, besides the money, is that 
they should burn the incriminating papers after 
using them. That racket about test papers is in 
the hands of Education Minister Ngo Khac Tinh and 
his associates. For his talents he has been dubbed 
Minister of lin-Education. 
� 
. Now about the draft. If you want to evade it, 
you must of course find a hiding-place, whether it 
be a cellar, a cupbcaid, or a dark corner in your 
own kitchen. But the point is that you must have 
a wad of banknotes in your hand, between 20,000 
and 5o,000 piastres just in case military police find 
you out. If you want to take a walk in the streets, 
you'd better have some money with you, for at 
each check-point you'll have to offer some dough 
to the officers on duty : in 1966, about 3,000 pias-
tres, now more than io,00b ! As you can see, prices 
have skyrocketed, ever since. the proconsul Bunker 
rei4ealed his intention to charge the colour of the 
corpses on the battlefields. 
�-Suppose they get you somehow and you are im-
pressed inti) the " Republican . Army. " If you 
don't want to be sent to fanaWay places up in 
. Central Trueg Bo or in Cambodia or Laos, if in-
stead of goi.ig to "hot" battlefields you prefer safer 
jobs like st,hcling guard before government offices, 
your parents will have to pay up to 300,000 piastres 
for the favehr, just ask the sentries on duty before 
T�HE worries and miseries that beset the people 
the City Eall or the Saigon Special Command, 
of Saigon are multifarious. Many spring fi'om you'll lean. that most of them are sons of wealthy 
the necessity to offer bribes, which inVo'lves Chinese me-chants in Cho Lou who in order to get 
many hardships .and much h - them these soft jobs have paid astronomical sums 
.�to high-ranking officers: 50o,000 piastres down, and 
then 20,00, piastres each month. � � 
From f97 I onwards, because of galbring inflation, 
the bribe-takers, instead. �of fat env, lopes stuffed 
with 5o0�piastre bills, would prefer presents in � 
kind : a few ounces of heroin in plasti-: phials, or a 
Japanese television set, or a big refr �;erator, or a 
Honda motorbike, or a dozen wrist-w,Aches... - 
- � 
Even those who are not. seek-in e any special 
favour must sometimes offer bribes, to district 
chiefs or to security officers, if they just .wish to 
be left alone to mind their peaceful Ind law�abid-
mg businesses. Otherwise they would e .summoned 
from time to time to police head, uarters to be 
questioned about distant relatives or childhood 
friends who, so they are told, have '')ined the Viet 
(long ! 'After greasing the palms of y.rious officials, 
they would be allowed to return hopie, only to be 
summoned back a few Months later, .'or more ques-
tions and more... palm-greasing ! 
To be fair, we roust say that the Saigon admin-
istration has promulgated quite Jew Iecrees against 
" corruption." Discussions have )een held in 
Parliament and the lawcourts. V ritable " cam-
paigns " have been launched with C a 'participation 
of police, customs officers, militi ry gendarmes, 
etc., and the whole court-and-pr ton machinery 
put in motion. Tens of thousand , r arrests were 
made, in January 1972 alone. Bu as a Saigon 
judge candidly said : " These cam:�tigns only hit 
at the small lry. Nobody ever clans to touch the' 
big fish !" The small traders com:ilain: " Whom 
are the authorities striking at in their drive 
against corruption ? They only sinai,h the rice bowl 
of the poor people by confiscating smuggled goods 
from petty peddlers." The only ins1-.ance of punish-
ment meted out to " big fish" was the execution 
of the rich Chinese merchant Ta Vinh. But this 
served .only as a smokescreen to cover thousands 
of much bigger fish. Sonic people also hold that 
the shots that felled Ta Vinh in fact ushered in 
a new stage in the history of wealthy circles in 
Saigon : the decline of the "old millionaires" and 
the rise of new ones, who wear military unifotin 
and hold absolute and exclusive control over the 
country's economic resources. 
The Saigonese know -that the anti-corruption 
drives are in fact golden- opportunities for more 
corruption : police, customs officers, military 
gendarmes, judges, etc., seize upon these occasions 
to get fat bribes and kickbacks. Indeed, one can 
say that in Saigon, the law-makers, law. enforcers 
and lawbreakers are just the. same people, and 
that the watchword : ".Fight corruption ! " . in 
fact in.eans,: " Long liVe corruption "

However, it would be. unjust if we were to 
include in that rapacious gang the ordinary rank-
and-file of the Saigon army. Iry the " free world," 
they are indeed the lowest-paid mercenaries. The 
salary of a ITC is 3,800 Saigon piastres ; that of 
a non-corn ,ranges from 5,00o to.�8,000 piastres. In 
comparison, let us ohkerve that a glass of beer 
costs 8o piastres ; a bowl of soup, roo ; a kilogram 
of pork, 600 ; an egg, 22; and a packet of cigaret-
tes, 80. How could they ever hope to make ends 
meet True, the Saigon atlininistration has on a 
few rare occasions raised teteir salaries, but while 
prices ride away at a gall p, wages and salaries 
creep along at a snail's pace. A paratroop NCO 
with some education uses this mathematical 
parallel: "While prices in-crease by geometrical 
progression, salaries are raised only by arithmetical 
progression." 
It is routine practice for a PFC or NCO back 
home after service hours to hastily swallow his 
bowl -of ,rice, don civilian clothes and drive a mo-
tor-cycle taxi for some extra earnings to supplement 
the family income. The case has been reported of a 
sergeant living at Bay Hien crossroads who had 
been compelled by financial oecessity to let his wife 
provide entertainment to sex-hungry GIs. She caught 
VD, the family was ruined by the costs of medical 
care, and the neighbours got wind of the matter. 
Finally the wife committed suicide by drowning 
and the sergeant, left with 6 young children to look 
after, was driven to near insanity. 
Soldiers arl'd non-corns with some special skill�
signalmen, engineers, mechanics... � try to earn 
some extra money by working on evenings and 
Sundays repairing typewriters, radio and television 
sets, calculators, cars and motorcycles, etc. All 
have work very hard indeed if they are to feed their 
wives and children. 
Among the junior officers, sonic succeed in getting 
rich through using their influence and power as 
battalion or regiment commanders. They grow up 
into wealthy big shots too. For them, their sala: 
ries only serve as pocket money. Their main income 
is drawn from .elsewhere. 
Let's listen to what Major he Van Ng4i, 
the commander of a 6cio-man battalion of the 
Fifth Infantry Division stationed at Lai Kim, has 
to say about his extra earnings : In annual times, 
when no operations are under way, the quarter-mas-
ters give him kickbacks of up to loo,000 Saigon 
piastres every month, from funds earmarked for 
�supplies and maintenance. Theso earninge really 
shoot up when things get hotter on the battlefields. 
Soldiers die or desert, but their names remain on 
the company lists, and their salaries go to their 
company commanders, who send half of -that wind-
fall to Major Ngai. The latter's cornucopia also in-
cludes a fat percentage of the operational funs 
(combat rations, special expenses, etc.) and the war 
booty : pigs and chickens, articles of clothing, gold 
and jewels mercilessly stolen from the civilians. 
Meanwhile the battalion's rear-base hums with. prol-
Rabic activities :-under the supervision of the Ma-
jor's trusted lieutenants, military lorries are hired 
to private traders for the transport of goods, most 
often smuggled ones, or are used to ferry "surplus 
supplies" : firewood, oil and lubricants, etc., to 
confidential middlemen. And so, after a mere two 
years as battalion commander, from a penniless 
captain, he has risen to be a millionaire-major, a 
faithful member of the Khaki Party, 
His colleague, Major IInynli Cong Do, v 
chief of the 3rd district of Saigon city, has fi hal 
his pockets at a still greater speed, thanks to I iree. 
ident Thieu's favour. Major Do's bonanza sprinei 
from-many sources : one is the damageS paid by tee 
American embassy to Vietnamese civilians killed 
"by mistake Or accident" by American borito, 
shells, bullets, or military trucks. These dam:1-4.�-: 
amount to 31. dollars per viethin the prie,. ef 20 
kilograms of pork; as bitterly observed by the Sel-
gonese. Forty per cent of that miim-V i it 
keted by Sir deputy district-chief for the simple 
reason that "were it not for his interveotion the 
Americans wouldn't have paid a cent !" Another 
Pactolus is the kickback from gambling-den gl�k 
who will ipso facto benefit from police proleetion. 
Another mint of money : the jUlok ,t ii at Long 
Binh, the great Ameriean 11,gisticat base. its the 
biggest military refuse dump in Asia, sperwlieg over 
tens of hectares, a huge motititruit 1 1i- carded 
jeeps, scontoears and trucks, typewiiiers, air-condi-
tioners, reftigerators, radio and guns. tie sheets, 
iron and corper wire, articles of eiotl,ing, blankets, 
shoes, belts, canteens, and AVIIM- Ilt,l ! Tens, hundreds 
of tons of them. On orders from the .% tnerican bri-
gadier commanding the Long Binh base, that enor-
mous mass of junk is handed over to Major Do, to 
be sold to the "district people, with prioi-ity to'fam-
ilies with orphans and widows it ho are es,pecially 
sympathetic to American and alb( dintuit- " at 
prices as low as one-tentli of ii -c on .the 
Saigonlilaelf market. But as soon as the goods are 
out of the stockade, Sir deputy dieiriet-a hie( hastens 
to put the "district people and fainiln-s otth widows 
and orphans" out of his miad. The merchandise is 
quickly sold out at the most profinilde � prices

henchmen..

7.7 THE KHAKI PARTY 
THANKS to solicitous care from the fortress-
embassy, political parties have mushroomed in 
Saigon, like fungi on decaying wood. No less 
than 123 political parties and organizations are reg-
istered with the Ministry of the Interior and the 
City administration. Proconsul Bunker can Mcleod, 
take pride in the fact that, quantitatively at least, 
Saigon " democracy " has outstripped American 
democracy, which can boast only two contending 
parties. 
The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dung has split into 
three factions, with three headquarters. One under 
the thumb of Vu Hong Khanh, who had moved 
south after 1954 ; one controlled by Nguve:i Hoa 
Hiep, and one, calling itself the " unified VNQaDD " 
and having Nguyen Dinh Luong as its bellwether. 
Each faction claims to be the genuine VNODD and 
of course disclaims all American subsidies and. 
string�pulling. 
The Dai Net has also burst asunder : the Bac Ky 
(Nort.Vrn) faction is under the sway of Bang Van 
Sung, the Trung Ky (Central) faction is led by 
Ha Thuc Ky,. and the Nam Ky (Southern) coterie 
by Nguyen Ton Tloang. The Saigonese give the party 
as a whole the sobriquet of Dai Fit, which means, 
Great Hoax. 
The Dan Xa is an avatar of the " Labour and 
Personalism " organization set up by Ngo Dinh Diem 
and his brother Nhu. Its aim is to restore tl:c Ngo 
dynasty, and it maintains close relations, pc litical 
and financial, with Thieu and other Saigon generals, 
-
and also with CIA chieftains responsible fer the 
murder Of Diem and Nhu. 
The list could be indefinitely prolonged : Phuo Viet, 
Cach Mang Nhan Dan, Vitt Nam Ilitng ()two Bang, 
Cong Flea Dui Chung, Doan ket, etc., not counting 
the Mat Fran CUU Ng u y Dan Toc (Front for Na-
tional Salvation) hastily rigged up by the Amer-
icans in an effort to rally all anti-Communist parties. 
behind Thieu. 
'Many of those " parties " can boast only a few 
dozen- members. - Some are possessed only of an 
" Executive Committee " of ten members or less, a 
headquarters and an emblem, all serving the sole aim 
of getting hand-outs from the Americans. Before 
attempting to recruit any follower at all, a "party 
leader ' . should first get himself a fashionable 
" suit " from Adam, the tailor in vogue 
in Saigon, a black Mercedes sedan, and an attach 
case which he would stuff with... old 'newspapers. 
These accoutrements will allow him to knock at 
Bunker's door, hat in hand. , 
�: 
- � One party stands out among all those American-
financed organizations. It has neither rules, program, 
headquarters, emblem nor any other paraphernalia 
normally connected with a political party, yet is 
especially pampered by the Americans. The Saigon 
-ese dub it the Khaki Party. Tt is made up of the 
generals and colonels promoted on the recommenda-
tion of the proconsul Bunker and has had a meteoric 
career which is Ei cause of bitter envy and deep re-
- sentment.on the part of the other parties. .. 
'IOnce Phan Huy Quat, who served as Prime 
Minister under Nguyen Khanh's -military rule, said 
with a shrug 01 the shoulders : " Their job is to fight 
at the front. Yet they intrude into every field and 
grab every post : president, vice-president, prime 
minister, ministers, province chiefs, etc. Here in the 
South, there is one. only political party left, the 
- Khaki Party." 
For the last four or five years, the Khaki Party, 
the pampered child of the Americans, has driven 
all other parties into the background. 
"Senator" Dang Van Sung, a Dai Viet chieftain, 
who has close ties with the CIA and was once 
General Taylor's favourite, is quite spiteful about 
the Khaki Party. At a dinner in company with his 
close collaborators on the terrace-roof of the Con-
tinental Hotel, he shook his head and complained 
with bitterness in his voice: "We are at the end 
of our tether. What's the use of founding a party ? 
The Army Party is ruling the roost." 
On the. Saigon political stage, gun-toting armymen. 
play all parts. All power is in their hands. Streets 
are controlled by sergeants, precincts by lieute-
nants, districts by majors and the city itself is 
headed by a colonel mayor. At the National 
Cultural Congress, the tune was also called by 
men in khaki uniform : Air Vice Marshal Nguyen 
Cao Ky, whose main cultural interest is cock-fight-
ing, gave his " instructions, 7 and psywar officers 
delivered lengthy speeches in paaise of "literacy" 
works by S. Paratroops Captain Nguyen Vu, and so 
on and so forth. 
Things are even more obvious in the economic 
field. The Khali Party controls all national 
resources. Everything is in the hands of generals, 
ex-generals, and their wives, concubines, relatives 
and friends : chemical' industry (Dosuki and C" in 
Bong Klianh boulevard, owned by Generals (ret.) 
Don, .Kuan, Kim, Tinian) ; i'mport-export trade 
(with yearly imports worth over 500 million US 
dollars), banking. (Ex-Defeace Minister Nguyen 
Hun Co is now the owner of a big bank)... Every 
.source of wealth and profit's is controlled by them : 
wood and forest products in the Central Highlands, 
cinnamon bark and pine resin in Quang Nam and 
Lam Bong, fish, brine and other sea products in 
Phan Thiet and Phu Quoc, even thc frozen-shrimp 
trade at Vung Tau. The real-estate business is also 
quite firmly in the hands of khaki-clad liigwigs: 
high-rise buildings in Saigen, Nha Traug, eam 
Ranh, . Da Nang, luxurious hotels and villas, 
complete with tennis-courts and swimming-pools, 
in Cong Ly and Hai Ba Trung boulevards, etc. 
Lesser figures in the Khaki Party control such 
profitable businesses as snack-bars, brothels, 
Turkish-baths, massage parlors, and laundry shops 
catering for American Gls. 
Time and again, Parliamentarians attempting to 
safeguard the interests of civilian traders and 
businessmen have vociferously condemned the 
brazen - faced encroachments . of the military, but

well, but. how can anyone , compete with the 
generals when they wield such power and influence, 
have access to military and economic secrets, hold 
control over US-aid goods, and, supreme argument, 
over the guns ! Many wealthy businessmen who

defence of corruption.. Among them is former 
president Tran Van Huong, who is now nearly So 
and has been connected with the regime for, decades. 
In one parliamentary rebate, he had this clincher : 
" If we should eliminate all corrupt elements, no 
one would be left to work for the States! " 
In the electioneering campaign of October ro7r, 
when Iluong was Thieu's running mate for the 
vice-presidency, he w.Ls praised by his sycephants 
for his " integrity Lnd honesty." According to 
them, he was "a rigl.teous man who lives close to 
the people and stays .way from all temptations." 
Then in early 1972, a pretty kettle of fish was 
uncovered. It was p-oved by political opponents 
that Huong was no irore honest than any other big 
fish of the Saigon regime. Immediately after he 
agreed to be Thieu's running mate, the American 
Embassy presented 'rim with a gift of io,000 US 
dollars. Thieu himseli: offered him a luxurious villa 
on f'han Thanh Gipri boulevard, and Bang Van 
c.juang, Thieu's financial manager, brought him two 
million in cash for " the furniture. " 
Later, Iluong also pocketed a check for 20,000 
US dollars. But what made him most happy was 
the " special fund " of the vice-presidency, put at 
his disposal by the Saigon Finance Ministry after 
approval by Hunker personally and by USA1D 
headquarters: from five million, the fund was 
increased to thirteen million piastres ! 
Huong� was indee(1 wholly correct when he said 
that a truly effective anti-corruption drive would 
drive all Saigon officials from office', and that no 
one would be left to work for the "State," neither 
civil servants,. police, gendarmes, parliamentarians, 
soldiers, senators, nor president, vice-president and 
premier : Corruption is the miraculous twee which 
keeps the State machinery in motion. It is the 
cement that holds together all components of the 
�  Saigon regime. 
No one should worry about the lack of industrial 
development in thE US-occupied part of South Viet 
Nam. Corruption and prostitution, thanks to the 
solicitude of the Americans and their fluiikeN,' 
Thieu, have reached a level of development equal to 
that of any industry in the world and could indeed 
supply the ''free world" with top-notch experts.

8.-SEA TIGERS AND 
BLACK VULTURES 
THE "get-rich-quick" methods of the Saigon 
generals have brought them new records. The 
legendary wealthy figures of French colonial 
times fiave now been relegated to the background 
the latifundist Tran Trinh Trach, who had enough 
rice in his granaries to food hundreds of thousands 
of people ; Nguyen Hun Hao, the father-in-law of 
ex-Emperor Bao Dai, the doe phic su who owned 
immense areas of ricefields in My Tho and ]lac Lieu ; 
the rich Chinese merchants of the 1 lui I3on lion 
type, who had rows of tenement houses. Even in 
their heyday, they could in no way stand in com-
parison with present-day generals. Because, in the 
.words of a wealthy Bac Lieu landowner, their for-
tunes are to the generals' what a little knob is to a 
whole TV set ! 
� 
� 
In these years of r970-71, for the first time in 
history, there have appeared Vietnamese millionaires 
(if their wealth is counted in US dollars) or bil-
lionaires Of it is reckoned in terms of Saigon pias-
tres). International bankers now show a healthy 
repect for Vietnamese moneybags and put them on 
an equal footing with American, British, French 
and Japanese nabobs. Of course President Nguyen 
Van 'Dieu and General ('no Van Vien are counted by 
Saigon and international business circles among 
� 
those Croesuses. 
These Men have invented very effective ways for 
. filling their pockets. 
Take for instance the case of Admiral Trait Van 
Chon, the. Commander of the Saigon Navy. He and 
��his predecessor, Admiral Chung Tan Cang, now 
military governor of Saigon, together with their 
subordinates of the Saigon naval forces, have all 
got rich " at the speed of PT boats " according to 
the colourful simile of their rank-and-file. 
Every three months or so, the admiral would 
� send groups of officers and men to the United States 
to take over warships handed over by the US Navy 
to its Saigon ally. These- are golden opportunities 
both for those entrusted with the job and their 
bosses at home. While living in posh hotels in 
'various port cities along the Californian coast, they 
have plenty of occasions to familiarize themselves 
with American " culture " and market conditions. 
Their cargoes of heroin, opium and marijuana 
quickly change hands, bringing them wads of green-
backs. Trips to the Philippines and Okinawa (japan) 
to fetch military hardware and get their ships 
checked are also highly lucrative and entertaining. 
No .wonder it happens that ship collisions are 
sometimes deliberately provoked by Saigon naval 
ofiicers to. provide them with opportunities for 
sailing .over to Manila for " repair. ' 
The coasts of South Viet Nam are uncter close 
surveillance by the Navy, whose ships, can cast 
anchor � wherever they see fit and' have besides 
" special security zones " put at their exclusive dis-
posal. It also owns the multitude of rivercraf t which 
ply South Vietnamese canals and rivers. Vice-admiral 
Lam Nguon Tank has many friends and relatives 
.among the wealthy Chinese merchants of Cho Lon. 
And so the trade of sea-products is of course in the 
hands of Messrs senior officers of the Saigon Navy 
and their clans : fish, lobsters, mine main (fish brine) 
of top quality, and swallow's nests, which fetch 
high prices on the Hongkong market. 
�The holds of Navy vessels are crammed not only 
with such valuable merchandNe as cinnamon bark 
from the forests of Trung Bo or fresh .fruit and 
vegetables from the delta- kitchen gardens .and 
orchards, but also with all kinds of drugs and 
narcotis for GI customers stationed in Cam Ranh, 
Da Nang, Cua Viet and other ports. One must add 
of course the " war booty" that has been mercilessly 
stolen from the coastal population .and fishing-folk 
in frequent raids, incursions and round-ups : gold 
and jewelry, clothing and. furniture, watches, radio 
sets, motorbikes, even fishing boats and gear. After 
each such raid, the lesser items are distributed to 
the sniall fry, while the more valuable ones or the 
proceeds from their sale are moved up the ladder, 
each level of the hierarchy taking its re-deter�minect p 
share. All senior commanders of the Saigon Navy, 
vice-admirals and admirals, are millionaires ; the 
ship captains and commanders of rivercraft groups 
are also very wealthy men. The land-lubbers, green 
with envy, call the sailors " corsairs who not only 
rob the population but also steal from the State', 
Indeed in the open-air markets of Saigon, at Th.oi 
Binh and Cau Ong Lanh, one can find every item of 
Navy equipment put up for sale on the pavement : 
buoys, compasses, blankets, hammocks, electric 
generators and what not ! � 
The airmen, for their part, do business in their 
own way, with the speed and efficiency worthy of 
the jet era, under the leadership of such men as 
" Air Vice Marshal " Nguyen Cao Ky formerly and 
General Tran Van Minh at present. They deal in 
light-weight, h igh- value merchandise : gold, either 
in foil or bars, diamonds, heroin... Missions to 
Phnom Penh, Vientiane, Bangkok, Manila or Taipei 
are highly �profitable occasions in which base, wing 
and flight, commanders operate in close co-
operation with Southeast Asia-based international 
dealers. The goods travel under the protection of air-
force military police and leave the airports in special 
air-force vans or even helicopters, which completely 
stymie customs officers and economic police. Air-
force officers at the big Tan Son Nina base also 
run a transit business catering for private traders 
with especially valuable goods to ferry to 
various places of the speed and security with 
which the precious cargoes travel : 200,000 Saigon 
piastres for the transport of a kilogram of heroin 
from Saigon to Nha Trang ; 300,000 to Da Nang; 
and 350,000 to Phu Bai,further north. The money 
is given in advance and no receipt is of course given. 
The sender gives the address at which the goods 
are to be delivered, usually a public square or a posh 
restaurant, and also the sign at which the receiver 
is to be recognized. 
Big money also comes to the airmen from the 
sale of US-supplied equipment : spark-plugs (z,000 
piastres apiece), special pilot's watches (40,000), 
plane wreckages (50,000 piastres a ton)... 
The Marines' worship of Mammon cannot be so 
discreet. The Saigon press is replete with unpleas-
ant news and tumours which greatly anger Major-
General Le Nguyen Khang, the burly, green-beret-
ed Marine commander whose headquarters is at 
No. 15 Le Tininh Tong Street on the Saigon water-
front. Marine officers, who wear the black-vulture 
badge, still speak with nostalgia of the great 1970 
bonana. ; the invasion of Cambodia in the Neak-
lueng region. It costs the Marines nearly a thou-
sand lives, but the survivors had a jolly time

Lon Nol and stripping the local population, "refu-
gees " included, of all their property : gold, jewels, 
Vespa scooters, Honda motorbikes... which were 
piled up on military lorries and whisked to open-
air markets which had mushroomed along the 
frontier. A Marine brigade commander, on the 
advice of no less a figure than General Le Nguyen 
Khang himself, sent his own wife to Neakluong 
where she quickly organized, jointly with the 
spouse of the Cambodian local commander, Colonel 
Tasayat, an efficient channel linking Saigon to 
Phi mom Penli t iron gh N eakl uong for prof ii aide 
trade in opium and diamonds. Thus was " friend-
ship " built up and consolidated, under the Ameri-
cans' benevolent eyes, between the " States " and 
" armies " headed by Nguyen Van Thieu and Lon 
Nol. The year [970, in retrospect, proved to be 
the apex of the fortune of Le Nguyen Khang, and 
of his Black Vultures as well. For according to 
wags at the Saigon General Staff, the pitiful show 
the Marines performed in Southern Laos in 1971 
was due among other things to the absence of 
such stinni Ii as gold and opium, which were hard 
to come by in the thick jungle of that theatre of 
operat ions. 
However, in this rat race, the men in the Com-
missariat of the Saigon army are the fastest of 
them all. The name of this department in Viet-
namese is Quao Tiep vu (Military Supply Depart-
ment), ()TV for short. It takes care of all the 
stores and supplies of the Saigon army, and the 
whole. of US military and economic aid to this 
army passes through QTV services. The OTV men 
have grown sei presperous that the acronym has 
been read by Saigon wags to mean Own tim yang, 
or Gold Rushers. Indeed they have learnt quite 
a few tricks from their American counterparts, 
who run the PX stores and engage in thriving black-
market activities. 
Let us pay a visit to the PA' on Nguyen Tri 
Phuong street, the biggest of them all. In spite of 
all the official announcements of American " troop 
withdrawals, " it is still crammed with GIs. The 
shop assistants, with painted lips and rouged cheeks 
and suggestive miniskirts, cast sheep's eyes at 
their American customers in the hope of getting 
generous tips. The rooms are filled with all kinds 
,of goods : motorbikes, refrigerators, television sets, 
tape-recorders, cameras, fabrics, the newest gadgets 
from the US, Japan, France, Canada.-- soldat 
specially low prices. 
IN principle the PX's are off limits to the Viet-
' namese. Yet black-marketeers wait in throngs 
at the door with wads of 500-piastre bills in 
their Pockets, for the kind-hearted GIs arc ready 
to help them get any commodities they want, against 
hard cash of course. Getting a 9-inch TV set for them 
will bring the GI 15,000 piastres' net profit ; a 
Honda moped will fetch them ro,000. The whole 
deal takes five minutes and twenty steps down the 
street. No wonder that many GIs have sung the 
praise of Saigon as a new Eldorado. 
US commissaries, however, look down on such 
paltry deals. Theirs are of a quite different magni-
tnee. Let us follow for instance an American eonvOy 
(usually from 5 to zo trucks) carrying military 
supplies along one of the main highways leading 
from Saigon to Vong Tau, Tay Ninh or even nearby 
Bien lloa. At a given place, the convoy would 
screech to a sudden stop and some lorries would be 
quickly unloaded. The crates are dumped onto the 
roadside and quickly taken by waiting men to con-
venient hiding-places, and the convoy would start 
rolling again. The whole operation lasts only a few 
ery : 10,000 piastres for a big crate, 6,000 for a 
smaller one. Their contents are not known in ad-
vance, and that is the spice of the deal, which is 
as fascinating as a roulette game. When the crates 
are opened, the Vietnamese- _buyers, civilians or 
QTV men, hold their breath : if the boxes are fitteu 
with blankets of articles of clothing, they will give 
a contended nod, for the profits will be quite sizable. 
But they are really mad with joy if the goods then 
out to be watches, electronic radio valves, or lighter 
flints. On the other hand, they will put on a long 
face if confronted with heaps of Cl training man-
uals, MP white helmets, rolls of toilet paper, or 
some metal or plastic machine parts of uncanny 
shapes. These will have to be quickly disposed of. 
But don't feel soiry for the gambler-buyers, they 
will make up for the losses later, and Nvith a 
vengeance. 
This original way of doing business lets begun to 
be practised by QTV men along such routes as the 
Saigon�BariaeSaigon�Lai Khe and Da Nang�Chu 
Lai highways. 
Recently a big scandal erupted in Saigon about 
the theft of 420 tons of copper hardware and elec-
tronic equipment from the giant Long Binh US 
logistical base. The stolen goods were loaded on the 
cargoOtip Bong Nai bound for Singapore, at a time 
when the price of copper was shooting up on the 
world market. The deal involved big shots in many 
services, both American and Vietnamese: the Econom-
ics Ministry, the port administration, tl.e customs 
service, American senior officers, etc. Palingreasing, 
as it was later revealed, took as much as 30 million 
piastres, but it apparently foiled to satisfy every-. 
body, for the beans were eventually spilled by some 
malcontent. The goo* according to time exposme, 
had been taken to the wharves by American militaey 
lorries during fifteen consecutive nights, in curlew 
hours of course ! They consisted of brand-new altil-
lery shell-cases (the warheads had been unscrew,d 
and sold out to junk-yard dealers in Cholon) and 
costly military signal equipment. 
Outstanding among the Vietnamese names men-
tioned in connection with this big deal are thmse 
of General Bong Van Khuyen, head of the Commis-
sariat, and other ()TV senior officers. Their tort 
nes rival those of other top brass of the 
Saigon army : Admirals Chung Tan Cang and Tran 
Van Chou, Air-force Generals Tran Van Minh and 
Vu XUall Lanh, Marine General i.e Nguyen Khang, 
Paratroop General Du Quoc Bong, and other hie-
rarchs of the IChahi Party. Small wonder that 
they are bemused by the prospect of American 
withdrawal and the wobbling posture of their 
ringleader Nguyen Van Thieu.

7.� THE NUMBER ONE MAN - 
AND HIS PROFESSION OF FAITH 
WHEN, in late 1.97o, a number of parliamen-
tarians met in the Dien Hong Conference 
hail which stood among the bank buildings 
near the -Chuong Duong docks, and kicked up a 
row about � corrupt ion among the bigwigs in the 
government, the name of Major-general DO Cao Tri 
was the subject. of vehement debate. 
In the coffee houses . along Tu Do (Freedom) 
Boulevard and the posh refreshment stalls along 
the Saigon-Bien Iloa. expressway, the name of Do 
Cat) Tri, President Thieu's right hand man, became 
a byword of plunder and embezzlement. 
At the joint General Staff Headquarters, junior 
officers doing clerical work amidst the. ,scream of 
jets from the Tan Son Nhut airfield agreed that the 
major- general was indeed the number one embezzler 
and bribe-taker of the Saigon army. Behind him 
stood three other�generals in this order : Bang Van 
Quo ng, I,n Lan and Dam Van Quang. 
Who was Do Can Tri ? His name was a household 
word among the paratroopers. He joined the French 
cohmial army at the age of 17, was sent to France 
for training and made his first parachute jump at 
. the age of is, whereupon he was promoted second 
lieutenant. It was in 1946. Later Tri liked to remi-
nisce about his French superiors at. the time, Co-
lonels Gilles, Ducourneau, Konal and others, and 
about his participation in operations of the French 
Soon,, on the highway leading from Chup to the 
frontier and on to Saigon, long convoys of Amer-
ican-made military trucks. with QC (Quan Canh : 
Military Police) escorts started rolling. Under the 
tarpaulins they carried ro-12 fat oxen or buffaloes 
apiece. About 4,000 head of cattle ,thus passed the 
frontier in one week. But what particularly enraged 
the French plantation-owners was the looting of 
their rubber stocks. Nearly a thousand tons Of raw 
rubber were thus taken away by 20o truck convoys, 
this operation being given priority even over the 
evacuation of Tr i's wounded soldiers. The bales bore 
inscriptions in French "Plantation Chup," or "Plan-
tation Mimot." 
After the warehouses were nearly emptied, aircraft 
were called in to drop incendiary and napalm bombs. 
Called to account by angry Cambodian senior offi-
'curs, 'Fri answered with a shrug of the shoulders : 
" The latex is so inflammable ! A few Viet Cong 
shells were enough to set it �ablaze. As for the 
cattle, well, they just stampeded away when the 
battle started and we couldn't do a thing about it,

18th infantry Division later supplied some details 
about the operation, in the course of a carousal:

were welcomed at the frontier by no less a figure

not such a fool as to risk his life by going to the 
tiger's den. It was publiC knowledge that Tri enjoyed 
"President " Thieu's Complete confidence and pro-
tection, and his truculence naturally knew no 
bounds. Indeed, the mere sight of him would fright-
en the ordinary citizen out of his wits : t burly 
figure with fierce features, jumbo-sized dark glasses, 
a black beret tipped at a sharp angle, and enormous 
pipe pugnaciously sticking out of a corner of his 
mouth from which came an unending flow of foul 
language, one hand waving a silver-tipped ebony 
swagger-stick, the other ready to whip out a caliber Colt Colt pistol at the least displeasure. 
Tri's career had been meteoric. His climb from 
ordinary paratrooper in the French colonial army to 
major-general in Thieu's army had been all smooth 
sailing. Made commander of the most important of 
the four Corps Areas of the Thieu regime, then 
commander-in-chief of the 50,000 Saigon troops 
invading Cambodia, he had good reasons to believe 
that his star would keep rising. Financially speak-
ing he had made quite a few lucky strikes. In 1955 
he had pocketed heaps of money in the operations 
ordered by Ngo Dinh Diem, his then in titer, against 
the Binh Xuyen. In late 1903, he Was serving 
in the First Corps Arc-a when Diem and his brother 
Nhu were liquidated at CIA instigation. Tri received 
orders from his new masters to arrest Diem's bro-
ther Ngo Dinh Can, the satrap of Central Trung Bo, 
whom he used to respectfully address as " Elder 
" Among the latter's confiscated property 
was a box of diamonds, the most precious item in 
the immense fortune of the `` Tiger of Trung Be." 
A Tri aide who was present when the box was seized 
From r965 onwards, as the war expanded, Tri's 
fortune also knew a fantastic rise. One of his 
younger brothers was appointed commander of the 
Bien Floa sector, the family's native region. Another 
was given a lucrative job in le forestry adminis-
tration while a third worked ill the army's security 
forces, a good position from which to "protect " 
the business deals of the Do Cao clan. The Saigon 
press talked a great deal about the Do Cao " war-
lords " who, under the wings of General Tr, planned 
to become financial magnates as well. � 
In March 1972 General Tri's career came to an 
abrupt end when his helicopter, in which had also 
taken place his closest American advisers, was shot 
down by Tay Ninh guerillas soon after taking off 
from the Trang Lon airstrip. 
It was reported that 'Chien wept bitterly when 
accompanying Tri's remains to the military ceme-
tery at Bien Ifoa. The dollar-scented relationship 
between the two was well-known : a sizable part 
of the Thieu family's income came from Tri's 
contribution, through the channel of the " sisterly " 
rapport between San, Thieu's wife, and .Kim Chi, 
Tri's third spouse, who incidentally was the 
daughter of Nguyen Hue Tri, the governor of 
Tonkin in French times. 
Soon before his death, Tri had uttered what could 
lae considered the profession of faith of the lihrki 
Party anti the Saigon generals' guideline for action. 
The French journalist Jean Larteguy, who interview-
ed Tri in Tay Ninh town, recounts that after remi-

his former saperiors in the French colonial army --

12. �Inside the Dragon's 
Head Palace 
- The Khaki Party- had. no officially proclaimed 
leader. But tlw Saigonese know very well who is at 
- the top, In fact. they know all ;Llama his past and 
present. Bunker has been warmly praised by Nixon 
for the acumen he displayed when he put that man 
in the Dragon's I lead Palace. 
When in late 1963, Ngo Dinh Diem was made 
way with at CIA instigation, the Americans found 
themselves in a quandary, Coup followed coup at 
such a tempo that, as saifi an English newspaper, 
" no one knows on waking up each morning what 
government has come to pokvor." It was then that 
Bunker made his judicious choice of a man worthy 
of the confidence of the " free- world. " lie was the 
" statesman " Nguyen Van 'Mien. Of course there 
were a few snags. For instance the tact that Thieu 
had been staff . sergeant in the French colonial 
army. It was rattier awkward to put an understrap-
per of the French colonialists at the top of the 
government 6f an " independent nation. " But Thieu 
knew how to make up for his shortcomings. 
Before becoming the bell wet her of t he khaki Part y' 
Then had fed on corn from every bin. Ile had been 
a member of the Dai Viet Party, then had joined 
� the Lab(nir and Personalism Party of Ngo Dinh 
Nhu, and called himself a Buddhist before becoming 
a fervent Catholic, in order to please the then Pre-
sident Diem as well as his own ( atholic wife. A 
.complete and succinct description of Nguyen Van 
Thiel] could be found in this conversation he might 
have with an imaginary interlocutor: " Are you a 
Did V ret ? Su re� :" A rid a Ille,Inher of the' Labour 
and Personalism Paily as well ? " " Of course." ; 
" A follower of Ngo Dinh Diem ? " " Yes. 
." Didn't you oppose Diem ? " � " Why shouldn't 
I ? "; " Are you a Catholic ? " � " You lot. " ; " And 
a Buddhist too ? "� " Correct. " And so on and so 
forth... . 
Saigon � politicians have dubbed Thieu " The 
- Master Turncoat, �' for his skill in forsaking the 
French for the Americans, Diem for Minh,. Minh 
for Khanh, etc. and in taking care of number one. 
Once he made common cause with Lam Tan Phat 
and Duong Ngoc Lain but left them in the .lurch 
when the going got- touch. The depaty Ngo..Cong 
Due calls him the " Six-faced Die. " 
Then has just turned 49. News leaked out from 
the " DragOn's I lead Palace " said that as prepara� 
tions were under way for a tremendous birthday 
party for the " President, " everything was spoilt 
by the gloomy reports from Highway 9 where all 
the strong points built by the Saigon army had 
collapsed. And so, when the festivities were held 
on the night of April 5, 1972, to mark the entry 
of the " President " into the 5oth year of his life 
full of intrigues and plots, the whisky drunk for 
the toasts tasted like gall and wormwood. And no 
wonder, Said a soothsayer with a political turn of 
mind living on Confucius Memel, for this year will 
.prove to be one of hoodoo for the " President. " 
,�Thien attracted the Americans' attention as. early 
as the days when he was attending military training 
courses at -Fort Leavenworth in the USA. Ile was 
interviewed by .General Taylor persimallY. Ever 
since then he has tried hard to groom himself for a 
career as a " statesman. " For instance, he avoids 
drinking and revelling in public; But his political 
machinations are far from innocent-. � 
. What Nixon and his proconsul Bunker have been 
'seeking has been a Diem government without Diem, 
a Diem line without Diem. There are many point. 
ers. The role played by 'Fran Kim 'Dwell for 
instance. 
After Diem and his brother Nhu met their death 
in an American-made armoured car, people say that 
their evil spirits jointly appeared in -human 
form in the person of their former aide 
Tran Kim Tuyen. Tuyen had built and con trolled 
the whole �network of secret agents of the Ngo 
dynasty and was notorious for his machiavellian 
schemes. In late 1967, after his entry into the 
" Dragon's Ilead Palace, " 1I.iicii got TuYen out .of 
prison and had hint installed in a luxurious villa 
linked to the Presidential office by a direct tele-
phone line. Tuyen thus became a major, albeit 
hidden, Presidential adviser. People see his hand in 
c;uch murky affairs as the murder of Professor 
Nguyen Van Bong and the ouster of such right-hand 
men of Nguyen Cao My as Lt. Nguyen Khang, 
governor of Saigon, and Linh Quang Vieni Minister 
of the Interior, at a time when Ky himself, as Vice-
President, was having his office in the same palace 
as Thiel]. More recently, when Ky and Big Minh 
were prevented from competing with Thiel' in the 
one-man " presidential " race � that brazen act of 
dictatorship in the midst of a show of 
democracy " the credit for that cunning scheme 
also went partly to Tran Kim Tuyen. 
Thiel] lives in the " independence Palace, " 
also dubbed by the Saigonese " Dragon's I lead 
Palace, " protected by stringent security 
measures. The iron fence which had been 
partly knocked down in the Spring of 1968 has been 
replaced and reinforced. Two heavy M.48 tanks 
stand by in a corner of the grounds in the shade of 
mango trees, as yell as three grey.painted I 
helicopters further to the left. In the backyard, two � 
M.I13 armoured personnel carriers point their heavy - 
machine guns outward. Both vehicles and pedestrians 
are banned from fluyen Tran street, which runs 
along the back side of the palace. The nearby Ong 
Timing stadium and Tao Dan park have been 
turned into a huge camp, where 2 oo paratroopers 
in camouflaged uniform and armed with quick-
firing M.16 submachineguns have pitched tents, 
together with clusters of jeeps and military lorries. 
Policemen, clad ill Nvhite in the daytime and olive 
-drab at night, patrol the surrounding streets: They 
are armed cap-aTie and number at least two batta-
lions, for surveillance over an area of less than one 
square kilometre'. Behind each tree, lurk two or 
three uniformed policemen. As for the plainclothes 
men, their number is difficult to ascertain. 
Quite � memorable were the security measures 
taken at Thieu's inauguration on October .3r, r97r. 
In front of the " Independence Palace, " along 
Thong Nhut boulevard stood no less than 42,000 
troops and police .under the direct command of 
Brigadier Cao Ilao lion, aSsistant to the I nterior 
Minister. They ;were there to ensure safety for the 
Less than 10,000 people who attended the ceremony : 
high-ranking functionaries, foreign guests and 
American officials. As for the 3.5 million Saigonese, 
they were ordered to stay behind close doors, the

best way for them to celebrate the investiture 
of the man whom Nixon had just pritistd as " one 
of the major leaders in Asia. " 
After crossing the lawn and the flower-beds,. 
where "Longevity" chrysanthemums are grown, we 
enter the main hall. Behind immense doors of 
polished wood is the ceremonial room where big 
receptions are usually held, attended by such 
pillars of the regime as Ambassador Bunker, Gene-
r:ds Abrams and Weyand, the director of USA ID, 
Saigon generals with their la-jewelled spouses and 
senior officers of " allied " armies: South Korea, 
the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand... 
sporting Saigon medals awarded them for their 
" exploits " in massacring South Vietnamese civil-
ians. In short, the cream of Saigonese society, 
viewed from the angle of Thieu and Co. But 
intelligent and honest people hold quite different 
views. A Saigon lawyer, for instance, has called 
the habitues of such gatherings " a refuse heap 
that the people �vill sweep away. " 
At the far end of the ceremonial room stand a 
pair of elephant tusks in a glassease. Next to it is 
a.door of polished wood which leads into Thieu's 
office. The floor is covered by a red carpet. Thieu 
sits behind an immense desk of bulky shape, in an 
armchair upholstered in flowered silk, with a cush-
ion to support his aching back. Here Thien discusses 
" State affairs " with his close advisers. Topping 
the list is Hoang Due Mut, his press secretary and 
number-one counsellor. Others are Nguyenl'hu Due, 
his-mentor on foreign affairs, Dang Van Onang, 
adviser, and Nguyen Ngoc Linh, former 
of Viet Tan Xa, the Saigon official news 
now a millionaire whose wily schemes are 
greatly appreciated. Thieu's son-in-law, Trang Si 
Tan, has recently been admitted to those meetings, 
where the most notorious frame-ups of the "Second 
Rtpublic " have been thought out. They have 
resulted in the arrests of Trait Ngoc Chau, secre-
tary general of the Lower house ; Truong Dinh Dzu, 
Thieu's runner-up in the presidential race of 1967 ; 
Au Truong Than lx ; and the bonze Thich Thien Minh, 
later sentenced .to ten years of hard labour and 
five of solitary confinement...,all for t hie r anti-war 
attitudes. Also in this room have been devised such 
cunning schemes as the law winch compellecl all 
presidential candidates to produce evidence of sup-
� port by at least .jo members of the "National 
Assembly " or too members of provincial councils 
-- a hurdle which tripped Nguyen Can Ky evert 
before the race began. Ky was so embittered that 
even now, in his Nha Trang retreat, he often 
clenches his teeth in the midst of a tennis game and 
gives the ball a whacking bl(ny accompanied by a 
curse addressed to that " s.o.b. Thieu! " 
Other decisions, adopted on direct instructions 
from the Americans, are taken in another room, on 
the second floor of the left wing. It is a big draw-
ing-room with furniture upholstered iii purple 
velvet and light-yellow carpeting. Every time he 
comes, Brinker would stalk straight down the. 
cor.ridor, up the stairs and into the room, followed 
by his host, who walks with a bad limp due to 
sciatica. Iloang Due Nha �alone s allowed to be 
present at such meetings. 
Political circles in Saigon have been wondering 
whether Homing Due Nha is the roan of Thiel], or 
Bunker, or both, While Thiel' puts up a show of 
filial respect for Bunker, he is often annoyed at the 
latter's peevishness. Thieu is linang Due Nha's 
maternal uncle. Nha received thorough training it' 
the United States from the age of 25 to 28 (he is 
,now 32) at Stanford and Pittsburgh universities, 
majoring in history apd economics. A taciturn man 
with eyes hidden behind thick -lenses, he is a repu-
tedly ambitious and wily politician. Ile and Thieu 
completely agree on this guideline for action : The 
end justifies the means. This highly practical motto 
perfectly suits the taste of the Americans, but 
contributes to time accusation brought against 
Tibet] by his political opponents, who consider him 
a treacherous and unscrupulous inch% idua/. " After 
shaking hands with Thku, " they say, " you'd 
better make sure you still have all your fingers 
left. " 
Even now Thieu's participation in the November 
robri coup, which overthrew Ngt� Dinh Diem, 
remains �a complete mystery. It is true that at 
dawn on November 2, 1963, two battalions of the 
5th Infantry Division under Thieu's command did 
launch an assault on the " Independence Palace, " 
but by that time DitIll and his brother Nhu had 
escaped to Cho Lon. At 7 in the morning, when 
Big 11linh made a triumphant entry into the palaco 
grounds, on the spur of the moment he hugged 
Thien and pinned two stars on the collar of his 
uniform. Thieu thus became the only Saigon colonel 
ever promoted major-general without pasin, through 
the rank of brigadier. !however, officers ( the 5th 
II.) gave another version of what had happened. 
When 'I hien ordered his troops to move to Saigon 
front Bien lloa on the afternoon of Noventher. 
according to these officers, he had told them : 
" Duong Van Minh has staged a rebellion. We nmst 
come to Saigon to save the President (i.e. Diem). 
Recen'tly, on the occasion of the Sth anniversary 
of the death of Diem and Nhir (November 1, 1971), 
Thiel.' himself gave this account : " On the morning 
of November 2, when I opened the door of .that 
M.1 r3 armoured . personnel carrier and saw the 
bodies of His Excellencies Diem and NItu lying in 
a pool of blood, I stood at attention, took off my. 
cap, and clad tears of sorrow. " Could it be that 
for once he was telling the truth ? Ir hr had 
switched his loyalty from Diem to the putschists 
only vhen the former's fate appeared to be sealed. 
In December 104, barely a year later, he received 
his third star from the hands of Nguyen Iihanh as 
a reward for his betrayal of Duong Van Miuili. lint 
just at the time when he was fawning upon Nguyen 
Khanh, lie was already plott big with General Lain 
Van Phat and his friends Doc, Ton and Thao to 
overthrow his boss. \\ lien the scheme was discover-
ed, Thieu quickly ctsengaged himself. In answer 
to Mat's' revelation about his participation in the 
conspiracy, Tibet' flatly said that it was only a 
ruse which had allowed him to penetrate the chat: 
designs of the " rebels." lie even became a member 
of the court-matial whim !omit his former " comra-
des" to face the firing squad.

Thien's financial deals go hand in band with his 
political machinations. He is the leader of a new 
'Class of men in military uniform who hold sway 
over the country's economic and finoncial resources. 
The size of bank accounts is of course a %yell-
guarded " State seciet, " But indiscretions from his 
entourage give us some rough idea of his Nvealth. 
When he was the colonel commanding the 5th 
lirfantr' Division stationed north of Saigon in the 
years I962-63, Thieu once boasted to. his chief-of-
staff that he had a nest-egg of some zo,000 US 
dollars tucked away in a 'Hongkong bank, the equi-
valtnt of eight million Saigon piastres. By the time 
he became chairman of the "National Leadership 
Committee, " that, hank account had swollen to at 
least fifty times that amount, and his wife, in one 
of her trips abroad, went to Rome, ostensibly to 
visit the Vatican, in fact for financial operations, 
.which involved important deposits in Italian banks 
and the purchase of a large villa in the western 
suburbs of that capital city. In 1066, some, repre� 
sentatives back from a foreign tour supplied hints 
of the princely life led by Nguyen Von Ilion, Saigon 
ambassador to A.ustialia and linen's elder brother-. 
In French and Japanese colonial Limes, 1-lieu was a 
notoriously cruel and corrupt mandarin in Yen 
Dinh, Thieu Floa and Ninh Tinian. Now besides his 
" diplomatic " functions, he ma�kes trips by PanAm 
jets to Paris, Rome, Geneva, etc. to look after the 
oVersea.s financial interests of the Thieu clan, 
dropping casual remarks about " my brother the 
President " at diplomatic cocktail parties. 
Nguyen Van Kieu, Thieu's younger brother, was 
at one time bead of the " Relief Funds to Flood. 
Victims in Trung, Bo " and is now widely travelling 
abroad to prepare for the comfortable " withdrawal " 
of the whole Thieu tribe to Taiwan or Switzerland. 
A relative newcomer to the "Independence Palace" 
(Dila; Doc Lap in Vietnamese, and often read by 
Saigon wags as Dinh Co Lap; or Isolation Palace) is 
� Trang Si Tan, the lieutenant-colonel commanding 
the city police and the right-hand man of the pimp 
mayor Do Kien Nhieu (see supra). He is Thien's 
son-in-law and has been dubbed " Prince Consort of 
the Nguyen Court. " He is a �swarthy, burly fellow, 
with slant eyes and a breath reeking of alcohol. His 
special skill resides in torturing, which he does 
with cold-blooded ingenuity. Besides such routine 
business as the ,electricity or water torture, he 
relishes such sadistic practices as sticking US-made 
needles into the nipples. of girl students suspected

relatives and friends there. 'have been appearing regularly on over 40 daily 
publications. Thien's advisers are also preoccupied 
with the attitude of the intellectuals -- lawyers,' 
doctors, professors... In their retreats in Hoc Mon, 
Thu ')uc, or Go Vap, they have suddenly ceased to 
devote their time to raising song-birds and wild 
orchids, as they have -been doing in recent months 
to show their coldness to the regime. Now they 
start engaging in heated political debates, in which 
such explosive remarks as the following have been 
heard " impossible to live with the present 
regime I " " This regime is a challenge to human 
dignity I " � " To sit with folded arms is to con-
done crime ! " etc. A priest, Truong Ba. Can, writes 
in the Dien Tin �: " Mr Thieu is the only obstacle on 
the road to peace. " A bonze, the Venerable Clap � 
Duc : " Thiel' is the. war president. " Others, like 
the Catholic priests Chan Tin, Nguyen Dinh .Tin 
and Nguyen Viet Khai, denounce the Saigon regime 
as " rootless, "anti-national, " while praising the 
achievements of the North. Small wonder that on 
orders from Thieu, a veritable war has been started 
against the press. Small wonder too that, following 
each of the above-mentioned meetings of his tight-
hand men, more people are flung into jail or sent 
to the penal island of Con Son (Poulo Condor). The 
Khaki Party is fast becoming the 'Cudgel Party, 
whose very survival depends solely on apression 
� naked, unscrupulous, brazen 'faced repression. 
In this veritable war, Thieu has attained new 
records: in May alone, he ordered the confiscation 
of no less than 165 newspaper issues, the highest 
peak in his crackdown on the press so far. Indeed 
he had no choice, for the press has been publishing 
highly " subversive " stuff. For instance, this item 
in �Dcoi Chic Moi (New Democracy) which follows a 
scathingly ironical essay on " The GI Problem " 
" The children in the North dig their own air-raid 
shelters, wear plaited-straw protective helmets, feed 
on cassava, and successfully stand up to American 
aircraft. They truly spring from a heroic people I " 
In .the " war against students," the Thieu 
administration has ordered the arrest of such 
student leaders as Bnu Chi, secretary general of the 
Association of Creative Students, in Hue, and Nguyen 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
Duy Hien, head of the students' Social �Vork Team 
in the same city, together with over 300 ,other 
students. Still another lvar, that " against the Third 
Force " has been waged against those tylp, stand 
for peace, neutrality, and national concord, -whose 
numbers have been increasing among intellectuiliS 
and at er strata, including deputies and�religious 
leaders. But the.  most fiercely waged of them all 
has been theewar against the over three trillion 
Saigonese with a view to press-ganging ever more 
people and grabbing ever more alt Ii for the war 
against the patriotic forces, which threatens to 
bring about the collapse of the whole regime. More 
than 200,000 civilians have been pressed into the 
army and inflation has passed the 'zoo hit I ion 
piastres mark. These staggering figures are the 
topics of heated discussions among the Sai,..:one-ie 
for the policies worked out in the " Dragon's !lead 
Palace " are depleting their already very lean 
pocketbooks, and threatening not only their liveli-
hood but their very lives and those of their dear 
ones. This is the thing that is likely to toll the 
knell of the Nguyen Van Thiel] dynasty. 
While alarming reports have been streaming into 
the " Independence Palace '' from every quarter, 
rumour has it that the relationship between the 
American proconsul and " Pres!dent " Thieu has 
become heavily tinged with bitterness. Thien and 
his aides, Quang and Nha, have been perusing the 
newly-disclosed secret papers of the l'entagon, 
particularly the chapters on the decisions taken by 
President Kennedy in the wurse of those five 
fateful meetings of the National Security Council 
held in the period front August to November 1963, 
which resulted in a plan to overthrow Diem and 
Nhu, an operation which was to be headed by a CIA 
chieftain and to involve many generals of the Diem 
army itself. 
In the light of those documents, the praise 
recently bestowed upon Thieu by President Nixon : 
" You are a talented leader, equal to your respon-
sibility, etc." took on a sinister meaning when one 
recalls a similar c9mmendation given bi Diem by 
President Kennedy. 
Over the past few years, Thieu has never failed 
to order fairly sumptuous commemorative ceremonies 
on the occasion of the anniversary of Diem's death. 
Requiem masses are as a rule held at the Church 
of the Virgin Mary. On October 1, 1971., when a 
400-strong procession marched out from the Church 
along Hai Trung boulevard to the cemetery on 
Mac Dinh Chi street for a wreath-laying ceremony 
at Diem's grave, Thieu's wife distinguished herself 
by the particular loudness xvith which she vented 
her grief. The Saigonese were not surprised, for 
they knew that the tears were in fact being shed 
over the impending doom of the Thieu regime itself. 
The Saigon press has made this observation about 
three outstanding sites in the city : the " Inde-
pendence Palace," the American Embassy, and the 
Mac Dinh Chi cemetery. These three symbolic 
places are all situated in the same district and are 
separated by equal distances (about one kilometre), 
which causes them to stand at the apexes of an 
equilateral triangle. Incidentally, the Mac Dinh 
Chi cemetery used to be called the " Cemetery of 
the French Ghost."

13.�TWILIGHT OF A ,REGIME 
SAIGON,
May 1972:. � 
Long convoys of military trucks are bring-
ing wounded soldiers hack from An Loc through 
Lai Kile. They are heading for the Republican 
Hospital. 
Highway 4, which leads to the provinces, is block-
ed for long hours at a time. 
On the morning of the loth, the whole city is 
astir. Martial law has been clamped down on the 
whole of the territory of South Viet Nam, a mea-
sure without precedent over the past 25 years. 
Even in Diem's time, only a state of emergency 
was sometimes decreed. At nightfall, the streets 
are all deserted. 
� The. draft, which hits men from the age of 17 to 
43, set the town agog. The press remarks : " It 
takes everyone, from striplings to hoary heads." 
US Vice-President Spiro Agnew sent to Viet Nam 
on an 'inspection tour, thought he could not stay in 
Saigon overnight for security reasons. On hand at 
the airport to greet a worried and irritable Agnew 
.was Thieu, who had suddenly grown old. In late 
1070, he had had to dye a mass of his hair at the back 
of his head a dignified grey so as to make him 
look more like the venerable "father of the Repub-
lic " .he had been trying to set himself up as. But 
since then, no dye had- any longer been necessary 
to turn part of his head white. � 
One FriclaV morning, the Proconsul Bunker flew 
by helicopter from his fortress-embassy to the Tan 
Son Nhut airfield to welcome General Alexander. 
Haig, the security assistant of President Nixon, 
who had come on a fact-finding mission. Bunker's 
back was hunched up and his cheeks were sagging. 
-He didn't even bother to wave a greeting to the 
American officials present. Ile is too old, people 
'say, nearly So, and too much depressed by the 
impending doom of Ids President's policy of ' Viet-
namiza.tion. " it is rumoured that he is about to 
retire. His greatest grief has been his failure to 
build a viable political party in Saigon, one which 
has a broad popular base and might serve as a 
" Labour and Personalism " party without its bell-
wether Diem. The Khaki Party, his pampered 
child. has been a big flop. 
Talking to a friend in a small villa in Thu Due, 
a college professor said : " The Old Fridge can't 
sleep because of the deterioration in the military 
situation, and he has been crying over the political 
decomposition that has taken place." The profes-
sor was of course right. The Americans want the 
Saigon generals to, fight the patriots, but all they 
:care for is their coffers. 01 the four Corps Area 
.corrimanders, one, Tri, has been burnt to ashes in 
his downed helicopter ; two, Lam and Dzu, have 
been dismissed and are awaiting trial. The fourth 
arid only one remaining, Truong, has been hastily 
sent from the Mekong Delta .to the northernmost 
provinces of Tri-Thien. But Truong is only an in-
competent swashbuckler. An American officer at 
MACV says : " Truong is a hot-headed bully, whose 
only way to get himself obeyed by his men is to ' 
bawl insults at them, and threaten them with pris-
on and firing squad." 
Things are even worse on the political front. 
Ever since his " triumph " in the one-man presi-
dential race, Mien has turned practically every 
man against him. Most of the 1' Senators" oppose 
him and his valets. The press clamours : " The 
regime is dying. It has reached the lowest depth 
of infamy. We are witnessing the twilight of the 
Thiel] regime." And a doctor who has kept abreast 
of the situation asserts: " For Thieu the situation

During a Senate session at the Dien Ilong 
Stmetor shouted.: " The Americans have brought 
Thieu to power. It is DOW Up to them to remove 
him frem office. When the roar Of American 13.52s 
and the millions of tons of American bombs stops, 
then the Vietnamese will be able to hear the. 
voices of each other." 
But in his Isolation Palace; Thicu is not resign-
ed to his fate. More and more pewls.�,ttalo.,ttwyaz 
arrested by his police. In the old imperial city of 
Hue, nearly 300 students were rounded up in one 
single night and taken Heaven knows where. In 
Saigon, a stifling atmosphere prevails in all eleven 
districts. Police Chief Tra.ng Si Tan is flinging 
himself about. At police headquarters, all detention 
rooms are filled to capacity and in the torture 
chambers near the Zoo, the lights are 'on all night. 
The Saigon government needs zoo billion piastres 
to rebuild its badly-battered army. Little is left of 
American aid, and so slogans are put out for " self-
reliance " and " Vietnarnization. A hundred new 
taxes are decreed. Business slumps. It becomes ever 
harder to earn one's bowl of rice. 
The nights are still. The streets are empty. A 
storm is brewing. In the workers' quarters at Khanh 
Hoi and Lo Sieu, the children are singing : 
� 
To stand on our 07011 feet 
And have enough to eat 
Let's topple Thieu 
And knock down his whole gang. 
Saigon under Thieu in 1972 is just like Saigon 
under Diem in 1963, sa.y many- people. The same 
chaos and tension, the same stifling, unbearable 
atmosphere. 
There is one difference, though : anti-Americanism, 
i.e. the disgust at, scorn for, hatred of and opposi-
tion to the Americans, has become even more open 
and widespread. 
Over the last five or six years of contact with 
" GI civilization, " the Saigonese have come to 
realize more fully than ever that nothing can be 
more precious than the spiritual values of one's 
own nation. Material wealth unaccompanied by a 
spirit of independence and self-respect only leads to 
moral ruin. Many school and college students, who 
formerly liked, believed in, and admired the Amer-
icans, now turn against them and enthusiastically 
join movements with such slogans as : " Let's go 
back to our nation's roots " and " Let's speak to 
our compatriots' and listen to them." They want to 
cause the stream of the people's strength to gush 
forth even more strongly and to immerse themselves 
in it. 
Hero is what a patriotic woman teacher said in 
the course of a recent meeting : "How fortunate 
that after such a long occupation by US troops our 
fellow-countrymen still stick to their national baba 
silk garments, relish their milk-apples and 
mangoes, love their fragrant rice and sweet folk 
melodies... How fortunate that neither American 
miniskirts, Californian rice, nor GI music have 
succeeded in catching their fancy."

dollars are coming only- in driblets and many GIs 
have left. The backbone of that clique is now made 
up of the 13 plippet regular divisions. But seven 
or eight vertebrae of that backbone have already 
been smashed. The pillars of the Khaki Party turn 
'their anxious look to the Independence Palace, 
Thieu's residence. They know that if Thieu goes, 
nothing can save the. Khaki Party, which has neither 
popular roots nor following, from immediate 
collapse. 
ln the sweltering days of this summer, neither 
Thieu nor his henchmen seem to have much confi-
dence left in each other and in their American and 
Vietnamese friends. In early May, Thieu's wife 
again set out on trips to Italy and Switzerland and 
the generals began accelerating the flow of their 
money transfers to Hongkong and France. At the 
booking office of Air Viet Nam at No. rib, Nguyen 
llue strict,- wives and children of VIPs are i peuing 
up, lugging heavy suitcases. The Boeings and Cara-
velles flying to Hongkong, Paris and Rome are lull 
to capacity. In the Lower House of Parliament, 
deputy Do Sinh Tu shouted ' While appealing to 
all of us to fight to the bitter end, why should 
Mr Thiel' be sending his wife and his money abroad? 
Let him stop doing it ! " 
It is very difficult indeed for Then and other 
members of the Khaki Party to comply. Every 
morning, at 4:30 sharp, the people in the whole of 
District One of Saigon city can hear the engine of 
a chopper revving up : it is the special 1111.i helicop-
ter on standby duty on the grounds of the presi-
dential palace. It is piloted by a captain who is a 
nephew of Mrs Thieu's. And here is the message 
that the noise of its engine is carrying to all Sai-
gonese : " I, President Thee, am still here. So 
beware. And let me tell you this : If it comes to 
pinch, I won't rush headlong into a tunnel, like 
that fool Diem, and die like a rat. I will just hop 
off in that American helicopter ! " 
There is enough room in the helicopter for Thien, 
his wife, his financial manager Dang Van Quan,,, 
his police chief and son-in-law Trang Si Tan, and 
his close adviser 1-bang Due Nha, who has sworn 
to swhn or sink with him. On the navigation charts 
these routes have been carefully plotted : Saigon-
Bangkok (from which PanAm flights could be taken 
to Paris, Geneva, etc.) and Saigon-Yankee Station 
(where American aircraft carriers are standing by).

Marchetti Book on CIA Still Under Suit 
Harper & Row has decided, after 
much consideration, to honor a request 
from the Central Intelligence Agency to 
see page proofs of Alfred 'W. McCoy's 
controversial September 13 book, "The 
Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia," 
and to consider "factual" corrections 
that the CIA may offer. The publisher, 
however, has made no advance com-
mitment to accept any requested 
changes. 
In his book, written with Cathleen B. 
Read, Mr. McCoy, a 26-year-old student 
in .Yale's Ph.D. program in history, al-
leges that French, Vietnamese and U.S. 
personnel have used the traffic in opium 
� and _heroin in Southeast Asia for their 
own ends, and that the CIA and other 
U.S. agencies have either accepted or 
have responded inadequately to the sit-
uation.. Mr. McCoy told Congressional 
committees early in June (including the 
foreign olierations subcommittee, headed 
by Sen. William Proxmire, D., Wis., of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee), 
that he had had more than 250 intervic)As 
�� , about the drug traffic, including talks 
with CIA and South Vietnamese offi-
cials, and that President Thieu and 
Premier Khiem were involved: he gave 
details of many allegations which appear 
also in the book. 13. Brooks Thomas, 
Harper vice-president and general coun-
sel, tells PW he and the editors have 
worked closely with Mr. McCoy on the 
manuscript, have insisted on documen-
tation of all material points, and have 
had outside experts read it. As a result, 
Harper & Row is convinced that the 
book is well-documented, scholarly and 
deserves to be published. 
A chapter from the book, adapted, 
appears in the July Harper's magazine. 
The magazine has. received a letter from 
the CIA's .executive director, W. E. 
V Colby, denying allegations involving the 
CIA. Ikrper's reportedly plans to pub-
lish the letter soon. Mr. Colby and an of-
ficer of Air. America (a contract airline 
which does Work for CIA in Southeast 
Asia) also wrote to the Washington Star, 
disputing allegations picked up by a Star 
columnist from Mr. McCoy's findings. 
In these protests, and in its approach to 
�� 
Harper & Row, the CIA is said to be 
departing sharply from its usual policy of 
silence concerning criticism. 
Harper & Row was approached early 
in June, when a representative called 
upon Cass Canfield, Sr., former chief 
executive, now a senior editor for the 
firm, and said the agency understood the 
McCoy manuscript contained serious al-
legations about CIA and other agen-
cies�allegations that 1te said might be 
libelous to individuals or severely dam-
aging to the national interest. The repre-
sentative spoke also to Ni. S. Wyeth, Jr., 
executive editor of the trade department. 
The Harper officials said the manuscript 
was not yet ready to be read, but that the 
request would be considered. 
in weighing their decision, I larper & 
Row officials and editors talked among 
themselves and with respected publishing 
colleagues, including experts in the field 
of the freedom to read. On June 30, Mr. 
Thomas wrote to the CIA asking the 
agency to state its request, with reasons 
for it, in writing. The reply, dated July 5, / 
came from Lawrence R. Houston,'gen-t/ 
eral counsel of the CIA. Ile wrote that 
the CIA was ip no way questioning 
Harper & Row's right. to '.publish the 
"book, but said, "We believe we could 
demonstrate to you that a considerable 
number of Mr. McCoy's claims" about 
the CIA were "totally false" or "dis-
torted" or �"based on 'unconvincing evi-
dence." � 
Harper & Row then decided to let the   
CIA see the book�subject to the au-
thor's approval, without which, Harper 
& Row president Winthrop Knowlton 
told PH', the CIA's request would not be 
accepted. The author finally accepted the 
decision, to let the CIA look at page 
proofs only, and to give a quick repiy, 
with Harper -& Row reserving all its op-
tions and reaffirming its right to publish. � 
"As head of the house of Harper & 
Row," Mr. Knowlton told PW, "I am 
sensitive,. like' all my colleagues in pub-
lishing, to the problem of censorship, 
and if I felt this request involved censor-
ship we would not be agreeing to it. In 
view of the gravity of the allegations, we 
simply think this is the most responsible 
way we can publish this book. 
Ironically, in view of CIA efforts to 
refute the charges by Mr. McCoy and 
others; personnel of CIA, State and the 
Department of Defense completed in 
February a report to the Cabinet Com-
mittee on Narcotics Control which but-
tressed many-of the charges, according to 
Seymour Hersh in a � front page New 
York Times story, July 24. Mr. Hersh 
reviewed the I larper-CIA discussions in 
the Times of J uly 22. 
The CIA's procedure with respect to 
Mr. McCoy's book is in sharp contrast to 
government action on an as-yet-
unwritten book, a nOnfiction work about 
the CIA, which Victor L. Marchetti is 
tinder contract to prepare for Knopf. iii 
that case, the Justice Department ob-
tained in April 'a restraining order to 
Prevent Mr. Marchetti from .publishing 
the proposed book, on the ground that it 
would be likely to divulge currently clas-
sified information in violation of a sc-
crecy agreement that N4 r. Nlarchetti had t/ 
made as a CIA employee. Mr. NI archetti 
worked for the CIA for 14 years and 
resigned in 1969. 1 le then wrote a novel, 
"The Rope Dancer.' (Grosset), based on 
his observations. 
Judge Albert V. Bryan, Jr., U.S. Dis-
trict Court, Alexandria, Va., in issuing 
the restraining order, ruled that Mr. 
Marchetti's agreement with the CIA 
"takes the case out of the scope of the 
First Amendment." The American Civil 
Liberties- Union, representing Mr. 
Marchetti, denies this and argues that the 
author cannot in fact sign away his First. 
Amendment rights. The Association of 
American Publishers and the Authors 
League have filed an:jells- curiae briefs 
supporting Mr. Marchetti in further. 
Court proceedings. �(See PHI, April 24,

in this seemingly endless 
war--1 million, 2 million, 
3 million? 
More important yet, how 
many Americans truly care? 
� 'That question was asked 
of Intelligence Report 
.recently by a North Viet-
� namose representative in 
Moscow. 
The North Vietnamese, at 
least many of them, if this 
' official is to be believed, 
are convinced that if 
President Nixon cannot end 
the war by negotiation, he 
will end it by extermi-
nation. ' 
With seven U.S. aircraft 
carriers discharging 
fighter-bombers daily, with 
more than 200 B-52's drop-
ping-tons of bombs, with 
the new "smart" laser bombs 
in action and the even 
smarter "Maverick" TV bombs 
forthcoming, U.S. air and 
naval forces can extermi-
nate most of the North 
Vietnamese population 
within 60 days. 
It is a long-held Kissin-
ger belief that extermi-
nation will not be neces-
sary, that the North 
Vietnamese can stand only 
so much destruction and 
devastation before they 
accede to ending the war by 
negotiation. 
The North Vietnamese told 
US that they prefer ex-
termination to negotiatibn 
under duress. 
Many of them are con-
vinced that they will soon 
die by drowning. They point 
out that U.S. planes have 
been systematically bombing . 
the areas around the Red 
River dikes which protect 
the Plain of Tonkin from 
flooding. By weakening the 
dike foundations, they 
contend, the Americans are 
making certain that the 
monsoon rains will collar's-

lives have

_ 
the dikes, causing the 
death by drowning of a 
large portion of the 14 
million North Vietnamese 
who livo on the Plain of 
Tonkin. 
President Nixon was asked 
on April 30th, this year, 
at the John Connally bar-
beque in Floresville, Tex., 
if he intended to order the 
bombing of the Red River 
dikes. 
"That is something," he 
answered, "that we want to 
avoid. It is also something 
..we believe is not needed." 
He also Said that "with 
regard to dams or dikes... 
while it is a strategic 
target and indirectly a 
military target, it would 
result in an enormous number 
of civilian casualties." 
Nixon, however, did not 
foreclose on his option to 
bomb the dikes, which the 
North Vietnamese claim our 
Air Forca.is already doing 
That the American public 
will support a continued 
air war so long as it 
results in relatively few 
American deaths is a Nixon 
tenet which has been proved 
correct. 
Nixon and Kissinger, as 
well as countless military 
men, are convinced that 
under continued bombing, 
the Communists must eventu-
ally cry "uncle." 
The North Vietnamese 
maintain that their ulti-
mate pain threshold isdeath. 
The Soviets, on the other 
hand, believe that the war 
could end tomorrow if only 
we would order the C.I.A. 
to assassinate Nguyen Van 
Thieu, President of South 
Vietnam. :

"You people arranged to 
have Diem assassinated in 
1963," one Soviet journal-
ist explained. "Why can' 
the C.I.A. do the same 
thing with Thieu? Or at 
least arrange his abdica-
tion to Singapore where we 
understand he has already 
bought a home? Once Thieu 
is out of the picture, 
really out of the picture, 
a coalition government can 
be formed in South Vietnam, 
a cease-fire can take 
place, the war is over, and 
you can get your prisoners 
back. It is all really 
quite simple." 
The Soviets, of course, 
are cynical.

Herobi, and tke Tar  
� Alfred McCoy, a Yale graduate student who inter-
lyiewed 250 people, charges that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency has known of Thai and South Viet-
namese official involvement in heroin traffic, has 
� covered up their involvement and has participated 
-In aspects of the traffic itself. The CIA has publicly 
� denied these charges, in the process even per-
suading Mr. McCoy's publisher, Harper gr. Row, to 
,.Jet it review his book manuscript before publication. 
.But now � there comes an internal government re-
:port�done by the CIA and other . agencies�on 
the difficulties of controlling the narcotics trade 
in Southeast Asia. The report states: 
"the most basic problem, and the one that 
unfortunately appears least likely of any early 
solution, s the corruption, collusion, and indif-
ference at sOme places in some governments, 
particularly Thailand and South Vietnam, that 
preclUdes more effective suppression of traffic 
by the governments on whose territory it takes 
place." 
-That is to say, a private report by agencies in-
eluding the CIA confirms the thrust of charges. 
:which the CIA publicly denies. The White House 
� contends the report, completed in February, is "out 
of date." 
Now, we are aware that the Nixon administration

ness to curb the international narcotics trade. Thel 
fact remains that the largest supplies of .the filthiest 
poison of them all apparently come from or through 
Thailand and South Vietnam, if one is to take the 
CIA's private word�as against its public word�
on the matter. Nor should it stretch any reasonable 
man's credulity to understand that the United 
States has had to accept certain limitations on its 
efforts to get those governments to stop drug deal-
ing because it has wanted to ensure their coopera-
tion in the mar against North Vietnam. In the final 
human analysis there is simply no place in the pur-
suit of honor and a just peace in Southeast Asia for 
an all-out lionest effort to control traffic in heroin. 
This is the infinitely tragic fact flowing from con-
tinued American involvement in the war. 
Would heroin addiction among Americans have 
swollen to its current dimensions and would the 
amount of heroin reaching the United States from 
South Vietnam and Thailand have reached its cur-
rent levels if the war�and power politics�had not 
gotten in the way of effective American pressure 
upon the governments in Saigon .and Bangkok? If 
President Nixon needs any further reason to make 
good his pledge to . end the war, this is almost 
reason enough by itself for what it says about the 
character of regimes this ,country has gotten into 
the habit of supporting�lavishly and indiscrim-
inately�in the name of our "national .security" 
and "world peace."

I think the Senate is quite aware of the 
growing seriousness of the inter-

information, which would then be avail-

two general categories; The first, it would

processing of narcotics drugs in' each 
country where these operations are 
known to, or believed by, the Bureau of 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to occur; 
the routes of transport of such drugs to 
the United States; the financial and 
banking arrangements which support 
such illegal international nareotie.s 
traffic; changes in the international pat-
terns of cultivation, processing, and 
shipping of such drugs for the United 
,States markets which, in the opinion 
of the Bureau of Narcotics and Danger-
ous Drugs, have occurred since 1060, and 
other information in this general area, 
The second part of the report would 
include a list of the countries which, in 
the opinion of the Bureau of. Narcotics 
and Dangerous Drug's, are Currently 
major centers in illegal international 
narcotic traffic; a summary of the pro-
grams and other actions undertaken by 
such countries for the suppression of such 
traffic; and an evaluation by the Bureau 
of Narcotics and Dangerous�Drugs of the 
effectiveness of such programs and 
actions, including; reasons for their effec-
tiveness or ineffectiveness. 
Last year we adopted an amendment 
which I offered, which, among other 
things, authorized this Government to 
terminate foreign aid to any country 
which 'vas known to be willfully in-
volved in the production of sale of illegal 
drugs and which ultimately ended up in 
the United States. 
It is estimated that the amount of 
illegal heroin entering this country will 
be nearly 40 percent greater than that 
brought into this .country .a year ago. 
A front-page story in the New York 
Times describes a secret Cabinet level 
renort that concludes "There is no pros-
pect" of eliminating the smuggling of 
narcotics in Southeast Asia "under any 
conditions that can. realistically be 
projected." 
. I ask unanimous consent that the 
article appearing in the New York Times 
appear at the conclusion of my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. MONDALE. This amendment will 
help the public and the Congress better 
understand the essential elements of this 
vicious problem so that we know better 
what to do. 
I am hopeful that the distinguished 
floor manager will accept this amend-
ment.

MI:PORT TO UNITED. STATES SEES No Hoc's OF 
- HALTING ASIAN DRUG TRAFFIC . 
(By Seymour M. Hersh) 
WASIIINCTON, July 23,�A Cabinet-level re-
port has concluded that., contrary to the 
Nixon Administration's public optimism, 
:'there is no prospect" of stemming the 
smuggling of narcotics by air and sea hi 
Southeast Asia "under any conditions that 
can realistically be projected." 
"This is so," the report, dated Feb. 21, 
1972, said, 'because the governments In the 
region are unable and, In some cases, un-
do those things that would have 
done by them if a truly effective effort 
twoill be it 
were to be made." 
The report, prepared by officials of the 
- Central Intelligence Agency, the State De-
partment and the Defense Department, 
noted that "the most basic problem, and 
the one that unfortunately appears least 
likely of any early solution, is the corrup-
tion, collusion and indifference at some 
places in sonic governments, particularly 
Thailand and South Vietnam, that precludes 
more effective suppression of traffic by the 
governments on whose territory it takes 
place." � 
The report sharply contradicted the official 
Administration position and qovernment in-
telligence sources say its conclusions are 
still valid today. In May, Secretary of State 
William P. Rogers told a Senate subcom-
mittee that "we think all the countries are 
cooperating with us and we are quite satis-
fied with that cooperation." 
Similarly, Nelson G. Gross, Senior Advisor 
to the Secretary of State and Coordinatoie for 
International Narcotics Matters, testified be-
fore Congress in june on the subject of nae-
coties smuggling that "the gOvernments of 
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam have airesciy 
joined us in the fight and, while we have 
a long way to [o, we feel that during the 
past year some real progress lies been 
achieved." � 
All officials concerned with the drug 'prob-
lem acknowledge that the United States 
55elle13, under personal prodding from Pres-
ident Nixon, have begun an intensive effort 
to stem the international narcotics traff,e. 
But critics contend that the effort is far less 
effective today than Administration officials 
say it is. 
C'RITICS. CHARGES BACIZ-ED 
Two leading critics 'of what they allege to

the pivotal importance of Thailand to the 
International drug smugglers. Thailand is 
also a major Air Force staging area for the

III a report on the world heroin problem 
last year, Mr. Steele wrote that "from the 
American viewpoint, Thailand is as impor.

all of the opium produced in Southeast A5iia, 
Is not grown in Thailand, most of it is smug--

Mr. Steele's report, filed with the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, noted that 
many American citizens had established res-

notorious smugglers deported had led some 
intelligence officials to conclude that the,

Tut critics contend' that th-e ef-
fort is far less effective today 
than Administration officials 
.say it is. 
Critics' Charges Backed 
Two leading critics of what 
they allege to be the Govern-
ment's laxness in stopping the 
flow of narcotics are Represent-
ative Robert IL Steele, Repub-
lican of Connecticut, and Alfred 
W. McCoy, a 26-year-old Yalg 
graduate student who has writ-
ten a book on narcotics in 
Southeast Asia. The New York 
Times reported Saturday that 
Mr. McCoy's allegations con-
cerning the C.I.A.. and the drug 
traffic had been the subject of 
an intense and unusually pub-
lic rebuttal by the agency. 
The Cabinet-level report, 
made available to The Times, 
buttressed many of the charges 
made, by the two critics, par-
ticularly about the pivotal im-
portance of Thailand to the in-
ternational drug smugglers. 
Thailand is also a major Air 
'Force staging area for the Unit-
ed States. 
In a report on the world 
heroin problem last year, Mr. 
Steele wrote that "from the 
American viewpoint, Thailand 
is , as important to the control 
of the illegal international 
traffic in narcotics as Turkey. 
While all of the opium pro-
duced in Southeast Asia is not 
grown in Thailand, most of it 
is smuggled through that coun-
try." 
Mr. Steele's report, filed with 
the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs, noted that many 
American 'citizens had estab-
lished residence in Bangkok, 
and had moved into the nar-
cotics trade. The report added 
that the inability of the United 
States to have a few notorious 
smugglers deported had led 
some intelligence officials to 
conclude that the men were pay-
ing Thai officials for protec-
tion. 
Mr. McCoy said in testimony 
before Congressional commit-
tees last month that hundreds 
of tons of Burmese opium 
passed through Thailand every 
year to international markets 
in Europe and the United States 
and that SO to 90 per cent of 
the opium was carried by Chi-
nese Nationalist paramilitary 
teams that were at one time 
paid by the C.I.A. 
There are a number of opium 
refineries along the northern 
Thai border, he said, and much 
of the processed high-quality 
heroin is shipped by trawler to 
Hong Kong. 
"Even though they are heav-
ily involved in the narcotics 
traffic," Mr. McCoy testified, 
"these Nationalist Chinese ir-
regulars units are closely -allied 
with the Thai Government." He 
said that Thai Government po-
lice units patrol the northern traffm of heroin. Their measure

pound of raw Opium entering: 
Thailand. All this activity, he 
said, is monitored by United 
States intelligence agencies. 
Thai-U.S. Agreements Cited 
Mr. Gross, the State Depart-
ment's adViser on international 
narcotics, said in his Congres-
sional testimony that "during 
the past year the Thais have 
increased their efforts in the 
drug field with United States 
and United Nations assistance." 
He cited two agreements, 
signed in late 1971, calling for 
more cooperation and more 
long-range planning between 
Thai and United States officials 
.to stamp out the trade. 
"Based on all intelligence in-
formation available," Mr. Gross 
testified, "the leaders of the 
Thai Government are not en-
gaged in the opium or heroin 
traffic, nor are they extending 
protection to traffickers." He 
added that the top police of-1 
ficial in Thailand had publicly 
stated that he would punish 
any corrupt official. 
The cabinet-level report, sub-
mitted to the Cabinet Commit-
tee on International Narcotics 
Control, asked "highest prior-
ity" for suppression of the traf-
fic by Thai trawlers, noting 
that each trawler "would rep-
resent something like 6 per 
cent of annual United States 
consumption of heroin." 
The report said that the 
trawler�traffic should have pri-
ority because "it is possible to 
attack the Thai trawler traffic. 
without seeking the coopera-
tion of Thai authorities and 
running the attendant risks of 
leaks, tip-offs and betrayals." 
After such a seizure, the re-
port said, the United States 
Embassy in Bangkok could "re-
peat with still greater force 
and insistence the representa-
tions it has already often made 
to the Government of Thai-
land" for more effective efforts 
"to interdict traffic from the 
north of Thailand to Bangkok 
and also the loading of nar-
cotics on ships in Thai har-
bors." L 
At another point in the re-
port, a general complaint was Nailed Press International 
voiced. "It should surely be Robert II. Steele charged 
possible to convey to the right the Government is lax in

"No real progress can be made

Representatives Steele, Les-
ter L. Wolff, Democrat of Nas-
sau County, and Morgan F. 
Murphy, Democrat of Illinois, 
have sponsored legislation that 
would cut off more than $100-
million in foreign aid to Thai-

During a Congressional hear-
ing into drug traffic last month, 
Representative Wolff disputed 
the Administration's contention 
that it was making "real prog-

flow and said, "we think the 
trade has got so much protec-
tion in high places in Thailand 
that the Administration is 
afraid they'll tell us to take our 
air basses out if .we put too 
much pressure on them."

� CIA. AIDES ASSAIL 
'ASIA D41  CHARGE 
Agency, Fights Reports That 
!gnored Heroin Traffic 
- Among Allies of U.S.. 
� By SEY1ViOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, July 21 � 
The Central Intelligence Agency 
has begun a public battle 
;against accusations that it 
knew - of but failed to stern 
the � heroin traffic of United 
.Stdtes allies in Southeast Asia. 
� In recent weeks, high-ranking 
;officials of the C.I.A. have 
Signed letters for publication 
to a newspaper and magazine, 
granted a rare � on-the-record 
interview at the agency's head-
quarters in McLean, Va., and 
-.� most significantly �. per-
suaded the publishers of a 
forthcoming expose on the 
C.I.A. . and the drug traffic 
to permit it to review the 
manuscript prior to publica-
tion. � 
The target of all these meas-
ures has been the recent writ-
ings and Congressional testi-
mony of Alfred W. McCoy, a 
26-year-old Yale graduate stu-
dent who spent 18 months in-
vestigating the narcotics opera-
tions in Southeast Asia. His 
dbook, "The -Politics of Heroin 
in Southeast Asia," is sched-
uled to be published by Harper 
& Row in mid-September�bar-
ring delays caused by the in-
telligence agency's review. 
In his �book, Mr. McCoy al-
leged that both C.I.A. and 
State Department officials have 
provided political and military 
support for America's Indo-
chinese allies actively engaged 
in the drug traffic, have con-
sciously covered up evidence 
of such involvement, and have 
been actively involved them-
selves in narcotic trade. 
C.I.A. officials said they had 
reason to believe that Mr. Mc-
Coy's book contained many un-
warranted, unproven and falla-
cious accusations. They ac-
knowledged that the public 
stance in opposition to such 
allegations was a departure 
from the usual "low profile" 
of the agency, but they in-
sisted that there was no evi-
dence linking the C.I.A. to the 
drug traffic in Southeast Asia. 
One well-informed Government 
official directly responsible for 
HEW 'LUX T I kES 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
'4 4 JUL IW4. 
monitoring the Illegal flow of 
narcotics complained in an in-
terview that many of Mr. Mc-
Coy's charges "are out of date." 
"Go back three or four years," 
he said, "and no one was con-
cerned about this. It wasn't 
until our own troops started 
to get addicted, unal 1968 or 
'69, that anyone was aware" of 
the narcotics problems in South-
east Asia. 
This official said that In the 
eyes of the C.I.A., the charges 
were "unfair." He said of the 
C.I.A., "they think they're tak-
ing the heat for being un-
aware and not doing anything 
about so/net:MI.1g that was go-
ing on two or three years 
ago." 
Based on 250 Interviews 
During two Congressional ap-
pearances last month, Mr. Mc-
Coy testified that his accusa-
tions were based on more than 
250 interviews, some of them 
with past and present officials 
of the C.I.A. He said that top-
level South Vietnamese officials, 
including _President Nguyen 
Van Thieu and Premier Iran 
Van Ithient, were specifically 
involved. 
In July, 1971, Representative 
Robert H. Steele, Republican 
of Connecticut, said during a 
House Foreign Affairs subcom-
mittee hearing that the United 
States Government possessed 
"hard intelligence" linking a 
number of high-ranking South-
east Asian officials. including� 
Maj. Gen. Ngo Dzu, then corn-! 
mander of the South Viet-
namese II Corps, with involve-
ment in the narcotics trade. 
Mr. Steele's accusations were 
denied and mostly ignored. 
Mr. McCoy also alleged that 
Corsican and American syndi-
cate gangsters had become in-
volved in the narcotics trade. 
He said that such information' 
was known to the C.I.A. In a 
chapter of his book published 
in this month's Harper's Maga-
zine, Mr. McCoy further 
charged that in 1967 the in-. 
famous "Golden Triangle" � 
an opium-producing area etn-
bracing parts of northeastern 
,Burma, northern Thailand and 
northern Laos�was producing 
about 1,000 tons of raw opium 
annually, then about 70 per 
cent of the word's supply. 
The bulk of Mr. McCoy's 
accusations�both in the maga-
zine and during the Congres-
sional hearings--failed to gain 
much national attention. None-
theless, the C.I.A. began its 
unusual public defense after 
a Washington Star reporter 
cited some of Mr. McCoy's 
allegations in a column. 
Letter Sent to Paper 
Two letters were sent to 
the newspaper for publication. 
One was signed by W. Er 
Colby, the executive director 
of the (ILA _ artrl 
did not agree; he added, Harper 
& Row would not publish the 
book. 
In a subsequent interview, 
� Robert L. Bernstein, president 
of Random House and president 
of the Association of American 
Publishers, Inc., said that his 
concern had twice refused of-
ficial C.I.A. requests for per-
mission to revise manuscripts. 
"In general," Mr. Bernstein 
said, 'our opinion would be 
that we would not ,publish a 
book endangering the life of 
anybody working for the C.I.A. 
or an other Government agency. 
Short of that, we would pub-
lish any valid criticism." 
In a series of interviews with 
The New York Times, a number 
of present and former officials 
of the C.I.A. acknowledged that 
smuggling and "looking the oth-
er way" was common through-
for a copy of the manuscript out Southeast Asia during the

Vitals concerning involvement of

the U.S. Government [in drug 
traffic) or the participation of 
American citizens should be 
'made only if based on hard 
evidence." 
The letter continued: "It -is, 
our belief that ,no reputable 
publishing house would wish 
to publish such allegations with-
out being assured that the sup-
porting evidence was valid." 
If the manuscript were handed 
over, the letter said, "we be-
lieve we could demonstrate to 
you that a considerable num-
ber of Mr. McCoy's claims 
about this agency's alleged in-
volvement are totally false and 
iithout foundation, a number 
re distorted beyond recogni-
tion, and none is based on 
convincing evidence." A copy 
of the letter was made avail-
able to The New York Times. 
Mr.McCoy, in an interview, 
said that the book had been 
commissioned by Harper & 
Row and carefully and totally 
reviewed by its attorneys with 
no complaint until the C.I.A. 
!request was made. 
1 B. Brooks Thomas, vice presi-
dent and general counsel of 
.the publishing house, said in 
. an interview in No York,

!about the book at all. We've 
,had it reviewed by others and 
we're persuaded that the work 
is amply documented and schol-
arly." 
"We're not submitting to 
censorship or anything like 
that," Mr. Thomas said. "We're 
aking a responsible middle po-
sition. I just believe that the

to review it.", If Mr., McCoy

. A similar letter of disavowal,

for publication to the publisher 
of Harper's Magazine within 
the last week. Robert Schnayer-
son, the magazine's editor, said 
that the letter would be pub-

The C.I.A. began its approach 
to Harper & Row in early

of Mr. McCoy's appearance be-

The American 
SAIGON (NEA) � There is a monument 
in this city � appropriately next to a Chase 
Manhattan Bank advertisement � which 
reads: "The noble sacrifice of allied soldiers 
will never be forgotten." 
Ah, these Vietnamese. Already they tend 
to forget. 
Nearly three million soldiers from a half-
dozen nations have suffered 60,000 dead and 
350,090 casualties in the last decade of the 
Vietnamese war. But the man in the street, if 
he acknowledges it at alp, may just shrug and 
say, "Yes, butswhat have you done for us 
lately?" 
Some here who are aware that several 
neighbors, such as Thailand and the Philip-
'pines, have contributed troops, dismiss it as 
insignificant. The Australians, they say, 
never, did much. And the Koreans, have just 
strutted about feeling superior. 
As for the Americans � who did the most, 
who fought the most, who in effect pur-
chased, the 'entire allied commitment � as 
� for them, well, "Americans No. 10," say 
imany of the children of Saigon. - 
Vietnamese officials deny it, U.S. diplo-
mats try desperately to explain it away, but 
the icy fact is that after all this time and all 
this blood the United States is unloved in this 
country. Women fear us, merchants cheat us, 
peasants ignore us, students deplore us. The 
$10 billion a year ton average) Americans 
have spent in this land has bought some co-
operation,.but neither respect nor apprecia-
tion. 
"The only people who smile at me here 
are the beggars," says an Air Force colonel. 
"On the streets I feel like my forehead is 
marked." - 
The situation � call it anti-Americanism, 
was perhaps inevitable. Two and a half mil-
lion GIs have been in and out of Vietnam 
since 1961, plus thousands of sundry diplo-
mats, civilian workers, newsmen and seekers 
of erotica. Few of them; with the occasional' 
exception of diplomats, have strengthened 
any international bonds. It's not that the 
Yanks are so bad, just that they are different. 
Vietnamese women have never gotten use to 
being pinched on the boulevard and Viet-
19 Of COurse 
namese men have never gotten use to seeing 
it happen. 
The troops, perhaps, because of sheer 
numbers, have done the most to wrinkle the 
Oriental brow. A drunk GI is hard to take in 
Galveston, much less Gia Dinh. Not long ago 
in Da Nang, a trooper from the 196th Light 
Infantry Brigade, tipsy of course, ran down a 
Vietnamese child with a truck. It was the last 
straw for the nationals of the area. Hundreds 
of angry locals stormed the truck, threatened 
the driver and hinted of open war. Indeed, it 
was war of a sort, and the. 196th had to seal 
off the area, helicopter reinforcements in 
and finally agree to pay retribution to the 
victim's father. 
The same sort of thing is happening from 
the Delta to the DMZ. A newsman in Hue 
was recently set upon by three Vietnamese 
soldiers who stole his pack, his camera and 
his sunglasses U.S. troops traveling through 
the off-limits town of Bien Iloa do so with 
guns loaded, cocked and pointing 'at anybody 
who comes near. A military policeman with

Fights. Shootings. Name it. The Nams are at 
the Yankees' throats. 
Even the North Vietnamese spring offen-
sive has not sobered the citizens sentiments. 
Vernacular newspapers have hinted � good 
grief! � that the invasion was a .ClA.splot to 
"coldly test" South Vietnam's military met-
tle. And a young legislator, who knows bet-
ter, says privately: "It-wouldn't surprise me 
if Nixon and Mao (Tse-tung) have plotted out 
a coalition government for Saigon. The hth-
ajon could be the ploy to convince us that we 
can't stand by ourselves. Therefore we 
should hasten to aceept any generous Hanoi 
offer of peace." 
So it goes here. The walls of Hue Universi-
ty are covered with anti-American slogaris 
("American GIs eat water buffalo drop-
.

pings"). An airline clerk in Pleiku tells a 
Yank traveler to "buy a ticket to My Lai." 
There are several urban slums where U.S. 
types walk at their own peril. "Not every-
body here hates us," says an executive of a 
U.S. engineering firm "Some just don't care 
one way or the otter.'' 
The situation is sad. And maddening. And 
the forecast is the United. States may spend 
the next decade here spending money trying 
to buy the friendship it lost spending money 
in the last. lint, say the cynics, there is at 
least one hope to 'Vietnamese anti-Ameni, 
canism: "Maybe it's a sign. Maybe these 
people aren't passive after all. Maybe one 
day they'll hate their enemies as much as 
they hate their friends." . -

SIR: I refer to the letter of W. E. Colby, executive 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who .-re-
butted the charges made by some American newspa-
permen that the CIA was involved in opium traf-
ficking. I do not question Colby's good faith, neither 
do I say that the CIA, as an entity, traffics in opium; 
but, I am sorry to say that there is more to these 
charges than mere "gossip, conjecture and old history." 
I also know what I am talking about becausel was 
inVolved in security matters for the South Vietnamese 
government under President Ngo Dinh Diem. In effect, 
one day, the President told me to investigate into the 
activities of our chief of secret police, chief of our own 
"CIA" and chief of military security, and to report di-
rectly to him, because, as he put it: "I cannot ask my 
own chiefs of police, 'CIA,' and military security to 
investigate into themselves." 
I found out the corruption of two. chiefs, and the 
President took very drastic measures against Them. I 
have kept the contact with my security agents ever 
since. They firmly confirm that a few CIA agents in 
Indochina are involved in opium trafficking. But above 
all, a line must be drawn between Indochina and the 
rest of the world, because, due to the fact of the coun-
ter-insurgency warfare, the operations of the American 
CIA in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are extremely im-
portant when they are compared. to operations of the 
same agency in other countries, In Indochina, the CIA 
is a real army with his own aerial Beet. A number of 
CIA operatives deal directly with Vietnamese, Lao, or 
Meo warlords or officials at the highest level, with 
whom they share the proceeds of the opium traffic. For 
, good American citizens in the United States, it is very 
difficult to imagine the influence and power of these 
operatives in Indochina. Their power, in fact, is un-
limited�they are the true rulers of Indochina; their 
desires are orders�no Vietnamese, Laotian or Cambo-
dian official would dare resist their orders. Corruption 
growing from a de facto power. affects some of these 
CIA operatives. 
The traffic of opium involves a relatively large num-
ber of persons. Outside a few Americans, there are 
Vietnamese, Laotians and Meo who are involved. Since 
these persons have their clans, families and friends who 
live from INS traffic, the total number of persons con-
cerned become so great that it is impossible to keep 
secret the operations. 
also do not question the good faith of CIA Director,/ 
Richard Helms when he said that "os an agency, in 
fact, we are heavily engaged in tracing the foreign 
roots of the drug traffic for the Bureau of Narcotics 
and Dangerous Drugs. We hope we are helping with a 
solution;�we know we are not contributing to the prob-
lem . . However, as I said previously, a line must. 
� be drawn and a distinction must be made; for circum-
stances are not the same�there is not the vaguest re-
semblance between CIA operatives in Indochina and 
their colleagues operating in other countries. 
� In conclusion CIA Director Helms and Colby, Miss j. 
Randal, and Mcdoy said the truth and did not contra- . 
diet one another; they perhaps did not talk about' the 
same country.

� � 
� Let us not talk about 
Nixon's war or Johnson's war 
or the Pentagon's war or the 
C.I.A.'s war. Let us take hold 
' of this war as citizens and as 
elected representatives, and 
let us vote to end it. 
, Many years ago, the an;�� 
cleat Biblical prophet wrote: 
"I have set before you life 
or death, blessing or cursing; 
, therefore choose life that 
' thou and thy seed may live." 
� Let us choose not cursing 
fait blessing, not death but 
life. (Senate Speech, May. 7, 
� 1970.) 
Future Commitments 
. In cases similar to what 
.we�have *seen in Vietnam, we 
should examine any request' 
for American involvement in 
the light of these points: 
� cAre those asking our help 
the appropriate elements for 
us to be supporting, both in 
terms of what they stand for 
and in terms of our national 
interest? , 
(]1.1 so, are they unable to 
bear the responsibility them-
selves for the protection of 
their position? 
cilf they are not, we should. 
try to determine if the inter-
national community, through 
the United Nations, can pro--
vide there the aid they need. 
If such a U.N. role is not 
possible, then we should in-
vestigate the possibility of 
multilateral action. 
cif that approach is un-
workable, then we should be 
prepared to consider a com-
mitment by the United 
States..(Response to Congres-
sional Quarterly questions.) 
Welfare . 
There is a fundamental al-
ternative to the President's 
Family Assistance proposal--
an alternative whose poten-
tial as an antipoverty strategy 
far exceeds the poor people's 
approach of the President � 
a Human Security Plan which 
looks toward insuring each 
of our citizens against the 
risk of poverty and doing so 
simply because we believe 
that this kind of minimal fi-
nancial_ security should be a 
right of citizenship in our 
country. 
I will offer an amendment 
[comprising] four major corn- - 
ponents�components which 
would protect each of us 
against the four major 
causes of poverty in Amer-
ica. First, it would include 
a children's allowance to se-
cure the future of our. chil-
dren. Second, it would guar-
antee a job at a decent 
wage for every able-bodied 
working-age citizen. Third, it 
would improve Social Securi-
ty for the elderly and disabled. 
Finally, it would provide a 
small, federally administered 
special Public Assistance plan 
to protect the few who would 
remin in need for additional 
incoMe maintenance. 
(Speech to Citizen's Com-
mittee for Children, New 
York City, Jun. 20, 1970.) 
CrimQ and Justk' 
All these apparently hard-
nosed proposals, winch would 
actually result in making re-
duction of crime harder to 
accomplish, are part of a 
great illusion that has been 
fostered ever since Richard 
Nixon began to campaign for 
the Presidency in I It is 
the illusion that. crime is ray-
aging the nation because the. 
police, the prosecutors and 
the judges are too soft on 
the criminals The Ad-
ministration hopes to blame-
Congress and the courts for 
striking down an alleeTd at-
tempt to stop crime. This will 
be the Administration's re-
sponse to the inevitable 
demonstration that the Nixon 
promise to end the crime 
crisis is to he unfulfilled. The 
promise- will be uniulfillcd 
because the harder construc-
tive task has been largely 
avoided. (Senate speech, July

ill it rain on your protest? 
Every war, no matter how unpleas-
ant, produces benefits for some of 
those who survive it. Outdoorsmen, 
for instance, can thank World War 
II for jeeps and lightweight sleeping 
bags. Korea speeded up the develop-
ment of helicopters and jet airplanes. 
And now Vietnam has given us a re-
markable new crowd. control tech-
nique known as "weather modifica-
tion." 
On various occasions during the 
war, according to the New York 
Times, the CIA_ arranged for rain to 
fall on civil lTdrders in Saigon and 
Hue. Torrential downpours, the CIA 
discovered, were useful in persuading 
uppity Buddhist monks and other pro-
testers to go home and quit embar-
rassing South Vietnam's democratic 
government. All it took to maintain 
order in the streets was a little cloud 
seeding on the day of a demon-
stration. 
The question now is whether the 
government will use similar methods 
here in the United States. Miami 
Beach, the scene of both national 
political party conventions this sum-
mer, would be an ideal testing ground. is that the Miami Beach City Council

Even the most militant yippies, gay 
libbers and poor people would be 
forced to retreat when hit by Miami's 
first monsoon. 
Politics being what it is, we rather 
doubt Mr. Nixon will modify the 
weather to help the Democrats. Any-
thing that embarrasses them helps 
him, so he will surely be content to 
sit back and watch heads get bashed 
on nationwide TV. Sudden cloudbursts 
are much more likely if demonstrators 
get out of hand when the GOP meets 
in Miami late in August. 
At the moment, however, it appears 
that peace will prevail in the streets 
of Miami this week. The authorities 
have taken the security measures 
needed to preserve order in an open 
society. Concertina barbed wire has 
been rolled out, troops are on alert, 
and tear gas has been stockpiled.

trol won't carry guns or clubs. When 
a problem develops, negotiations will 
be tried first, force second. In other 
words, every effort is being made to 
avoid the violence of 1968. 
All bets are off, of course, if Sen. 
George McGovern should somehow be

appears that while the candidates 
shed each other's blood inside Con.

take .along a ceuple of raincoats and 
a water-repellent sign.

GOP Attractions: Vietnam, Beer, 
By Bruce Lambert Jr. 
Roslyn�When the several hundred youths at a Republi-
can conference here broke Ub into seminar groups, only half 
a dozen or so showed up for the one on reelection of Pres-
ident Nixon. 
Despite that disappointing turnout, the President got 
virtually unanimous support at the day's most popular sem-
inar, on Vietnam. Thirty youngsters gathered for it, and, 
unlike the other groups, their number grew. 
In fact, the Vietnam seminar nearly tripled in size and 
lasted close to two hours, long after the other seminars 
ended their discussions on women, colleges, ecology, off-
shore oil, transportation, .busing, the courts, narcotics, and 
the State Legislature. 
The Vietnam seminar had not even been scheduled, but 
the Nassau County Republican organization running the all-
day youth meeting accepted a speaking offer from a young 
man who identified himself as Daniel Teodoru, a Romanian 
refugee and former correspondent in Vietnam. He did, not 
say what news organization he had represented. 
Teodoru said the effectiveness of Nixon's war policies 
had been confirmed by unpublicized Communist documents 
captured by the. Central Intelligence Agency and the mili-
tary. "When you've got. ifie-PFAident and the enemy telling 
you the same thing, you've got to believe it," he said. 
Teodoru described Sen. GeOrge McGovern as "an out-
and-out liar" who "coordinates his political campaign with 
Hanoi's military campaign." Referring to his own youth, 
Teodoru also claimed that McGovern "bombed inc and other 
innocent civilians" while serving as a pilot in World War II. 
And he said that the media have been "vicious and vile" in 
distorting news from Vietnam. 
His remarks drew several rounds of applause from the 
youths: One objected that the war was based in U.S. eco-
nomic interests and another spesifiled oil. Teodoru challenged 
them for details and got none. 
- "I ended up being a defense of Nixon," .one 19-year-old 
girl said. "But he [Teodoru] was able to back himself up 
with facts while they weren't. They had no facts. Generally, 
I think the Republicans are making an effort for youth." 
Another girl. said the seminars were "really excellent." 
More popular than any of the seminars, however; were 
the free attractions: several swimming pools, a- trampoline, 
a pond, shady trees, fried chicken box lunches, Leer on, tap 
and a dinner of hot dogs and hamburgers. One teenage girl 
said to another, "Oh, let's stay. There's nothing else to do." 
Nearly 1,000 of the 1846-25-year-olds registered during 
Sakirday morning and afternoon, but a late afternoon rain 
til6atened to end the program, and the crowd dwindled to 40. 
With an ice cold can in his hand, one youth said, "Well, 
we've still got the free. beer."

.'''Dr. MacDonald (who is now a 
member of the White House Council on 
)nvironmental Quality) made it clear 
71.11at" his essay was based only on spec-
-tilation. Last week, however, it became 
Ithown that at least part of his maca-
bre weather arsenal had been secretly 
4n use by the United States since the 
1960's. 
t: 
7;�Air Force planes, supported by the 
se 
ntral Intelligence Agency, have beers 
waging a systematic war of rain on 
the infiltration trails of Laos, Cam-
bodia, North Vietnam and South Viet-
nam. The intent: suppress enemy anti-
missile fire, provide cover for South 
Vietnamese commando teams pene-
trating the North and hinder the 
movement of men and materiel from 
North Vietnam into the South. 
The first experimental rain-making 
mission was flown by the C.I.A. in 
South Vietnam in 1963, but it was not 
until 1965 that a' group of Air Force 
scientists officially was ordered to 
start thinking of ways to turn nature 
into a' military tool. 
"We all sat down in a big brain-
storming session," said one of the 
sciehtists who participated at the Air 
Force Cambridge Research Labora-
tories at Hanscomb Field near Bedford, 
Mass. "The idea was to increase the 
rain and reduce the trafficability in all 
of Southeast Asia." 
Within a year, the Air Force and 
C.I.A. began a highly secret rain-mak-
ing project over the Ho Chi Minh Trail 
in Laos, known as "Operation' Pbp-
Eye." There were heated protests from 
the State Department, and eventually 
a directive from the Secretary of De-
fense Robert S. McNamara ordering a 
halt to the project. Instead, well-
qualified sources � said last week, "it 
went underground�into the dark." 
From 1969, through at least early 
this year, weather warfare was a 
covert operation being directed by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff with White House 
acquiescence. 
The fact that the program existed 
at all came to light only last week in, 
The New York Times. But, despite an 
extensive investigation, it could not be 
learned how successful the program 
had been, how many missions were 
conducted or whether it was-still being 
used in connection with the heavy 
bombing of North Vietnam that fol-
lowed the enemy offensive last April. 
Making rain has long been techni-
cally feasible. Scientists have learned 
that rain fall can be increased 
by as much as 40 per cent after seed-
ing clouds by aircraft with silver-io-
dide particles. Other chemicals, includ-
ing dry ice, also have been used with 
success, both in the United States and 
in Southeast Asia. 
Military and Government specialists 
acknowledge that there is little precise 
scientific knowledge of the short-range 
impact of cloud seeding and practi-
cally none of the long-range ecological 
effect of changing the amount of 
natural rainfall. Some scientists have 
. � . � . � 
.published data suggesting that weather 
.modification, in combination with 
,� 
other ecological stresses such as air 
pollution and pesticides, may have a 
synergistic effect�that is, result in 
collective changes far greater than 
either abuse would have- caused by . 
itself. 
In Indochina, where heavy bombing 
already has robbed much of the land-
snipe of its natural water-holding ca-
pability by destroying foliage and trees, 
artifically induced rains may result in 
far greater flooding than expected, 
along with heavier soil erosion. 
Technically, there are no interna-
tional agreements outlawing such war-
fare. But Government officials made 
clear last week that the weather-mak-
ing activity of tile Air Foree was 
shielded from public view because of 
White House sensitivity to what could 
be regarded as the impropriety of the 
action. The issue, one well-informed 
official said, was one in which Henry 
A. Kissinger, the President's national-
security adviser, took.a personal hand, 
"This kind of thing was a bomb," the 
official said, "and Henry restricted 
information about it to those who had. 
to know."

John P; Roche 
War Command chaos 
DEN. JOHN D. La-
velle' s private War with 
North Vietnam has justifia-
bly touched off quite a stir. 
Lavelle, it will be recalled, 
was commanding general of 
the 7th Mr Force and appar-
ently decided to use the am-
- biguity of "protective reac-
tion" as a justification for 
some preemptive strikes 
against North Vietnamese 
military installations. He had 
the records of these strikes 
doctored up in such a fashion 
that they indicated compli-
.� nee with the rules of en-
gagement. However, because 
the President subsequently 
Authorized wider bombing, 
the chances are that many 
-people will write off the La-
velle incident on the ground 
that he was premature but 
� sensible. 
Actually the Lavelle initia-
tive is symptomatic of a far 
more basic problem than sim-
ple battlefield improvisation.. 
Leaving aside the Strange-
love scenarios which have 
� local commanders joyously 
,firing off Minutemen, what 
-occurred was a complete fail-
ure of, the command struc-
ture that should concern all 
.of us. It was far more than a 
'breakdown in civilian control 
over the military; it was a 
breakdown in military con-
trol over the military. Not 
'since Abraham Lincoln put 
.U.. S. Grant in command of 
the Union armies have we 
� seen such a shambles as the 
command structure a the Vi-
etnamese war. 
WHO IS theoretically the 
top American official in 
South Vietnam? The chief of 
mission, Ambassador. Ells-
worth Bunker. What was the 
official function of Gen. Wil-
liam Westmoreland and, 
later, Gen.- Cr e ig ht on 
Abrams? They were the am-
bassador's subordinates in 
charge of the Military Assist-
ance Command (MACV). 
That is, in theory, these four-
star generals had exactly the 
same status as, say, the colo-
nel, who is in charge of an 
American military assistance 
group in some Latin Ameri-
can nation. 
For openers, then, the. 
commanding general, MACV, 
worked for the ambassador, 
just like the local director 
of the Agency for Interna-
tional Development or the 
local head of the Central 
Intelligence Agency. Then 
came the war and half a mil-
lion American troops�Army; 
Air Force and Marines, plus 
the assets of the Seventh 
Fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
Now who was in charge? 
Well, if you can believe it, 
the ambassador. 
' At this point General of 
the Army George C. Marshall 
must have been spinning in 
his grave. Vietnam was never 
made into a military theater 
of command with the highly 
structured lines of control 
that existed in World War II 
(and even then there were 
problems; George Patton, for 
Instance, had a do-it-yourself 
view of strategy). Nor were 
our ambassadors, either by 
character or conviction, will-
ing to take on the job of pro-
consul. 
Which brings us to Gen. 
' Lavelle and the 7th Air 
Force. Who was Lavelle's 
boss? In one capacity, he 
worked for Abrams; in an-
other, for the commander in 
chief, U.S. Forces in the Pa-
cific (CINCPAC)---an admiral 
In Hawaii; in still a third, for 
the chief of staff of the Air 
Force in Washington. 
THE SAME sort of com-
mand chaos permeated all 
the services. Indeed, if one 
looked at the chart, he some-, 
times wondered how any-
thing ever got accomplished. 
But conversely, such a laby-
rinth is perfectly designed 
for a general who wants to go 
Into business for himself. 
In political terms, it is a 
' 
classic case of hardening of 
the categories. Even though 
he character of the war rad'. 
1t 
he
changed between 1963- 
66, the fiction was main-
tained that we were merely 
providing "military assist-
ance." Thus we fell between 
two stools: there was no thea-
ter commander to run the 
show; there was no ambassa-
dor willing or able to exer-
cise his theoretical responsi-
bilities. 
I have often thought in this 
context that perhaps Presi-
dent Johnson's greatest error 
was in not accepting Robert 
F. Kennedy's offer to go to 
Saigon as ambassador. With 
Bobby at the head of the 
table there would have been 
no ambiguities in the com-
mand structure.

ANNALS OF \VAR_ 
VIETNAM 
. II--SOVEREIGN OF DISCORD 
, 
NGO DINH DIEM�the 
name 
meant a great deal at one time, 
in Washington as well as Sai-
gon. On a trip to Vietnam in 1961, 
Lyndon Johnson called Diem "the 
Winston Churchill of Asia." What-
ever the other points of resemblance 
between him and that British states-
man, the man who undertook the 
American project of barricading the 
southern against the northern half of 
Vietnam certainly provoked hyperbole 
�from Americans. For a period in the 
mid-nineteen-fifties, Diem was the 
.hero of the American press. According 
to an article in Life, he was a "tough 
miracle man," who . had "saved his 
'people from [the] agonizing prospect" 
of a national plebiscite; and he was 
widely given credit for halting "the 
red tide. of Communism in Asia." The 
word "miracle" affixed itself to Diem's 
name with the adhesion of a Homeric. 
�epithet. Diem had performed the "po-
litical miracle" of creating . a strong 
government, the "economic miracle" 
of rebuilding the economy of South 
Vietnam from the ruins of war. In 
1957, Diem travelled to the United 
States on the American Presidential air-
plane. Welcomed by President Eisen-
hower at the airport, he addressed a 
joint session of Congress and visited 
New York, where Mayor Robert 
Wagner called him "a man history 
may yet adjudge as one of the great 
figures of the twentieth century." Six 
years later; Diem was to die in a dark 
alley of Saigon, denounced as the petty 
tyrant who had destroyed South Viet-
namese society and prejudiced the cause 
of the free world in Asia.' 
Any history of the Diem regime 
would have to be written in vivid, 
novelesqu.e colors. To start with, there 
was Ngo Dinh Diem himself�a shy, 
self-righteous Catholic mandarin who 
had �taken a vow of chastity and re-
vealed an ambition to serve as a moral 
example to his people. He wished, in ef-
fect, to be the emperor of an enlight-
ened Confucian state, in the classic pat-
tern of Vietnamese history. Four of 
Diem's brothers played important roles, 
especially the lean, fierce Ngo Dinh 
'Nhu, wfloSe life. Was a succession of 
plots, ruses, and metaphysical dogmas. 
And there was Mine. Nhu, the beauti-
ful, outspoken, and wholly outrageous 
woman whom the American journalists 
called "the Dragon Lady." For nearly 
a decade, the Ngos dominated all con-
versation in Saigon; Americans and 
Vietnamese alike spent hours discussing 
the latest court intrigue or scandal, 
hours speculating on the intricacies of 
the family philosophy. The 'Ngos never 
disappointed them�not even in dying. 
Played out under the gaze of the tele-
vision cameras, the fall of the Ngos 
was, in its way, pure theatre, the de-
nouement of a baroque tragedy. 
The private psychological drama of 
Diem and his family was as nothing be-
side the grand strategies and global 
concerns of the United States in Viet-
nam, but, as the French historian Phi-
lippe Devillers once wrote, "in our age 
of mass society, where all liitory seems 
to be determined by forces so powerful 
as to negate the individual,, the Viet-
namese problem has the originality to 
remain dominated by questions of indi-
viduals. Indeed, the problem becomes 
almost incomprehensible if *one trans-
forms men into. abstractions." "f he no-
tion .may sound romantic, but it is not. 
In the first place, Vietnam in the days. 
of Diem possessed a very small edu-
cated society; most of the prominent 
men knew each other as well as if they 
had been the inhabitants of one village. 
In the second place, the Vietnamese 
traditionally understood politics not in 
terms of programs or large social forces 
but in terms of the individual. And 
their perception was not unscientifically 
based, for, given the size and .uniform-
ity of the old society, the life of one 
man might stand as a model for the life 
of the society as a whole. If that one 
man was. Ngo Dinh Diem, then. the 
personal drama of the Ngo family, with 
its mysterious and violent ending, de-
scribed the difficulty of. the American 
project in Vietnam better than would 
a history of all the counter-insurgency 
programs or an analysis of all the larg-
er social forces. 
mencan decision to back 
Ngo Dinh Diem was not of it-
self a major policy decision. The policy 
of supporting a non-Communist Viet-
nam had been 'formulated sonic years 
earlier, and Diem himself was but 
one element of the fallback position 
hastily devised following the French 
debacle in 1954. By that time, the 
United States was paying eighty per 
,cent of the costs of the French war, 
and it was not until June of 1954 that 
Secretary of State Dulles told the 
French definitely that the United States 
would not commit its own troops and 
planes to Indo-China. Even after the 
fall of Dien Bien Phu, Administration, 
officials did not accept the Vietminh 
victory or the principle of a divided 
Vietnam. During the Geneva Confer-
ence, their ambition was not only to 
build up a government in Saigon but to 
undermine Ho Chi Nlinh's govern-
ment in Hanoi as well. In June, 1954, 
Colonel Edward G. Lansdale was sent 
out as chief of a Saigon military mission 
with orders to "beat tile Geneva time-
table of ComMunist takeover in the 
.North." By August, during the period 
of negotiated truce that had been 
agreed upon to precede the �holding 
of national elections, Lansdale's teams 
were scattered about the country from 
Hanoi to the Ca Mau peninsula con-
ducting agitprop work and sabotage 
operations, in direct violation of the 
United States government's promise at 
Geneva to "refrain from the threat 
or the use of force." These teams had 
small success in the Vietminh-held. 
areas. Their main' achievement in the 
North was to lay the groundwork for 
the 'subsequent "flight" of the Catholics 
to the South. Their tactics were prom-
ises and "black propaganda," or the 
falsification of enemy reports. Many 
of the rest of their activities were little 
more than terrorist acts. One team, 
for instance, managed to contaminate 
the oil supply in the bus depot of 
Hanoi in order to wreck the engines 
of all the city's public transport. 
The fact is that high United States 
officials could have had very little con-
fidence in the success of Lansdale's mis-
sion in either the South or the North. 
In Saigon, the French-sponsored gov-
enunent was in a state of near-collapse.

By MIRIAM OTTENBEI RG 
Star Staff Writer 
U.S. narcotics agents are 
making a sizable dent in the 
Southeast Asian dope traffic 
and�:despite reports to the 
contrary � America's Asian 
allies and the CIA are helping 
them do it. 
"We have seriously dam-
aged the program of the nar-
cotics traffickers," reported 
c/ John Warner, chief of the Bu-
reau of Narcotics and Dan-
gerous Drugs' strategic intel�
ligence office. "It's becoming 
increasingly more difficult for 
them to operate, even though 
their profits are tremendous." 
Warner countered testi-
mony given recently by Al-
fred W. McCoy, a Ph.D stu-
dent, before a Senate Appro-
priations subcommittee to .the 
effect that the governments of 
South Vietnam, Laos and 
Thailand are actively en-
gaged in the heroin traffic - 
and that the U.S. government� � 
.; has not moved to stop it. 
"Corruption," Warner 
ac-
knowledged, "is a way of life 
- in Southeast Asia. It reaches 
to all levels. But the United 
States government has made 
it perfectly clear to all gov-
ernments in the area that we 
Will not compromise on the 
,narcotics issue." 
He cited as an example of 
increasing cooperation on in-
stance earlier this year when 
1.26 tons of opium were turned 
.over to the government of 
Thailand by one of the in-
surgent forces along its bor-
der�presumably for reasons 
of its own. 
Until recently, the opium 
'would have found its way 
back into the traffic. But this 
were taken and analyzed by 
American chemists. 
Even more significant are 
recent successes of Laos and 
� Thai narcotics investigative 
units set up with U.S. aid. 
Warner explained how they 
came into being and, in doing 
so, replied to the charges 
made by McCoy in his Con-
gressional appearance. .. 
McCoy had chaliged that 
the U.S. ambassador to Laos, 
G. Malurtrie Godley, "did 
his best to prevent the as-
signment" of U.S. narcotics 
agents to Laos. 
Actually, Warner said, God--
ley has been one of the 
staunchest supporters of the 
anti-narcotics program in 
Laos, and requested U.S. nar-
cotics agents as advisers long 
before they could be sent 
there. He was instrumental in 
persuading Laos to outlaw the 
opium traffic, Warner said. 
Godley also persuaded the 
Laotian government to ap-
point an honest and compe-
tent general to head the new 
narcotics investigative unit 
which the U.S. Bureau of Nar-
cotics and Dangerous Drugs 
established and, 'trained, War-
ner added. 
In the short time the unit 
has been operational, Warner 
reported, it has made tre-
mendous progress in arrest-
ing traffickers and seizing 
laboratory equipment and the 
chemicals used to make 
heroin. 
The unit's latest score came 
on June 7 when it arrested a 
Meo deputy of the Laotian 
parliament and seized 10 kilos 
of No. 4 heroin (the injectable 
kind), 26 kilos of opium and 
a number of U.S. Army car-
bines. 
Another special investiga-
tive force tr a i ned and 
equipped by BNDD agents, 
has just gotten under way at 
Chingmai in northern Thai-
land. Chingmai is a road junc-
tion in the network of roads 
leading south to Bangkok. 
. It's particularly important

cotics agents and samples opium growing area border-
ing Laos, Burma and Thai-
land. 
The new Thai unit has just 
scored its first success. On 
June 10, a joint BNDD and 
Thai task force raided a com-
pound and seized 1,600 kilos 
of raw opium and processing 
equipment, he said. 
. Warner also reported that 
.he Royal Hong Kong police 
also have stepped up their 
anti-narcotics program, 'flak-
ing large seizures of nar-
cotics, arresting traffickers 
and seizing two laboratories 
this year. At the time, both 
labs had quantities of heroin, 
opium and morphine base. 
Burma, the other govern-
ment touched by the opium 
traffic, has expressed its will-
ingness to cooperate, \Varner 
reported, but Burmese offi-
cials frankly admit their con-
trol over the border areas are 
very tenuous. It would require 
an army to make any impact 
on the border areas where 
.insurgent forces protect the 
opium traffickers. Warner 
said. 
In Laos an acknowledged 
impartant trafficker has been 
knocked out of business not by 
an army but by American 
diplomacy, Warner said. 
Gen. Ouane Rattikone, for-
mer chief of staff of the 
Royal Laotian Army, had con-
solidated several opium refin-
eries into one, and with his 
army, controlled and protect-
ed the Laotian narcotics traf-
fic for years, Warner said. 
"He was forced to retire in 
July, 1971. We have political 
clout in the area and Ambas-
sador Godley exerted it." 
Warner said similar action 
would be taken against Viet-
namese figures if charges of 
narcotics trafficking were 
proven. 
"Politics means nothing to 
us in BNDD," he said. If we 
had the evidence . . . the 
President would be informed 
and I know something would 
be done about it. 
McCoy had said in is con-
gressional testimony that the. 
political apparatus of Gen. 
Nguyen Cao Ky (the former 
president of South Vietnam) 
"demonstrates the importance 
of official corruption in South-
east Asia's drug traffic." Mc-
Coy also said Ky's sister is 
tied in with heroin smuggling. 
_ Warner, however, said there 
is no evidence that Ky is in 
volved. 
McCoy, in his Senate testi 
mony, said he had briefed 
BNDD on his findings and they  
corrobated much of his evi-
dence. Asked about that, War-
ner said he had seen nothing 
of an evidentiary nature from 
McCoy "other than gossip, 
rumors, conjecture and old 
history." - 
McCoy had accused the CIA 
of providing substantial mili-
tary support to mercenaries, 
rebels and warlords actively 
engaged in the narcotics traf-
fic and of letting aircraft it 
chartered be used tO transport 
opium harvested by the mer-
cenaries. 
Of those charges, Warner 
said the American-chartered 
aircraft now have security 
forces guarding against the 
against the transport of any. 
narcotics. 
Since President Nixon asked 
the CIA to assist in dealing 
with the Southeast Asian nar-
cortics problem, Warner said, 
the CIA has been one of the 
most cooperative government 
agencies working with BNDD 
to' develop the information on 
which BNDD and its foreign 
counterparts can act to inter-
dict the traffic and make 
cases. 
The weeding out of Asian of-
ficials heavily involved in the 
dope traffic, as well as the 
strikes against the traffickers 
themselves, are all fairly re-
cent. And so is the BNDD 
in-
volvement in the Pacific. e 
It's .only in the last twO 
years that American narcotics 
agents have come into the 
Orient in force. Since BNDD 
Director John E. Ingersoll 
pushed for more agents to 
fight the Pacific traffic in 
drugs, regional offices .have. 
been set up in Bangkok, Sia, 
gon and Tokyo, and district 
offices in Chingmai, Vientiane, 
Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, 
Hong Kong, Okinawa and 
Manila,.

Charge CIA and Thieu 
� push heroin to .U.S. GIs 
Daily World Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON. June 2�Alfred W. McCoy, a Yale student. 
working on his doctorate, told a Senate Appropriations subcom-
mittee today that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Sai-
gon Dictator Nguyen Van Thieu are directly involved in the ship; 
meat of vast quantities of opium and heroin to the U.S. 
McCoy, who has authored a book, "The Politics of Heroin in 
Southeast Asia," debunked President Nixon's campaign against 
heroin imported from Turkey." 
. He told the Foreign Operations subcommittee. headed,by Sen. . 
William Proxmire (D-Wisc), that the U.S. underworld has totally 
�recouped the loss of the Turkish supply by turning to Southeast 
Asia sources. 
In South Vietnam, McCoy said, the opium and heroin traffic 
Is divided among. the nation's three dominant military factions: 
Pres. Thieu's political apparatus, Prime Minister Kim's political 
organization, and Gen: Ky's political apparatus. 
"Throughout the mountainous Golden: Triangle region, the 
� CIA has provided substantial military support for mercenaries,: 
- right-wing rebels, and tribal war lords who are actively engaged 
in the narcotics traffic and 'in Thailand the CIA has worked 
closely with nationalist Chinese paramilitary units which control 
80 to 90 percent of northern Burma's vast opium export and man-
ufacture high-grade heroin for export to the American market," 
McCoy testified. � 
"Some of President Thieu's closest supporters inside the 
South Vietnamese army control the distribution and sale of he." 
roin to Americans GI's fighting in Indochina." 1 �.� 
' "Finally U.S. agencies have been actually involved in. certain 
� aspects of the region's drug traffic. In Northern Laos, Air Ame-

Perspective   
lectoral 
olitics: The 
Candidates 
eply 
IN THE ED1TORTAL ESSAY "Vietnam 
and the Elections" which opened 
the April issue of RAMPARTS WC 
observed that the call for U.S. with-
drawal from Vietnam, once dismissed 
as extremist or naive, had at last be-
come politically respectable. Withdraw-
al- had in fact become the dominant 
' theme of Vietnam policy among this 
.. year's..Presidential candidates. At the 
same time, we noted, the clear prin-
ciple of this demand was being clouded 
and distorted in the turgid mainstream 
of American electoral debate. And we 
. . . 
called upon the anti-war movement 
in the coming months "to sharpen the 
demand for withdrawal and establish 
the clearest possible mandate for it." 
� In an attempt to' follow our own ad-
vice, RAMPARTS wrote, to each of the 
Presidential candidates, presenting to 
them a list of seven questions on their 
plans for peace in Vietnam. We re-
ceived replies from Rep. Chisholm, 
.Sen. Humphrey, Sen. Jackson, Sen. Mc-
Govern and Sen. Muskie. The letters 
from Chisholm, Humphrey, McGovern 
and Muskie essentially consisted of the 
candidates' point-by-point responses to 
our questions over their signatures. In 
the following commentary we have 
taken these questions one or two at a 
time, and grouped together the answers 
of these four candidates' for compari-
son and analysis. Sen. Jackson's letter 
did not direct itself to the specific ques-
tions in a parallel way, so we are print-
ing it in its entirety in a box on page 
10.0f the Democratic candidates who 
remained in the aftermath of the Wis-
consin primary only Wallace and Mc-
Carthy did not respond to our questions. 
Since Rep. McClosky had dropped out 
of the race in March, and Richard 
Nixon didn't answer, we drew a blank 
on the Republican hopefuls. 
. We posed seVen 'questions:. while the 
original numbering is maintained, the 
results are discussed here in a different 
order. This alloWs us to set out first the 
common thrust of the four candidates' 
policies and in a sense proceed from the 
easy questions to the hard, from the 
shared assumptions to the problematic 
implications. . 
I. Shall the United States permanent-
ly withdraw all its armed forces (161-
,diers, sailors and airmen) from Viet-
nam on the sole condition of an agree-
ment for the repatriation of prisoners 
of war, timed to coincide with our 
� 
withdrawal? 
2. Shall the U.S. similarly withdraw 
its armed forces front all of Indochina 
on the same single. condition? What 
about U.S. bases in Thailand? . 
CHISHOLM: . . . 
1. I firmly believe and stand for an 
immediate total withdrawal of all U.S. 
forces from Vietnam:. with the sole 
londition being an agreement for the 
repatriation of prisoners of. war. � 
2. I also believe that it is imperative 
� that we.. withdraw our armed forces 
from all of Indochina. I must further 
support a withdrawal of U.S. influence 
on the lives of those who seek a .pres-
ervation of their culture. 
HUMPHREY: 
1. Yes.. 
2. Yes, although in regard to Thai-
land the critical point is that these bases 
not be used for strikes in Indochina. 
The question of leaving these bases al-
together is a longer term proposition, 
involving issues that go beyond the 
Vietnam war; this calls for further 
study at the Presidential level. 
McGOVERN: 
1. Yes. It is important to note, how-
ever, that leaving U.S. forces in South 
Vietnam to defend the Thieu regime is 
a circuitous method of achieving re-
lease of our prisoners. I am convinced 
that they will be returned within the 
framework of Article 118 of the Gen-
eva Convention on prisoners of war, 
which provides that prisoners will be 
released without delay "after the cessa-
tion of hostilities." This requires a com-
plete American disengagement from 
hostilities. against all parties in Indo-
I china.  want to point out, too, that I

do not regard this U.S. withdrawal as a 
negotiating position�it is instead a 
course of action which I. fully intend 
to implement. The McGovern-Hatfield 
Amendment did not urge the President 
to 'negotiate our withdrawal; rather it 
required withdrawal by cutting off 
funds for the war. 
2. Yes. The bases in Thailand have 
no justification other than to attempt to 
dert U.S. influence over the internal 
politics of Southeast Asian countries. 
The withdrawal must, of course, mean 
an end to all military operations, in-
cluding bombing, anywhere in Indo-
china. 
MUSKIE: . 
I. Yes. I have consistently supported 
this position in the last few years. On 
February 2, I urged that "We muSt set 
a date when we will withdraw every 
soldier, sailor, and air-man, and ,stop 
all bombing and other American mil-
itary .activity, dependent only on an 
agreement for the return of our pis-
oners and the safety of our troops as 
'they leave." I do not believe that an 
agreement for the safety of our troops 
as they leave would be in any way a 
problem; the basic exchange would be 
a complete end to American. military 
participation in the Indochina war for 
the return of our prisoners. 
2. My proposal includes our military 
aCtivity and personnel in Vietnam, 
Laos, and Cambodia. would there-
fore not make use of our bases in Thai-
land and elsewhere in Southeast Asia 
for activities related to the Indochina 
war. I would otherwise approach the 
issue .of bases in Thailand and else-
where in Southeast Asia in the context 
of efforts not only to promote detente 
between the U.S. and China but also 
with regard to the effect that either 
maintaining or removing our various 
bases would have on the possibilities 
for accommodation among Asian na-
tions' themselves. Clearly, we do not 
need to maintain anything like the 
number and size of bases we have now 
in Southeast Asia. 
6. Shall the U.S. set a date by which 
it will carry out its withdrawal (as spe-
cified in the preceding answers) on the 
same single condition of an agreement 
on repatriation of POWs?

in terview 
Jr-1i 
By Wilfred Burehett 
' Guardian Stall Correspondent 
Paris 
President Nixon's advisor Henry Kissinger has visited 
Moscow, Peking and Paris in. search of�as Nixon always 
puts itr-a peaceful settlement to the war in South Vietnam 
and bearing "generous" offers of peace. 
'He has had 13 private sessions with the Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam's delegation in Paris, but he has 
never deigned to talk with those primarily'concerned with 
the struggle in the South�rePresented in Paris by Nguyen 
Thi Binh: Foreign Minister of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam and head of 
its delegation in Paris. 
There ar,e unclaubtedly elements of Male chauvinism in 
this, but it is primarily the arrogance of the super-power. 
psychology at the White House. An arrangement between 
"equals" with the other super-power, the Soviet Union 
could be tolerated. Next best would be a deal with People's 
'China�at least a major power. But it was too humiliating 
to talk even with. the DRV. 
Each of Nixon's negotiators in Paris, from Henry Cabot 
Lodge to William Porter, have exhausted the language of 
contempt to make this clear. As for the PRO, it was seen 
as far, beneath the contempt of the U.S. 
It was with this in mind and due to the deliberate 
distortions of the PRO's views by Nixon and Kissinger that 
I put some questions to Nguyen Thi Binh: � 
Are you prepared to meet with Kissinger or some other 
competent U.S. 'negotiator and within the framework of 
the PRG's 7-point peace plan discuss the following con-
crete points: 
(1) The question of the safe withdrawal of the remaining 
60,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam? 
(2) The question of the release of U.S. POWs in South 
Vietnam as well as the captured pilots held in the DRV? 
(3) Questions relating to President Nixon's concern 
about the "imposition of a Communist regime in Saigon?" 
(4) Assure that there will not be a "long night of terror" 
in South Vietnam as Nixon expressed it on May 8 or a 
;bloodbath" as he expressed it in his April 28 speech? 
Nguyen Thi Binh. answered with the following: 
"In order to deceive American and Niior Id public 
� opinion, Nixon persists in repeating his lies and slanders, 
trying to justify his new extremely grave acts of war. We 
have many. times declared and we repeat once again that 
as evidence of cur good will and our sincere desire to 
arrive at a peaceful solution to the problem of South 
Vietnam, we are ready to engage in private conversation 
with U.S. representatives so they may still better un-
derstand our peace proposals. We are ready to discuss alt 
matters concerning a solution. 
.The PRG proposals 
"It, seems to me that the American government' is 
presently well informed regarding ourApprove'd for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
continued. "However, I would like to clarify for American 
public opinion some of the points you have raised: 
"Regarding the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops in 
complete security. On Sept. 17, 1970, in .our 8-point peace 
plan, as on July1,1971 in our 7-point peace plan, we clearly 
rated that after the U.S.-fixes a definite date for the total 
vithdrawal of all U.S. military forces from South Vietnam, 
he parties concerned could agree- on necessary. measures 
.o guarantee the security of U.S. troops during their with-
Irawal. 
"Thus, if the, list of soldiers and pilots captured, killed 
Ind wounded gets continually longer this is precisely 
because Nixon has refused to fix a concrete date for total 
withdrawal, refuses to negotiate responsibility on the basis 
of our reasonable proposal and continues to utilize U.S.. 
troops and pilots in acts of war against our people. 
"Regarding the freeing of U.S. POWs. This problem has 
also been dealt with exhaustively in our peace initiative. If 
until this day captured U.S. military personnel have not 
been able to return to their homes and their number in-
creases all the time, this is also because Nixon refuses to 
fix a definite ..late for the total withdrawal of U.S. troops, 
refuses to discontinue his support for dictator Nguyen Van 
Thieu's clique and continues to wage -war against our, 
people. These captured military personriel are in fact 
prisoners of the policy of Wietnamization.' They are 
prisoners of Nixon and Thieu. If the U.S. had replied 
seriously to our, 7-point peace plan, the POWs would long 
ago have returned to their families. 
. "Regarding the political regime of South Vietnam. 
There. never has been a question for us of imposing on. 
South Vietnam any sort of regime whatsoever other than 
one chosen by the South Vietnamese people. Still less do 
we wish to impose a communist regime as the Nixon 
administration continues to maintain.' On the contrary, it is 
the U.S. that stubbornly continues to impose on the South 
Vietnamese people the pro-American, anti-communist, 
belligerant, dictatorial and fascist regime of Thieu. 
. _ 
Elections�with Thieu machinery 
Nixon's proposals about 'new presidential elections' in 
South Vietnam, while Thieu's machinery of dictatorship 
remains means nothing-other than a repetition of the one-
man electoral farce of October last year. The National 
Liberation Front and the PRG have consistently ad-

A delegation of American Communists arrived in Hanoi last month 
as American bombers roared overhead with their weapons of death and 
destruction. 
The delegation consisting of Gus Hall, general secretary of the 
Communist Party of the United "States and CP candidate for U.S. Pres-
ident; Jarvis Tyner, chairman of the Young Workers Liberation League 
and CP Vice Presidential candidate; Rasheed Storey, chairman of the 
- New York State CP; and Joseph North, author and editor of the Daily 
World Magazine, was in Hanoi as invited guests of the Vietnam Workers 
Party. 
Hurried into air raid shelters by their North Vietnamese hosts, 
the four Communists recorded their observations and issued, on April 
19, "An appeal to the conscience of the U.S. people." 
' "We have now seen the crushed bodies of little girls and the bodies 
of small boys ... the shattered hands of workers who will never again 
be able to provide for their families... (and) some who were blinded by 
� the flying debris," the appeal, printed in full in the April.20 Daily World 
said. 
Substantial portions of the appeal folloW: 
, . . . . 
We saw with our own eyes that the main targets of 
the U.S. bombers were the heavily populated working 
class centers of Hanoi and Haiphong. 
We saw the newly constructed working class apart-
ment houses in Haiphong that were destroyed by the 
criminal pilots sent by the arch criminals of the Nixon 
Administration. � 
We saw the hospital and spoke to the women and 
children whose blood was smeared on the steps as we 
entered. 
We saw the workers' quarters where the planes re-
turned three times to complete their destruction. 
< This is no accident. Civilian targets are the Main 
objective of the government. We saw market places 
bombed, restaurants bombed, factories bombed, water-
front warehouses bombed, vital water mains bombed. 
� 
We saw British, Soviet and German Democratic Re-
public ships attacked in the harbor. As we crossed a 
bridge entering Haiphong, crowded with families of mo-
thers, fathers and their children, a U.S. plane streaked 
above us and people scrambled for their lives. 
We saw the same in the beautiful capital of Hanoi 
where we experienced two waves of bombers. It was 
the same in peaceful country villages by the rice pad-
dies where we met a. farmer whose friends, a family 
of seven, had been killed in that morning's raid: 
We have now seen the crushed bodies of little girls 
who only 'moments before played peacefully with their 
dolls, and the bodies. of small boys whose friendly 
games of marbles were disrupted forever by the mas-
3ive tonnage of U.S. bombs. We saw the shattered hands 
)f workers who will never again be able to provide for

their families. We saw some who were blinded by the 
flying debris. 
In the name of our own children we appeal to all

and Laos. We appeal to your humanity, common sense 
and reason. ' 
. We know these murder. policies of aggression are 
dictated not by the will of the people, or even of the 
U.S. Congress, but by the giant monopoly corporations�
the Rockefeller, Morgan, I.T.T. interests, etc., who main-
tain and extend their riches through the destruction and 
suffering of the Vietnamese and other peoples of the 
world. ' � 
We must see, though, that we bear a responsibility 
as long as these acts of barbarism are perpetrated in 
our name. 
The bombings are the work of desperate tnen gone 
insane, Nixon, Kissinger, Agnew, these Dr. Strange-
.loves of Washingtm.

The victories of the Vietnamese National Liberation 
forces have created a totally new situation. They have 
virtually destroyed the best of the puppet troops. They 
have shattered once and for all Nixon's hoax of Vietnami-
zition. As the Pentagon-trained Thieu mercenaries turn 
their guns and tanks on U.S. puppet troops, the arrogant 
.predictions of General Creighton Abrams and Defense 
Secretary Melvin Laird go un in smoke. 
� But we in the United States have the main. respon-
sibility. In meeting this challenge we will be fulfilling 
our responsibility to ourselves and to all the people of

The "language of naked power": that is the "kind of

The words are those of Agriculture Secretary Earl

The words describe the regime that Nixon would 
impose on the world, the regime he would instal at home. 
Those words'-- the "language of naked power" � de-
scribe also the attempt to assassinate Governor George 
Wallace. 
They express the violence of Nixon and Spiro Agnew 
and the late J. Edgar Hoover. the violence which they 
repeatedly incited against the advocates of peace and 
democracy during the 1968 campaign. 
That violence is of a piece with the scarcely-cloaked 
charges of treason which the White House hoodlum bri-
gade has flung at those political leaders who do not support 
Nixon's new violence against Vietnam. 
It is the violence which the Pentagon and the mer-

The "language of naked power" is the language that. 
U.S. imperialism introduced into Indochina a quarter cen-

harshly since then. It is the language in which the death 
sentence on Ngo Diem was spoken during the Kennedy

It is the language of napalm and bombs and torture 
and defoliant chemicals and bacteriological agents and 
rigged elections and chain-store brothels and "tiger

wounded-100,000 of them perma-
nently incapacitated�or that today 
there would be 350,000 war orphans. 
These figures date back to 1961, 
when the American involvement that 
has cost us 55,000 lives began on a 
small but gradually increasing scale, 
with advisers and funds. By the time 
of the coup, there were 12,000 ad-
visers in Vietnam, but those who 
knew Diem best feel that neither he 
nor Nhu would ever have invited or 
allowed 550,000 American soldiers to 
fight in thefr country, and to permit 
the devastation caused by air at-
tacks, including bombing and defolia-
tion. There is evidence that shortly 
�before the coup took place�
and for several months after, 
ward�the first tentative ef-

the Saigon Government and 
the National Liberation Front 
to come to some sort of ac-
commodation. These- efforts 
might well have led to noth-

ones involving Hanoi and 
Washington as, well as the 
Front and Saigon have, and 
the war might have continued 
,anyway, although on a much 
smaller scale than came to be 
the case in the post-Diem era. 
If there had been a smaller 
war, or if a political- agree-
ment had been reached in the 
days before Hanoi completely 
dominated the N.L.F., South 
Vietnam might well have 
come under some form of 
Communist domination one 
way or another within two or 
three years. This remains a 
political possibility today, and 
if that happens, despite Viet-
namization and despite con-
tinued American air and other 
logistical support, it will be 
due primarily to the inability 
of the many governments that 
succeeded Diem's to create a 
�nation capable of withstand-

dedicated, and better-led Com-
munists. Still and all, looking

d"What fascinates me," former Viet-
Dam pacification. chief Robert W. 
Korner observed last week, "is that 
the war is ending with a conventional 
bang." . 
Komer'S feeling that the old Viet-
cong insurgency has been completely 
overtaken by the overt North Viet-
namese inv asion and President. 
Nixon's military moves against the 
North seems to be generally shared 
by a number of Americans who had 
most to do with shaping U.S. counter-, 
. insurgency doctrine and strategy in 
Vietnam over the past 20 years. � 
Among those interviewed . were 
Henry Cabot Lodge, Gen. Maxwell D. 
Taylor and Frederick E. Nailing, all 
former ambassadors to Saigon; Walt 
W. Restow, a chief foreign policy ad-
viser to Presidents John P. Kennedy 
and Lyndon 13. -Johnson; Maj. Gen. 
. Edward G. Lansdale, Ngo Dinh 
Diem's first American adviser; and 
Barry Zorthian, former U.S. infor-
mation chief in Saigon. 
As most of them see it, the war 
has now become a .straight old-fash-
ioned� military contest between two 
geographically distinct states in which 
the better army,, conventionally or-
ganized 'and equipped with tanks, 
rocks and heavy artillery., Will defeat 
the weaker one.. . 
Solar American tactical air power 
has failed to provide the necessary 
margin of assistance to the South 
Vietnamese, and the military effect�
iveness of the Northern sea blockade 
remains to be proven. Nor have 
those of the Southern Vietcong guer-
rillas.who survived the defeat of 1963 
as yet shown they can play anything 
but a supporting role. 
THE IMPORTANCE of so complete 
a transformation of the war, it is felt, 
is that Hanoi has destroyed its own 
propaganda. � 
It can no longer claim 'a victory 
will validate the doctrine of "people's 
revolutionary war." The importance 
to the North Vietnamese of still doing 
so is evidenced by the title and con-
tent of General Vo Nguyen Giap's 
recent essay setting down the ideol-
ogical basis for the current offensive, 
"People's War, People's Victory." 
In it, Giap predicts the war will end 
In a climactic military victory. The 
collapse of South Vetnam's 3rd di-
vision at Quang Tri, followed by 
smashing blows against Hue, Kontum 
and An Loc, may put that victory 
In his grasp.. .. _ 
�1 
But it will be done contrary to all 
North Vietnam's declared strategic 
doctrine, with its credos that the vic-
torious soldiers must be drawn 
from the supporting masses of people 
around them or native-born South 
Vietnamese. � 
Following the Chinese Communist 
model, North Vietnamese doctrine as 
declared by Giap and others has al-
ways held that the revolution must 
pass through three phases: first, the 
defensive, when the population is tak-
en in hand while leaving the enemy 
to control the main centers; second, 
offensive guerrilla warfare, which 
obliges the enemy to split up his 
forces while the organization of Com-
munist regular and local units is ac-
tively. continued on a battalion and 
regimental scale; finally, the third 
phase, Giap's climactic military vic-
tory, whose object is to crush the 
enemy's main forces in preparation 
for seizure of the cities. 
North Vietnam's major departure 
from this doctrine by sending its regu-
lar divisions into the South provided 
the argument for the original U.S. 
intervention in '1965. It also provoked 
bitter Chinese disapproval, since the 
more .conventional the .war became, 
the more Hanoi became dependent 
.on modern Russian arms and the less 
its victory would vindicate Mao Tsp.-
twig's revolutionary idea. 
Today, North Vietnam may be 
close to winning, but it has had to 
send almost its whole army into the 
South and by sending its army it has 
destroyed its own pretensions about 
the nature of the war.� 
IN THE VIEW of some of the 
Americans most deeply involved in 
Vietnam in the past, it is even pos-
sible this may have some effect on 
what happens next, especially should 
the North Vietnamese forces mount 
an offensive directly against Saigon, 
the provinces around it and the Me-
kong Delta. 
More than 70 percent of the 
country's population, mosiy native-
born Southerners with a distinctly 
different dialect and culture from the 
North, live in this rice-rich region. 
Regionalism among these Southern 
rice-growing peasants, it is felt, is as 
strong as Austrian resentment against 
the Prussians, or southerners against 
Yankees in the American civil war, 
and Hanoi cannot predict accurately 
how much they might resist .wholly 
Northern troops. 
T. 
s - 
AMONG THE AMERICAN old 
hands, Gen. Lansdale, who today 
lives in retirement in Alexandria. said 
he believed Hanoi could not collapse 
the government of President Nguyen 
Van Thieu without mounting an offen-
sive against the capital itself. 
"Hue's falling would be tremen-
diously traumatic," Landsdale said, 
"but that wouldn't be enough to topple 
the government. I think we'll see 
Saigon threatened. That will be the 
real climactic moment." 
Lansdale, who first went to Viet-
nam in 1953 and was Ngo Dinh Diem's 
American adviser in 1954-56 after help. 
ing Ramon Magsaysay defeat the 
Huk guerrillas in the Philippines, has 
ajways held the view that the growth 
of Communist power in Vietnam fed 
on peasant grievances. His recom- � 
mended counter-insurgency strategy 
was a mixture of charismatic leader-
' ship, land reform and agricultural 
modernization, restraint on military 
power � and restoration of traditional 
Confucian ethics. 
Today, Lansdale said, the overt 
North Vi e lira mese invasion has 
changed the nature of the ideological 
struggle, since victory now will only 
prove the Communists had a superior 
army not necessarily that they had a. 
superior political idea. 
In the American search for a � 
counterinsurgency doctrine to combat 
"people's war" over the years, one 
school of thought was to put primary 
emphasis on civil government. This 
was most closely associated with the 
British and such authorities as Sir 
Robert Thompson, who agreed that 
top priority must be put on establish-
ing law and order through a central 
government with a strong public pos-
ture of morality, decency and legality, 
a large, competent police force and 
an effective civil administration. 
An American who shared This view 
was former ambassador Notting, who 
resigned his post in August 1963 to 
protest the Kennedy administration's 
withdrawal of its support for Diem. 
Like all of those interviewed, Noll-
ing felt the lack of respected leader-
ship in Saigon was perhaps the most 
potentially fatal weakness in the pre-
sent situation. Lansdale said, "I 
think Thieu is trying but there's little 
charisma or respect there. Corrup-
tion's been such and so commonly 
known and his people have been in 
on the take so obviously, I doubt if 
he can rally the population as a war 
leader."

us, I insert these articles by Mr. Wasser-
Man intoThe REcom) at this time: 
AIR WAR SECRECY IS MOST FRIGHTENING 
(By BM Wasserman) . 
You can be frightened after a week in 
Southeast Asia that U.S. policy is not suc-
cessful. 
You can be even more frightened when you 
see that we are rigidly pursuing that same 
policy of failure, and perhaps widening it 
to include Thailand. 
But you can be most frightened by the ef-
fort of the U.S. government to conceal the 
whole business from the U.S. public, and even 
from a Congressman who votes the authori-
zation for all U.S. military programs. 
After three days of intensive briefings and 
tours of the five U.S. air bases in Thailand, 
Congressman Harrington learned from a 
newsman that several shifts in squadrons 
and aircraft Were shortly anticipated which 
would increase the fighter squadrons in the 
area. 
"That newsman's information is remark-
ably good," we were told by an Air Force 
officer. 
''Why wasn't I fold about itr asked Cong. 
Harrington. 
"You didn't ask," said the Air Force officer. 
At Udorn Air Base in Thailand, a civilian 
pilot staying in the civilian hotel where I 
was billeted told me very openly that all Air 
America helicopter 'flights oven Laos origi-
nated from Udorn Air Base. Air America is a 
contract airline paid by the American gov-
ernment, and presumed to he a CIA oper-
ation. 
When Congressman Harrington asked the 
base commander at Uclorn, "What is that 
squadron of helicopters over there?". pointing 
to the lined up aircraft. 
"I don't know, sir," said the base com-
mander. "Those are contract flights and I 
don't know anything about them." 
A press association reporter who has spent 
five years in Thailand and has consistently 
sought to report on American air bases there, 
as reporters freely do in Vietnam, said that 
he has been unable to obtain permission to 
go on the bases. "The U.S. officials say 'Ask 
the Thais.' The Thais say" 'Ask the U.S.' " 
Craig Whitney, chief of the N.Y. Times 
bureau; Peter Osnos, Washington Post; Kim 
Wifienson, United Press International; Don 
Sutherland, Christian Science Monitor�they 
have all tried and so far been refused per-
mission to report first hand on the 'U.S. air 
war being waged out of Thailand. 
Yet the U.S. has about 26,000 airmen in 
Thailand end its five bases account for about 
5 million dollars a day. We have invested 
billions of dollars in Thailand, and from 
these bases we are 'boinbing Laos, Cambodia, 
Vietnam, and now North Vietnam. We have 
nearly twice as many airmen in Thailand tls 
in Vietnam. It is a gigantic 'effort, but it is � 
Concealed from the U.S. public. 
One reason given for concealing the air-
war from the U.S. is "security' 
But momasans, Thai women, come on the 
U.S. bases in droves every day to do the house 
chores of the U.S. airmen. They clean the 
barracks. They wash airmen's clothes. With 
their children, and their washtubs, and their 
picnic lunches, they make a colorful sight 
squatting between the GI barracks at lunch 
hour. Along with Thai men who work on the 
base, they can easily be the cover for any 
hostile agent seeking general information 
about the airbase. To suggest that what they 
know as common knowledge cannot be avail-
able to the American public just doesn't 
make sense. 
SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHERE THE UNITED STATES j 
PR ',J PRACTICES A POLICY OF AMB -ELIEVE 
(By Bill Wisserman) 
(North Shore 'Weeklies' publisher Bill 
Wasserman traveled with Cong. Michael J. 
Harrington to Vietnam and Thailand for 10 
days from March 29 to April 8. In Vietnam 
they visited Saigon and DaNang. In Thai-
land, they were in Bangkok and Udorn, and 
Mr. Harrington visited four other air bases. 
Harrington spent his days being briefed on 
the military operations which he, as a mem-
ber of the Armed Services Committee, over-
seas. Wasserman interviewed airmen, civilians 
and newsmen.) 
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, tall, patri-
cian and gracious, leaned forward, his hands 
folded, and said, "You must look at the 
whole picture, not just the military. You 
must see the economic side too. The military, 
however, is now working." - 
That was less than three weeks ago. 
Ambassador Bunker had received me be-
fore Congressman Harrington's arrival in 
Saigon because he was leaving for a week's 
trip over Easter to visit his wife, the U.S. 
Ambassador to Nepal. 
It was a calm, sunny day in Saigon. We 
sat in comfortable chairs at one end of the 
Ambaslarge, air conoitloncci occ11/1,, 
the embassy. The Ambassador's youngest sonku)k 
x/3) 
had been my roommate in school for two 
years, and now, after catching up on family 
histories, he told Me about Vietnam. 
The. U.S. initially had failed, said Mr.  
Bunker, to appreciate the need to provide 
the wherewithal for the South Vietnamese. 
"It was a new experience for the U.S. to he 
involved in a civil war and a war from 
without at the same time." 
The Tet offensive In 1968, psychologically 
a blow to the U.S., had been the source of 
fresh determination by the Vietnamese, con-
tinued Bunker. They .saw the need to be bet-
ter armed, and, the A mbassadorobserved, the 
U.S. supplied M-16's. The ARVN (Army of the 
Itepublic of Vietnam) was modernized and 
expanded and now 'numbered 1.1 million. 
"fhe -Ambassador dwelt on the economic 
development in the south. "I drove recently 
with President Thieu through the country-
side. The farmers used to have bicycles. Now 
they have Hondas and tractors, radios and 
tv's, outboard motors for their sampans." 
He urged me to arrange an air trip for 
Cong. Harrington over the delta to see the 
prosperity and to see, also, to the north to-
wards An Loc�now the scene of desperate 
fighting�how air interdiction had not 
meant total destruction but selected destruc-
tion. 
What Bunker was clearly saying was that 
Vietnamization was working, that we should 
on this trip pay attention to the broad, civil-
ian achievements under President Thiem He 
mentioned land reform, specifically. 
As the interview drew to a close, tile erect 
septogenarian who had completed a success-
ful business career before joining the govern-
ment, noted that he had served five Presi-
dents. "Of course, I expected to stay here a 
much shorter time." 
He smiled and described how President 
Nixon had arranged for him to visit his wife 
In Nepal regularly. "But that was impossible. 
It was so busy here�seven days a week, 
It used to be. It's better now," and he made 
a little joke about how he had to make this 
particular trip because his wife surely would 
not permit him to be absent over Easter. 
Forty-eight hours later, the North Viet-
namese offensive was underway. And within 
those few hours, Quang 'Fri and Hue, major 
bastions irf the north, were threatened. . 
The American public at home was also calm 
as our trip to Vietnam took shape. One local 
newspaper even queried, "Why go?" Cong. 
Harrington, their editorial suggested, would 
do better to stay home and tend to his dis-
trict. Going to Vietnam now, they said, was 
a junket. 
In general it seemed the American public 
felt that the war was almost over. Caeualties 
lead almost disappeared�U.S. casualties, at 
least. Our troops were leaving. The air war? 
What was that? A distant war, Cong. Har-
rington said it needed seeing, it neediest ex-
posure. He suspected, but could not get firm 
figures that it was costing $10 to $20 billion 
dollars a year, and devastating three coun-
tries. 
A gentle breeze swayed the palm trees over 
the ornate Buddhist temple while saffron 
robed young men, monks in training, strolled 
by. This was Thailand, where the people, 
commented the Air Force captain escorting 
ine, were "very easy going and gentle," and 
where the U.S. now maintains its major 
Southeast Asian air bases. 
Down the dirt road in front of the pagoda 
walked a young couple hand in hand. He 
was obviously American in his khaki trousers 
and sport shirt. She was obviously Thai. 
"Who would that be?" I asked. 
"One of the guys from the base, and. his 
girl," was the reply. 
I was in Udorn, 30 miles from the Laotian 
border and the location of our largest fighter 
base in Thailand.

Jos,eph Buttinger 
IDne of the most puzzling questions future 
historians will have to deal with is why the 
United States ever got involved in the con-
temporary struggle for Indochina that has 
been going on since 1945. Did the consid-
erations that determined the course of 
American foreign policy after World War II 
' make this involvement inevitable or could 
it have been avoided in spite of the tensions 
that arose after 1945 between the West and 
.the so-called Communist bloc? On this point, 
opinions will probably always remain di-
vided, but those who believe that no other 
course could have been chosen without dam-
age to the West or the United States would 
do well, to consider the following: 
(1) no Indochina war would have taken 
:place if France had not insisted on reestab-
)l.ishing its control over Vietnam, Cambodia, 
and Laos after these countries had gained in-
dependence following the Japanese surrender 
in 1945; 
(2) it is questionable that the United 
� State S would ever have reached the point of 
even considering intervention in Vietnamese 
�� affairs. if it had refused from the beginning 
to support the reestablishment of French rule 
in Indochina. 
� It is indeed one of the important conclu-
sions of the Pentagon Papers "that the Tru-
man Administration's decision to give mili-
tary aid to France in her colonial war against 
the Communist-led Vietminh 'directly in-
� volved' the United States in Vietnam and 
'set' the course of American policy."' 
Yet this deci4on was made only in 1950, 
after the victory of Communism in China 
and the recognition of Ho Chi Mirth's regime 
by the Soviet Union and Communist China. 
It would never have come about had it not 
been preceded by the decision made by the 
� victorious Allies at the Potsdam Conference 
of July 17 to August 2, 1945, which gave 
0 the French not only a free hand but also 
Allied support for the reconquest of � Indo-
china. This Potsdam decision, supported only 
� by the British under both Churchill and At-
tlee, might not have been taken if President 
Ca. Q.rq11,1 
Roosevelt had still been alive. It was op-
posed by Nationalist China under Chiang 
Kai-shek and certainly not favored by Stalin. 
Vigorous American .opposition to it would 
probably have led to the acceptance of 
Roosevelt's concept of a United Nations 
Trusteeship for French Indochina as a first 
step toward full independence. 
Surprisingly on this crucial point the con-
clusion of the Pentagon Papers is that Roose-
velt "never made up his mind whether to 
support the French desire to reclaim their 
� Indochinese colonies from the Japanese at 
the end of the war." 2 In view of the forceful 
statements Roosevelt made against the re-
turn of the French to Indochina to his Secre-
tary of State Cordell Hull and to his 'son 
Elliot, as reported in their memoirs,8 this . 
conclusion must be regarded as erroneous. 
There has been much speculation about 
the question whether American massive mili-
tary intervention in Vietnam might not have 
bean avoided if President Kennedy had been 
alive. It is .unlikely that this question will � 
ever be answered with any degree of cer-
tainty. But it is probable' that Vietnam after - 
1945 would have experienced a period of 
peaceful evolution toward independence, un-
der a regime not unlike that of Tito's Yugo-
slavia, if Roosevelt had lived and succeeded 
in imposing his anticolonial solution for In- . 
dochina. Nor is it far-fetched to assume that 
Roosevelt would not have disregarded the 
appeals of Ho Chi Minh, in at least eight 
letters to Washington in 1945-46 for United 
States and United Nations intervention 
against French colonialism.4 "There is no 
record . . . that any of these appeals were 
answered." 5 Not until publication of the 
Pentagon Papers did the American public 
hear of the existence of these letters. 
Yet the Truman administration's policy 
toward Vietnam remained ambivalent for at 
least the first three years of the Indochina 
war. On the one hand, the -U.S. "fully rec-
ognized France's sovereign position," as Sec-
retary of State George Marshall said in a still 
secret State Department cablegram sent to 
the U.S. Embassy in Paris; on the other hand, ,

I had thought that there was no 
longer any need to set forth the na-
ture and� causes of American failure 
in Vietnam or the case for complete 
� withdrawal, but the renewed bomb-
ing attacks on Hanoi and Haiphong 
demonstrate that there are still those 
� who have the delusion that it will be 
possible to sustain a viable non-com-
munist government in the South. 
The notions of "Vietnamization" 
and an "honorable negotiated settle-
ment" in Paris implied the delusion, 
but one could question how seriously 
, they should be taken. When, how-
ever, we renew massive bombing 
� . raids with their indiscriminate 
� slaughter, it seems clear that Presi-
dent Nixon and his top advisers either� 
think that the South can survive as 
an independent entity, Or they are 
� committed to postponing its collapse 
until after the election. If it is the 
former, they are fools: if the latter, 
the most callous sort of political op-
portunists. 
As a member of the infamous 
Michigan State University project in 
. Vietnam from 1955-1957, I partici-
� pated in that attempt to create an 
� anti-communist regime in the South� . 
By 1957 it was already clear that the 
�Diem government was moving 
towards , a police state to offset its 
declining popularity, and that the 
massive presence of the US was un-
� dermining Diem's legitimacy and en-
couraging his authoritarian tenden-
cies., That was 15 years, 5 govern-
ments and how many dead and 
maimed Vietnamese ago? Everything 
we have done over the past 15 years 
has .contributed to destroying the in-
tegrity, the rationality and the will 
of the people in South Vietnam while 
building up the commitment to na-
.. 
tional. reunification in the North. We 
have trained a few people at the top 
of the South how to con us into great 
concern over the consequences of 
their defeat and therefore con-
tinuing support of their survival. Our 
leaders for 15 years have operated 
out of fear of being held responsible 
for � a debacle (e.g. "who lo 
China"), and the false hope that the 
could create a regime that could stir� 
. vive., � 
. 
continue' 
The The con artists in South Vietnam 
are not all venal. Some are; but. 
many are just trying to exist in a 
terribly confused setting. What 
would happen to them if the North 
:Vietnamese take over? The more 
corrupt, who have already made their 
fortunes, would probably flee, and 
wisely so. The rest would stay and 
try to make their peace with the new 
regime. I am sure that some of them 
would be killed and some impris-
oned, but probably not many. There 
was no mass slaughter in the North 
in 1955 and 1956. Most Vietnamese 
with strong feelings about political 
freedom have already left the coun-
try and those who remain have 
learned how to compromise. 
We have no right or reason to 
continue, much less to expand a com-
pletely corrupt and corrupting war 
either to save a few of our "friends" 
or to postpone an inevitable failure. 
We should recognize that there is ab-
solutely-no hope for an independent, 
anti-communist regime in the South. 
Given that fact, the only way we can 
help the Vietnamese people is to get 
�out of the country completely � mil-
itary, aid, X,,J,406.,the whole works. �j 
- � ._ 
and let the Vietnamese Work. out 
their own accommodations and solu-
tions. , 
The US Government, by its recent 
actions has demonstrated that it nei-
ther accepts these propositions nor is 
it following a consistent policy of 
withdrawal. So long as this is true 
,and the government remains unre-
sponsive to the normal expressions of 
public opinion, there must be mass 
demonstrations as the only way of 
showing the degree of dissatisfaction 
with current policies. If such demon-
strations can be kept non-violent and 
non-destruetive they can help to 
build popular support for stopping 
the war. It is unfortunate that uni-
versity buildings and research facili-
ties become the lightning rods for 
absorbing the frustrations over tragic 
government policies. A more fruitful 
line of action is to assure that the 
person elected President next No-
vember is unalterably committed to 
stopping our involvement in the war.

Washington Merry.Go-Round 
Navy F 
By Jack Anderson 
� , 
The sewage that ships dump 
into the open sea often washes 
up on the shore. 
� President Nixon, for one, 
has had personal experience 
'with this problem at his Flor-
ida beach house where mari-
time wastes have fouled his 
swimming area. 
s To fight beach and harbor 
'pollution, he assigned the 
Navy aa the "lead agency" to 
set an example of maritime 
sanitation to the world's ships. 
; A .1978 deadline 'was set for 
the Navy to stop the discharge 
'of sewage; garbage, oil and 
other debris into the sea. 
Locked in the Navy's confiden-
tial files, however, is sad evi-
dence that this billion-dollar 
program is failing. 
' The Navy had counted heav-
ily upon a complicated sewage 
'system manufactured by Fair-
banks-Morse. But Rear Admi-
ral Nathan Sonenshein, the 
ships commander, has com-
plained in a "Point Paper" to 
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the 
Navy chief, that the new sew-
age equipment is "unreliable" 
and "not operating" in the test 
ship U.S. Conopus. 
Indeed, the failure of the 
sewage disposal units could 
cause a smelly incident at 
lioly Loch, Scotland, where 
the Canopus has been berthed. 
� Navy Odor 
"In the interests of con-
genial relations with the tilt-
. 
ule Up in Sew 
ish," Sonenshein warned the 
Navy's top admiral, "it is vital 
that these units be put back 
into operation as early as fea-
sible." 
On top of the "unacceptable 
reliability" of the new sewage 
units, they also take up too 
much room. This will have 
"significant impact on military 
performance . . . in the 
smaller, high population dens-
ity ships," warn's the docu-
ments. Old sea dogs are also 
sputtering over a plan to pull 
out guns to make room for 
sewage units on some destroy-
ers. 
All the trouble with the 
Fairbanks-Morse equipment 
has forced the Navy to fall 
back, at least temporarily, 
upon a system of "holding 
tanks." The tanks are sup-
posed to retain all sewage 
while the ships are within 50 
miles of the shore. Then, in 
theory, the sewage is supposed 
to be dumped at the pier when 
the ships dock. 
But-- unfortunately, most 
piers aren't equipped to han-
dle the sewage or, for that 
matter, the bigger naval ves-
sels. To get around this, the 
Navy plans to spend millions 
to build special ."lighter! 
barges for each 'naval port." 
The Navy's sea-sewage ex-
perts explain delicately that 
the lighters will "collect and 
transfer shipboard wastes" 
to shore. But the shipboard 
salts, less delicately, are al-
ready referring to the lighters 
as "honey barges" and "dough-
nuts." 
Summing up, the Navy docu-
ments concede that, on the 
one hand, their sewage units 
are a flop and, on the other, 
there are persistent "political 
pressures to demonstrate ac-
complishments." 
Refugee Deaths 
We reported on February 6 
that U.S. officials in Vietnam 
had covered up rampant mal-
nutrition, exposure, tuberculo-
sis and pneumonia in three 
refugee camps. 
As a� result, 350 displaced 
Montagnard tribesmen, mostly 
the old and the young, per-
ished while U.S. officials. shuf-
fled papers. 
When word of the refugee 
conditions reached the head-
quarters of U.S. pacification 
chief William Colby. the fact 
were swePt under the plush 
rugs of the U.S. offices in Sai-
gon. 
The number of deaths, ironi-
cally, were close to, casualty 
totals in the infamous Mylai 
massacre. Yet only Rep. Les 
A spin (D-Wis.) showed any 
concern. 
In an outraged letter to AID 
Adminsistrator John Hannah, 
the congressman demanded to 
know what had been done to 
punish those "directly respon-
tsposal' 
sible for the tragic deaths of 
350 innocent people." 
A few days ago, Hannah 
sent back an evasive, self-serv-
ing memo prepared by ails 
Vietnam specialist Robert II. 
Nooter. The memo reports 
that the Montagnards were 
transferred from their homes 
to the camps about January, 
1971, by Vietnamese military. 
commanders over the objec-
tions of American pacification 
Officials. 
"Montagnarcls exist at a 
marginal subsistence level, 
and with any loss in nutri-
tional level, the prevalent 
diseases of diarrhea, malaria, 
pneumonia, and tuberculosis 
can prevail," explains the 
memo. 
The deaths began to occur 
shortly after the relocation, 
the memo adds. "Some 330 of 
the very old and very young" 
had died by the time higher 
American officials discovered 
the problem, it is contended. 
Once discovered, "prompt 
and remedial actions were 
taken," the memo claims. The' 
AID officials admit, however, 
that it was April before "the 
situation was in hand." 
The officials tried to pass 
the buck to military authori-
ties for hushing up the facts. 
Any suppression of reports, 
declares the memo, "would in-
volve reporting by militarY.

don't think we've had a successful paramilitary 
operation yet." 
The clandestine operations are worth review:

so far various presidents have kept a measure 
of control over such activities. That is no guar-

gress, not the President, that is supposed to

tivities to a small and highly professional group, 
and eliminating the covert actions entirely. 
Intelligence simply cannot work well when

Special to the Daily World 
HANOI, April 19�A delegation of four 
U.S. Communists here who witnessed U.S. 
air raids upon Hanoi and Haiphong today is-
sued an "appeal to the conscience of the peo-
ple of the United States" to force the Nixon 
Administration to end the "mass murder" 
bombing. 
The appeal was signed by Gus Hall, gene-
ral secretary and Presidential candidate; Jar-
vis Tyner, Vice Presidential candidate; Ras-
heed Storey, N.Y. State Communist Party 
chairman, and Joseph North, author and edi-
tor, World Magazine. 
� The text of the appeal follows: 
We who have now experienced the brutal 
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong make this ap-
peal to the conscience of the people of the 
United States. 
reirnr, 
We saw with our own eyes that the main targets of 
the U.S. bombers were the heavily populated working 
class centers of Hanoi and Haiphong. 
We saw the newly constructed working class apart-
ment houses in Haiphong that were destroyed by the 
criminal pilots sent by the arch criminals of the Nixon 
Administration. 
We saw the hospital and spoke to ,the women and 
children whose blood was smeared on the steps as we 
entered. 
We saw the workers' quarters where the planes re-
turned three times to complete their destruction. 
- This is no accident. Civilian targets are the main 
objective of the government. We saw market places 
bombed, restaurants bombed, factories bombed, � water-
front warehouses bombed, vital water mains bombed. 
We saw British, Soviet and German Democratic Re-
public ships attacked in the harbor. As we crossed a 
bridge entering Haiphong, crowded with families of mo-
thers,- fathers and their children, a U.S. plane streaked 
above us and people scrambled for their lives. 
We saw the same in the beautiful capital of Hanoi 
where we experienced two, waves of bombers. It was 
the same in peaceful country villages by the rice pad-
dies where we met a farmer whose friends, a family 
of seven, had been killed in that morning's raid. 
We have now seen the crushed bodies of little girls 
who only moments before played peacefully with their 
dolls, and the bodies of small boys whose friendly 
games of marbles were disrupted forever by the mas-
sive tonnage of U.S. bombs. We saw the shattered hands 
of workers who will never again be able to provide for 
their families. We saw some who were blinded by the 
flying debris. 
In the name of our own children we appeal to all 
Americans to save the children of Vietnam, Cambodia 
and Laos. We appeal to your humanity, common sense 
and reason. 
rr, et* �zi rn 
Li i;a44.4 i=1 Li 
. . . 
We who have seen the iron will, the unprecedented 
courage, the unbreakable determination, the united, un-
flinching commitment of the Vietnamese people in their 
struggle for national salvation against U.S. imperialism 
appeal to all Americans who value human life and dig-
nity. 
We appeal to you to see the Vietnamese love of life 
as your own, to see the Vietnamese people's struggle for 
social progress as your own, to act now to save human-
ity from disaster. 
Those who thought that the withdrawal of troops was 
intended to end the aggression in Indochina now see 
that it was Nixon's camouflaged way of escalating the 
war via criminal air power�the new IVIylais of the B-
52's�that are designed to undertake an impossible task 
to break the unshatterable will and determination of the 
Vietnamese people. 
This is why the targets are heavily populated cen-
ters and not the so-called military objectives. This we 
saw with our own eyes�the genocidal policies of the 
Nixon Administration. Now that we know this, we must 
act now or accept the verdict of humanity of complicity 
by complacency in mass murder, in genocide. 
As long as the aggression continues we cannot, as 
Americans, escape the stigma of what is a national 
shame. As long as the bombing goes on. we can never 
wash off the" blood of the millions of victims of U.S. 
imperialist aggressors. 
We know these murder policies of aggression are 
dictated not by the will of the people, or even of the 
U.S. Congress, but by the giant monopoly corporations�
the Rockefeller, Morgan, I.T.T. interests, etc., who main-
tain and extend their riches through the destruction and 
suffering of the Vietnamese and- other peoples of the 
world. 
We must see, though, that we bear a responsibility 
as long as these acts of barbarism are perpetrated in 
our name. 
The bombings are the work of desperate men gone 
insane, Nixon, Kissinger, Agnew, these Dr. Strange-
loves of Washington. 
The victories of the Vietnamese National Liberation 
forces have created a totally new situation. They have 
virtually destroyed the best of the puppet troops. They 
have shattered once and for all Nixon's hoax of Vietnami-
zation. As the Pentagon-trained Thieu mercenaries turn 
their guns and tanks on U.S. puppet troops, the artogant 
predictions of General Creighton Abrams and Defense

Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
Secretary Melvin Laird go up in smoke. 
The retaliation bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong has 
smdshed to smithereens Nixon's phony �'peace for gene-
rations" fraud. This insane act destroyed the illusion 
that Nixon's troop withdrawals were ever intended to 
lead to the end of the aggression in Indochina. 
This is a moment of great danger. NixOn's irrespon-
sible acts of desperation are those of a mad butcher and 
can lead to a .world confrontation. But above all else. 
the very acts of desperation have opened up momentous 
possibilities of putting an end to the aggression now. 
The escalation of the bombing has set into motion 
an escalation of the world's struggle against U.S. im-
perialism. It has created a new stage in that struggle. 
It will let loose the greatest waves of anti-imperialist 
movements to date. 
But we in the United States have the main respon-
sibility. In meeting this challenge we will be fulfilling 
our responsibility to ourselves and to all the people of 
the world. 
We appeal to all Americans: to every shop worker, 
to all members of the trade union movement, to all 
peace and democratic-minded Americans. to all Black 
Americans. .to all Chicano, Puerto Rican. Indian and 
Asian Americans, to the youth, to the students, to the 
women, to the veterans, to the unemployed, to the in-
tellectuals. to all who feel the impact of the war in a 
thousand different ways�on our living standards, on our 
.taxes; on the decline of our cities, on the escalation of 
racism, and the destruction of democratic rights. � 
We appeal to all whose sheer humanity is violated 
by this war. 
This moment in history cries out for unity in action! 
This is a moment when we must unite and concentrate 
our total efforts to end this criminal war, to end this 
mass murder, to end this imperialist aggression. ' 
An absolute precondition for the right of the Vietna-
mese .people to determine their destiny is the total 
withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Indochina. 
These actions must continue on every level and in all 
localities. These actions must be intensified in depth 
and scope, until the U.S. Government returns to the 
Paris negotiations in good faith, until it accepts the just 
seven-point program of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Government of South Vietnam. 
These actions must continue until the U.S. govern-
ment sets the date for the withdrawal of all forces from 
Southeast Asia�the ground troops, the U.S. Navy, the 
U.S. Airforce, the C.I.A. and all supportive personnel! 
There have been many important actions in the U.S. 
on behalf of peace since this war began. The moment 
cries out now for the greatest united actions of us all�
to achieve the end of this war on behalf of our people 
and the peoples of Vietnam and all Indochina, on behalf 
of human progress, on behalf of our children and all 
children of the world. 
We make this appeal from the air-raid shelters of 
Hanoi. 
Signed, Gus-Hall, Jarvis Tyner, Rasheed Storey, Jo-
seph North.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD � SENAT 
(b)(3) 
0 041.)1 
Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield for a minute? I use 
the time of the Senator from Arkansas 
for this purpose. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. I am glad to ,yield 
to my friend from California. 
Mr. CRANSTON. I thank the dis-
tinguished' Senator for a very forceful 
and effective presentation. I think it is a 
particularly significant contribution to 
this discussion because of the Senator's 
background in military matters in the 
executive branch with high responsi-
bilities. His service now on all key com-
mittees in the Senate also provides him 
with the opportunity to be better in-
formed than almost all Members of this 
body on military and foreign relations 
matters. � 
I would like to make an observation 
� and then to ask a question. I have noted 
this morning that in some of the debate 
we see what almost amounts to a "win 
the war" attitude again rearing its head 
in this Chamber. The distinguished 
Senator from Arizona (Mr. GOLDWATER), 
whose forthrightness and frankness I 
respect tremendously, stated he feels this 
is perhaps the worst managed war in 
history. He said that when you go into 
a war you go in to win., not in 10 years, 
but in 10 minutes. I wonder what that 
means. The Senator from Colorado 
spoke of the other side as a "losing 
horse." . 
The Senator from Missouri, and every 
other Senator, and every citizen in the 
country, know that we could�at least 
In a tiarrow military sense�if we went 
all out. The reason we have not done 
that under a Democratic President, Lyn-
don Johnson, and under a Republican 
President, Richard Nixon, is that we 
know we do not just face small North 
Vietriam with its limited population and 
hmited resources; we face North Viet- � 
.nam backed up by the Soviet Union and 
China. If we choose to escalate our aid 
to the South, they may very well feel 
that they must escalate their aid to the 
North. 
I wish to ask the Senator this ques-
tion in light of the circumstances now 
prevailing. Greater risks are being taken 
now than at any time in this war in 
terms of the escalation and possible re-
ciprocal moves by the other side: Where 
can this end? What risks do we face if 
we decide once again not to lose, not to 
negotiate, but to break the backs of the 
other side? What are the risks in that 
policy? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I yield 
myself 2 minutes under the same con-
ditions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is recognized. 
Mr. SYMINGTON. I would say to the 
able Senator that, regardless of what 
the risks were, I would take them if I 
felt they were in the interest of the se-
curity of the United States. 
When I first went to Vietnam, back in 
1961, with Gen. Maxwell Taylor and Mr. 
Walt Rostow, I felt this war was neces-
sary. After further examination over the 
years, however, I changed my mind, and 
so told ray colleagues in the Senate in 
the fall of 1967. _ 
It is interesting to note in General 
Taylor's recent book, "Swords and Plow-
shares," that he makes a statement 
which supports what I am told the dis-
tinguished Senator from Arizona said 
this morning on this floor. General Tay-
lor's statement best illustrates how badly 
this war has been managed from a mili-
tary standpoint by those who made the 
decisions. 
He said that no one, not even the 
President, has the moral right to send 
a man into combat without giving him 
the best chance to do the job he is as-
signed, with least danger to his life. His 
exact quote reads as follows: 
Our pilots were required to return through 
increasingly heavy enemy defenses to repeat 
attacks on targets deliberately hit previous-
ly by aircraft insufficient in number to as-
sure their destruction in a single attack. This 
was a misguided attempt to translate the 
principle of gradualism and limited violence 
from the strategic to the tactical realm�a 
fallacy which ignored the fact that for the 
soldier or pilot in the presence of an armed 
enemy any war is total since his survival 
is at stake. No one, not even the President, 
has the moral right to put a man on the 
battlefield or in hostile air space and re-
strict him from taking all the measures need-
ed for his survival and the execution of his 
mission. So in a variety of Ways, gradualism 
contributed to a prolongation of the war 
and gave time not only for more men to lose 
their lives but also for the national patience 
to wear thin, the antiwar movement to gain 
momentum, and hostile propaganda to make 
inroads at home and abroad. 
Military men constantly protested to 
me that they were being forced to attack 
useless targets. One who did was shortly 
killed; another, even though a major 
general, quietly resigned in protest. This 
all helped me to change my view about 
this war. 
It is now clear said war is being 
escalated as a result of the President's 
decision to continue it even though in 
his campaign�and I have now placed it 
all .in the REcoaa�often he said,' "If 
elected, I will stop it." He has had nearly 
three and a half years, but instead of 
stopping it, he has expanded it. There 
is now fighting in Cambodia where there 
was not fighting until he came to office. 
He has maintained the struggle in Laos, 
even though he switched it from being 
run by the Defense Department, if they 
ever ran it, to the Central Intelligence 
Agency, and now he is further escalating 
the war in Vietnam. 
One. of the ironies of what is going on 
brings us back to what I said in 1956, 
namely, that our policies are to be weak 
against the strong and strong against 
the weak. The recent visit to China and 
the planned visit to Moscow would ap-
pear incredible efforts to demonstrate 
our peace loving intentions at the same 
time we continue to destroy these little 
countries in Southeast Asia. 
Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, if the 
Senator would remain on his feet, I wish 
to say I regret that, under the time re-
straints, I was unable to yield to Senators 
who have asked for time. We have had 
difficulty when. they have asked us to 
yield because of the time limitation. I 
would like to ask if Senators who have 
contrary views would like to address 
questions to the Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, we have 
Senators who would like to get the floor 
In their own right. . 
Mr. CRANSTON. As the Senator 
knows, they will get the floor in their 
own right. 
Mr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I will 
begin by making reference to the Senator 
from Missouri's statement about the dev-
astations which have been visited--
Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, 
on whose time is the Senator speaking? 
Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, is there 
time to Senators on this side? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CHILES). Yes.  - 
Mr. GRIF.O'IN. Mr. President, I have 
been authorized by the Senator from 
Illinois (Mr. PERCY) to yield to the Sen-
ator from New York (Mr� BUCKLEY) such 
time as he may need. 
Mr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I will 
start by commenting on the statement by 
the Senator from Missouri about the 
devastation visited on Vietnam. 
The history of the Vietnam war has 
been one of complexities and confusion, 
a history on which men of good will have 
differed and shall continue to differ. 
Yet with the redent massive invasion 
by North Vietnam of South Vietnam, a 
new phase of this war has been created. 
The facts are unambiguous; one sov-
ereign nation has invaded another with 
conventional forces for no other purpose 
but the traditional one of all invading 
forces: to conquer the people and the 
territory of the invaded nation. 
This savage and sudden end to cer-
tain fashionable myths which have 
hitherto masked the role of North Viet-
nam in this war has had certain salu-
tary effects on world opinion. With the 
exception of North Vietnam's ideological 
allies; no nation has supported this at-
tempt at conquest. The idea that what we 
are witnessing is a Civil war has become 
a linguistic as well. as historical absurd-
ity. 
While it would be worthwhile to ex-
amine in great detail those curious at-
tempts we have heard during the past 
few weeks to switch the burden of blame 
for these latest developments from the 
North Vietnamese invaders to President 
Nixon whose decisive action has helped 
to halt the invasion, because of the brief 
time allowed me I will limit myself to 
an examination of some of the basic facts 
of the matter. 
First, the facts of the invasion along 
the DMZ and of the bombing of the 
military targets in the Hanoi-Haiphong 
area: 
The northern sector of South Vietnam 
has been invaded by a force of 45,000 to 
50,000 seasoned NVA troops equipped 
with modern Soviet and Chinese Com-
munist artillery and armor including 
three varieties of conventional and am-
phibious tanks. 
With the exception of minor Vietcong 
units operating along the Cambodian 
border north of Saigon, the entire Com-
munist effort within South Vietnam is 
being conducted by the North Vietnam-
ese. Not less than nine NVA divisions 
are now employed in South Vietnam, sus-
tamed by huge quantities of weapons and 
trucks and fuel provided 85 percent by 
the Soviet Union. . � 
The fact that the NVA is now employ-

18 APR- 1972 
Stop the mad bomber! 
President Nixon's order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong 
has opened the door to an international crisis, and involves 
a challenge to our Constitutional structure. Democracy 
and world peace are imperilled. 
The message is� unmistakable. North Vietnam has 
been under U.S. bomber attack for the first time since 1968, 
now for the 12th day. Four Soviet merchant ships and one 
from the German Democratic Republic have been hit in 
Haiphong harbor. Another squadron of F-4 Phantom jets 
has been deployed to Vietnam, this one from South Korea. 
The Soviet Union has stated clearly that it will continue to 
support, as it has, the liberation struggle of the people of 
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against imperialist 
aggression. - - 
These developments reflect an unprecedented aggra-
vation of U.S. aggression abroad. The implications for 
democracy at home are inescapable, for imperialist ag-� 
� gression abroad and fascistic steps at home complement 
each other. 
The situation demands a people's response of unpre-
cedented proportions, for'peace and democracy. 
The demonstrations scheduled for New York, San 
Francisco and other cities Saturday, April 22, should be ex-
panded far beyond their original scope in auspices and par-
ticipation. They should become outpourings of hundreds of 
thousands united in the determination to turn Nixon from 
his mad course. - 
But the situation created by the bombing of Hanoi and 
Haiphong demands even wider action. The hour demands 
demonstrative action of all peace forces; in Seattle and At-
lanta, in Chicago and Houston, in Albuquerque and Boston, 
in Cleveland and Minneapolis, in every city and town. 
Nixon has put world peace in peril; he is prepared to 
bomb U.S. democracy as he is bombing Hanoi. If confirma-
tion were needed of the world menace that Nixon's course 
represents, it was provided by Defense Secretary Melvin 
Laird's declaration that the Nixon Administration is plan-
ning to expand the U.S. s:-.ockpile of tactical nuclear wea-
pons in Europe, already in excess of 7,00. 
The aggravated peril to peace, the desperate need to 
mobilize the majority of the American people for action 
against the war demands the maximum of unity for peace 
and democracy. In the face of this peril, the provocation of 
disunity � however "revolutionary" the gabble that may 
aceempany it -- is the side of the bombers, not of the 
people: The certain fact that the Central Intelligence Agen-

4ontinued

cy is determined to provoke such disunity as part of Nix-
on's more-war program, should alert everyone to the need 
for the utmost discipline. 
The President's order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong 
represents another step toward Presidential dictatorship, 
for further aggression abroad and at home. 
The funds that should be used to sustain our public 
schools and hospitals, for example, are being used to de-
stroy the women and children, the schools and hospitals of 
North Vietnam. 
Every public official, in executive or legislative post, 
must be faced with the people's demand to speak out 
against this incitement of a greater war, this ruthless mis-
use of the nation's wealth in devastating Vietnam, the new 
steps toward dictatorial White House rule. 
Eery public official should be required to answer: 
What are you doing to block the road to a bigger war? 
The resolution on which the Gary, Indiana, City Coun-
cil is scheduled to act tonight deserves emulation in every. 
city. It calls upon Congress to "demand an immediate end 
to the bombing of North Vietnam, and an immediate end 
to American air anti other logistic support for carrying on 
the war in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos," and it 
demands that the White House set a "definite date for... 
complete withdrawal" from Southeast Asia. 
' Such demands should be introduced into every muni-
cipal and state legislative body, to save the peace and our 
democracy. Mass demonstrations for peace this Saturday 
will strengthen the prospects for people's victory -- here 
and abroad'. '

:well a Taylor sees the murder of for-
mer South Vietnamese President Ngo 
Dinh Diem and his brother, Ngo Dinh � 
Nhu, as a monstrous blunder in the 
:Vietnam War, bringing about political 
:c on f usi on that vastly prolonged the 
Struggle. 
Though one might answer such a theo-
ry in the words of the French diplomat 
who said that it is an idle exercise in 
history to spedulate on what might have 
_ happened had that which happened not 
happened, the Taylor opinion stays no 
less weighty in the aftermath of the mil-
� itary coup and the killings. Taylor be-
came ambassador to Saigon and had to 
'cope with the consequent chaos. 
As he cOrrectly puts it, the inexcusa-
ble mistake of all who cons pi r e�ci to 
� ;.0 v or throw Diem was that they had 
� ;planned nothing better to replace him. 
' The passions and attitudes of that 
summer nine years ago almost inevita-
bly generated a violent climax. Diem 
was under heavy fire. He was being vi-
ciously assailed by the American press 
in Saigon, who waged their vendetta be-
:cause Diem scorned them and they 
were. being starved of news: - 
' Publici opinion in the United States, 
;seeing Diem as a lesser evil, vented its 
.rage against Nhu because of his oppresL. 
sion of the Buddhists led by Tri Quang, 
:who was just another Vietnamese rack-
eteer in a saffron robe. The self-immo-
. lation� of several Buddhist monks in pro-
test against Nhu's measures also served 
to fire American emotion. Though Tay-
� lor indicates that Tri Quang had con-
'Arived these sacrifices to topple Diem, 
'Madame Nhu, already an object of par-
ticular loathing to the American press, 
:intensified the get-Diem movement by 
ficial statements came out of Washing-
ton that seemed clearly to signal that 
the U.S. government would welcome the 
ruination of Diem. 
Gen. Taylor's freshly minted memoir 
lifts the lid on that subject more than a 
little. On Aug. 24, when he was chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there 
came to his desk a U.S. State Depart-
ment action paper already cleared and 
cabled to the embassy in Saigon. What 
he read alarmed Taylor as it did other 
defense principals. - 
The authors of the already cabled in-
struction were Undersecretary of State 
W. Averell Harriman, Assistant Secre-
tary of State Roger Hilsm an and a 
White House staffer, Michael Forrestal. 
They had cleared their paper with Un-
dersecretary of State George Ball while 
he was playing golf and with the late 
President Kennedy via telephone, which 
signifies mainly that the clearers gave 
only passing attention to a major and 
convulsive change in American policy. 
Significantly, the paper had not been 
cleared with Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, who was not anti-Diem, or the 
Central Intelliaence Agency or the De-
partment of Detenn5: 
The sense of the paper sent to the new. 
ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, was 
that the United States would no longer 
tolerate the presence of brother Nhu in 
the Saigon government. Diem, however, 
'must be given a chance to get rid of 
Nhu. At the same time, Lodge was to in-
form key South Vietnamese generals 
about this change in the U.S. position.. 
Not only that, but if at any point the 
generals decided to get rid of President 
Diem, they were told the United States 
would directly support their action. 
So what was in essence this instruc-
tion to the ambassador? Only a twisted 
mind would see it other .than as a li-
cense for the South Vietnamese military 
. I 
(b)(3) 
, . . 
to form a cabal to gun down Diem and 
Nhu with the approval of the United, 
States. 
� Inside official U.S. circles there *as : 
no protest against the course so definite-
ly set forth. Some of those directly con-
cerned such as Taylor might in their 
own minds question the wisdom of the 
instruction or policy shift. But none said 
clearly: "What we propose to do is im-
moral. It is beneath the dignity of the 
United States that we as a government 
would conspire to political assassina-
tion. My conscience won't take it. So I 
will turn in my suit." One by one the 
principals fell in line with what had be-
come, if by default, White House polity. 
In the end, the deed was done. 
Be it said in favor of the Vietnamese

I3'y PETER ARNETT 
Before the Vietnam war turned 
sour and Americans could still be-
lieve in legends, there was an 
idealized cold-war warrior whose 
.bravery, boldness and common sense 
were carrying the American Way to 
victory over Communism in South-
east Asia. 
His legendary exploits and style 
became the model for the scores of 
young American operatives dis-
patched by various departments -and 
agencies to that arena of big-power 
political intrigue. Like the idealized 
cold warrior himself, those operatives 
were armed with a moral certitude 
about their mission. It sustained 
them through the long hot nights in 
backwaters like Luang Prabang and 
Pakse cultivating minor princelings. 
And it justified their support of the 
shoddy political accommodations 
that passed for democracy in Bang-
kok, Saigon and Vientiane. 
- Then it all started to go bad. Deeds 
'once thought bold and daring now 
seem to have been blundering acts 
of miscalculation that sucked the 
United States into an unforgiveable 
bloodletting in Vietnam. 
Those who had a hand in shaping 
the recent history of Southeast Asia, 
however, feel differently from the 
average._ American about that his-
tory. One such man is the model 
cold-war warrior of them all, Ed-
ward Geary Lansdale. Novelists 
.have tried to put him between. cov-
ers: Graham Greene made a kindred 
idealist the antihero of "The Quiet 
'American," and he was later featured 
as the hero of "The Ugly American" 
by William Lederer and Eugene Bur-
dick. - 
Now, the 64-year-old Lansdale, for-
mer San Francisco advertising man, 
oriental kingmaker, frustrated, coun-
terinsurgency expert, speaks for 
himself with, "In the Midst of Wars: 
An American's Mission to Southeast 
Asia." But he remains as elusive as 
the legends, even after 378 pages, 
and the reason seems to be that his 
memoirs are strangely abbreviated; 
the narrative concluded with Presi-
dent Ngo Dinh Diem firmly in power 
in Saigon in 1956, the second Asian 
monarch helped .to the throne by 
Lansdale. The first was Ramon Mag-
saysay of the Philippines. But with 
all we know of the later dramatic 
developments of the war, and with 
all Lansdale knows; his memoirs are 
like reading a history of the Ameri-
can Civil War that ends with the 
first election of Abraham Lincoln to 
the Presidency. 
The record states plainly that in 
1960 Lansdale wrote a bitterly nega-
tive report on the way the war was 
going in Vietnam, and later dis-
cussed .his finding with President 
Kennedy who wanted to send him 
back to Saigon in a high position. 
But -top Kennedy aides intervened 
because of his bureaucratic crock-
ery breaking and. independence. This 
same reputation apparently forced 
his retirement from the United 
States Air Force with the rank of 
major general at the age of 55. But 
none of this appears in his memoirs. 
But if Lansdale is reluctant to eval-
uate his life's work or discuss his 
personal reverses, he has plenty more 
to say. His pages ring with the 
evangelistic anti-Communist rhetoric 
of the 1950's. Lansdale, an O.S.S. 
officer in World War II, remains an 
idealist who believes that the United 
States can prevail in distant, un-
derdeveloped lands if she exports 
"the American way," a composite 
of "winning the hearts and the minds 
of the. people" and expert leverage 
of American economic aid. 
The former operative made plenty 
of enemies in his freewheeling days 
as Secretary of State John Foster 
Dulles's personal emissary in Indo-
china, but he names none in his 
memoirs, preferring to rail against 
the "back rooms of Washington pol-
icy makers," which are "too full of 
articulate and persuasive practi-
tioners of the expedient solution to 
daily problems, of the hoary art of 
power politics, and of the brute 
usages of our physical and material 
means." 
I ,ott Co A e c, 
Lansdale's belief is probably sus-
-tamed because of his first and last-
ing counterinsurgency success, the 
crushing of the Huh rebellion in the 
Philippines. He teamed with the then 
unknown Ramon Magsaysay, secre-
tary of national defense, and mount-
ed a drive against the Communist 
Huks that demonstrated superb co-
ordination of political, military and 
social-psychology strategy and tac-
tics. This dramatic campaign, which 
he details .minutely in his memoirs, 
destroyed the Huks and led Mag-
saysay to the Presidency in 1953, 
with Lansdale's help. 
By then Lansdale had become 
America's Number One counter-
insurgency expert, and John Foster 
Dulles sent him to Vietnam to do the 
same there. In the Philippines Lans-
dale had a favorite maxim, "Dirty 
tricks beget dirty tricks," and in Viet-
nam he was given every opportunity 
to put his skills to use; his mission, 
among other things, was to launch 
paramilitary operations and poitticak 
psychological 
warfare against North Vietnam 
a few days after the Geneva 
accords gave that country to 
Ho Chi Minh. 
Lansdale's operatives were 
the first American fighting ram 
in Vietnam, a fact not hitherto 
known until the Pentagon Pa-
pers last year revealed minute 
details of sabotage in Hanoi by 
Americans in 1954, including 
the pouring of contaminants 
into Hanoi buses to eventually 
destroy them. Lansdale men-
tions the teams in his memoirs, 
but he fails to include the con-
taminants, or his association 
with the .Central Intelligence 
Agency revealed by the Penta-
gon Papers. 
Lansdale's main contribution 
to the history of Vietnam was 
his success in propping up Ngo 
Dinh Diem, the obdurate Viet-
namese nationalist appointed 
Prime Minister by the French 
in a power play in 1954 and 
saved from political extinction 
by Lansdale who save in him 
the makings of another magsay-
say. Dulles, in April, 195, had 
already agreed to a demand by 
his special envoy -in Saigon, 
Gen. J. Lawton Collins, that 
Diem be dumped in favor of a 
coalition of Saigon politicians 
and sect leaders, when a dra-
matic cable arrived from Lans-
dale stating that Diem was suc-

-6 APR 1972, 
Letters To 
- A South "Vietnamese Soldier Writes 
I have just received a letter from a South 
Vietnamese soldier in Vietnam (a former 
constituent) who retreated from the DMZ. 
His language is very straightforward, but I 
will not change anything because it will help 
the American people who are saturated with 
,cliches and hypocritical euphemisms to 
know the other side of the story. Here are a 
few excerpts (when my correspondent says 
"we" he refers to himself and his South Vi-
.etnamese comrades in arms): 
" "Enemy fire was not so terrible really, I 
� have known much worse; we were not afraid 
at all, we could have stayed, but we did not 
want to fight the Reds . .. What for ? Why 
� should we fight them? They have never 
harmed us. But the corrupted Vietnamese 
'leaders in Saigon and the Americans who 
live in luxury and debauchery in Saigon 
have harmed us. These Americans and these 
Vietnamese traffic in heroin and opium; 
they share the proceeds with one another; 
the Vietnamese are the high officials; the 
Americans are U.S. officials which include 
military, civilian and CIA personnel; they 
live lavishly with villas, cars, mistresses; 
each of them spend in one night what we 
soldiers, with one wife and three or four 
children take one year to earn. That is why 
'we all agree: (1) it is too stupid to die for 
nothing; (2) it is even criminal to kill the 
guys in front because they do not deserve to 
die, they are unfortunate fellows like us; we 
should kill instead the corrupted leaders in 
Saigon and their dirty Saigon-American 
friends .. . [note: he makes a distinction be-
tween the Americans who live in the U.S. 
and who are not involved and the despised' 
Saigon-Americans who are war profiteers] 
who have made shambles of our country. 
Since the Americans killed [sic] President 
Ngo Dinh Diem and installed a new regime 
of yes-yes men, corruption stinks to the sky. 
We want to tear down the corrupted. Since 
the Communists want to do the same job, we 
leave it to them. What we want before all is 
independence, then we shall freely choose 
the leaders we respect. With the Americans 
sitting right on our head we are anything 
but free. That is why we are more and more 
mad at President Nixon. His withdrawal is 
interminable, hence we have no independ-
ence. His Vietnamization shall never work: 
because he is fighting not only the Commu-
nists but also the whole Vietnamese popula-
tion which are mad at the corrupted Ameri-
cans.; and Vietnamese who rule them. 
"There is a brave U.S. major, who acted as 
adviser and who probably meant well, who 
saw us packing and leaving and who asked 
me�probably because I have many ribbons 
for gallantry on my chest�why we did not 
make the slightest effort to resist and save 
our country from communism, etc., etc. . I 
looked at him silently for a long moment, 
shrugged my shoulders, and went away with-
out answering, because I cannot tell him 
what I tell you in this letter. Some of us, in 
other units, fight by sheer reflex, like ro-
bots, but they will quit too, because they 
also feel the same way as we do. For the 
time being we 'just quit the battlefield, but 
in our next step we shall join the Commu-
nist forces. 
"We hate the corrupted. Why don't you 
come back to lead us?" 
I concur, but I also advocate reunification 
and neutrality for the entire Vietnam.

Mr. Marchetti was on the director's staff of the CIA when 
he resigned from the agency two years ago. Since then, his 
novel The Rope-Dancer has been published by Grosset & 
.Dunlap; he is now working on a book-length critical analysis 
of the CIA. 
The Central Intelligence Agency's role in U.S. foreign af-
fairs is, like the organization itself, clouded by secrecy 
and confused by misconceptions, many of them deliberately 
promoted by the CIA with the cooperation of the news 
media. Thus to understand the covert mission of this 
agency and to estimate its value to the political leadership, 
one must brush myths aside and penetrate to the sources 
and circumstances from which the agency draws its au-
thority and support. The CIA is no accidental, romantic 
aberration; it is exactly what those who govern the country 
intend it to be�the clandestine mechanism whereby the 
executive branch influences the internal affairs of other 
nations. 
In conducting such operations, particularly those that 
are inherently risky, the CIA acts at the direction and with 
the approval of the President or his Special Assistant for 
National Security Affairs. Before initiating action in the 
field, the agency almost invariably establishes that its oper-
ational plans accord with the aims of the 'administration 
and, when possible, the sympathies of Congressional lead-
ers. (Sometimes the endorsement or assistance of influen-
tial individuals and institutions outside government is also 
sopght.) CIA directors have been remarkably well aware 
of the dangers they court, both personally and for the 
agency, by not gaining specific official sanction for their 
covert operations. They are, accordingly, often more care-
ful than are administrators in other areas of the bureau-
cracy to inform the White Hous,e of their activities and to 
: seek Presidential blessing. To take the blame publicly 
for an occasional operational blunder is a small price to 
pay in return for the protection of the Chief Executive and 
the men who control the Congress. 
The U-2 incident of 1960 was viewed by many as an 
outrageous blunder by the CIA, wrecking the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev summit conference in Paris and setting U.S.-
Soviet relations back several years. Within the inner circles 
of the administration, however, the shoot-down was 
shrugged off as just one of those things that happen in the 
chancy business of intelligence. After attempts to deny 
responsibility for the action had failed, the President openly 
defended and even praised the work of the CIA, although 
for obvious political reasons he avoided noting that he had 
authorized the disastrous flight. The U-2 program against 
the USSR was canceled, but work on its follow-on system, 
the A-11 (now the SR-71,) was speeded up. Only the 
launching of the reconnaissance satellites put an end to 
espionage against the Soviet Union by manned aircraft. 
The A-11 development program was completed, neverthe-
less, on the premise that it, as well as the U-2, might be 
useful elsewhere.

The reorganization of the U.S. intelligence commu-

the clandestine action arm of American foreign policy. 
Most of the few changes are intended to improve the finan-
cial management of the community, especially in the mili-
tary intelligence services where growth and the technical 
costs of collecting information are almost out of control. 
Other alterations are designed to improve the meshing of 
the community's product with national security planning 
and to provide the White House with greater control 
over operations policy. However, none of that implies a 
reduction of the CIA's role in covert foreign policy action. 
In fact, the extensive review conducted by the White House 
staff in preparation for the reorganization drew heavily on 
advice provided by the CIA and that given by former 
agency officials through such go-betweens as the influential 
Council on Foreign Relations. Earlier in the Nixon Admin-
istration, the Council had responded to a similar request 
by recommending that in the future the CIA should con-
centrate its covert pressure tactics on Latin American, 
African and Asian targets, using more foreign nationals as 
agents and relying more on private U.S. corporations and 
other institutions as covers. Nothing was said about reduc-

Meanwhile, in another hamlet nearby, this one known 
as My Khe 4, Bravo Company was getting in some prac-
tice. "We were out there having a good time," one of the 
participating GIs told Hersh. "It was sort of like being in 
.a shooting gallery." Estimates of the dead at My Khe 4: 
range up to 155. Hersh's account of this episode is the

_ 
ITT's public relations fiasco 
Despite the welter of testimony and 
newspaper stories implying question-
able relations between International 
Telephone & Telegraph Corp. and the 
Justice Dept., the Central Intelligence 
Agency, and the White House, there 
has been no concrete evidence yet pro-
duced of any illegal conduct. Still, the 
publicity has damaged ITT's public im-
age. Even sophisticated businessmen 
and investors are talking of the dam-
age done to the reputation of business 
in general, describing ITT's recent con-
duct as arrogant and conscienceless. At 
midweek, the common stock hit a low 
for the year. 
ITT is caught up in a full-fledged pub-
lic relations fiasco, with an unaccus-
tomed spotlight beaming on the office 
of Edward J. Gerrity, Jr., senior vice-
president for public relations. Gerrity, 
48, a onetime Scranton (Pa.) news-
paperman, oversees ITT's far-flung cor-
porate relations staff, including public 
relations, advertising, and dealings 
with government agencies. Dita Beard, 
the lobbyist whose alleged memo about 
the company's contributions to the San 
Diego Convention Bureau started the 
brouhaha, works for Gerrity. 
The credibility. Gerrity's operation, 
which has a staff of 51 worldwide, has 
had a reputation for being effective but 
heavy-handed. 
In 1967, for instance, three Washing-
ton reporters .covering the Federal 
Communications Commission hearings 
into ITT's proposed acquisition of 
American Broadcasting Co. testified 
that ITT public relations staffers pres-
sured them for better treatment. Ei-
leen Shanahan, a New York Times re-
porter, said that Gerrity "badgered" 
her, and she later claimed that ITT 
asked a former employer about her 
character. Now, shredded documents, 
discrediting medical testimony, and ill-
advised memoranda have all combined 
to make things look very bad for ITT. 
When columnist Jack Anderson pub-
lished alleged ITT internal memos im-
plicating ITT in a scheme to block the 
election of Chilean president Salvador 
Allende, ITT public relations issued a 
statement describing as "without foun-
dation in fact" Anderson's claim that 
the conglomerate "had participated in 
planning any plots or coup against him 
[Allende]." 
Yet former CIA director John A. 
McCone, a member of the ITT board of 
directors since 1966 and a member of 
company told the U. S. government, "If 
you have a plan, we'll help with it." Far 
from disavowing the authenticity of 
the memos published by Anderson, 
McCone says "those were staff." And. 
he adds that suggestions of "economic 
repression" measures were "prudently, 
properly, and firmly rejected by Gen-
een and his operating people." McCone 
adds that ITT Chairman Harold S. Gen-
een and he are filled with "regret at 
the way that the memos were written 
and the way they have been read by 
the press so that our true policy has 
been distorted." 
The Image. The .way they are 'being in-
terpreted by the press is, of course, a 
problem for globally ambitious ITT, as 
well as for 'Ned" Gerrity. What he and 
ITT's statuette: A manneken pis for 
members of The Brussels Boys Club. 
his staff think of it all is unknown, for 
Gerrity is refusing interviews "on the 
advice of our lawyers." 
ITT is not a corporation known for 
hiding its light. Each year several hun-
dred journalists, ranging from finan-
cial writers to police-beat hacks, gather 
at Manhattan's St. Regis Roof for a 
bash that ITT's public relations depart-
ment calls "The Brussels Boys Club." 
The tone of the evening is set by a 
replica of Brussels' famed manneken 
pis, which directs a potable stream into 
the glasses of thirsty guests. "Members"

Notably absent were Chairman Geneen

Hanging over the meeting was the

Foreign affairs. If ITT's image is hurt in 
Europe, it could not come at a worse 
time. The now-famous deal it struck 
with the Justice Dept., which allowed it 
to retain Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 
set a limit of $100-million on the size of 
a company it could acquire domes-

will have to look abroad�especially to 
Europe�for large acquisitions, and in

Foreign ownership of telecommuni-

Peru and Ecuador nationalized ITT sub-

Brazil declined to renew the franchise 
of ITT World Communications. 
For all its overseas interests, ITT is 
not averse to waving Old Glory. For ex-

SAN FRANCISCO-Earth Magazine 
has announced the preparation of 
a law suit against a CIA-controll-
ed airline it accused in its March 
issue of flying heroin out of 
'Southeast Asia with the knowledge 
of that clandestine government 
agency. 
San F rancisco attorney Ron Lea-
chrnan says the suit.will charge 
Air America, a corporation set 
up by the Central Intelligence 
Agency, with allowing its 
facilities to be used for the traf-
ficing of opium from the "fertile 
triangle" of poppy fields in Laos, 
Burma and Thailand. 
The current issue of Earth 
documents in a feature article 
by University of �Calfornia Prof. 
Peter � Scott, the connection be-
tween� the CIA, Air America and 
the heroin trade, Scott charges 
that "the opium-based economy 
of Laos is being protected by a 
coalition of opium growing CIA 
mercenaries, �Air America planes 
and Thailand troops." 
The article charged that much 
of the heroin wound up being used 
in Vietnam by U.S. troops or went 
to the streets of America. 
At a press conference announ-
cing the publication of the article, 
Earth editor James Goode ang-
rily pointed out how corruption 
abroad has brought disaster back 
home: 
"The CIA helped put our kids 
in Vietnam and CIA heroin traffic 
turned them on to smack." he said 
at the press conference. "And 
we're paying the CIA $6 billion 
a year for these services." 
The impact of this trafficking 
on American youth cannot be 
underestimated. In the article, 
Scott quotes Eliot Marshall's 
estimate in the New Republic . 
that 25% of all berOin in the 
U.S. comes from the fertile 
triangle region of South-east Asia 
A further amplification of the 
problem came from research done 
by Mike Benner of WR IF news in a 
recent broadcast about the Earth 
magazine exposures. 
He said, "Studies on the heroin 
problem in the United States have 
indicated that up to five billion 
dollars is spent annually on heroin 
by an estimated five� hued red 
thousand addicts. More than half of 
the money spent each year on 
the purchase of heroin two and 
one-half billion dollars � is 
U.S. Government studies have 
indicated that as much as 50% 
of the crime in metropolitan areas 
is caused by addicts and medical 
officials report that heroin pre-
sently causes more deaths to 
people between the ages of 18 and 
35 than war, cancer or car 
accidents." 
. Most observors feel that the 
CIA involvement in the heroin 
trade has not come about through 
a desire of the U.S. government 
to poison its troops and young 
people. But rather through a trap 
of political alliances with the 
dealers and marketers of opium, 
who were often the only forces in 
Southeast Asia willing to support 
the U.S. political and military 
adventures in that region, an area 
contro led by remnants of the 
Chinese Nationalist Army. 
Several recent calls for 
attacks on the trade by the gov-
ernment are not being taken too 
seriously and Hubert Humphrey 
even suggested having the CIA 
itself hunt down the smugglers. 
Don Strachen writting in the 
Staff newspaper in Los Angle 
suggested that this was like askin 
the Nazi S.S. force to investigat 
atrocities at the Auschwitz con 
centration camp.

Cl 
Nixon's Peace Offer 
IIE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE at stake 
in the Indochina war has always 
been a relatively simple one; is 
the United States (or the French be-
fore it) to have a predominant voice 
in determining the political and social 
structure of Indochina, or will this 
question be settled by the Indochinese 
peoples themselves, relatively free from 
outside intervention? It has been fairly 
clear from the outset that, if external 
force were withdrawn, Vietnam would 
ultimately be unified under commun-
ist leadership, since the Viet Minh and 
its successors had "captured" the na-
tionalist movement, as U.S. govern-
ment analysts express it. In Laos, the 
Pathet Lao have been unmatched in 
their ability to construct a popular na-
tionalist political movement, in this 
case, too, with revolutionary social con-
tent. U.S. intervention from the late 
1950s. has drawn North Vietnam in-
creasingly into Laotian affairs, much 
as in South Vietnam and more recently 
Cambodia, where the March 1970 
coup, very likely with a CIA hand, and 
the US-ARVN invasion that followed, 
shattered a fragile though conceivably 
stable neutralism and increased the 
probability that Cambodia too will be 
brought ultimately into a communist-
led federation of. some sort if outside 
force is withdrawn. 
For reasons that need not detain us 
here, the United States has never been 
willing to tolerate the "loss" of Indo-
china, and remains unwilling today. 
The conditions of U.S. intervention 
have changed over the years, but not 
the essential goals. Furthermore, the 
basic problem facing the Western in-
vaders has also changed little during 
the past quarter century. Several years 
ago, an American military spokesman 
formulated the problem clearly: the 
U.S. has enormous military force but 
littlo. political power and must defeat 
an adversary with enormous political 
power but only modest military force. 
To this problem the U.S. must find the 
"proper response"�in Vietnam and 
elsewhere in the third world as well. 
(Jean Lacouture, Vietnam: Between 
Two Truces, 1966). 
This ,problem dictates American 
strategy. The basic strategy has been, 
necessarily, to demolish the social and 
� 
political structures in which the.. indig-
enous resistance is rooted, what is 
called "nation-building" by some of the 
more contemptible hypocrites spawned 
�in the course of this endeavor, for ex-
ample, Robert Komer, chief Presiden-
tial advisor on "pacification" in the 
Johnson Administration. Five years 
ago, he held out the hope that "ero-
sion of southern VC strength" may be 
feasible because, though none of the 
American programs are very efficient, 
"we are grinding the enemy down by 
sheer weight and mass" (Pentagon 
Papers, Beacon, volume IV). After the 
Tet offensive of 1968, it became clear 
that the American public would not 
long tolerate the costs of a continuing 
military occupation in South Vietnam, 
coupled with a costly air war against 
the North. Consequently, the direct 
U.S. troop commitment was leveled off 
and then gradually lowered through 
"Vietnamization"�a policy suggested 
by Pentagon systems analysts in 1967 
�while a sharply expanded techno-
logical war reached its peak in the early 
months of the Nixon Administration. 
Nixon and Kissinger are gambling 
that the massive destruction and forced 
population concentration in the South, 
with its devastating impact on the rural 
society, may create conditions under 
which the U.S.-imposed regime can 
survive. To use Robert Komer's terms, 
"thanks to massive U.S. military in-
tervention at horrendous cost," a "fa-
vorable military environment" has been 
created "in which the largely political 
competition for control and support of 
the key rural population could begin 
again" in this "revolutionary, largely 
political conflict" of International 
Affairs, 1971, no. 1). He fails to add 
that contiol of the "key rural popu-
lation" may be facilitated by the fact, 
that at least half the population, 85 
percent rural in 1960, now lives in 
urban ghettoes (J-C Pomonti, Foreign 
Affairs, Jan. 1972), part of the "hor-
rendous cost" of "massive U.S. mil-
itary intervention." Much the same is 
true in Laos and Cambodia. Nixon and 
Kissinger appear to be moving towards 
an effective partition of Indochina: the 
heavily settled areas of Laos, South 
Vietnam and Cambodia will, it is 
hoped, be separated from the resist-
ance forces by a ring of fire and de-
struction, controlled by an elaborate 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
� military and police apparatus, an-C1 
gradually absorbed within the U.S.-
Japan Pacific system. The vast areas 
ceded to the resistance will be sub-
jected to intensive bombardment which 
will continue to make an organized so-
cial life virtually impossible. Parts of 
Laos may be effectively incorporated 
within Thailand, as George Ball sug-
gested years ago. It may be that the 
willingness of the Administration to 
concede the 'presence of Thai mer-
cenaries in Laos (in conflict with ex-
plicit legislation designed to prevent 
this) reflects the need to prepare the 
public for this outcome. 
As the very knowledgeable Austra-
lian analyst Peter King observes; such 
"successes" as have been achieved in 
this program are "no mystery": "It re-
quires more than ordinary courage for 
civilians to maintain their political al-
legiances openly in the face of a semi-
genocidal counter-insurgent strategy" 
(Pacific Affairs, Fall 1971), the pre-
requisite for Komer-stle "nation-
building." It is this counter-insurgent 
strategy and its results that lead Gen-
eral Westmoreland to believe: "I think 
particularly significant is that the en-
emy does not have the strong infra-
structure and the guerrilla forces in 
large numbers, well equipped and high-
ly motivated, that he had in 1968" 
(Peter Osnos, Washington Post-Bos-
ton Globe, Feb. 1, 1972). However, as 
King and many others recognize, "the 
durability of that success may be 
doubted." 
Given the insistence of the U.S. pub-
lic on scaling down the direct Amer-
ican involvement, it has been obvious 
for several years that it would become 
necessary for the U.S. to engage in 
some sort of political manipulations 
within the areas of South Vietnam that 
'remain under U.S. control, or to "get 
ready for political competition in South 
Vietnam," as Harvard Professor Sam-
uel Huntington put it in a paper be-
fore the May 1969 meeting of the 
Council on Vietnamese Studies of SEA-
DAG. This collection of scholars, who 
claim to be concerned with support 
for research on Vietnam, struggled 
manfully with the problem of how tc 
ensure control at the national level fen 
"our side," given that the NLF re-
mains "the most powerful purely po-
litical national organization," "the 
csontitued

IN THE MIDST OF WARS: 
An American's Mission 
to Southeast Asia 
by Edward Leary Lansdale 
Harper & Row, 386 pp., $12.50 
Reviewed by Jonathan MirskY 
IN With the exception of the Pentagon 
Papers, Edward Geary Lansdale's 
memoir could have been the most valu-
able eyewitness account of the inter-
nationalizing of the Indochinese war. 
Lansdale, a "legendary figure" even in 
his own book, furnished the model for 
the Ugly American who, from 1950 
through 1953, "helped" Magsaysay put 
down the Iluk revolution in the Philip-
pines. He then proceeded to Vietnam 
where, between 1954 and 1956, he stuck 
close to Ngo Dinh Diem during Diem's 
first shaky years when Washington 
couldn't make pp its mind whom to 
tap as the American alternative to Ho 
Chi Minh. Lansdale's support insured 
Diem as the final choice for Our Man 
In Saigon. While the book's time span 
Is, therefore, relatively brief, the period 
it covers in the Philippines and Viet-
nam is genuinely important. 
There is only one difficulty with In 
the Midst of Wars: from the cover to 
the final page it is permeated with lies. 
That Harper & Row finds it possible 
to foist such a package of untruths on 
the public�and for $12.50!�several 
months after the emergence of the 
Pentagon Papers, and years after the 
publication of other authoritative 
studies, exhibits contempt for a public 
trying to understand the realities of 
, our engagement in Vietnam. 
The lie on the jacket describes Lans-
dale merely as an OSS veteran who 
spent the years after World War II as a 
"career officer in the U.S. Air Force." 
In the text Lansdale never offers any 
explicit evidence to the contrary. In-
deed, on page 378�the last of the text�
he states that at the very time Diem 
was being murdered in Saigon, "I had 
been retired from the Air Force." 
For all I know Lansdale drew his pay 
from the Air Force and, as the photo-
graphs in his book attest, he certainly 
wore. its uniform. This is irrelevant. 
Lansdale was for years a senior opera-
tive of the Central Intelligence Agency; 
on page 244 of the Department of De-
fense edition of the Pentagon Papers, 
Lansdale, two other men, and Allen 
Dulles are identified as representing 
the CIA at a meeting of the President's 
Special Committee on Indochina held 
on January 29, 1954. 
Why is this important? Because if 
there is one word Lansdale uses re-
peatedly it is "help"�and he uses it 
personally, simulating a Lone Ranger-
like urge to offer spontaneous assist-
ance. Thus, the first day he ever saw 
Diem, ". . . the thought occurred to 
me that perhaps he needed help.... I 
voiced this to Ambassador. Heath. . 
Heath told me to go ahead." The in-
formal atmosphere continues when 
Lansdale, upon actually meeting Diem, 
immortalizes him as "the alert and 
eldest of the seven dwarfs deciding 
what to do about Snow White." 
Further desires to serve inform Lans-
dale's concern for the "masses of 
people living in North Vietnam who 
would want to ... move out before the 
:ommunists took over." These unfortu-
nates, too, required "help." Splitting 
his "small team" of Americans in two, 
Lansdale saw to it that "One half, 
Rider Major Conein, engaged in 
-efugee work in the North." 
"Major" Lucien Conein, who was to 
play the major role the CIA had in the 
murder of Diem in 1963, is identified in 
the secret CIA report included by the,/ 
Times and Beacon editions of the 
Pentagon Papers (sec SR, Jan. I, 1972) 
as an agent "assigned to MAAG [Mili-
tary Assistance Advisory Gr9up1. for 
cover purposes." The secret . report 
refers to Conein's refugee "help" as 
one of his "cover duties." His real job: 
"responsibility for developing a 'para-
military organization in the North, to 
be in position when the Vietminh took. 
over . . . the group was to be trained 
and supported by the U.S. as patriotic 
Vietnamese." Conches "helpful" teams 
also attempted to sabotage Hanoi's 
largest printing establishment and 
wreck the local bus company. At the 
beginning of 1955, still in Hanoi, the 
CIA's Conein infiltrated more agents 
into the North. They "became normal 
citizens, carrying out everyday civil 
pursuits, On the surface." Aggression 
from the North, anyone? 
Lansdale expresses particular pleas-
ure with the refugee movement to 
the Snuth. These people "ought to be 
provided with a way of making a fresh 
start in the free South.. .. [Vietnam] 
was going to need the vigorous par-
ticipation of every citizen to make a 
success of the noncommunist part of 
the new nation before the proposed 
plebiscite was held in 1956." Lansdale 
modestly claims that he "passed along" 
ideas on how to wage psychological 
warfare to "some nationalists." The 
Pentagon Papers, however, reveal that 
the CIA "engineered a black psywar 
strike in Hanoi: leaflets signed by the 
Vietminh instructing Tonkinese on 
how to behave for the Vietminh take-
%.1 x tit toe Hanoi region in early 
October [1954] including items about 
property, money reform, and a three-
day holiday of workers upon takeover. 
The day following the distribution of 
these leaflets, refugee registration 
tripled." 
The refugees�Catholics, many of 
whom had collaborated with the 
French�were settled in the South, in 
communities that, according to Lans-
dale, were designed to "sandwich" 
Northerners and Southerners "in a 
cultural melting pot that hopefully 
would give each equal opportunity." 
Robert Scigliano, who at this time 
was advising the CIA-infiltrated Michi-
gan State University team on how to 
"help" Diem, saw more than a melting 
pot: 
Northerners, practically all of whom 
refugees, [have] preempted many of 
choice posts in the Diem government. 
[The] Diem regime has assumed the 
are 
the 
as-
pect of a carpet bag government in its. 
disproportion of Northerners and Cen-
tralists ... and in its Catholicism.... The 
(Southern people do not seem to share the 
anticommunist vehemence of their North-
ern and Central compatriots, by whom 
they are sometimes referred to as un-
reliable in the4communist struggle. . . . 
[While] priests in the refugee villages hold 
no formal government posts they al e gen-
erally the real rulers of their villages and 
serve as contacts with district and pro-
vincial officials. 
Graham Greene, a devout Catholic, 
observed in 1955 after a visit to Viet-
nam, "It is Catholicism which has 
helped to ruin the government of Mr. 
Diem, for his genuine piety has been 
exploited by his American advisers 
until the Church is in danger of sharing 
the unpopularity of the United States." 
Wherever one turns. in Lansdale the 
accounts are likely to be lies. He re-
ports how Filipinos, old comrades 
from the anti-Huk wars, decided to 
"help" the struggling Free South. The 
spontaneity of this pan-Asian gesture 
warms the heart�until one learns from 
Lansdale's own secret report to Presi-
dent Kennedy that here, too, the CIA 
had stage-managed the whole business. 
The Eastern Construction Company 
turns out to be a CIA-controlled 
"mechanism to permit the deployment 
of Filipino personnel in other Asian 
countries for unconventional opera-
tions.... Philippine Armed Forces and 
other governmental personnel were 
'sheep-dipped' and sent abroad." 
Elsewhere Lansdale makes much of 
Diem's success against the various 
sects, Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh 
Xuyen. (At every step Diem was ad-
vised by Lansdale who, at one pathetic

would give each equal opportunity." 
Robert Scigliano, who at this time 
was advising the CIA-infiltrated Michi-
gan State University team on how to 
"help" Diem, saw more than a melting 
pot: 
Northerners, practically all of whom are 
refugees, [have] preempted many of the 
choice posts in the Diem government.... 
[The] Diem regime has assumed the as-
pect of a carnet bag government in its 
disproportion .of Northerners and Cen-
tralists ... and in its Catholicism.... The 
Southern people do not seem to share the 
anticommunist vehemence of their North-
ern and Central compatriots, by whom 
they are sometimes referred to as un. 
reliable in the communist struggle, 
[While] priests in the refugee villages hold 
no formal government posts they are gen. 
erally the real rulers of their villages and 
serve as contacts with district and pro-
vincial officials. 
Graham Greene, a devout Catholic, 
observed in 1955 after a visit to Viet-
nam, "It is Catholicism which has 
helped to ruin the government of Mr. 
Diem, for his genuine piety has been 
exploited by his American advisers 
until the Church is in danger of sharing 
the unpopularity of the United States." 
Wherever one turns in Lansdale the 
accounts are likely to be lies. He re-
ports how Filipinos, old comrades 
from the anti-Huk wars, decided to 
"help" the struggling Free South. The 
spontaneity of this pan-Asian gesture 
warms the heart�until one learns from 
Lansdale's own secret report to Presi-
dent Kennedy that here, too, the CIA 
had stage-managed the whole business. 
The Eastern Construction Company 
turns out to be a CIA-controlled 
"mechanism to permit the deployment 
of Filipino personnel in other Asian 
countries for unconventional opera-
tions.... Philippine Armed Forces and 
other governmental personnel were 
'sheep-dipped' and sent abroad." 
Elsewhere Lansdale makes much of 
Diem's success against the various 
sects, Cao Dal, Iloa Hao, and Binh 
Xuycn. (At every step Diem was ad-
vised by Lansdale who, at one pathetic 
moment, even holds the weeping Chief 
of State in his arms.) Everything de-

novels, The Quiet American and The 
Ugly American, are modeled on his 
doings. He helped move American 
military strategy from the conven-
tional concerns of how you position 
your armored divisions, tanks, artil-
lery, and nuclear weapons, to more 
political questions like where you put 
your psywar leaflets, why you need 
pacification teams, and how to � win 
the hearts and minds of the people. As 
a counter-guerrilla man long before 
the fashion, � Lansdale contributed 
about half the ideas that led to 
Vietnam. 
General Taylor symbolizes another 
idea, flexible response, which, floating 
on a common sea of anticommunism 
with Lansdale's doctrines, helped 
direct troop ships across the Pacific. 
At the apparent end of a long, 
successful military career that began 
at West Point under Superintendent 
Douglas MacArthur,Taylor, found him-
self a very dissatisfied Army Chief of 
Staff from 1955 until 1959. :He 
dissented from the Eisenhower-Dulles 
strategy of massive retaliation (which 
essentially promised to nuke the 
communists if they made a �move 
anywhere) because he considered it 
unlikely that the Russians would 
believe our threat to blow up the 
world if they seized the post office in 
Nairobi. Of course, Taylor also had 
bureaucratic reasons to oppose the 
Eisenhower nuclear strategy: the Air 
Force was getting missiles, the Navy 
was in line for nuclear subs, while the 
Army was getting little but budget 
cuts. His development of the flexible 
response posture paralleled a.series of 
frustrated battles for more Army 
funds, which Taylor implies were lost 
because conservatives like Treasury 
Secisetary George Humphrey wanted 
balanced budget so badly that the 
persuaded Ike to stick with a bargain 
basement nuclear strategy. 
Taylor retired from the Army ii 
1959 to write The Uncertain Trumpe 
and thereby take his case for flexibt 
response to the public, where it wa 
well-received because most peopt 
were chilled by so much talk abou 
the bomb during the Eisenhowe 
Administration. A powerful fear tha 
nuclear vertigo might draw our leader 
toward the button was activated 
especially among liberals, and its nem 
endings .remained exposed until afte 
the Goldwater-Johnson race in 1964

government and military 
that had traditionally been 
reserved for only our vilest 
adversaries. They were 
charges. few Americans 
could accept. 
But in November, 1969, 
Seymour M. Hersh, an en-
terprising free-lance jour-
nalist who specializes in cov-
ering the military, rocked 
the nation and the world 
with a series of articles ex-
'posed what became known 
as the My Lai massacre. The 
series won Hersh the Pu-
litzer Prize and later be-
came a probingly thorough 
book. Although most people 
refused to believe it, it 
,,began to look as if the worst 
charges made by the anti-
war groups were true. 
Now Hersh is back with a 
-second book based on My 
Lai. It is potentially more 
. explosive than the story of 
the massacre itself, raising 
-serious questions that cut to 
the core of the military as 
an institution and laying 
open to question the integ-
� rity of our top military and 
.civilian leaders as well as the 
American brand of justice. 
"Cover-up" Is based on 
.28,000 pages of testimony 
and documents gathered by 
the Army's investigation of 
the My Lai affair by a much 
ballyhooed blue-ribbon panel 
named after its chief, Lt. 
-Gen. William R. Peers, plus 
Hersh's own extensive inves-
tigations. The purpose of 
the Peers inquiry was to dis-
cover what happened at My 
-Lai, why it happened, and 
how it could have gone so 
long undiscovered. 
Army Was reacting, accord-
ing to Hersh, to charges of a 
whitewash. The public was 
promised full access to the 
Peers discoveries after the 
military trials, barring the 
usual "national security" 
catch-all provision. The 
trials are now over except 
for Calley's appeal, but the 
Pentagon still refuses to re-
lease the report. 
The reason, Hersh lays, is 
that the investigation of the 
whitewash, is itself a cover-
up. 
�Hersh shows the Peers 
group collecting detailed ev-
idence of a second massacre

to protect their fellow offi-
cers�even those they've 
never met. 
Beyond these revelations, 
however, lies the deeper 
question of command re-
sponsibility, not only for My 
Lai but for all the undiscov-
ered�publicly at least�
massacres and atrocities of 
the war. Implicit in the han-
dling of the My Lai affair by 
the administration and the 
Pentagon is the assumption 
that the massacre was an 
atypical incident, a kind of 
horrible aberration caused 
by a freakish and compli-
cated combination of factors 
that could never be re-
peated. 
"Cover-up" indicates that 
the atrocity syndrome was 
widespread throughout the 
Americal Ijivision, at least, 
and that the military poll-
cies then in effect. policies 
designed in the highest mili-
tary echelons made them 
inevitable. In the chapters 
Hersh devotes to the sub-
ject, one is struck by the 
identical line that issues 
from a variety of witnesses 
from numerous echelons: 
"Kill, kill, kill". If they are 
to be believed, the official 
emphasis was on body count 
and little else. There is 
hardly any conclusion left to 
draw except 'that as far as 
the brass Was concerned; 
what really mattered was 
not who was killed, but how 
many. 
In Hersh's final analysis it 
becomes clear that not only 
was My Lai inevitable, but 
so was its cover-up and the 
cover-up's cover-up. Perhaps 
the most disturbing issue he 
raises is that what made it 
all so inevitable is integral 
to the United States Army 
today. And that raises some 
questions. 
Hersh threads the story of 
My Lai and its sister massa-
cre at My Khe, their investi-
gation and the double cov-
er-up, into a broad tapestry 
tightly stitched together with 
the most damning evidence 
of all�the testimony of the 
men who participated at 
every level and every stage 
of the whole sordid affair. 
Years from now, when schol-
ars attempt to understand 
the Vietnam phenomenon, 
"Cover-Up" is the one book to 
which they will all turn. 
And they will ask them-4 
selves, I suppose, why the 
vital questions raised by � 
Hersh about an institution 
as powerful in and impor-
tant to America as its army 
were allowed to go unan-
swered�as they surely will 
in a nation that has had the

Cm . VEenfl 
By HENRY S. BRADSIIER 
Star Staff Writer 
SAIGON � In the.half-year 
since South Vietnam's presi-
dential .elections ended with a 
whimper instead of a bang, 
this country has been political-
ly more quiet than at any time 
in recent years. 
The quietness is a sign of 
President Nguyen Van Thieu's 
political mastery, of the de-
moralization of his opponents, 
and of preparations for a pos-
sible eventual political contest 
with the Communists. 
And it might also be taken 
as a sign of the narrow focus 
of Vietnamese politics on a 
small handful of people, with 
the bulk of the population 
knowing little abont them and 
caring less�in the normal 
way of underdeveloped coun-
tries with strongman tradi-
tions. . 
In the offices and villas of 
,those persons who consider 
themselves Saigon politicians, 
there is some desultory discus-
sion these days of new politi-
cal alliances. Thieu might 
once again be interested in 
gathering the support of some 
politicians, instead of spurning 
them all. 
i The An Quang pagoda group 
� of Buddhists is busy cleaning 
house, the student movement 
is hardly visible, and war vet-
erans are being taken care of 
fairly well. These are the 
groups that have caused the 
most political turmoil in re-
cent years, but not now. 
Few Pay Attention 
Retired Gen. Duong Van 
Minh, the self-appointed savior 
of Vietnam from both Thieu 
and communism, has issued a 
few statements since deciding 
in August not to fight a losing 
presidential election cain-
paign. 
Not many people pay atten-
tion. Vietnamese politicians, 
Journalists and other observ-
ers find it hard to imagine any 
future developments which 
could bring to Minh the call to 
national leadership that he � 
wants. 
The other man whom Thieu 
maneuvered out of the presi-
dential race, former Vice 
President Nguyen Cao Ky, 
plays tennis and talks with his 
military cronies. 
Now outranked by a former 
subordinate, he cannot return 
to command of the air force 
which he held before becoming 
premier seven years ago. Be-
sides, Thieu seems disinclined' 
to give Ky any position of au-
thority�not surprisingly, since 
Ky threatened in September to 
"destroy him and all his 
clique." 
Ky is not so easily written 
off as Minh, however. He has 
more determination and, at 43,� 
he is younger. He can wait for 
the next presidential elections 
in 1975, when Thieu will be 
constitutionally unable to seek 
another term. 
Way Charter Reads 
Or at least that is the way 
the Constitution reads at the 
moment. But that American-
inspired limitation may prove 
no more realistic for Vietnam 
than other ideas copied from 
the U.S. Constitution and later 
abandoned, like an independ-
ent judiciary. 
Few observers would want 
to predict as far ahead as 1975. 
But if Thieu is still running 
the same kind of government 
then, it seems likely that he 
might decide to emulate Presi-
dent Chung Hee Park of South 
Korea. A few years ago Park 
found himself so indispensable 
that he had to force through 
his parliament a change in the 
American-inspired two-term 
limitation. 
Thieu works from behind a 
screen of Oriental aloofness. 
He tours the country exten-
sively to meet with local offi-
cials, who form the basis of 
his political power, but he does 
not try to establish a popular 
image with the masses. 
He has made little effort to 
explain his policies. The presi-
dential palace provides almost 
no information to the Vietnam-
ese press about what it is 
doing. More than just a retic-
ence, there seems to be an 
absolute hostility toward the 
American press. 
Parties Too Fractious 
� Thieu dickered in 1969 with 
the idea of uniting seven politi-
cal parties behind his pro-
grams. But they proved too 
fractious. By early 1970 he was 
denouncing all politicians as 
would-be leaders without any 
followers.-
Now, however, there are 
signs that the president might 
be coming back to the idea 
that organized political sup-
port can have a value beyond 
his use of local officials and 
army officers to rally popular 
backing and turn out voters. 
The three parties that show 
signs of coalescing behind 
Thieu are the Workers' and 
Peasants' party, the Progres-
sive party, and the Revolution-
ary Greater Vietnam party. 
The first is primarily com-
posed of union members led 
by Tran Quoc Buil. He has had , 
strong American support since 
the days when the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency financed 
"No one has the right, 
through ill-considered acts, to 
go counter" to the constitu- . 
tion, Huyen said. Thieu's pro-
posal to let the Communists 
contest elections Would violate 
the anti-Communist provisions 
of the Constitution. 
Cautiously Quiet 
the creation of anti-
Commtthist unions abroad. 
The second party unites pro-
fessional tnen and civil serv-
ants. Its highly respected lead-
er, Prof. Nguyan Van Bong, 
was assassinated in Novem-
ber, weakening the party. 
The third, part of the old Dal 
Viet semi-secret political 
movement, is led by a former 
minister of the interior, Ha 
Thuc Ky. 
Position Strengthened 
Thieu gave these parties 
some help of dubious legality 
in August's elections to the 
lower house of parliament, 
and they strengthened their 
position. Now, he might be 
looking toward next year's 
lower house elections. 
If a constitutional amend-
ment is to be passed allowing 
a third term, . Thieu would 
need more parliamentary sup-
port than he now has. 
The president is still pre-
senting a stoutly anti-
Communist determination to 
the world. But he has gained 
politically � and weakened his 
critics � by offering in Janu-
ary to resign and fight presi-
dential elections against the 
Communists. 
This helped Thieu to capture 
much of the credit for favor-
ing peace which had been held 
by various opposition groups. 
It has at the same time 
caused concern. After a six-
week silence, the president of 
the upper house of parliament, 
Sen. Nguyen Van Iluyen, who 
would run the country tempo-
rarily under Thieu's plan to 
resign for new elections, ex-
pressed guarded disagre e-
ment. 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
The opposition groups which 
had voiced desires for peace 
have been cautiously quiet. 
The most interesting devel-
opment among the opposition 
is an attempt by the An Quang 
Buddhists to purge Communist 
sympathizers from their own 
n r ks, especially their student 
io 
ovements. After denying 
bvernment accusations that 
they often served communist 
purposes, the church leaders 
now seemed concerned about 
this. 
Their supreme patriarch re-
cently accused both the Saigon 
and Hanoi governments as 
"merely acting as puppets for 
foreign powers." This even-
handed condemnation was a 
change from attacking Thieu 
while being polite to the Com-
munists. . ,_

Lansdale. Harper & Row. 386 pages. $12.50. 
When Edward Lansdale returned to an almost-defeated 
Vietnam in the fall of 1965, he was already a fabled figure, the 
legendary Asian hand who had been the mentor of the Philip. 
pines' great anti-guerrilla fighter, Roman Magsaysay, as well 
as Ngo Dinh Diem's first American political-military adviser 
in the mid4950s, 
Although he was. then 58, he still had an air of youthful 
Idealism; with his haggard good looks and brown hair only 
tinged with gray, he might have stepped out of the pages of 
Eric Ambler or Ian Flaming. One saw at once why he had 
inspired major characters in both "The Ugly American," by 
William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick, and Graham 
Greene's classic on the Indochina war, "The Quiet American." 
BOOKS 
� a 
In "The Ugly American," Lansdale was barely disguised 
as Colonel Edwin D. Hillandale, a haromonica-playing good 
guy who "loves to be with people, any kind of people." In a 
frankly admiring sketch, the authors wrote, "In 1952 Colonel 
Hillandale was sent to Manila as liaison officer to something 
,or other. In a short time the Philippines fascinated him. He 
ate his meals in little Filipino restaurants . . . he even. 
'attended the University in his spare hours to study Tagalog* 
The counsellor up at the American Embassy always 
spoke of him as 'that crazy bastard.' But within six months 
the crazy bastard was eating breakfast with Magsaysay and 
he soon became Maksaysay's unofficial adviser." 
� BUT THERE was another way of interpreting Lansdale 
and Greene turned it into literature in his bitterly brilliant 
:"The Quiet American." The novel is a despairing portrayal of 
.a young idealistic CIA operative who blunders tragically 
.through the intrigue, treachery and confusion of Vietnamese 
'politics. Innocent and well-meaning, but naive, the American 
leaves a trail of blood and suffering in his wake. 
Greene's young American was sent to Indochina in the 
early 1950s to help create an indigenous political force that 
could resist a Communist takeover when the French pulled 
out. In May, 1954, John Foster Dulles dispatched Lansdale to 
Saigon with secret orders to see if anything could be salvaged 
from the fall of Dien Bien Phu. Lansdale became Diem's 
adviser at the time the Vietnamese leader was defying the 
Geneva agreements, which both he and the United States 
refused to sign, resettling almost a million refugees from the 
Communist north- and beginning to make South Vietnam a 
nation. 
In the novel, the Lansdale figure, after becoming involved 
in a terrorist explosion in Saigon � an incident that actually 
took place before Lansdale went to Vietnam � is murdered by 
the Communists. Thus when Lansdale came haek to Saigon in 
1965, It was rather like Greene's quiet American coming back 
to Saigon in 1935, it was rather like Greene's quiet American 
coming to life again. Oddly, the Vietnamese started calling 
Lansdale "the phoenix" after one of their household gods. 
What would he do?. 
"What does a man do," Lansdale told us at the time, 
"when he returns to a country, 10 years later, with great 
stress on its social and political structure, great suffering,' 
great pain. I have no great plan. One's got to move in with 
tremendous gentleness; these people have been divided and 
hurt and a lot of clumsiness could divide and hurt them more. 
But there isn't much time. They need rule of law, consent of 
the governed in how they are governed and a life in which kids 
have some hope of tomorrow. I feel the Vietnamese are in 
their last quarter. This is the ninth inning and we either do it 
now or not at all." 
' He was brimming with plans for sweeping land reform, 
rural electrification, bringing back all the able administrators 
purged for serving Diem, restoring Confucian ethics, putting 
strict restraints on American artillery and air strikes. 
But he was quickly stripped or any real authority. On Jan. 
21, 1966; Philip Habib, now ambassador to South Korea who 
ran the embassy's political aection, sent Lansdale a memoran-
dum, reportedly signed by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, 
forbidding him further contact with the Vietnamese leaders. 
Lansdale the phoenix. Perhaps the Vietnamese should have 
remembered a line of Greene's in "The Quiet American:" 
if� � � but nothing nowadays is fabulous and nothing rises 
from its ashes." 
"IN THE MIDST of Wars" is his own discreet account of 
the years in Asia from 1950 to 1956, the brilliantly successful 
four he spent helping to defeat the Huks and elect Magsaysay 
president in the Philippines, the less successful two in Viet-
nam assisting Diem to unite the feudal religious sects, defeat 
the.gangster army which ruled Saigon and begin a pacification 
effort against the budding Vietcong insurgency. 
It is an invaluable historical document and an exciting 
adventure story, and like the author himself, rugged, humor-
ous, compassionate, baffling, naive and a little infuriating. In 
tho book's anti-climactical final paragraph, Lansdale briefly 
notes he returned to Vietnam again from 1965 to 1968, closing 
his book with the cryptic sentence, "But that's another story, 
quiet different from the experiences f,lescribed in this book?" 
Why another story? From his personal viewpoint, of 
course, he went back as a civilian in an enormous, disarrayed 
American mission torn by interagency rivalry in a war 
already going badly, and he was never allowed to come up to 
bat. But would his approach have worked if he had? 
The book's final chapter is devoted to Lansdale's belief 
that irregular war is not just another aspect in the art of 
fighting but is a complex primarily political struggle for 
political ends. 
"Fundamentally," he writes, "the people of a country are 
the main feature on a' battleground of Communist choosing, 
since the ensuing struggle becomes one between the Commu-
nists and the government over which side will have the 
allegiance of the people. Whichever side wins that allegiance 
will win the country. . . In other words, a country's strength

Throughout, Lansdale promoted his belief that democ-
racy on the American model was exportable, desirable,. 
and an effective method of countering Communist "peo-
ple's wars." In his view, the theories of Washington, Jeffer-
son, and Lincoln were both morally and tactically superior

in Southeast Asia and certainly the most controversial. As

dale helped to defeat the Communist Hukbalahap rebellion 
The Washington officials to whom Lansdale addressed this 
message were, he notes, "not toe happy" over it. In the 
sadder and wiser America of tie 1970s, perhaps most 
Americans would not be happy ,,sith Lansdale's sense ,of 
global commitment to democratic panaceas. (Yet the 
Lansdale spirit is not so dated as it may sound; it survives, 
perhaps in more sophisticated forais, among able and in-
telligent men at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, and else-
where.) . 
In trying. to realize his ideal, Lansdale was ingenious 
and ruthless. He was an early student of Maoist military 
theory and psychological warfare. "Dirty tricks beget dirty 
tricks," he writes, and the premise is that the other side 
played dirty first. Thus he writes approvingly of a Filipino 
psywar squad that drained the blood of an ambushed Huk

rades of d vampire. Lansdale also recalls his success in 
causing a mass work .stoppage in Hanoi at the time of the 
Communist takeover� there-through distribution of phony 
leaflets proclaiming a' one-week victory holiday. 
- He does not tell all, however, which is probably one 
'reason why the book by Lansdale reads less melodramat-
ically than the ones about him. Through the Pentagon 
Papers, it is known that Lansdale's American agents in 
Hanoi also sabotaged the city's bus fleet at that time to 
embarrass the Vietminh and .that American-trained Viet-
namese guerrillas, the "Hao" -and "Binh" teams, were in-
filtrated into :Haiphong under his direction for anti-Com-
niunist underground activity. It may not be surprising for 
a retired career officer to omit such secret and sensitive 
material, but in Lansdale's ease there are grounds for sus-
pecting that he may have omitted more than he put in. His 
protests about exaggerated news reports of his activity in - 
.Vietnam sometimes have a hollow tone. 
Certainly Lansdale's 386-page book is no comprehensive 
record of the U.S. involvement in either the Philippines or 
Vietnam during this period. Neither are there any major 
historical revelations. What does emerge strongly is the 
personal philosophy and style of America's best-known 
".`nation-builder" in Southeast Asia at a time when the 
nation-building concept was generally accepted and ap-
plauded. Anecdotes, alternate with moralizations. Out of 
these, Lansdale app7.ors as idealistic and courageous (he

� American B-52 heavy bombers yesterday made their heaviest attacks in two weeks 
against the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In Saigon, more evidence of political 
skulduggery emerged, in the case of a Saigon puppet general fired by puppet President 
Nguyen Van Thieu at the beginning of the week on the "recommendation" of U.S. 
adviser John Paul Vann. 
Gen. Le Ngoc Trien, eommand-
er of the Saigon. puppet 22nd In-
fantry Division, was relieved of 
his command on Monday by Thieu 
at what was described as a "high-
level" military conference at 
Nha Trang, 190 miles northeast 
of Saigon. 
Nha Trang was formerly U.S. 
Special Forces headquarters in 
South Vietnam and is also a center 
of U.S. Central Intelligence Agen-
cy operations. Vann, the U.S. 
adviser � not otherwise described 
� recommended that Gen. Trien 
be fired because he was suffering 
from "a case of nerves and can't 
hack:it." Trien's forces are stat-
ioned in the Kontum-Pleiku region 
of the Central Highlands and the 
coastal province of Binh Dinh. 
Tied to U.S. elections 
What made thp U.S.-inspired 
move by Thieu significant was 
that Thieu on Monday tied in the 
defense of the vital Central High-
lands region to Nixon's reelection 
goal. Thieu asserted that "the 
Communists" would try to defeat 
Nixon by gaining military victor-
ies in the Central Highlands and 
thus disproving Nixon's "Viet-
namization" scheme. The firing 
of Gen. Trien therefore is a move 
within the context of U.S. domes-
tic politics. 
Thieu's remarks appeared on 
Tuesday in two Saigon news-
papers: Tin Song, which is financ-
ed by his own private secretary, 
bang Duc Nha, and the news-
paper Chinh Luan, which was de-
scribed by United Press Inter-
national as having a "special 
relationship" with the (Saigon 
puppet) presidential palace. Chinh 
Luan is also known to be in the 
good graces of the Saigon National 
�Police. 
Thieu declared, according to . 
these papers, "1972 is the last 
year for the Communists to 
achieve final success. To help 
bring about Nixon's defeat, North 
Vietnamese must try to demon-
strate the failure of Vietnamiza-
tion by inflicting a crushing mili-
tary defeat." 
He asserted that the "Commu-
nist thrust" would be aimed at 
Gen. Trien's area, and thus Trien 
was being fired. 
It was not until yesterday that 
U.S. newsmen dug up the fact 
that Thieu's action and the reas-
ons behind it all originated with 
the U.S. 
. � 
The Central Highlands region 
of South Vietnam has been a cen-
ter of fierce struggle against the 
Japanese, the French colonial-
ists, the Saigon puppets and their 
U.S. masters. 
In the 1946-54 war against the 
French, the Central Highlands 
were regarded by the French com-
mand as a center of Viet Minh 
strength; among the French lower 
ranks, being posted to the Central 
Highlands was regarded as the 
equivalent of a death sentence: 
In the 1954 Geneva discussions, 
the Vietnamese patriots argued 
that the Central Highlands should 
be included in the area under 
their control but agreed to the 
region temporarily being assigned 
to the French zone until scheduled 
elections were held in 1956. The 
elections were never held. 
Heavy fighting was reported 
raging yesterday in the Central 
Highlands and the adjoining 
Binh inh coastal province. Seven 
separate B-52 air strikes were 
called in a single, 450-square-mile 
area in the region, while in other 
areas, U.S. fighter-bombers 
were called in to drop napalm and 
bombs around encircled Saigon 
puppet army units.

Editor, The Record: 
Because Americans so much 
ant to believe their president 
and want to believe that what is 
happening in Indochina is all 
right and that our position is 
improving, if slowly, it is hard 
to keep the basic facts of the 
situation in f u 11 perspective. 
What are these facts? 
1. In Cambodia most of the 
countryside is in the hands of 
. revolutionaries of many types, 
; including hard core communists 
and also followers of Prince 
Sihanouk. They are consolidat-
ing their positions and setting 
up an infrastructure so- that 
when they take over the capital 
that they can set up an effective 
government and resist attacks. 
The Lon Nol regime is maintain-
ing its precarious position on the 
basis of support from the U.S., 
by using mercenaries and for-
eign, troops, and by training 
Cambodian soldi e rs in South 
Viet Nm under the 
2. clients in Laos are alSo 
in �a stea '131 worsening position. 
The Royal Laotian Army is es-
sentially moribund. The forces 
holding the communist Pathet 
Lao at bay are: a, Thai troops 
and the threat of further Thai 
commitments backed by the 
U.S., b. Mao tribesmen (an eth-
nic minority) under the pay, 
support and direction of the 
C.I.A., and c. U.S. air power. 
The Mao tribesmen have been 
worn down to using even nine 
year olds as soldiers. The com-
munists now have sophisticated 
anti-aircraft defenses and, de-
spite heavy air a ttack st are 
making increasing use of artil-
lery and tanks and thus over-
running government positions 
previously considered se cu r e. 
Our bombing has depopulated 
much of nort hern Laos and 
caused intense hatred of remain-
ing and displaced tribesmen. 
3. In South Viet Nam the 
"new" army of Thieu and oth-
ers has given up to sorties into 
Cambodia and other contested 
areas and has basically with-
drawn behind a ring of Ameri-
can air power to take up def en-
sive positions around population 
area s. Thieu has still not 
established any significant pop-
ular support other than the land-
lords, and has had to use ex-
treme measures to repress stu-
dents, workers, Buddhists a n d 
Catholics some of whom still 
dream of setting up a genuinely 
neutral "third force" govern-
ment and thus stopping the kill-fl 
In sum, the military, political 
and economic situation in all 
three of our client nations is not 
good, is deteriorating, and is 
being sustained by massive 
American aid, This situation is 
not deteriorating so fast that it 
will embarrass Nixon be f or e 
November. His reelection game 
plan just might work. But let's 
be clear just what is happening. 
We are prolonging the agony of 
millions of local peoples in Indo-
china, killing and maiming un-
told numbers in our "unin-
volved" air war. We are still 
draining our treasury and killing 
our youth. We are continuing to 
damage our military morale. We � 
are still dividing our own nation 
in deep and long lasting ways. 
We are delaying return of Amer-
ican prisoners of war. We are 
deflecting national attention and 
energy from many severe do-
mestic needs. We are prolonging 
the draft . and all its attendant 
problems. 
Is it worth all this 'just to get 
Nixon reelected? Can people 
really support a politician like 
Nikon who would place his own 
political future ahead of so 
many crucial national needs. 
The coming primaries in North 
Carolina will be a good indica-
tion of just how badly America 
wants to forget, to put out of 
mind, our national agony.

.V.r[itmEy. 
Not long ago the counter-culture's own superstar; Allen Ginsberg, appeared on 
the Dick Cavett Show. After first chanting a Hindu psalm for some two minutes 
(watch out, Dick, your ratings are slipping), Ginsberg began weaving an enchanting 
web of mystery, high intrigue and crash exploitation�a tale of the CIA's involvement. 
.in the heroin trade of Sbutheast Asia. 
in a straight forward manner Ginsberg told of a coektail party, a la radical chic, 
which he attended with the CIA's chief, Richard Helms. It seems the two made 
a friendly v, T...er. Ginsberg accused the CIA of maintaining an open market for opium 
(from which heroin is derived) at Long Cheng, a CIA-built stronghold in Laos. Helms 
denied this, and so they made the bet. If Ginsberg lost, he was to turn over his 
Hindu scepter. If, however, Ginsberg's accusations were correct, Helms was to 
meditate every day for a year�a thought as frivolous as watching Richard Nixon 
turn on for a national television audience. 
As Ginsberg was rapping this bit of people's folklore, he was all the time waving 
that very same Hindu scepter, as if he was exorcising the evil powers-that-be with 
-a magic wand. 
The rest of Ginsberg's story is history�past and future�as set out boldly in 
the May, 1971 issue of Ramparts. 
� Such an open market for opium, in the true capitalistic sense, does in fact exist 
�at Long Cheng�with the open blessings of the powerful, clandestine CIA. This much 
has been told by as many as eight journalists who have managed to slip past the 
ultra-high security structure of Long Cheng, as the Far Eastern Economic Review 
reported last year. 
, Carl Strock, one of the reporters, gave an eye-witness account tells of "American / 
-crews loading T-28 bombers while armed CIA agents chatted with uniformed Thai 
soldiers and piles of raw opium stood for sale in the market (a kilo for $52) ..." 
Where much, if not most, of this money earned from opium goes is towards 
the support of "friendly" capitalistic governments in Southeast Asia. For example, 
Newsweek has said that General Duane, former chief of the Laotian general staff, 
was forced into a premature retirement due to excessive exposure of his role in 
thd opium trade. General Duane, who, the New York Tomes said, "has never denied 
allegations that he is in charge of the opium traffic in Laos," even confided to news-
men that supporting opium traffic is a "good thing." Not only does this occupation 
provide the Meo tribesmen with a livelihood, Newsweek reported Ovane as saying, 
but it keeps them from the control of the Communist Pathet Lao. It is by now common 
parlor talk that these same Meo tribesmen are equipped and instructed for warfare, 
In a most thorouah manner, by the "freedom-loving" CIA. 
Although not as clearly documented, there is a preponderance of evidence of 
dealings in opium traffic at the highest level of South Vietnam's government. In . 
a broadcast reported by the N.Y. Times, NBC charged President Thieu and Vice 
President Ky with profiting from the drug traffic, and the Vietnamese police were 
accused of pushing illegal drugs (note the parallel with New York City). In that � 
same broadcast NBC reported that the biggest pusher was said to be Thieu's closest 
'adviser and special assistant for military and intelligence affairs, Lieut-Gen. Dang 
Van Quang. All NBC's charges were attributed to "extremely reliable sources." 
Su much for a mere spattering of the suspected truth. What all this suggests, 
incredible as it might seem, is that the United States government, directly or 
indirectly, is supporting a procedure which results in the heroin addiction of hun-
dreds of thousands of American citizens. 
We should all know that Nixon has proudly proclaimed a "most significant" 
deal with. Turkey, a country which, according to Nixon, exports two-thirds of the 
world's heroin. This fact is somewhat contradicted, however, by a -report by the 
UN Commission on Drugs and Narcotics. Referred to by both Ramparts and Ginsberg, 
this report stated that since 1966, 80% of the world's 1,200 tons of illicit opium comes 
�not from Turkey, but from Southeast Asia. ,

Viet Prisoner-Rescue 
Unit to Be Disbanded 
Fate of Secret Squad Parallels That of 
Other Clandestine Operations in S.E. Asia 
BY GEORGE McARTHUR 
� ' 
� � � Times Staff Writer 
. � 
SAIGON�A secret corn-. 
mand of American sol-
diers specially trained for 
prisoner rescue raids in 
hostile ,territory is sched-
uled to be disbanded some 
time this month. 
According to an officer 
long involved in clandes-
tine operations, the move 
will take from the U.S. 
command in South Viet-
nam its last cloak-and-dag-
ger outfit specifically 
honed to fight its way in 
and oht of prisoner camps. 
(The secret unit being 
disbanded was trained for 
use in the jungles of South 
Vietnam, Laos and Cam-
bodia and not for such 
spectaculars as the unsuc-
cessful raid on Son Tay in 
North Vietnam in Novem-
ber, 1970.) 
Scattered ArOund 
Though there are. plenty' 
of toughly skilled Ameri-
cans in Sbuth Vietnam to 
mount such. raids if the 
chance arises, they are 
'scattered among many 
Units. There are also small 
outfits � like Navy seal 
eteams�available for such 
things, but they are not 
specifically trained and 
kept in readiness for pris-
oner rescue grabs. 
Consequently the stand-
down of the secret prison-
er rescue group has stirred 
heated words within the 
headquarters of U.S. Gen. 
Creighton W. Abrams. 
Abrams, who has an ill-
concealed suspicion Of the 
value of elite units super-
imposed on the Army's reg-
ular structure, has repor-
tedly resisted arguments 
to go lightly on the with-
drawal of such outfits. 
Since the prisoner 
rescue unit was formed af-
ter the big influx of Amer-
ican .troops in 1965-66 it 
has not succeeded in res-
cuing a single American' 
prisoner held by the Viet' 
Cong, though it has helped 
5.earch a� small number of. 
S .o u t h Vietnamese cap-
tives from jungle camps. 
The unit had a parallel 
mission of saving downed 
pilots in cases where 
ground commandos might 
be required in addition to 
the crews of Air Force 
rescue helicopters known 
as Jolly Green Giants. If 
any such operation was 
ever mounted it has not 
been_ revealed. Some offi-
cers hint, however, that 
some operations of this 
type took place. 
Not Many Captives 
One reason the unit has 
few successes ,to its credit 
is that it was used sparing-
ly and under the strictest 
limitations. To avoid en-
dangering the lives of any 
captives with "fishing ex-
peditions," special raids 
were ordered only when 
intelligence turned up 
hard and immediatennfor-
mation on the location of 
Viet Cong POW camps. 
Thus, while the unit had 
few successes . it could 
equally boast few failures 
in the sense of botched or. 
sloppy efforts. - 
The number of Ameri-
can captives in Viet Cong 
.camps is also very small. 
Casualty figures list 463 
Americans missing in 
South Vietnam. The Unit-
ed States claims 78 of 
these were known from 
various sources to have 
been alive at the time of 
their capture and were 
consequently listed as 
war prisoners. Of these, 
however, only 20, have

many programs. Part of 
this was caused. by 
Abrams, who disliked hav-
ing Army types under CIA 
command as was the case 
in several areas. At any 
rate, the CIA began to 
withdraw provincial 
agents from the Phoenix 
program�aimed at root-
ing out and killing Viet 
Cong, "Phantom govern-
ment" officials�and quit 
funding (and controlling) 
such programs as the 
training school at Vung 
Tau which turned out

ry Development cadre. 
Though the CIA's tenta-
cles still reach all the sen-
sitive areas of control in 
South Vietnam, the em-
phasis now is less on 
"operational" areas and 
more on pure intelligence 
gathering. 
Paralleling the CIA's .ap-
preciably lower silhouette, 
the, Green Beret troopers 
of the 5th Special Forces 
Group were pulled out a 
year ago�their clandes-
tine operations being ab-
sorbed by an outfit known 
as SOG�the Studies and

is a cloak.- and - dagger

quarters, incorporating a 
dozen or so outfits which 
inontns. Its tuture will 
probably be sharply di-
minished within the next 
several months when the 
troop withdrawal program 
enters its final phase. 
Paralleling these de-
clines in the "secret war' 
is the increased use of sen-
sors and computers re-
quiring fewer men in the 
field and more brainpower 
at headquarters. 
Long-range patrols into 
Cambodia, Laos and even

virtually eliminated by 
the seeding of the Ho hi

Activities of Nixon's aides 
_ President Nixon's promise of a "generation of peace" 
should be considered in the context of the latest war moves 
from Washington. They include: 
VIETNAM: The indefinite postponement of the Paris 
peace talks by Ambassador William Porter. 
This follows on the jingoistic declamations by the 
forme it -CIA agent at the meetings in the past couple of 
months, and his filthy slander of the Versailles confer-
ence last weekend. 
. VIETNAM: The prolonged and massive bombing of 
South Vietnam. 
A new dimension has been added to the barbarous 
destruction of the land, its people; dwellings, means of 
livelihood. Hitherto, the air assaults have been carried 
out from Thailand and the three U.S. carriers in the Gulf 
of Tonkin. Beginning Monday, B-52s recently flown to 
Guam and based there have been assigned to the so-called 
"Limited duration" devastation program. 
GREECE: Establishment of a U.S. naval base at Pir-
aeus. . 
In return for U.S. support, the dictatorial junta has 
agreed that the U.S. establish a home port for the U.S. 
Sixth Fleet and for 10,000 Naval personnel and dependents, 
at the port for Athens. 
SOVIET UNION: In preparation for the Defense 
Department's campaign to extract new billions from the 
Federal Treasury, Secretary Melvin Laird has pitched 
higher the Administration's hysterical warnings of Soviet 
peril and has demanded billions for new weapons, includ-
ing a one-billion-dollar appropriation for a new advanced 
missile submarine:

, Press Politics Editor 
There may be more activity 
- on the outside than on the 
inside at the Republican Na-
tional Convention in August, 
but any demonstrations will be 
peaceful, Dr. Benjamin Spock 
predicted here today. 
The widely recognized pe-
diatrician, running for the 
; -presidency on . the People's 
Party ticket, said anticipated 
protests in San Diego are 
"well ajong, in plannings." 
Permits Sought 
He said youth groups eve'l 
now are negotiating with offi-. 
dials there for permits am 
other arrangements necessary 
to conduct "nonviolent" dem-
onstrations at the convention. 
"It won't be a civil disobedi-
ence type of thing," he ex-
plained. Instead, he insisted, it 
will be an orderly attempt to 
"keep the pressure on" in 
demands for troop withdraw-
als and peace. 
Spock said he Is not aware of 
what might occur at the Dem-
ocratic convention in Miami 
Beach, but he described the 
1968 demonstrations in Chica-
;, go as "infinitely worthwhile." 
. "They radicalized tens of. 
� millions of young people," said 
Spock. "It was brutal . . . 
� America will never be the 
tame." 
� Spock, one of the godfathers 
of the youth protest move-
ment, was in Pittsburgh to 
rustle up not only interest in 
his candidacy, but also signa-
tures on petitions, yequired to 
put his name on the ballot.

He also would withhold eco-

Spock contended it was "out- .

others to impute treasonous 
motives to war critics. 
"The American people voted  
for his (Haldeman'S) boss be-
cause Nixon promised a quick 
end to the war in Vietnam," 
said Speck. "I hope American 
people won't be intimidated by 
that kind of rubbish."

The article, which is entitled 
"Vietnamization of the Foreign

the owner of the file will not 
make his information public 
because he is a "supporter of 
the President's Vietnam policy

WITH THE PASSING of an-
other Christmas, joyous for 
some and not so happy for oth-
ers, my thoughts turn to our 
prisoners of war in Vietnam and 
the cumulative casualty lists 
since the beginning of our folly 
in that tragic land. 
Since 1961, 45,626 of our 
youth have died and another 
302,367 are listed as wounded in 
a jungle war fought for unattain-
able and mistaken objectives. 
The cruel drama of this re-
pulsive war, together with the 
fateful decisions taken during 
the Kennedy administration, has 
never been more vividly por-
trayed than in NBC's "Vietnam 
Hindsight," a remarkable two-
part documentary which strip-,
away all of the noble self-
serving rhetoric and bared the 
bones of an unspeakable trage-
dy. , 
First With Diem 
� IN THE Eisenhower adminis-
tration, several hundred U.S. ad-
visers were in South Vietnam to 
assist Ngo Dinh Diem, the first 
provisional president who was 
afterward reelected in 1961. 
President Diem was an ex-
traordinarily strong ruler and a 
despot in deed and fact. Eisen-
hower promised Diem financial 
aid and military training for 
Diem's Army, provided South 
Vietnam's ruler made a number 
of indicated land and other re-
forms. Sadly, no reforms were 
ever made. � 
In the United States, Diem 
had the strong support of Joseph 
P. Kennedy, patriarch of the 
family, the late Cardinal Francis 
Spellman together with organi-
zations of Americans determined 
to "stop communism" in South-
east Asia. 
Later, Vice President Lyndon 
Johnson was to � call Diem "the 
Winston Churchill of Southeast 
Asia." 
Pressures Greiv 
FOLLOWING John F. Kenne-
dy's election in 1960, the pres-
sures for U.S. intervention be-
came greater. By 1963, we had 
16,000 troops in South Vietnam 
and were facing some very diffi-
cult decisions indeed 
Jack Kennedy was a sorely. 
troubled man as he contemplat-
ed his earlier statements that the 
struggle in Asia was net worth 
the life of a single American, and 
the growing awareness that the 
United States had become pre-
cariously involved. 
His chief concerns arose 
from Diem's absolutism, rumors 
of a planned Coup against Diem 
and the chilling news that Sai-
gon was losing the war. 
Within the White House. 
Kennedy advisers were divided 
on how to proceed.. After many 
fact finding missions to South 
Vietnam and long consultations 
with Ambassador Henry Cabot 
Lodge, a reluctant and torment-
ed Kennedy -decided that Diem 
must go.

Bloody Plot 
�THE CIA'S principal agent in 
Saigon had been in close contact 
with Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh, 
leader of the plot against Diem. 
He informed "Big Minh" that the 
signals were green and on the 
first days of November, 1963, 
the Diem regime was over-
thrown. 
Although President Diem and 
his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, had 
been offered safe conduct by 
Ambassador Lodge, Gen. Minh, 
by a vote of the conspirators, or-
dered their assassination. A 
third brother, Ngo Dinh Can, 
was also executecion May 9. 
Their blood was on our 
hands. In effect and by not op-
posing the coup, the White 
House had decreed their fate. 
Within three weeks of Presi-
dent Diem's murder; John F. 
Kennedy � 35th President of 
the United States � was shot. 
and fatally wounded by an as-
sassin as he rode in a motorcade 
in downtown Dallas.

A Canadian Perspective 
Amnesty When? 
Toronto 
At his November 12 press conference, Mr. Nixon was 
asked if, once the war was ended, he would grant am-
nesty to young American men who went abroad to 
avoid the military draft. He was .obviously unpre-
pared for the question. He had no circumlocutions or 
rhetoric at hand. He replied, "No." 
There are approximately 50,000 American war re-
sisters in Canada, most of them "guilty" of breach of 
Selective Service or military law. They have been flow-
ing across the border in a steady stream since the mid-
sixties. Canada has granted those who qualify by edu-
cation, skills, job offers, etc., "landed immigrant 
status" leading to citizenship. No question may be 
asked concerning their draft or military status in the 
process of "landing." Once landed, they are not ex-
traditable by Canadian-US treaty. They have not com-
mitted an offence punishable within Canada. 
They are a mixed lot. Some are educated, reflective 
young men who after attending Vietnam war sit-ins, 
rapping with their political science professors, and 
hassling the Selective Service system as long as pos-
sible, have come to Canada prepared and have as-
similated quickly. Others, less privileged, poorly edu-
cated, who got caught up in military service and who 
split for Canada impulsively when on order to Viet-
nani, have naturally had greater difficulty in adapting. 
What the articulate among them are saying goes 
something like this: "Amnesty is not ouF problem; it 
is the problem of guilt-ridden American liberals. We 
have done nothing for which we need to accept for-
giveness. In a choice between being criminals in South-
east Asia, being treated as criminals in American pris-
ons and stockades, and a new life in Canada-. we 
chose Canada. The land of the free and the home of 
the 'brave has killed, crippled, jailed and exiled thou-
sands of its young. Those Americans who find this 
fact hard to live with will try to make partial amends 
by amnesty or 'second chance' legislation. The likeli-
hood of their succeeding in time to benefit any appreci-
able number is negligible. If and when amnesty comes, 
we shall be launched on Canadian careers; have Cana-
dian Wives, and Canadian children. Amnesty will mean 
being able to take the kids to visit their grandmother, 
instead of her having to visit them here. Americans in 
Canada with their heads screwed on right are not 
making any decisions concerning their future based on 
talk of amnesty." 
Rather than amnesty, war resisters in Canada prefer 
to focus upon what they call "repatriation." Repatria-
tion is the right to return to the United States without 
any recrimination for breach of Selective Service or 
military law. It is amnesty with the Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
cepting forgiveness removed. Discussion of repatria-
tion among expatriates is usually in the context of the 
realities of the ongoing war. All they see happening is 
a change in the color of skin among some of the 
ground troops. American boys are being returned in 
time and in sufficient numbers to affect the '72 elec-
tion, while the horror continues unabated. Those who 
took a stand against the war and chose exile are saying 
that when the war ends completely � all troops, planes, 
advisors and CIA agents withdrawn � then and ohly 
then, the right of exiles to return may be considered 
along with other matters � US war guilt, release of 
political prisoners, reparation to the peoples of Indo-
China. Repatriation is not thought of exclusively in 
terms of the return of exiles. The word is used to in-
clude the release of prisoners and the surfacing of 
those who have gone underground. 
If the reaction of exiles is negative to amnesty pro-
posals implying their guilt, imagine their, feelings 
about proposals which link them with war 'planners 
and criminals. There are suggestions abroad which call 
for amnesty for all war-related offences � for the Lt. 
Calleys as well as draft and military offenders. As a 
Women's Strike for Peace newsletter recently ex-
pressed it, "This would solve the problem of war guilt 
by sweeping everyone under the rug together � those 
who refused to kill along with those who killed indis-
criminately. Then we could forget the past and march 
on united to even greater national glory." 
The ideal of repatriation which the exiles hold up as 
just will never be realized. The US is not going to con-
fess criminality, stage its own Nuremberg trial, and 
acknowledge the right of unqualified restitution to 
those who broke its laws resisting this war. The US 
may grant amnesty when it is politically expedient to 
do so, and when it can pass it off as a gesture of mag-
nanimity and strength. That is what Senator Robert 
Taft, Jr. seems to have in mind, when he proposes 
amnesty for these "however misguided" young men 
who "are entitled to a second chance." 
When will this be? Perhaps when the political fight 
to renew Selective Service legislation the next time 
around does not seem worth the effort. 1974? A ges-
ture of largeness of heart in the bicentennial year of 
1976? In the meantime, young Americans in Canada 
are not holding their breath. Nor are they, in the nice 
phrase of one Vietnam veteran and deserter, "standing 
here at the border crying."

Cable from John F. Kennedy 
to Henry Cabot Lodge. 
Well, last night gave us part 
II of the illustrated Pentagon 
Papers, otherwise known as 
Hindsight. And if anything, 
NBC's second episode was 
More fascinating than the 
" first. 
Yesterday's segment dealt 
with the events, the decisions, 
and the non-decisions that led 
up to the death of Diem. It 
focused less heavily on early 
Sixties footage than did the 
previous segment, preferring 
..to concentrate almost exclu� 
sively on testimony from men 
who were then involved in our 
- complicity to overthrow a 
� government that had turned 
against us. And according to 
the show, our complicity was 
well nigh wholehearted by the 
time the coup of the generals 
took place. 
� Chief among the subjeris 
.1( was Lt. Col. Lucien Conein, a 
key CIA agent in Vietnam who 
'now claims that as early as 
.August, 1963, he was given or-
ders not to thwart a possible 
Coup of the Diem regime. It's 
hard to remember when there 
has been a more avid testifier 
. than Colonel Conein, or one 
more anxious to relay contem-
porary history as he knew it 
and lived it.

�was growing increasingly dis-
satisfied with Diem. He was 
getting repressive, he insti-
tuted martial law, Buddhist 
monks were immolating them-
selves, . it was embarrassing. 
Also, Diem was starting to 
make deals with North Viet-
nam, and this was more than 
a little distressing to our gov-
�ernment. "His brother told 
me" said Colonel Conein, "that

people of North Vietnam. So 
the generals knew this too. 
And they considered this a 
danger, because what were 
they fighting for if he negotiat-
ed behind their back?" 
What indeed? Diem wanted 
above everything else to reuni-
fy his country. Mr. Kennedy 
and his advisors were appalled 
at the idea of supporting a 
man who would sell them 
down the river. But the first 
coup was never pulled off. 
Robert Kennedy wanted ta get 
out of Vietnam totally arid 
some advisers concurred that 
withdrawal would be prefera-
ble to supporting Diem. Only 
Robert S. McNamara wanted 
to delve a little deeper into the 
situation, and tripped off on a 
visit to Vietnam. According to 
Roger Hilsman, President 
Kennedy let him because he 
wanted to avoid divisiveness 
among his cabinet.

Vietnam; we had Henry Cabot

stay. And, as the program im-
plied, by that time there were 
only two alternatives: to re-
form Diem or to overthrow 
Diem. We withdrew our aid to 
Diem: As George Ball said, 
this was a hint to the rebel-
lions generals "to go ahead 
and try another government 
. This was inevitable." -

Watching last night's show, 
one was almost completely un-, 
aware that it was a documen-
tary. And that's probably the 
highest compliment you can 
pay any documentary. If this 
year's economy has resulted 
in a. paucity of news specials, 
and the political pressures in 
an even greater paucity of 
good news specials, Hindsight' 
more than made up for the 
deficiency. 
�o--
it's exceedingly difficult to 
speak about the unspeakable. 
WBAL-TV aired a children's 
special (translate "cartoon") 
last night. Very likely the 
crudest animation I have seen 
in a long time; clumsy draw-
ings, insipid story line, and a 
few sad voices, the most nota-

Conreid. There's nothing like

M C Claims 
lem Death 
Inside Story 
Seventeen - generals and - 
colonels of the South Viet-
namese army voted unani-
mously to kill President Ngo 
Dinh Diem in 1963, and were 
not particularly discouraged 
by a high - ranking U.S. 
CIA official, an NBC report 
scheduled to be telecast to-
night discloses. 
, The report is Part 2 of "An 
NBC News White Paper: Viet-
nam Hindsight,'" and deals 
.with the origins of America's 
involvement in that Southeast 
Asia, country. 
The report presents the first 
supposed inside � account of . 
Diem's assassination, disguised 
as a political coup, and in-
cludes statements by Alvin 
Davis, associate producer of 
the program, and Lt. Col. Lu-
cien Conch), the key CIA man 
in South Vietnam during the 
time of the coup. 
It is "quite inconceivable" 
:to Conein that Gen. Maxwell 
;Taylor and others were not 
!aware of the timing of the 
coup, Conein says on the pro-
gram, which depicts Diem's 
death as a Diem maneuver 
that backfired. 
� The decision to kill Diem 
Is reported to have developed 
over a series of eight meet-
ings and arguments, and, fi-
nally, a vote. Three who would 
have voted to save Diem were 
'assassinated before the vote 
was .taken. Four others, in-
cluding the present ' Prime 
Minister, Khiem, were deliber-
ately excluded from the vote. 
Many among the 17, how-
ever, wanted him killed from 
the start, and the only over-
heard phrase spoken in French 
rather than in Vietnamese was 
by Big Minh, might-have-been 
presidential contender in the. 
October, 1971, election, woh 
said, "The pig must be killed." 
After that, the vote went 
like this: Big Minh: kill; Gen.. 
Don: kill; Gen. Xuan, kill. Col. � 
Nghia, kill. At the end there 
was total unanimity, and a vow 
of silence was taken, The si-
lence is to be broken tonight, 
Davis says. 
Diem had asked for full 
honors, and a "graceful" exit 
from �Vienam to exile in an-
other country, but refused to 
-
ask Big Minh�who in turn 
was furious at the 'slight. 
Between 6 and 9 p.m. Nov. 2, 
the day of Diem's death, he 
refused again to speak to 
Minh, then finally spoke to 
him on the telephone, but 
Minh, outraged, hung up. On 
the third try, Diem gave in,. 
asking only for safe conduct. 
At this point Col. Conein 
said he was told by Amtas-
sador Henry Cabot Lodge not 
to instigate, encourage or dis-
courage a coup, which was in 
the planning stages through-
out October, 1963. But Diem, 
Conein said, had his own plans 
for a phony coup, after which 
he and his family would be 
brought in honors, by popular 
acclaim, back to Saigon from 
their place of exile, Pleiku. 
What happened, apparently, 
is that both the phony coup 
and the real one came off at 
the same time, fooling Diem 
and his brother, Ngo Dinh 
Nhu. 
Conein, in an attempt to get 
Diem out of the country, says 
he asked his embassy for a 
plane, but was told that he 
would have to wait 24 hours 
for it. 
"I spoke for the U.S. gov-
ernment and I was authorized, 
and I informed the junta' 
(Diem's organization) that I 
had an aircraft, but it would 
take me 24 hours to have that 
aircraft on the ground." 
"Instead?" Davis asked. 
"Instead, he was shot by a 
major in the Vietnamese 
army," Conein says on the 
telecast. .-

But I find him far from ready to

In 30 months of power, with Ins "vietnaraization of 
the. war" aimed at implementing the "Nixon doctrine" 
in this part of the world, President Nixon not only obstin-
ately continued and-prolonged the' war of aggression in 
South Vietnam, but. also embarked on new military ad-i 
Veeturea...teeainst the Democratic Republic of Viet-
nam, overtly extended the U.S. war of aggression into 
Cambodia and Laos, whose undertakings were accompan-
ied by innumerable crimes against the peoples of the three 
Indochinese countries, and seriously jeopardized peace in 
Southeast Asia. � 
, I. In carrying out "Vietuarnization," the Nixon ad-
ministration prolongs the U.S. war of aggression with 
countless concomitant fresh crimes against the South 
Vietnamese people. 
1)- The Saigon array feverishly beefed up and an im-
portant contingent of U.S.. troops maintained in South 
Vietnam. 
Under the U.S. plan, the Saigon junta feverishly draft-
ed. troops from 15-year-old adolescents to fifty-year-olds-
to raise the strength of their army from half a rnillioni 
to a million-odd men. Besides, it reorganized the police 
into an armed force with 20 men per village, 300 per. dis-
trict, 3,003 per province, and tens of thousands at the 
central echelon to lay an iron grip upon the population 
and repress. them. Over a million people, mostly aged, 
Women and children were forced into "civil defense" 
units. 
. With a great sense of urgency, the U.S. equipped the 
Saigon army with all types of weapons and war means. 
Since the beginning of the "Vietnamization" program 
alone, it has supplied 610,000 M.16 rifles, 20,00 machine-
guns, 34,000 grbriade-throwers, 870 guns, 10,000 81mm mor-
tars, 210 M41. tanks, Lem armored vehicles, 44,000 military 
lorries and 40,000 transceivers.... 
� As regards the Saigon air force, the U.S. provided it 
with some 850 planes of various types and has intended to 
bring this figure to 1,200 by 1972. To the Saigon navy, the 
U.S. turned over an estimated 1600 shipe� and craft of 
different kinds. The annual credit allocated by the Nixon 
administration to the Saigon junta for general expenses 
was brought to 2 billion dollars. 
Up to June 30, 1971, the Nixon administration still 
kept in South Vietnam about 240,000 U.S. troops, not in--
eluding nearly 20,000 men in the 7th Fleet and Coast-guard 
units and 32,000 others in the USAF stationed at American' 
airbases in 'rhetoric!. 
2) Relentless furtherance of "pacification" work 
backbone of the Nixon administration's "Vietuarnination" 
along with intensified bombardments and sweeps 
against civilians. � � 
The U.S. government has just earmarked an additional 
$1 billion and entrusted the U.S. Defense Department and 
ly in South Vietnam. . 
. The French newspaper Le Monde. on 'July 29, 1970 
stated: in 1970, on an average, the U.S. discharged on the 
Indochina theatre a quantity ef explosive equivalent to 11 
20-kiloton A-bombs, the sort released by the U.S. on Hiro-
-shima in 1915. - 
The U.S. command in Saigon 'unilaterally delineated 
"free fire zones," making of entire large populated-areas 
its targets.. ..B-52 strategic bombers, in particular, 
redoubled their carpet-bombings - without distinction of 
targets. In March 1039,� right after taking office, U.S. 
Defense Secretary Me Laird decided to ask for an addi-
tional credit of 52 million dollars in 1959-70 to increase 
B-52 activites from 1,503 to 1,853 missions a month. . . . 
Over 2,500 artillery pieces of all calibers., positioned 
everywhere on the mainland and based on warships. 
Everyday, tens of thousands of shells of different calibers 
were pumped into villages and hamlets. Quang Tri alone, 
in a single day, received over 20,003 shells... 
Sweeps against civilians, villages and hamlets 
' In the period under review (January, 1939-June, 1971) 
U.S.-Saigon and satellite troops mounted over 50,033 
mopping-up operations of battalion size upwards through-
out South Vietnam, blotted out more than one-fourth of 
the total of hamlets in the South, and perpetrated hundreds 
of new Son My-type massacres, many of which had been 
disclosed by GI's themselves. 
..In the two provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien, 
our of 870 hernlets, nearly 500 were levelled.,... 
� . In Quang Da province, till late 1970, out of 441 hamlets, 
351 were .erased. Bien Ban district- had 20 of its 27 vil-
lages flattened: Go Noi area, composed of 6 villages with 
40,000 inhabitants. was razed to the ground. The sur-

the CIA with the direct conduct of' a new "pacification" 
effort called "rural defense and local development" pro-
gram, beginning May 1, 1971. According to an assigned 
quote, within a year, the Saigon agents have to liqUidate 
14,003 patriots and force four million more people into the 
"civil defense" organization.� 
Following were the principal measures taken to imple-
ment the Nixon administration's "pacification" program': 
In 20 months under Nixon, the U.S. used in South Viet-
nam an amount of explosive equal to the total of U.S. 
bombs expended in both 4 years' World .War II and two 
years' Korean War (Bomb tonnage used in the Europe. and 
Pacific theatres: 2,682,244 tons; that used. in .Korea: 
635,003 tons). 
- Under Johnson, the yearly average of U.S. bombs used 
in both South and North Vietnam ran to 800,000 tons. Under 
Nixon, the qtiantity of bombs dropped on South, Vietnam 
alone yearly average 1,377,000 tons. According to. the U.S. 
Defense Department's data from the beginning of 1959 to 
August 1970, the U.S.. rained 2,131,334- tons of bombs and 
fired 2,292,125 tons of shells in the Indochina theatre, most-
, � 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
were turned into no-man's land. In Ben Tre provincenm 
1969-1970 alone, the U.S.-Saigon troops launched 6,003 
sweeps, slaying 4,300 people, -maiming 3,590, imprisoning 
aver 4,990, burning nearly 4,003 houses and levelling bun-
lreds of hamlets. 
The periphery of Saigon, stretching CO miles from Sai-
�;on to Tay Ninh, was cleared off. Twenty villages along 
the Vain Co Dung river, Long An province, were changed 
into deserts. 
Many an operation lasted for months on end, such as 
the raid beginning December, 1958, and ending late in 
April, 1959, on numerous areas in My Tho arid Ben The 
provinces, during which the soldiery killed and wounded 
almost 3,039 people, burnt 1,000 dwellings, blotted out 
(lozens of hamlets and herded tens of thousands_of villag-
ers into concentration camps.... 
...The "II Minh campaign" from Des:sernhner let, 1.0i73 
to late April 1971 in Ca Mau and Rach Gin, supported by 
hundreds of U.S. aircraft and artillery pieces, during 
which the troops, according to their own profession;� 
murdered 2,411 civilians, injured hundreds .of others, ab-
ducted hundreds of people, impounded tens of thousands 
in concentration camps and set on fire tens of square 
miles of forests.... In Ca Mau 'alone, from pril 1970 to 
pril 1971; the raiders raped or killed 575 people- of female 
Sex, including children and wounded 334 others.. . 
Data from the U.S. Senate, stated (though still below 
the reality) that the 'U.S.-Saigon forces in 1970 killed or. 
i.njured 125,000 people, one-third being children under 13 
;years of age. 
� I Colby, the man in charge of the US. � "pacification" 
program in South Vietnam, admitted on April 21, 1971, 
that from the beginning of the war to April, 1971, 5,900,090 
civilians (one-third of the South Vietnamese population) 
were killed, injured or made homeless. 
3) Stepping up population concentration to control and 
exploit them and to squeeze manpower and material 
sources for the U.S. war of tiggressien. ' 
The U.S.-Saigon forces carried out indiscriminate 
bombings and strafings, chemical sprays and sweeps 
against the civilians, used , series of huge bulldozers 
of over 20 tons with special "Rome plow blades" against 
houses, gardens and hamlets, thereby levelling whole vil-
lages into no-man's lands. . . 
With inch atrocities, millions of inhabitants were 
made homeless end forced to leave their villages, and 
mine away in disguised concentration camps. . . 
Once the people were cooped up there, "purification'.' 
programs started and "Vietcong" or "Vietcong" suspects 
were exectited: 
A network of spies, scouts, civil guards, policemen and 
"pacification" men was set up in such car:erre,tocenteol 
and supervise the detainees and spot, arrest and assass-
inate those who did not submit to the enemy during the 
so-called 'Phoenix" Or "Swan" campaigns. 
About the "Phoenix" campaign, the Baltimore Sun 
wrote on May 26, 1971: the campaign dragged on for 3 or 5 
years and an average of Loo people 'were killed or jailed 
in a month, surpassing the plan by 1,223. In Ka, a monthly 
average of 1,850 _people were disposed of. . . . 
Early in 1971, some. 10,090 minority peonle in CO ham-
lets on the High Plateaux were forced into concentration 
camps in the lowland... � 
_ Those who demanded to return to their villages and 
refused to suffer such harsh conditions were persecuted. 
A case in point was the airbornbing of 359 detainees in 
Kong-Ho-Rirh concentrating-1 cerrsa in nreseeturret ply/I:errs 
on Feb. 22, 1939. 
Repression and persecution in urban c-enters. 
The U.S.-Saigon rulers also carried out the "pacifica-
tion" plan in urban areas... . 
In operation "Thach Loc" "fa) in Hue-1 Q.ZanZ.7, Ti 
provincial capital and Dong 114 township, the enemy 
arrested, tortured or threw in jail oven 30,C90 COiC arid 
forcibly enlisted 1,599 young people.; . . 
All repressive measures were taken against students 
movements, such as closing down schools and forcing 
them to take military training..or go into the army, en-
circling or brutalizing their meetings, demonstrations or 
sit-ins. 
The crackdown of the press was still more blatant. In 
1959, the Saigon papers were confiscated 40 times... 
In 1970, 230 times, and in the first six months of 1971, 
250 times. The Ting Sang (Morning News) has been barnted 
127 times since March 13, 1970. ' 
Higher taxes were imposed on townspeople. 
Living, costs rose in proportion. According to official 
statistics, in 1959 the living costs shot up 09 percent as 
compared with 1958. In 1970 they again soared by 70 per-
cent. 100 kg, (220 lbs.) of rice of the best quality in 1969 
cost 590 piastres but this year 10,090 piastres, the price of 
an egg grew from one piastre to 22 piasters. 
The U.S. magazine Look VTOtC on June 11, 1970�since 
,1965 (when the U.S. expeditionary corps was directly in-
volved in the war of aggression) the living cOsts in South 
Vietnam had gone 900 percent higher. . 
4) Continued chemical warfare cotsplenel with at-
tempts to deceive public oniniore 
Alongside bombings and strafings, the Nixon atins,in-
istration Continued chemical warfare...Toxics laid 
waste over 1,880,000 hectares (one hectare equals 2.47 
acre) of rice and 'other crops, orchards and jungles: 
poisoned nearly 900,000 people, mostly women, chAren 
hundreds of them lethally. . . 
...The .U.S. wantonly lobbed gas or chemicals, bon-lbs � 
and shells on villages. Gas and toltic chemicals v,Tre - 
also sprayed by U.S, and Saigon troops into ur:dergro::r,d 
trenches, shelters, houses, wells and other drinkirn 
water sources during their actions. In the 1970-1071 liskell 
year, the Nixon administration spent 8 billion dollars on 
chemical warfare and has planned to drop 1,300,000 more 
gallons of "Blue" and "White" agents on South' Viet-
namese soil. 
Since the beginning of this year, U.S. aircraft have 
been flying more chemical sprays over numerous areas in 
the provinces of Quang ,Tri (March, 1971), Thna Thien 
(May, 1971) Phu Yen (March and April, 1971), Tra Vinh 
(February, 1571), Rach Gia (February, 1971), Ca Mau 
. . 
(January, March and April, 1971), etc. 
...The Nixon administration is training the Saigon 
army and equipping it with chemical warfare facilities 
to continue such atrocities in South Vietnam. 
The continued and intensified use of chemical products 
in high concentration and on vast areas for many years by 
the U.S: in South Vietnam has had serious effects on the 
population and the environment there, effects unforesee-
able for the immediate or distant future. 
The U.S. chemical war crimes in South Vietnam were 
exposed nnd strongly condemned by the Paris Inter-
national Conference of Scientists (December 1970) and 
the second session of the International Commission for 
Inquiry into U.S. war crimes held in Oslo (June, 1970). 
� Harsher prison regime and medieval torture 
Beside a sum of 86,761,900 for paying U.S. advisors on� 
prison and covering the cost of the maintaining of prisons 
in South Vietnam, the Nixon administration has spent 103 
more million dollars for the enlargement of the prison 
system. 
After the denunciation of the 150 "tiger cages" in Con 
Son island (July, 1970) the Nixon administration, on the 
one 'hand; ordered the abolition of the "tiger cage" re-
gime, but on the other; has secretly built 334 new "tiger 
cages.".. . 
AFP estimated on April 29, 1971, at 400,000 the South 
Vietnamese prison Phpulation. Current were such horrors 
as applying electricity to the breasts of women detainees

Phain The True, a member of the Saigon "parliament" 
testified that in. the first six months of 1971, in inh Thuan 
province alone, nearly 6,000 civilians were unwarrantedly 
imprisoned and savagely tortured. According to Kieu 
iTiong Thu, a woman member of "parliament," the ward-
*ers at Tan Hiep jail used quick lime and acid against. 
women -prisoners, inflicting grave injuries on many of 
them.

II.Contintitti and serious encroachments on the soir--
: ereigaty and security of the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam. 
In blatant violation, of the U.S. Government's commit-
ment to end definitively an; unconditionally all bombard-
ments and other acts of war against the DfaVN, in the thir-
ty months of its rule, the Nixon administration (ordered 
the following):.:. .aircraft of various kinds, including 
B-52 stategic bombers, and its artillery based south of the 
demarcation river and on the Seventh .Fleet in repeated. 
reconnaissance flights and murderous bombing and shell-
ing missions against many heavily populated areas in 
-"North Vietnam. . . 
U.S. planes flew 31,215 reconnaissance sorties over 25 
provinces and Cities in North Vietnam, and the tempo 
of such flights had not ceased growing: From a monthly 
average of 650 in 1959, it went up to 1,150 in 1970 and 1,000 
in the first half of 1971: 
U.S, tactical aircraft made 2,714 and B-52 strategic 
planes 601 strikes releasing a total of 184,167 demolition 
and blast bombs, 2,853 cluster-bomb units (CBU) many 
-missiles, rockets and 20:nm shells on many populated 
areas from Vinh Liah (17th parallel) to Vinh Phu province 
(21st 'parallel) and even letting off missiles" and rockets 
on the outskirts of Hanoi and Haiphong. : 
On March 21, 1971,40 waves of jet planes includ-
ing F4, F-105 and other types in 15 air actions in succes-. 
sion dropped 150 demolition and blast bombs and 22 CBUs, 
�fired many missiles, rockets and 207am Shelia on popu-
lation centers in Ky Anh and Hnoug Nile districts; Ha Thin 
province, killing or wounding over 30 civilians, destroying 
27 houses and a primary school. 
--... The rate of U.S. air strikes increased day after day. In 
1059: the monthly average of tactical aircraft missions 
was 50, that of B-52's was four. 
,In 1970: the figures rose respectively by 150 and 45. 
. times. In the first half of 1071 the monthly rate*was 137 
times for tactical planes and 46 for B-52s. - 
'� - III. Direct inVasions of ,Cranbesilia and Laos extend 
the Nixon administration's war of aggression to the 
whole Irealechina. 
. To salvage its "Vietnamization" program in South 
Vietnam,. the Nixon administration not only continued to 
-violate the sovereignty and threaten the security of the 
:Democratic Republic of Vietnam but also eapaucled the 
aggressive war to Cambodia and Laos, thereby adding to 
its records fresh war crimes against the Indochinese. . 
On March 13, 1570,- following the U.S.-masterminded 
ceup d'ettat against Head oinStato Norodom Siixnouc Can 
Nixon administration set up a lackey administration in 
Phnom Penh. At the end of April 1970, it hurled tens of 
thousands of U.S. and Saigon troops into an invasion 
of Cambodia.... 
Thea Nixon administration continued to introduce 
military personnel, weapons and strategic goods into 
Vietniane to step up its special war in Laos. The 
Central Intelligence Agency-speot hundreds of millions of 
dollars on the organizing, training and officering of the 
mercenary army of the Moo nationality headed by Wing 
Pao for inroads into the liberated mile of Laos. The U.S. 
also brought 17 battalions and continued to being more 
battalions of Thai mercentaries to Laos to join the rightist 
array.... 
The U.S. kept a high level of bombing in Laos. U.S. 
senator Paul McCloskey recently disclosed that the ton-
nage of bombs dropped on Laos had doubled since Nixon 
assumed office. Since September 1970, it has been flying 
a daily average of 500-000 tactical aircraft and 50-60 B-52 
missions against Laos., 
Early in February, 1971, the Nixon administration 
mobilized. nearly 2,000 planes, more than 40,000 U.S. and 
Saigon troops in aggression against Southern Laos. How-
ever, the disorderly rout of this aggressive army after 
losing an important part of its manpower vividly demon-
strated the bankruptcy of "Vietnamization," whose pur-
pose is to shift on to the Saigon army the war responsibil-
ity of U.S. troops. � 
Along with these � criminal -operations, the *Nixon ad-
ministration has' endeavoured to instigate the *rightist 
party in Vientiane to torpedo every effort of the Lao Pa.-: 
triotic Front to solve the Laos issue peacefully. . 
IV. Universal indignation of the heinous crimes of U.S. 
imperialism and tie Vietnamese people's resolve to 
carry on their resistance till final victor/. 
The past 30 months of the Nixon administration have 
been thirty months of progress along the path of the neo-* 
col,onialist War of aggression against Viet Nam and the 
-whole Indochinese peninsula.... . 
According to the estimates of William Wallace Ford, 
retired. U.S.' Army Brigadier (New York Times July 2, 
1970) in South Viet Nam alone, the U.S. war of aggression 
has had the following. consequences: 300,00 civilians 
killed, over 1,000,050 others injured, 105,050 incapacitated, 
253,000 orphans and 6,050,000 D.P.s and homeless:. .. 
Wherever and whenever the crimes or U.S. imperial-
ism were brought to light, they triggered off outbursts of 
anger against the Nixon administration's flouting of all 
:norms of morality and international practice and .untold 
crimes against the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Cam-
bodia. These have played havoc among .the present gen-
erations of these countries and will have incalculable ef-
fects -on the future generations. They have leached the 
level of genocide and of systematic destruction' of life and 
the living environments. . 
Together with the progressives in the United States 
who have been courageously and persistently pushing up 
their actions against the policy of aggression and the 
crimes of war of the U.S. ruling circles in Indochina, a 
front�of the world people has practically taken shape to 
back the just fight of the Indochinese peoples under the 
comMon slogan urging the Nixon administration to stop 
immediately its aggression in Viet Nam and Indochina, 
bring home speedily all the U.S. troops and let th Viet-
namese and. the other .peOples of Indochina settle their 
own affairs without U.S. interference. . � � 
Recently, the disclosure- Of the Pentagon's "secret 
study" on Viet Nam by the American press has further 
substantiated the denunciations : made by the Govern-
ment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam- over many 
years past concerning the root cause of the Vietnam war, 
and the aggressive nature of the United States. 
For their part, the Vietnamese people from South to

countries and the forces of-peace and democracy through-

EARLY three million Americans 
have now served in Vietnam. Of 
these, about 600 have been Foreign 
Service officers. 
Thus, roughly .20 percent of the 
Foreign Service has been exposed to 
many of the stimuli which have 
turned "nice" kids from Middle 
America into peace freaks, hawks, 
junkies, and even assassins. 
For the FSOs, however, the ex-
perience generally has not had the 
radicalizing effect that it has had on 
many of the military men. The 
FSOs tended to be older and less 
malleable than the American sol-
diers in Vietnam, and their personal 
thought processes were more subtle 
and less striking than those of the 
GIs. Some FSOs were essentially 
untouched by the whole experience, 
reacting no differently than if they 
had been in Paris or Rome. But for 
most, and especially the young, Viet-
nam meant change. It meant a 
violent breaking away from the tra-
ditional diplomatic life and an ex-
posure to the realities of war. 
About 350 FSOs have been as-
signed to the Pacification program 
(CORDS). They functioned as ad-
visors to the Vietnamese civilian 
and military administration in an 
effort to make the Government of 
Vietnam a viable force in the coun-
tryside. Few, if any, had any back-

sive reports on these apparent war 
crimes he investigated in Vietnam. 
As far as he knows, no action has 
ever been taken to punish the 
guilty. Because he is a supporter of 
the President's Vietnam policy, and 
because he fears the effect on that 
policy of additional war crime con-
troversy, he has not chosen to make 
his information public. He also is 
undoubtedly aware of the negative 
result disclosure would have on his 
career prospects. 
His example is extreme, but it 
points up the fundamental proposi-
tion that serving in Vietnam is not 
like serving elsewhere. 
With respect to no other country 
could it be said that perhaps 20 
percent of the FSOs had experi-
mented with soft drugs, but that is 
the case in Vietnam. And in no 
other country do FSOs have their 
own personal automatic weapons 
and receive training in how to fire a

Nevertheless, FSOs have been 
affected by .the same pressures that 
have been widely reported in rela-
tion to the military. 
Many served in proto-combat 
roles with command responsibility. 
While not participants, they re-

what often seemed like the unneces-

11.%.ichard Nixon does not intend "to see this nation accept the first 
defeat in its proud 190-year history," and the corollary of that is that 
he does not intend to preside over the collapse of our client regimes in 
Indochina. But in the modern world not even the most super super-
power can indefinitely maintain 'satellite governments 8000 miles 
from its shores (6000 miles, if we are thinking of Hawaii). And. 
even assuming the viability and the reliability of the governments Of 
our choosing and our financing in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambo-
dia, the .PLneiican people �are bound to become increasingly skeptical 
about whether the huge invcstinents required are worth it. Other 
great powers have played this game --,the French, the Italians, the - 
British, the Germans. Japan tried .to make it work as late as .1940; 
Portugal is 'still at it: But remote control by money and technology has 
a limited life. The Nixon Doctrine will soon seem aS antiquated as. 
. Empire or. the co-prosperity sphere. Meanwhile, the President thinks 
he can pull it off: winning a civil war in Southeast Asia by repeated, 
'heavy doses of US air and naval power, and aid, and disarming his 
domestic critics by keeping the casualty rate low and bringing most of . 
the combat troops home. In the short run- he might succeed -7 getting 
Thieu through '72 and Nixon too. In the longer run he won't. The 
Asians will take charge.. - 
"Cambodia is the Nixon Doctrine in its purest form," the President 
told the press on November 12. It took form initially with the in-
vasion of Cambodia by US forces in April 1970, Staged, the Presi-
dent reported, "to protect our men who are in Vietnam and to guar-
antee the cOntinued success of our withdrawal and Vietnamization . 
program." A week later, he remarked that if he .were to follow the 
advice of the doves and simply withdraw from Indochina, the. enemy 
would "come into Vietnam and massacre. the civilians there. by the 
millions.": Four days later he judged the Cambodian expedition an 
"enormous success," so much so that he thereupon requested an ad-
ditional. $250 million in aid for Cambodia (about $240 million more 
than was authorized the preceding year), and. invited "third doun7 
tries ..*. to furnish Cambodia with troops or material." The $250: 
million,. the' President said, was "probably the best investment in 
foreign assiStance that the US has made in my political lifetime." In. 
the following year and a half, he withdrew a substantial number of 
t riu 
Approved for for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/30 CO2792462 
combat soldiers from Vietnam. He also requested $341 
million for Cambodia for fiscal '72, which suggests 
that the, fewer the number of men whose withdrawal 
must be protected, the more it will cost. The $341 mil-
/ lion is not all that will be spent, of course. It does not 
si include CIA operations, or the surplus arms and 
equipment the" US will turn over to the Cambodians. 
Nobody knows how much in' the way of surplus arms 
has already been dumped into Southeast Asia. Sena-
'tor Symington has been trying for months to find out, 
without much success. Senator Fulbright has asked for 
a monthly report from the Pentagon on exactly what 
we are doing, what we' are putting into Laos and Cam-
bodia; he is not told. Bureaucracy is expert at passing 
the buck. "A slarge part of the data requested bY you," 
the Pentagon informed Fulbright earlier this month, 
"is not known to the Dept, of Defense because it con-
cerns the operations of other government departments 
or agencies." 
What we do know is that the amount is enormous 
. and the end is not in sight. 'Whatever the Nixon Doc-
trine promises, it doesn't promise total withdrawal. 
"This idea that somehow. or other the Nixon Doctrine 
means that we will not have air or sea power in Asia,-
Mr. Laird says, "is a great mistake because that isn't 
part of the partnership theory under which we � are 
operating." The President adds tivt in the absence of a 
� negotiated settlement, we must keep "a residual force" 
over. there, "in order to continue our role of leaving 
South Vietnam in a position where it would be able to 
defend itself from a Communist. takeover." However, 
that is not Mr. Nixon's only reason., 'A very ,primary 
reason" for keeping a residual force in Vietnam; is that 
we must have "something. to negotiate with, with re-
.gard to our prisoners." Five hundred thous-and Ameri-
can troops could not pry the prisoners loose, but 50,-
000 might help de) it! At no, time has the President 
bothered to acknowledge or treat seriously Hanoi's 
repeated statement that once he sets a withdrawal date, 
it will'provide for the safety of our forces as they pull 
out, guarantee the release of all POWs and prevent 
.reprisals. The President would not like to have it put 
this way, but in effect Hanoi has given him a choice 
between abandoning Thieu or abandoning the pris-
oners. He thinks he dare not give up either; that is 
his dilemma. And not his only dilemma. For his doc-
trthe requires constant transfusions of dollars and arms 
to anti-Communist military regimes in Southeast Asia, 
while he simultaneously seeks a detente with those bil-
lion Chinese, in fear of whom 'the US intervened in 
Indochina a decade ago. 
Some idea of the costs can be glimpsed by suryeying 
past and planned military assistance to the three Indo-
chinese states. The figures the public has access . to 
,understate the reality, for they do not include a variety 
of hidden expenditures. Even so, whereas aid to Cam-
bodia in fiscal 1970 was $8.9 million, two years later 
the requested authorization was over 37 times higher. 
e � 
For Laos, the 1970 aid bill Was $118.4 million; for the 
'coining fiscal year it will be at least $189 million. Mili-
tary aid 'for .South Vietnam in 1970 was $2,049,100,-
000; in fiscal 1972 it is expected to be about tWo and a 
half billion dollars. 
The cost to the Indochinese is incalculable by any 
'dollar measurement; they pay in the currency of refu-
gees, orphans, cripples, corpses. From 1966 until June 
of this year, our fliers had flown 25,546 sorties over 
Cambodia; 280,000 over North Vietnam; 505,000 over 
Laos; 762,650 over South Vietnam. The air war goes 
ahead full speed. We are dropping about 70,000 tons 
of bombs each month over Indochina, and by the end 
of this year twice the weight of bombs will have fallen 
on this area the size of Texas � as were dropped in 
World War II and the Korean war. 
Congress could set the country on a different, less 
.destructive course, but not by such ambiguous and 
open-ended declarations on withdrawal as the one it 
attached to a $21.4 billion bill for weapons and Penta-
gon research, and which the President simply dismissed 
last week as "without binding force or effect." 
. � In 1968, Mr. Nixon said he had a plan to end the 
.war. He 'did; be is following it; it is to. get peace by 
winning the war but without losing the next election � 
a refinement of an early and abandoned Lyndon John-
son plan to let Asians fight Asians. In its "purest 
form," the doctrine is bull.

who - have been burning 
American. ears on the streets 
of Saigon these past few 
:weeks. Tin Sang, the major 
opposition newspaper, is 
run by. a group of .young 
Catholic deputies. 
Even the more moderate 
Catholic politicians in the 
Senate, led by the Senate's 
'Chairman, protested against 
President Thieu's one man 
re-election. A group of 
-young Catholic priests pro-
Aided the opposition with an 
Intellectual backing more 
;radical than that of the. 
Blidelhist monks associated 
with the militant An..Quant 
pagoda. 
It never was true that the 
Catholics, who make up 
one-tenth. . of South Viet-
nam's population of 17 mil-
lion, were all aggresSive 
anti-Communists. This repu-
tation was really won by the 
.Catholic Communities who 
emigrated � to the Smith 
when Vietnam was divided 
into two zones at the Ge-
neva Conference in 1954. 
. Inevitably these groups, 
which resettled as communi-
ties still under the leader-
Ship of their- old parish 
priests, were eager allies of 
the Saigon government; all 
the more so becalise. that 
government was headed 
from 1954 to 1963 by the 
.pious �Catholic Ngo Dinh 
Diem. - 
The Diem gOvernment set-
tled a good many of the ref-
ugees from the North 
around Saigon, and the 
nearness of these .militants,. 
Who were always ready to 
take part in demonstrations 
in the capital, gave the im-
pression of an entirely 
miii-
uon. Why do they think so 
differently from their par-
ents? One very important. 
'reason is that they have 
come to look very critically 
at the whole history of Viet-
namese Cathlicism. 
Catholicism. was, � .of 
course, brought to Vietnam 
by European missionaries. It 
was the most eminent of 
these who gave the Vietnam-
ese language its Roman 
script. A French bishop be-
came the first great Western 
interferer in Vietnamese af-
fairs by helping put the Em-
peror. Gia Long on the 
throne of a united Vietnam 
� 
In 1806. 
Gia Long's successors 
were less friendly towards 
the Catholics and the cries 
of help from 'French mis-
sionaries encouraged France 
to take the country over. 
- The young Catholics today 
know that the fate of Chris-
tians in South Vietnam has 
been often used to justify 
the present war against the 
Communist. They know, 
too, that many Catholic& 
have collaborated closely 
with the Americans in Viet-
nam. This alliance with for-
eigners against the Vietnam-
' ese is, of course, a serious 
crime in the eyes of many 
people. (One of the easiest 
Ways to destroy someone's 
reputation in Saigon today 
is to call him a CIA agent.) 
Like many young and in-
tellectual people the radical 
� Catholics feel a strong sense 
of guilt about their church's 
association first with the 
French and now with the

_ 
But in fact the southern-
born Catholics were often 
different. 
eThose that lived in the 
countryside often had to co-
exist with the National Lib-
eration Front. Sometimes . 
the Communists' attitude to-� 
wards these Catholics was 
tough; it was accommodat-
ing. In either case the Cath-
olics. and their priests had to

Americans. It explains why 
they, more than any other 
opposition group .(excepting 
of course the ,Vietcong) are 
prepared to accept the Con-
sequences of a total Ameri-
can withdrawal however un-
pleasant they may be. 
The militant Buddhists 
are far less certain on this 
point. Perhalps this is partly 
because they do not feel 
they have any guilt to ex-
learn to live with the Corn- plate. But it is also because 
munists as best they could, many educated Catholics, 
Today children of the, and mit Only the radicals 
Northern ' emigres , are among. them, believe that 
among the most active of the churen will survive in 
the clerical and lay opposi- some form or other what-
ever happens. The Buddh-
ists, with no world-wide. or-
ganization to give moral 
support from outside, are. 
considerably more gloomy 
about their future in a Corn- . 
numist South Vietnam. 
. But the -young opposition-
minded �Catholic! priests are 
also left wing They . wel-
come the egalitarian ideas 
of the Communists and feel 
the true church has nothing 
to lose by them. "If you 
have nothing to lose you 
have nothing to be. afraid 
of," said one of them. � 
What counts most for Vi-
etnamese Catholics is the'at-
titude of their bishops, and 
the bishops are usually con-
servative. But even among 
them there are signs of 
change. 
The Pope's conference at 
Manila last year, when he 
proclaimed a "Church of the 
Poor" authorizes a move to 
the left. The bishops clearly 
do not want to be identified 
with the present Saigon re-
gime just because President. 
Thieu is a Catholic. They 
have given, and will give, 
no endorsement to Thieu'a. 
� uncontested re-election. 
The Archibishop is not 
going to back the radicals in 
the church openly: He is too 
cautious a man for that. But 
ori-te of -the young priests 
elieve .� he accepts that 
theirs may be the way of the. 
future. Whether that is true 
or not the church' has, po-
tentially, a far more ,open 
mind about the future than 
many have -suppoed in the 
past.
