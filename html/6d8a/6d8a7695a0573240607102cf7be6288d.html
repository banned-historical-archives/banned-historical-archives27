 Members of the Palestine Liberation Organization arrive at the UN
 Palestinians at the UN
 Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasir
 Arafat   asked  the  UN  General  Assembly  on
 November 13 to back the Palestinians' right to
 return to their homeland, to determine their own
 future, and to establish a national authority on
 any PalestiniE i  territory "from which Israeli
 occupatio.i is removed."
 These points were drawn from a comprehen-
 sive policy statement approved by the PLO's
 parliamentary body in Cairo last June. Arafat, in
 his address at the UN, did not repeat the more
 radical  planks of that plat'orm, notably the
 standard PLO threats directed at Israel. In June,
 Arafat approved a statement that the PLO would
 use all  means,  "fr,,-emost  of which is armed
 struggle," to liberate Palestinian !and; at the UN,
 he asked that there be no more bloodshed.
 Arafat did not repeat either the RJlestinians'
 usual rejection of UN Security Council Resolu-
 tion 242, ,which provides the legal basis for the
 Geneva peace talks, or their frequent denuncia-
 tions of Jordan's King :-lusay n. These omissions
 a;most certainly reflect the PLO leaders' current
 inclination to hint at compromises with Israel and
 Jordan in the hope of gaining a meaningful role in
 peace negotiations and eventually winning control
 of a truncated Palestinian state.
 Arafat's  resort  to intangible appeals for
 justice for the Palestinians and his tactic of avoid-
 ing threats to Israel were designed to gain wide
 support for the Palestinians -ind to avoid giving
 offense to Israel's backers, particularly the US.
 The PLO chief decried US support for Israel,
 which he charged is not in the interest of the
 "American masses." He appealed to the American
 people for friendship and for more fruitful rela-
 tions with the Arab world.
 Because the Palestinians have no official
 stati.,s at the UN, Arafat did not offer a specific
 proposal for a resolution on the Palestine ques-
 tion. Such a proposal will be introduced later in
 the debate, probably by Egypt.
 Arab delegates are unanimous in their assess-
 ment that the Palestinians would be satisfied with
 a modest resolution that demands a Palestinian

 entity but recognizes-at least implicitly-Israel's
 right to exist. Such a resolution, they believe,
 would  achieve two  important  objectives: win
 international recognition for the political rights of
 the Palestinians and create a better image for the
 PLO. The Arabs expect such a resolution to be
 passed by an overwhelming majority. They are
 hopeful the US will abstain.
 Debate on the Palestine question is expected
 to !ast until November 21. In order to ensure that
 its views are heard, Israel has reserved the right to
 address each session. The Arabs responded by
 claiming the same prerogative for Syria, their
 spokesman.
 In an initial reaction to Arafat's UN speech,
 Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said it challenged
 Israel's very existence and was made cn the
 assumption that Jews have no right to a state.
 Rabin emphasized, however, that  Israel would
 continue the search for peace with the Arabs in
 every way-directly or indirectly.
 Arab residents in the Israeli-occupied West
 Bank staged several demonstrations in :support of
 the PLO this week. A general strike called for on
 the West Bank by PLO broadcasts to mark
 Arafat's UN debut met with only limited success,
 however, in the face of intensive Israeli pressure.
 The major exception came in Nablus-long a
 hotbed of anti-Israeli activity-where the Strike
 25X1  25X1
 The Middle East
 Arab and Israeli reaction to Secretary Kis-
 singer's visit last week, as reflected in their respec-
 tive media, has been muted, and neither side has
 struck any notes of optimism on the prospects for
 further peace negotiations. The circumspect press
 commentary is partly due to the fact that so little
 information on the visit has been made public.
 Even more, it probably reflects recognition on all
 sides that the options for restoring negotiating
 momentum have narrowed considerably since the
 Arab summit last month.
 Both Egypt and Israel still appear to be
 focusing on a further disengagement in the Sinai
 as the only means of breaking the present dead-
 lock. The Israeli press has speculated that Secre-
 tary Kissinger may pursue this subject in another
 visit to the Middle East next month or else invite
 Egyptian and Israeli representatives to begin talks
 then  in  Washington.  Israeli  Foreign  Minister
 Allon, however, has stated publicly that "a great
 deal of clarification is needed before negotiations
 can be revived." The US embassy in Tel Aviv adds
 that the Israelis are not optimistic because, as one
 leading daily noted, there is an "abysmal gap"
 between Israel's demands for a political settle-
 ment with Egypt and the more narrow military
 agreement Egyptian President Sadat is prepared
 to concede.
 During the Secretary's visit, Sadat publicly
 affirmed his belief that a step-by-step approach
 remains viable, and he clearly would prefer to
 pursue unilaterally a further disengagement in the
 Sinai. Nevertheless, there were indications during
 the Arab summit that he was heavily pressured by
 other Arab leaders not to proceed before extract-
 ing a commitment from the US and Israel that
 Syria would also be included in any future phase
 of negotiations. Syria thus continues to play the
 pivotal role. Prospects for breaking the deadlock
 on the Arab side appear to hinge on whether or
 not President Asad believes that Sadat is ready to
 insist on linking another Israeli withdrawal in the
 Sinai with one on th , Golan Heights.
 Sadat has continued to hedae his bets on this
 subject in public. He has claimed both that the
 Arab summit decisions have not impaired Egypt's
 freedom to negotiate and that future negotiations

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/21: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000070030-7  25X1
 Despite the  persistent  Syrian misgivings
 about a step-by-step approach and about Egypt's
 attitude, it seems most likely that Sadat has had
 to give Asad some private assurances that Egypt
 will demand simultaneous prog. 'ss in negotiations
 and, perhaps, even that Egypt will support Syria
 if it is attacked. The crucial question at the
 moment appears to be whether or not Syria can
 be sufficiently mollified to allow some form of
 preliminary Egyptian-Israeli talks to take place
 that could be billed as the first step in a "simul-
 taneous" negotiating process.
 Syria's principal concer  is that the opening
 of any new Egyptian-Israeli discussions would
 reduce its Ievera,e on Israel and give Tel Aviv an
 excuse for postponing further any consideration
 of concessions on the Golan Heights. Earlier this
 month, Pi ime Minister Rabin reiterated that Israel
 is ready to resume negotiations with Syria, but
 there have been no indications that the Israelis are
 preparing to make new proposals. If Israel con-
 tinues to balk, Asad could attempt to force the
 issue by pressing for reconvening the Geneva con-
 ference.
 What Syria does about the renewal of the
 mandate of the UN observer force on the Golan
 ront, which expires at the end of this month, has
 been regarded  as  a key indicator of Asad's
 ttitudes and intentions. Speculation continues
 hat he may refuse to extend the mandate to
 ion with Israel's failure to offer concessions. This
 veek there were some signs that military con-
 iderations could prevent Asad from playing this
 :ard. The Jordanian ambassador H Damascus said
 hat he was told that Syria will be forced to agree
 o extend the mandate out of fear that cancella-
 Page  3
 tion would provide Israel with a justification fc25X1
 attacking Syria.                              25X1
 Asad's  military  advisers  presumably  rec-
 ognize thzit hostilities, once begun, could not be
 confined io a repetition of the artillery duels and
 patrol actions that Syria employed to reinforce its
 bargaining points in the disengagement talks last
 spring. If Asad should decide that ending the
 mandate involves too much risk of a destructive
 Israeli attack, he might justify a limited extension
 of a few months as necessary to allow time both
 tor more vigorous diplcmatic efforts and for the
 completion of military training and defense con-
 struction programs.
 When Asad makes his play on the mandate
 issue, it will be based as much on poiitical as on
 military factors. He probably believes that the
 negotiating options have not yet been completely
 exhausted. As usual, however, he has his cards
 very close to his chest.
 Egyptian military exercises continued at a
 high level during the week. Syrian and Israeli
 forces also maintained their vigilance, but there
 were no indications that either side took any
 unusual measures to increase the alert levels of
 their forces.                             25X1
 The  exercise  probably  reflects  Egyptian
 concern that the Israelis would use their three
 landing craft in the Mediterranean to seize Port
 Said from the sea as part of a general offensive to
 regain control of the Suez Canal. These landing
 craft could carry about 1,000 Israeli men for an
 amphibious assault.                       25X1

 Austerity Measures in Israel
 The cabinet announced a number of new
 economic measures this week, highlighted by a
 43-percent devaluation of the pound. The new
 measures are the latest in a series of steps
 designed to correct the country's economic ills
 caused by the burden Israel's military program
 places on the country's resources. Last July the
 government implemented a number of measures
 aimed  at slowing the rate  of inflation and
 trimming nonessential budget outlays. A third
 economic package that will concentrate on wage,
 income, and tax reforms has yet to be announced.
 The latest measures deal almost exclusively
 with slowing Israel's foreign currency drain. In
 addition to the devaluation of the pound from
 4.2 to 6 per US dollar, the government has moved
 to:
 ? Freeze imports of :ortain luxury goods,
 including autos, for six months.
 ? Raise the foreign travel tax.
 ? Increase utility taxes and the prices of
 petroleum products.
 ? Reduce subsidies en many basic com-
 modities.
 ? Extend the national wage agreement for
 one year.
 Finance Ministry officials said the new eco-
 nomic program was made imperative by the large
 decline in foreign exchange reserves. At the end
 of September official reserves stood at $1 billion,
 a drop of $800 million since the beginning of the
 year.  According  to  Israeli  officials,  the new
 measures will save an estimated $700 million in
 foreign exchange.
 Israel's current account deficit has soared to
 $3.5 billion this year from a deficit of only $1
 billion  before  the war. Arms purchases from
 abroad have accelerated and put added pressures
 on reserve holdings. Defense imports this year will
 probably  total  $2.4  billion,  compared  with
 $500-600 million a year before the war. Although
 the  US  is covering the bulk of Israel's arms
 imports with official aid, Israel apparently has
 purchased up to $400 million in arms under
 commercial contracts. The sharp rise in w^rld
 food prices also has contributed to Israel's i;ade
 woes.
 The r.;w measures will surely aggravate infla-
 tion, which has increased 40 percent since the
 war. The reduction in basic foodstuff subsidies

 alone has caused ttie consumer price index to rise
 17 percent-some officials are speculating that
 prices could rise as much as 50 percent within a
 year.
 Much will depend on whether the Histadrut
 labor federation, whose support is vital to the
 program's success, agrees to go along with the
 government's desire to hold the line on wages.
 Prime Minister Rabin's bargaining position was
 strengthened when the Knesset voted 59 to 41 on
 November 12 to approie the economic package.
 Nevertheless, Rabin wi!: probably have to make
 some concessions to .he Histadrut. The govern-
 ment has already promised to work with the
 union to ameliorate the effects of price increases
 on low income groups, large families, poor elderly
 people, and welfare recipients.
 Although the Israeli public anticipated many
 of the government's actions, their severity when
 officially unveiled came as a shock and le'l to a
 series of demonstrations, brief strikes, and rioting
 in parts of Tel Aviv. Arabs in the Israeli-occupied
 West Bank-which is closely lini.,ed to the Israeli
 economy-also demonstrated against the  rise in
 price of basic commodities. Violent protests such
 as occurred in Tel Aviv were the exception, how-
 ever. Press commentary on the new program was
 generally favorable, conceding the necessity for
 harsh measures, but cautioning the government to
 ensure  that                          stributpri
 equitably.                                  25X1

 The conservative New Democracy Party led
 by Prime Minister Karamanlis is favored to win
 the elections this Sunday. Much is riding on voter
 confidence  in  Karamanlis,  who  has made his
 experience and proven ability to govern one of
 the main issues in the campaign. The size of his
 victory will determine how flexible he can be on
 Cyprus, NATO, and in relations with the United
 States. It will also influence Greece's future politi-
 cal  structures,  as the new  parliament  is em-
 powered to revise the constitution.
 Should Karamanlis fail to gain an outright
 majority in parliament, he will form a coalition
 government with the centrist Center Unio  - New
 Forces led by George Mavros, which is expected
 to come in second. Such a coalition would be
 much like that which took over this summer
 when the military stepped down. Mavros is less
 flexible than Karamanlis on Cyprus and NATO
 and less favorably disposed toward the US. A
 coalition  dependent on Center Union support
 might therefore prove unwieldy at times, but can
 be expected to keep Greece on a basically pro-
 Western course and act responsibly on the Cyprus
 and Aegean issues.
 Issues  in  the campaign  have  been  over-
 shadowed by the leading personalities, most of
 whom were active in politics before the 1967
 military  coup.  The  parties have  been   recon-
 stituted, however. Karamanlis has dropped con-
 servatives who collaborated with the junta and
 has tried to broaden the base of his support by
 bringing in a large number of new faces. Mavros
 has picked up several colorful candidates who had
 been associated with resistance to the junta, such
 as the would-be assassin of ex-President Papa-
 dopoulos. Mavros' leadership and party organiza-
 tion is weak, now_ver. More important, as Kara-
 manlis' former foreign minister, he has found it
 difficult to establish a separate identity for him-
 self and  his party, which  is, in many ways,
 ideologically similar to that of Karamanlis.
 Popular discontent with the past seven years
 of military rule plus anti-American sentiment over
 Cyprus provide the left wing with promising ter-
 rain      ~u exploit, but the left is split between
 Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Move-
 ment and the United Left. Papandreou has been
 exploiting themes of betrayal in Cyprus, hostility
 to NATO, neutralism, a vague socialism, and anti-
 Americanism to obtain considerable popularity
 among  intellectuals,  radicalized  students, and
 youth. He is mistrusted by the farmers and the
 .middle class, as well as by the establishment,
 however.  In addition, complicated registration
 procedures and the requirement that voters must
 cast their ballots in their place of origin may limit
 the turnout of student voters. Papandreou is also
 running more political unknowns than any other

 New Forces are expected to split about 40 per-
 cent of the vote, with the Center Union getting
 the larger share.
 The United Left, a grouping of two Commu-
 nist parties and a former communist-front group,
 is the only major group in the election that has
 been ruled a coalition by the Supreme Court. This
 means that the United Left must obtain 30 per-
 cent of the vote in order to be eligible to partici-
 pate in more than the first "distribution" of seats
 under Greece's complicated proportional repre-
 sentation law. Most observers do not give the
 United Left more than 15 percent of the vote.
 With perhaps as much as 30 percent of the vote
 the leftist groups-the United Left plus Papan-
 dreou-could  be  a  vocal  factor  in  the  new
 parliament.
 Except for Papandreou, the parties have
 treated the Cyprus issue gingerly. They all sup-
 port a solution "safeguarding the rights" of their
 ethnic brothers on the island. The Panhellenic
 Socialist Movem;ont and the United Left have
 urged the return,     Archbishop Makarios. The
 Center Union t? yes a solution through inter-
 communal talks, while Karamanlis has been re-
 minding voters that a strong Greek government
 with a decisive policy is in the best position to
 handle the Turks.
 Punishment  of those  who supported the
 junta has been a key issue. Karamanlis has de-
 fused it somewhat by exiling the five key mem-
 bers of the junta that overthrew the civilian gov-
 ernment  in  1967 and promising legal  action
 against them. He  has avoided taking harsher
 measures in order not to alarm the army and the
 extreme right.
 Right-wing forces, represented by the Na-
 tional Democratic Union led by Petros Garou-
 falias, are unlikely to win more than 5 percent of
 the vote. They are apprehensive about the legal-
 ization of the Communist Party and other mea-
 sures they interpret as a leftward drift, but appear
 to be willing to give Karamanlis time to work
 things out. Although pro-junta forces cannot be
 completely discounted as potential perpetrators
 of a coup against Kararnanlis, they probably lack
 sufficient support in the army to brine Kara-
 ENERGY: THE NEUTRALS
 Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland have
 decided to join the US-backed International
 Energy Program but with certain conditions
 attached that relate to their neutrality. The
 decisions  represent  an  important  political
 milestone, given the fact that the neutrals
 have heretofore consistently avoided align-
 ment with any politically committed group.
 Joining the program will mean a break with
 that tradition, even though it does not por-
 tend moves toward closer cooperation with
 Western  Europe on  political and  security
 matters.
 The realities of the oil shortage and the
 memory   of last winter's oil embargo com-
 pelled the three to give serious consideration
 to joining. Each is concerned, however, that
 its neutral status not be compromised. In or-
 der to soften the impact of an affirmative
 decision and to justify it domestically, the
 three are insisting that a neutrality statement
 be attached to final acceptance of member-
 ship. The neutrality declaration  is not in-
 tended to act as an escape mechanism, and
 the three have promised to adhere strictly to
 the obligations of membership.
 The I;iternational Energy Program was
 developed by the Energy Coordinating Group
 established last February in Washington. Un-
 der the er,iergency plan, the US, Canada, Ja-

 France would share oil reserves and reduc'
 energy consumption in she event of a future
 oil embargo or cutback in production. Eu-

 TURKEY: NEW PRIME MINISTER NAMED
 With the naming of Sadi Irmak as Prime
 Minister-designate, President Koruturk appears to
 have found a formula for breaking the eight-week-
 old political stalemate. Irmak, a political neutral,
 has begun a series of talks with leaders of Tur-
 key's major political parties in an effort to put
 together a broad coalition that will move the
 nation toward early elections next spring or sum-
 mer.
 The  breakthrough  apparently came after
 President Koruturk threatened to resign unless
 the party leaders reached agreement on forming a
 government. Democratic Party leader Bozbeyli
 then proposed a broad coalition govern .  A that
 would be headed by an independent ai.. would
 exclude the participation of party leaders. Most
 of the party chiefs had rejected former Prime
 Minister Ecevit's call for early elections as a con-
 dition for a new government, but Koruturk re-
 portedly has persuaded them to accept that idea
 as well.
 The 70-year-old Irmak, who was inactive in
 politics for 24 years before he was named to the
 senate as a presidential appointee this year, will
 have difficulty molding this disparate group into a
 working government. His primary role will be to
 act as caretaker until new elections can be held
 that  will  give  one  party  or  another a clear
 mandate to govern.
 Despite the preliminary approval the party
 leaders have given to this formula, Irmak still has
 several hurdles to clear. The formal process of
 organizing a government requires Irmak to:
 ? Name a full cabinet, which with presi-
 dential approval will become the acting gov-
 ernment of Turkey.
 ? Prepare a government program for sub-
 mission to parliament.
 ? Present this program for debate and a
 vote of confidence.
 There are a number of pitfalls along the way,
 particularly the distriiutiun of cabinet portfolios.
 Although the agreement arranged by Koruturk
 reportedly calls for the coalition parties to share
 the posts on a basis proportional to their repre-
 sentation in parliament, disputes could arise over
 which parties will get the more prestigious assign-
 ments.  Irmak  could  also  run  into  difficuity
 persuading parliament to go along with early elec-
 tions, inasmuch as many of the deputies will fear
 that Ecevit's national popularity-as a result of
 Cyprus-will carry his Republicar, People's Party
 to victory.
 25X1    25X1
 Except for the right-wing National Salvation
 Party, there  appears  to be general agreement
 among Turkey's political leaders on policy toward
 Cyprus. Irmak has announced that he plans to
 continue  the Cyprus   policy of former prim
 minister  Ecevit,
 If Irmak
 succeeds informing a "national coalition," it
 might defuse Cyprus as a political issue by sharing
 among all the likely contestants in the next elec-
 tion the accolades or blame resulting from any
 effort  to  negotiate  a  settle             the
 Greeks.

 EC SEARCHES FOR ENERGY POLICY

 EC deliberations on a common energy policy
 are picking up after being stalled for years. There

 policy is also seen as a way to induce France to
 join the international agency and to assure a role
 for the EC as an entity in the conference between
 producers, consumers, and developing countries
 that France has nroposed.
 French President Giscard's bid for a confer-
 ence early next year to discuss oil prices caused
 embarrassment among Paris' EC partners. They
 have not wanted to rebuff a French initiative, and
 they share to some extent the French desire to
 avoid an atmosphere of "confrontation" with the
 Arab producers. Nevertheless, they know that the
 French plan would not adequately allow for the
 prior development of a consumer position, one of
 the principal aims of the US-backed international
 agency.
 France also wants a common EC policy that
 would, among other things, lay down guidelines
 for  restrictions  on  consumption  and  for
 developing alternative energy sources. Most of
 France's partners may now be taking a friendlier
 look at EC Commission proposals along these
 lines, not  least  because  agreement on EC
 measures-even in a watered down form-could be
 hailed a success of the December summit of the
 Nine.
 French Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues hirn-
 self made an attempt at this week's ministerial EC
 political cooperation meetinr' to narry Paris' own
 earlier proposals with Commission proposals and
 to take account of responses to the conference
 idea. While calling for agreement by the summit
 on elements o:` an inter nal EC policy-deliberately
 left vague as  to targets and dates in order to
 minimize possible opposition----the new proposal is
 more positive about the contribution the inter-
 national agency could make toward cooperation
 among consumer countries. In return, the French
 want the EC leaders to "note with satisfaction '
 France's proposal for the consumer-prorJuc.- con-
 ference  and to agree that the EC intends  to
 participate in it as a single entity.
 France's conciliatory suggestions--incl,_~ding
 an observer role for the Commission at the inter-
 national agency-found initial favor among the
 Nine,  although  the  British  still  appear  quite
 reserved about the consumer-producer meeting.
 By aiming at positive decisions at the December
 summit, Paris may be implicitly recognizing its
 partners' criticism that a "preparatory meeting"
 this month for the consumer-producer conference
 would be premature.
 Although Paris will continue to press for
 such a conference, which would enhance French
 pretensions to be an honest broker between con-
 sumers and produce;, this week's EC meetings
 seem to have reinforced the priority to be given
 consumer cooperation within the international
 agency, on the one hand, and fo establishing
 common EC internal policies, on the other. The
 UK may still be an obstacle to early agreement on
 internal measures. London would prefer that the
 summit give a boost to the Labor government's
 hopes for  renegotiation of its EC membership
 terms rather than concentrate on en:argy matters.
 Differences  between  France  and  its  partners
 persist, moreover, over how free a common EC oil
 AF vaa?ei                                err.

 SPAIN: NEW DEFENSE TIES WITH US
 Spanish negotiators formally advised a visit-
 ing US delegation Ia?;t week that Madrid intends
 to seek a new defense relationship with the US.
 For some time the Spanish press has been citing
 the    inadequacy  of the present  agreement  of
 friendship and cooperation that covers US use of
 base facilities in Spain. Suggested solutions have
 ranged from calls for a mutual defense treaty all
 the way to demands the.i: the US get out.
 During the initial round of negotiations on
 renewing the present agreement that expires next
 September, the Spaniards stopped short of asking
 for a mutual defense treaty. Nevertheless, by em-
 phasizing  the  desirability  of  Joint  military
 planning and coordination of the Spanish defense
 role with that of the US and NATO, the Span-
 iards made it clear that a treaty is what they
 want.
 The Spaniards are trying to use the bilateral
 Declaration of Principles governing relations be-
 tween Spain and the US, which was signed in July
 to parallel the NATO declaration, as a lever to get
 a firmer defense tie. They argue that the declara-
 tion went beyond the provisions in the present
 agreement governing the use of defense facilities
 in Spain and signaled a stronger US commitment
 to gran- the Spaniards the same treatment in the
 defense  i ld as that accorded the NATO allies.
 Consequently they want the new agreement to
 incorporate the spirit of the declaration. The
 Spaniards argued that they could no longer justify
 to their people the increased threat to Spain
 brought on by the presence of US bases without
 being able to cite closer Spanish defense ties to
 the West.
 The principal US negotiator has asserted the
 willingness of the US to continue and s'.rengthen
 defense  cooperation,  but argued that the US
 believes this could be accomplished within the
 framework of the current agreement.
 The next plenary session will be held early
 next month in Washington. The agenda will cover
 the nature of the defense relationship and closer
 coordination of Spain's defense planning with
 Fiat of the West. The chief Spanish negotiator
 stated that these two items constituted the mair
 concern of his government and would have to bE
 agreed upon before Spain would consider twc
 other items proposed for future meetings: renego
 tiation of terms governing use of facilities pro
 vided to the US as well as conditions governinc
 their utilisation, and renegotiation of the military
 quid pro quo.  '
 Two additional items were also proposed:
 economic,  technical,  and  cultural  coopera?
 tion-which will  be considered by specialized
 study groups-and the composition and function-
 ing                                                                            of  joint  institutions  to administer the
 agreement.
 At the December session the Spanish nego-
 tiators can be expected to make a strong pitch for
 a treaty in spite of US warnings of the difficulty
 of getting congressional ?atificatien. This will re-
 flect sentiment expressed with growing frequency
 in the Spanish press that Madrid is negotiating
 from a position of strength. The installation of a
 leftist government in Portugal and the threat to
 the eastern flank of NATO created by the Cyprus
 crisis may have convinced Madrid that base rights
 in Spain are all the more vital tc US interests and
 will enable Spain at long last to insist on the
 security treaty that many Spanish officials have
 long wanted.

 CIVIL AIRCRAFT SALES DOWN
 Major  manufacturers  of  civil  aircraft  in

 rocked  by  new de~relopments in  the      already
 troubled industry.

 losses for many international airlines, includ-
 ing several in Western Europe.

 der for  four  of Europe's consortium-built
 A-300 Airbuses. Ironically, Spain is a member
 of the consortium.

 ? Hawker-Siddeley decided to halt devel-
 opment work on the new four engine HS-146,
 a  70-100  passenger  short-haul   feeder-line
 aircraft.
 These events are part of the general eco-
 nomic  uncertainty facing the civil aircraft in-
 dustry in Western Europe. Rising fuel costs and
 lagging traffic demand are gutting into the opera-
 tions of many international airlines, and the car-
 riers are reluctant to make commitments for addi-
 tional aircraft, either in Europe or elsewhere.
 Consequently, Europe's consortium and national
 aircraft programs have suffered, and the industry
 has kept going only because there are still back-
 logs of unfilled orders.
 Both  of  Europe's major  consortium  air-
 craft-- the Anglo-French Concorde and the Air-
 bus-are in trouble. Despite technological suc-
 cesses, mounting costs for the Concorde are se-
 verely limiting sales. French support-which in
 the past was unwavering-now appears in doubt.
 Some government officials have mentioned that
 any aircraft produced after the initial production
 run of 16 might cost $90 million. At the current
 $45-million price, which is triple the original esti-
 mate, only 9 Corcordes have been sold to the
 captive markets of Air France (4) and British
 Airways (5). Iran, which may bury 2 by the end of
 1974, is the only other country expected to pur-
 chase the aircraft in the near future.
 Orders for the A-300 Airbus-a joint effort
 of five European countries-have been poor. Sales
 were hurt by delays in early production schedules
 in 1969-70, allowing US manufacturers to get at
 least a two-year jump on deliveries of the similar
 widebodied McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lock-
 heed L-1011. These delays, coupled with lagging
 traffic, have limited sales over the past several
 years to 23 aircraft-less than one tenth of the
 estimated break-even point of 250. Despite this
 slow pace, however, many Europeans remain o, '.i-
 mistic about the aircraft's long-term prospects.
 The  failure  of  consortium  programs  has
 undermined many of Europe's national civil air-
 craft activities. In France, problems have been
 compounded by a host of difficulties with new
 aircraft, including the 150-passenger Mercure, the
 feeder-liner Falcon 30, and the Corvette Exec jet.
 In the UK heavy costs involving the Concorde
 have  undermined  development  of  new  com-
 mercial aircraft and forced the industry to rely on
 existing orders for aircraft currently in produc-
 tion. West Germany and the Netherlands have
 benefited from lesser involvement in the major
 consortiums and met with some success in the
 jointly manufactured F-28 and the new VFW
 Fokker 614, both shorter range aircraft cf a type

 ITALY: CRITICAL CROSSROADS
 The search for a new Italian government
 entered  a  decisive phase this week. Although
 there is no hope for reviving the center-left coali-
 tion in the immediate futi'--e, Foreign Minister
 Moro may secure agreement on a formula for a
 caretaker government that would keep the cen-
 ter-left alive in principle. His negotiations, how-
 ever, have left the dominant Christian Democrats
 in a difficult position.
 Moro, who leads the Christian Democratic
 left, is trying to set up an all-Christian Democratic
 cabinet supported in parliament by the other
 coalition  parties.  During  the postwar  period,
 Italian  politicians frequently  resorted to  this
 arrangement-the so-called "monocolore" govern-
 ment-to let the dust settle after a major political
 blowup. Such an administration would preserve a
 semblance of partnership among the parties and
 could pave the way for a later attempt to resusci-
 tate the center-left coalition, still the only work-
 able non-Communist government that can be
 drawn from the present parliament.
 Among the former coalition partners, or,iy
 the Social Democrats refuse to support such a
 solution. The Social Democrats have maintained
 throughout the six-week-old crisis that any gov-
 ernment relying on Socialist support would be
 "open to the Communists"; they now insist that
 the loose structure of a "monocolore" administra-
 tion would make it doubly vulnerable to Commu-
 nist influence.
 The Socialists and the other parties are play-
 ing down the Communist issue, and Moro would
 like to put the matter on ice for the time being.
 He wants to first nail down an agreement on
 economic policy; the parties are close to a com-
 promise on bread-and-butter issues.
 Moro would just as soon dump the Social
 Democrats if they remain adamant in the face of
 agreement among the other parties on economic
 policy.  The  key  question  is whether  he can
 persuade the rest of his party to take such a step.
 Although  Social   Democratic  support   is  not
 needed for a majority, the Christian Democrats
 have kept them in the cabinet to dilute Socialist
 influence.
 Dropping the Social Democrats from the
 parliamentary majority of a caretaker government
 could establish a precedent for excluding them
 from the next center left coalition-a move that
 woL'ld inevitably strengthen the influence of the
 Socialists and give the coalition a more leftist
 complexion.
 Moro appears to have qualified support from
 Christian Democratic boss Fanfani, and this could
 tip the balance against the Social Democrats.
 There is still resistance to the idea, however, in
 the party's key center faction and among right-
 wing Christian Democrats.
 All of this means that the Christian Dem-
 ocrats may have to choose the lesser of two evils.
 If they jettison the Social  Democrats, they
 eventually will  have to yield  more of the
 perquisites of power to the Socialists. If, instead,
 they side with the Social Democrats against the
 Socialists, they will not be able to muster a
 center-left majority. At that point, the only thing
 standing between the Christian Democrats and
 new elections-in which they would probably lose
 votes-would be a right-leaning coalition including
 the small, conservative Liberal Party. Although it
 is a numerical possibility, such a coalition could
 not govern effectively or for long against the
 opposition of the Socialists, Communists, and
 labor unions.
 The Communists are lying low. They have
 little to  lose  no  matter  what  the  Christian
 Democrats decide.    The Communists prefer to
 avoid an electoral battle now, but if it came they
 would probably do well. On the other hand, if the
 Social Democrats end up in the opposition, the
 number of anti-Communist voices in the gov-
 ernment will                                                                                  een reduced.

 The 57th anniversary of the Bolshevik Rev-
 olution last week brought forth the traditional
 speeches and ceremonies, and few surprises. For-
 eign Minisiar Gromyko-representing the Polit-
 buro-delivered the major address on November
 6. He concentrated on a routine cataloguing of
 Soviet foreign policy accomplishments and posi-
 tions, replete with flattering references to Brezh-
 nev. His moderate:; optimistic remarks included a
 statement that the USSR favors agreement with
 the US on halting the quantitative and qualitative
 arms races. He said the Soviets will strive to make
 the Vladivostok summit a meeting of great impor-
 tance to the continued improvement of US-Soviet
 relations.
 Gromyko called again for an early conclu-
 sion to the European Security Conference, imply-
 ing that a successful outcome in Geneva is a
 prerequisite to progress at the Vienna force reduc-
 tion               negotiations.  He was particularly pleased
 with the state of Soviet relations with France,
 West Germany, Finland, and  India among the
 non-Communist nations and exhorted Japan to
 match Soviet overtures of good will.
 Turning to the Middle East, he reaffirmed
 Soviet support for Palestinian statehood and pre-
 dicted that Brezhnev's visit to Egypt in January
 would be of "tremendous significance."
 Gromyko  reiterated earlier Soviet accusa-
 tions that China's leaders have aligned themselves
 with the enemies of detente and against the So-
 viet                                                                      Union  and  the  socialist community. His
 tough statement provoked a walkout by the Chi-
 nese ambassador, a ritual occurrence in recent
 years. Gromyko's speech preceded by four hours
 a Chinese broadcast of greetings to the Soviet
 government, a message containing an unexpected
 proposal for dealing with the Sino-Soviet border
 dispute.
 On November 7, Defense Minister Grechko
 made a brief speech in Red Square prior to the
 tradi?ional parade. He acknowledged the reduced
 threat of nuclear war, but pledged to defend the
 gains of socialism against the "forces of interna-
 tional reaction" which, he said, have not laid
 down their arms. He expressed satisfaction with
 the Soviet armed forces and assured his listeners
 that the Soviet party and government are paying
 urgent attention to strengthening the country's
 defenses.

 The military parade included no new weap-
 ons systems. The civilian portion was canceled,
 apparently at the last moment, with inclement
 weather given as the reason. This unusual step
 may have been taken to guard the health of aging
 Politburo members, most of whom were review-
 ing the proceedings from atop Lenin's tomb.
 Early this week the Soviets suffered another
 failure in their program for obtaining soil samples
 from the  moon. The  Luna  23  spacecraft-
 launched from Tyuratam on October 28-was
 damaged nine days later while landing on the
 moon in rough terrain, according to a Tass state-
 ment. As a result, the drilling device designed to
 The Soviets continue to have difficulty land-
 ing spacecraft of this sort on the moon. Of the
 five soil-sampling spacecraft that have reached the
 moon, only two-Luna 16 in September 1970 and
 Luna 20 in February 1972-landed intact, col-
 lected samples, and returned to earth. Because of
 limitations in the method used for returning the
 soil sample to earth, the Soviets are restricted to
 collecting samples from an area near the lunar
 equator.
 The government personnel shifts announced
 on October 31 reflect Sofia's continued concern
 over  ideology and the economy.  The changes
 seem to have been designed to give tha Bulgarian
 Council of State new responsibilities in these two
 areas.
 Two deputy premiers-Ivan Popov and Petur
 Tanchev-were  transferred to vice  presidential
 slots on the State Council. Popov, a noted scien-
 tist who advocates greater use of Western tech-
 nology to modernize the economy, is a trusted
 adviser of Zhivkov, who is also the council's chair-
 this responsibility.
 25X1
 Tanchev was deputy premier for agriculture,
 and he may retain this responsibility on the coun-
 cil. He is also the working head of the Agrarian
 Union, the so-called opposition party, and his
 transfer may be intended to give substance to the
 contention that the council is, in fact, the "cor-
 porate head of state" it was designed to be when
 created in 1971.                       25X1
 Among the other changes, Mitko Grigorov,
 the party's former ultraconservative ideologue,
 was promoted from member to vice president of
 the council, and Evgeni Mateev, a talented econo-
 mist, was made a member. Neither man has been
 among Zhivkov's friends, and their promotions
 will probably lead to speculation that the move
 was a concession to a faction within the party
 leadership. It is more likely, however, that their
 assignments were part of the effort to strengthen

 IRAQ-USSR: STRAINED RELATIONS
 Important military and civilian leaders con-
 tinue to shuttle between Baghdad and Moscow in
 an attempt to smooth over problems  in Soviet-
 Iraqi relations. Although the Soviets are disturbed
 by signs that Iraq is seeking better relations with
 the West, more recently their concern has cen-
 tered on Iraqi demands for increased Soviet sup-
 port in the war against the Kurds.
 Signs  of  Iraqi  displeasure  with  Moscow
 began to appear last summer, when Baath Party
 strong man Tikriti's bid to visit Moscow was
 apparently rebuffed. He had hoped to persuade
 the Soviets to exert pressure on Tehran to end its
 assistance for the Kurds.

 The  Soviets,  however,  still  look upon
 Baghdad as their principal ally in the Persian Gulf

 particularly concerned that intensified military
 operations could lead to more Iranian help to the
 Kurds and greater strains between Moscow and
 Tehran. The Soviets cognizant of Iran's growing
 oil wealth and regional influence -seem interested
 in improving ties with Iran; the Shah is slated to
 visit Moscow later this month.

 Guerrillas favoring a hard line against the

 The practical and political consequences of

 President Banzer has temporarily strength-
 ened his position by using last week's abortive
 coup attempt as justification for banning political
 activities and canceling the national elections set
 for next June. Even before the small insurrection
 occurred  in  an  outlying  province,  however,
 Banzer reportedly had the consent of his rr:iiitary
 commanders to call off the elections.
 Last Thursday, Banzer quickly put down a
 rebellion by a few dissident politicians and an
 army infantry unit in the provincial capital of
 Santa  Cruz,  located  approximately  350 miles
 southeast of La Paz. The fact that Banzer per-
 sonally commanded reinforcements in restoring
 order indicated that he had full confidence in his
 senior military advisers who remained in the
 capital.
 Barizer then announced that elections would
 be postponed until at least 1980. In his speech he
 sought to emulate other military strong men in
 South America by stating that the government
 intends to fulfill its mission of national recon-
 struction.  Although development polic`ds have
 consisted largely of empty promises and rhetor-
 ical flourishes, this stance makes Banzer look
 good when compared with his disorganized and
 inept opponents.                           25X1
 Banzer has taken other measures to stabilize
 his government. Official charges of subversion
 against two cabinet ministers, who had been in-
 volved in previous moves against the President,
 have resulted in a minor cabinet reshuffle.
 Military support has rallied behind the gov-
 ernment for the time being, but Banzer now de-
 pends solely upon the good will of his generals for
 his political survival. They have previously told
 him that he must soon step down in favor of an
 acceptable  military  replacement.  The  current
 front-runner is General Juan Lechin, the second
 highest official in the government. If Banzer balks
 at stepping down, the members of the high com-

 because no Soviet submarines were included
 in the latest group. In the past, the surface
 ships usually were accompanied by a sub-
 marine, which acted as a target for Cuban
 patrol  boat  training.  Although  two  sub-
 marines were observed trailing the Krestas
 across the Atlantic en route to Cuba, the
 Soviets apparently changed sailing orders as
 the submarines neared the Caribbean, and the

 China-USSR
 PEKING PROPOSES NONAGGRESSION PACT
 Last week Peking surfaced a proposal for
 dealing with the Sino-Soviet border dispute. The
 proposal, contained in a message to the Soviets on
 the occasion of the anniversary of their October
 Revolution, called for a pact renouncing aggres-
 sion and the use of force, a mutual troop pullback
 from disputed border areas, measures to avert
 conflicts, and maintenance of the status quo of
 the border itself.
 The Chinese had made a similar proposal in
 private during the early rounds of border talks in
 1969, but had never before publicly urged a non-
 aggression pact. Peking had greeted earlier and
 well-publicized Soviet calls for such a pact with
 public silence and private contempt. The Chinese
 have consistently argued that any nonaggression
 and nonuse-of-force pact would have to be ac-
 companied by a withdrawal of Soviet forces from
 the frontier, a position that the Soviets have
 categorically  rejected. 3ecause this linkage re-
 mains in the new Chinese proposal, Peking almost
 certainly expected that Moscow would find the
 package unacceptable.
 There were other indications that the pro-
 posal was a tactical maneuver. Chinese diplomats
 were quick t:: scotch speculation that the package
 signaled an upturn in Sino-Soviet relations, point-
 ing out to American and Japanese diplomats that
 the proposal contained nothing new. The message
 still has not been replayed by the New China
 News Agency nor has it been broadcast inside
 China, something Peking would almost certainly
 do in case of a major new development in Sino-
 Soviet relations. The substance and tone of
 Chinese and Soviet propaganda directed at one
 another, moreover, have not changed in any way
 since the proposal was made.
 Moscow maintained official silence on the
 substance of the package and has withheld publi-
 cation of Chinese terms for agreement. Soviet
 spokesmen have privately claimed that Peking has
 not offered anything new and that border talks
 can resume whenever Peking presents  a fresh
 proposal. The Soviets are probably reluctant to
 make any authoritative response until they can
 determine  whether  Peking  intended  anything
 I   !; r,     ti
 Soviet border guards along the Ussuri River
 more in publicizing its proposal than to gain some
 propaganda advantage.
 In their message to the Chinese on PRC
 National Day, the Soviets included references to
 their own proposals for lowering Sino-Soviet ten-
 sions. The Chinese, not to be outdone in this
 display of flexibility, have replied in kind. In a
 clear  public  relations  gesture,  moreover,  the
 Chinese embassy in Moscow took special pains to
 distribute the full text of the proposal to foreign
 embassies  and  news  services  there   after  the
 Soviets had published it only in censored form.
 The Chinc;e may hope to enhance their
 leverage both with the US and USSR by con-
 veying an impression of a more forthcoming
 attitude regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute and by
 implying that China is less concerned about the
 Soviet threat than it was a few years ago. By
 appearing accommodating, Peking also probably
 hopes to create a favorable impression among
 foreign Communist parties and complicate Soviet
 efforts to  r   'z      international  o munist

 Saigon last week called on the Communists
 to resume political and military discussions with-
 out preconditions. The South Vietnamese initia-
 tive was, in effect, the government's response to a
 Viet Cong statement on October 8 that called for
 the removal of President Thieu as a precondition
 for resuming negotiations and implementing the
 Paris Agreement. The Communists quickly re-
 jected Saigon's initiative, characteri-inn it as a
 "deceptive move"  designed to confuse public
 opinion. Viet Cong officials in Saigon and Paris
 r;peated their demands of October 8 and main-
 tained that there would be no new talks as long as
 Thieu remains in office. Hanoi's party journals
 quickly publicized the Viet Cong rejection.
 Political talks between the two sides were
 suspended by the South Vietnamese in April fol-
 lowing the North Vietnamese capture of a ranger
 outpost north of Saigon. At that time, the govern-
 ment sharply curtailed the nrivileges of the Viet
 Cong and North Vietna nese military delegations
 in Saigon, which  in turn led to a Communist
 walkout from the Saigon military talks. These
 discussions were resumed by the two sides in
 June, following the government's restoration of
 privileges to the Communist delegations, but they
 were  quickly  broken  off again  by the Com-
 munists.
 erally moderate to low level of action continues
 throughout most of the rest of the country. The
 usual  Communist midmonth mini-highpoint in
 the delta went off, but the action was spotty and
 concentrated in several areas. In. ' 'inh Long Prov-
 ince--one of the hardest hit areas-at least ten
 government outposts were lost .-i16 several roads
 interdicted, necessitating the movement of troops
 of the 7th Division into the province for the first
 time in several months.
 Deteriorating weather conditions and heavy
 casualties on both sides have somewhat slowed
 the ongoing battles for a number of strategic
 high-ground positions in the northern provinces.
 Several of these rositions have been retaken by
 government forces, but thy; South Vietnamese 1st
 Division  has  been  unable to make significant
 progress against Communist forces dug in just
 south of Hue. The regional commander is con-
 templating moving in fresh combat units to help
 out, because he considers these positions  vital to
 the defense of the lowlands south of the city.
 The current lull in fighting in the central
 provinces can best be described as an intermission
 for the opposing forces while the monsoon moves
 to the coast and the highlands begin to dry out.
 The latest S'iuth Vietnamese move meshes
 neatly  with  other recent actions of President
 Thieu designed to answer the charges of his polit-
 ical opposition. By placing the onus for the pres-
 ent lack of movement on negotiations squarely on
 Hanoi, Thieu no doubt hopes to undermine the
 efforts of Buddhist dissidents to expln?. public
 frustration over the continuing host`.:ities and the
 ineffectiveness of the Paris Agreement. Neither
 Buddhist nor Catholic opposition leaders have as
 yet reacted to Saigon's  call for the resumption
 of negotiations. Opposition act'?,ity continued at
 a low level during the week with protests con-
 fined              to rallies  and meetings in pagodas and
 churches.
 Communist military activity picked up early
 in the week in the delta provinces, but the gen-

 CHINA: MAO SETS THE TONE
 A statement by Chairman Mao Tse-tung-in
 a recently issued central directive-that the Cul-
 tural Revolution has gone on long enough under-
 scores the focus on political unity that typifies
 Peking's current propaganda line. Mao adds that
 the  time  is  ripe for  convening the  National
 People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parlia-
 ment; in fact, preparations for the congress are
 well under way. A corollary to the damping down
 of political struggle has been an emphasis on
 production, and both themes have been forcefully
 expressed in a series of central directives going
 back to July. As a whole, these developments
 show that moderate elements retain the upper
 hand in Peking.
 The political and policy trend since last sum-
 mer has been displeasing to Mao's left-leaning
 wife, Chiang Ching. Arrangements fo, the suc-
 cession to the party chairmanship have apparently
 been completed. Despite Chiang Chii _a's most
 recent attempts to portray herself as Mao's suc-
 cessor-expressed in the form of media articles on
 an historical empress who ruled China after the
 death  of  her  husband-youthful  party  vice-
 chairman Wang Hung-wen appears to be the one
 designated. Moreover, two of Chiang Ching's Cul-
 tural Revolution opponents seam to have the suc-
 cession to the premiership locked up between
 them. The madame has riot made much headway
 with her ambitions.
 she and her ultraleftist supporters appear to have
 been outmaneuvered, at least for the present.
 The rehabilitation of officials purged during
 the Cultural Revolution continues, and a reported
 central directive ordering the abolition of revolu-
 tionary committees, if carried out, seems sure to
 offend  leftist sensitivities. Established in 1967,
 the committees still symbolize leftist Cultural
 Revolution ideals and have been the object of a
 political tug of war for some time. An earlier move
 to replac" these committees with people's coun-
 cils, th;2 pre - Cultural Revolution organs of gov-
 ernme it control, was allowed to lapse after the
 campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius began in
 August 1973.
 While the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign
 is now apparently being phased out, factional
 differences, although they may be muted, will not
 disappear. A period of relative calm will probably
 ensue and improvements in production and social
 order in several provinces may well result, but the
 political contestants will keep their hatchets close
 at hand. In particular, Chiang Ching and her left-
 ist allies will remain vigilant for an opening, and
 current succession arrangements, no matter how
 clearly defined, will  be tested when the time
 comes for them to be put into effect.

 President Ford will be visiting Japan next
 week at a rather turbulent time. A controversy
 over the alleged presence of US nuclear weapons
 in Japan has generated some opposition to the
 President's visit. Moreover, Prime Minister Tanaka
 is in the midst of a political crisis stemming from
 charges of financial corruption.
 These issues, along with continuing high in-
 flation, will be the subject of demonstrations and
 strikes while thi President is in Japan. But there
 are mitigating factors:
 ? Protest activities will be orderly and will
 cause  minimum of disruption.
 ?  Most  Japanese  political  groups,  the
 press, and a large major ity of the public wel-
 come the President's vis, .
 ? Although Tanaka may well resign before
 the end of the year, he and his rivals within
 the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have de-
 clared a truce until the President's visit is
 over.
 The Current Atmosphere
 During November, a more favorable atmo-
 sphere for the President's visit has been develop-
 ing, and opposition groups have trimmed their
 scheduled activities accordingly. Last week, one
 opposition party withdrew from further demon-
 strations against the President, and others have
 yet to agree on a unified c~fort.
 The major groups still opposing the visit--the
 Communists, Socialists, and the largest labor fed-
 eration-are  committed  to  holding demonstra-
 tions, but they are emphasiai.ig their nonviL.lent
 character. The themes they will stress, mr. reover,
 focus more on inflation and Tanaka rather than
 on the US and the President's visit.
 In an effort to avoid a Sense of confronta-
 tion over the trip, the major rallies in Tokyo are
 scheduled for days when the President will not be
 in the city. Socialist leaders are now saving that
 they do not intend to harm good relations be-
 tween the US and Japan, but are opposing the
 visit solely out of fear that it will lead to a
 stronger military alliance between the two coun-
 tries. Opinion polls, meanwhile, show a majority
 favoring the visit, and Japan's major news dailies
 weighed in late last week with supporting editori-
 als.                                                                     In short, a consensus is developing that a
 courteous reception is in order, and a massive
 security effort by the Japanese police should con-
 tain any attempts by radical youth groups to
 cause problems.

 rrlme Minister Tanaka flanked by Finance V' .lister Ohira (r) and Trade and Industry Minister Nakasone
 A Besieged Tanaka
 These more favorable trends have not eased
 Prime Minister Tanaka's problems and his politi-
 cal liabilities are rapidly becoming acute. Tokyo is
 rife with speculation that Tanaka is on his way
 out as prime minister beccuse of recently pub-
 lished charges of financial corruption. Tanaka has
 long been vulnerable on this account; in over 25
 years in public office, he has become a very
 wealthy man. Early in his political career, he was
 indicted in an illegal coal mine transaction, and
 during the party's last major money scandal-the
 Black Mist of 1966-67-he was forced to retire
 temporarily as secretary general. His blatant use
 of money in last summer's upper house election
 also helped set the stage for the recent charges
 against him.
 Tanak; is clearly in a tough spot. Additional
 details of his financial transactions will apparently
 be published soon, and opposition parties are
 prepared to press the issue in the Diet session
 beginning December 1. Extensive disruption of
 legislative business by the affair would complicate
 the many problems facing the party and increase
 Tanaka's personal liability-perhaps beyond the
 point of no return.
 At present there is no clear successor to
 Tanaka. Despite his many ups and downs and his
 sagging popularity, he retains considerable power
 in the party, and carrying out an orderly transfer
 of such authority can be a difficult and time-
 consuming process under the best of circum-
 stances.
 Late last month, however, Tanaka privately
 raised the possibility of a caretaker government
 headed by party Vice President Shiina until the
 party convention next summer. Under such an
 arrangement, Tanaka would give up the prime
 ministership but remain party president and re-
 tain considerable power.
 This proposal was initially shelved, but is
 still being discussed and could be adopted if the
 party decides an early resignation is in order-a
 uecisicn it might reach soon.
 Tanaka, meanwhile, is struggling to salvage
 his position.  In a press conference earlier this
 week, he denied wrongdoing, noted that a de-
 tailed accounting of his financial transactions was
 under way, and indicated that the findings would
 be made available at some point. He then reor-
 ganized his cabinet to prepare for the new Diet
 session. The new lineup, however, remained much
 the same in terms of factional balance, indicating
 no real change in intraparty alignments since the
 previous shuffle last July.
 Tanaka and his rivals within the party have
 clearly agreed to hold their differences in abey-
 ance during President Ford's tour. But thereafter
 Tanaka will find it exceedingly difficult to stabi-
 lize his position and retain the orim        ership
 for long.                              25X1

 Nevertheless, labor unrest in the cities is growing
 as inflation cuts deeper into real income, and
 unemployment threatens to increase. In response,
 the government is encouraging businesses to re-
 duce work hours rather than cut payrolls, and will
 back generous pay hikes even at the risk of aggra-
 vating inflationary pressures next year. Labor is
 pushing for hefty wage increases as pay boosts
 this year have generally not kept pace with the
 rising cost of living-consumer prices have already
 risen 25 percent this year despite subsidized food
 prices.
 Seoul has also shifted from curbing inflation
 to bolstering output and employment. This year's

 to hard-hit larger firms in labor-intensive indus-
 tries to help them maintain employment levels.
 Sluggish export growth and soaring import
 costs-the oil import bill has tripled this year to
 around $1 billion-has sharply increased the trade
 deficit. As a result, the current paymen+s deficit
 will reach some $1.5 billion, or five times last
 year's deficit.  With direct foreign investments
 sharply off last year's pace, Korea has stepped up
 its foreign borrowing, especially short-term cred-
 its. Korea's good international credit rating and
 relatively low debt service burden have enabled it
 to meet its financing needs.
 For next year, Seoul hopes to reduce short-
 term borrowing by obtaining more long-term cap-
 ital, although this may prove difficult. As a pre-
 caution, besides borrowing from its u:-ial lenders,
 Seoul is seeking increased credits from the Inter-
 naticnal Monetary Fund and Middle East oil pro-
 ducers. Seoul has attracted a $20-million loan
 from Abu Dhabi thus gar. Direct foreign invest-
 ments are likely to pick up next year, however, as
 several leading US and Japanese firms are going
 ahead with investment nlant invnlv;nn nvor TRnn
 million.

 South Korea's economy is in its first pro-
 nounced slump in over a decade. Although real
 growth in 1974 will amount to 8 to 10 percent,
 most of the gain came during the first six months.
 The growth will continue slow well into 1975.
 Although the long-term outlook remains bright,
 near-term prospects have dimmed because of the
 continued  economic  downturn  projected  for
 major Western  industrial  nations  that take the
 bulk of Korean exports. In the past, brisk foreign
 sales have been the basis of Korea's rapid eco-
 nomic growth.
 Industrial output through June was more
 than 25 percent above last year's average, but has
 dropped    since  then.  The downturn  has been
 limited so far to a few consumer-oriented export
 industries. Hardest hit are the  labor-intensive
 textile,  clothing,  plywood, and electronics in-
 dustries. Heavy industry, in contrast, continues to
 do relatively well.
 Unemployment, although not yet serious, is
 rising. Some 100,000 workers have been laid off
 so far this year, a cut of some 6 percent of the
 manufacturing work force. The unemployment
 burden has thus far been borne mainly by young
 women rather than male heads of households.

 OPEC: 1974 OIL RECEIPTS
 OPEC countries will earn more than, $105
 billion and actually receive about $i4 billion
 from oil exports in 1974. The difference results
 from an average two-month lag in payments by
 oil companies to the producing countries. The
 bulk of 1974 OPEC oil receipts will be concen-
 trated in the last half of this year-$60 billion,
 compared  with  $34  billion  in  the first half.
 Second half receipts will reflect all of the January
 and most of the July price increases and are
 inflated by an additional $10 billion in retroactive
 payments resulting from nationalization moves.
 The bulk of OPEC oil receipts in 1974 will
 go to relatively few countries. The two largest
 producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, will receive
 about $43 billion, over two thirds in the second
 half of the year. Together, the five largest pro-
 ducers-Saudi Arabia,  Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela,
 and Kuwait-will account for over 70 percent of
 total OPEC revenue this year.
 OPEC oil receipts should decline when the
 retroactive payments are completed early next
 year. Any further price increases will be partly
 offset by  decreased  demand.  If present  pro-
 duction and prices are maintained, oil payments
 in the first quarter of 1975 would total $26.9
 billion-almost  $4  billion below the  level of
 receipts in the third and fourth quarters of 1974.
 Even if currently anticipated price hikes are in-
 stituted, payments will still drop by about $2
 billion  for the first quarter of 1975.
