 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 THE SITUATION IN GUATEMALA . . . . . . . . .  . . . .  .  . .  Page  1
 The surface calm in Guatemala since the assassina-
 tion of President Carlos Castillo Armas on 26 July may
 break in the near future as political factions line up
 for a power struggle.       Although the army, under the power-
 ful defense minister, Col. Juan Francisco Oliva, is in
 virtual control of the government and has thus far main-
 tained order, reports of plotting and impending violence
 are  increasing.  Prospects for political stability in
 the coming months appear slim.                                                 25X1
 HOSTILITIES IN OMAN AND YEMEN  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Page   2
 Britain has initiated another series of air strikes
 against rebel forts and supply lines in interior Oman,
 while small-scale movements of British-led native troops
 have been undertaken to contain the rebellion.  Prime
 Minister Macmillan remains determined not to employ
 British troops airlifted to the area.   Some Persian Gulf
 native ground troops under British control will almost
 certainly eventually have to be committed to re-estab-
 lish the Sultan's influence in the rebel area.                  Meanwhile,
 the Yemenis have in recent weeks again provoked hostili-
 ties on the Aden Protectorate frontier, and British air
 and ground forces have been in action against them.                       25X1
 SOVIET HINTS OF FOREIGN POLICY TRENDS FOLLOWING PARTY
 SHAKE-UP . . . . . . . . . . . 010 . . . . . . . .  . . . .  Page  4
 Since the party presidium shake-up, a number of So-
 viet officials have provided--mostly in private conver-
 sations--clues to the direction Moscow's foreign policy
 may take.  Nearly all these officials have been optimis-
 tic about the prospects for an improvement in the inter-
 national atmosphere and for increased high-level contacts,
 particularly with the United States, but have offered
 little indication of a changing Soviet stand on the main
 issues that divide East and West.  Although no dramatic
 change in Soviet foreign policy is anticipated, a reap-
 praisal of diplomatic tactics may be under way,,possibly
 involving a substantially increased economic aid program
 aimed primarily at areas peripheral to the Sino-Soviet
 bloc.

 SOVIET ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE CONTINUES . . . . . . .  . . . .  Page   7
 The Soviet economic offensive in the underdeveloped
 countries has continued to expand since the June shake-
 up in the presidium.   In recent weeks several new large
 credit and aid agreements have been signed, and the re-
 sponsibility for directing economic relations with for-
 eign countries has been assigned to a newly formed state
 committee under M. G. Pervukhin.  Moscow may consider
 the present time propitious for a major campaign to ad-
 vertise continuing Soviet readiness to aid underdeveloped
 countries.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Page  1
 Reporting on the Syrian mission to Moscow empha-
 sizes its economic objective, but official explanations
 remain vague.  Jordanian authorities remain concerned
 over Israeli activity in the "neutral" zone in Jerusa-
 lem and a number of minor border incidents have taken
 place.  Egyptian Defense Minister Amir's acceptance of
 an invitation- to visit the USSR sets the stage for a
 possible return visit by Zhukov to both Egypt and Syria.
 Nasr's 26 July speech was received critically by much
 of the Arab press outside Syria; his references to the
 failure of the other Arab states to support Egypt in
 the first Palestine war seem to have been particularly
 resented.
 NEW PRESSURE FOR CHANGE IN FRANCE'S ALGERIAN POLICY  . . .  Page  2
 Opposition to the Lacoste pacification policy for
 Algeria continues to grow in France.   French military
 circles are apparently beginning to insist on the neces-
 sity for a political move to break the Algerian impasse.
 The government still maintains that pacification is its
 first objective, but the possibility of a fresh approach
 is growing as Paris works out a draft statute and again
 extends negotiation  feelers to the Algerian nationalists.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 BRITAIN SEEKS TRIPARTITE CYPRUS CONFERENCE .  . .  .  .  . .  .  Page  3
 The British cabinet's recent discussions on Cyprus
 have resulted in a plan to invite Greece and Turkey to
 confer in London on 3 September.  London presumably hopes
 to gain a political advantage by making such a concilia-
 tory gesture before the UN General Assembly meets.  Turkey
 may accept the invitation.  Greece feels its best pros-
 pects lie in UN consideration of the problem.
 ARGENTINE CONSTITUENT ELECTIONS  . . . .  .  .  . . . . . . .  Page  4
 Parties supporting the Argentine provisional gov-
 ernment's call for constitutional revision won a majority
 of the 205 constituent assembly seats in the 28 July elec-
 tions, but strong opposition was registered, particularly
 through the many Peronista-inspired blank ballots.  An in-
 crease in political jockeying for the important Peronista
 vote can be expected in the general elections on 28 Febru-
 ary 1958.  The Communists won at least two seats, their
 first in an Argentine assembly.
 POSSIBLE MOVE TO ENLARGE UN DISARMAMENT SUBCOMMITTEE .  .    Page 5
 The USSR may seek to enlarge the five-member United
 Nations Disarmament Subcommittee when the 12-member Dis-
 armament Commission meets to consider the subcommittee's
 report due on 1 August.  The often-expressed desire of
 such states as India to become party to the subcommittee
 discussions, coupled with allegations of pro-NATO bias on
 the part of the four Western members of the subcommittee,
 may result in General Assembly support for increasing the
 subcommittee's membership--to the detriment of the West's
 effort to reach a carefully wor                      with ade-
 quate inspection and controls.
 INCREASED PROMINENCE OF SOVIET SECRET POLICE . .     . . .  .  .  Page 6
 There are indications that the Soviet secret police
 is        being quietly strengthened and that the standing of
 KGB chief Serov may have improved.   The KGB does not ap-
 pear to have played a r                                                 "anti-
 party" presidium group.

 AGRICULTURE IN THE SATELLITES  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . .  Page  7
 Generally fair to good harvests appear to be in
 prospect in the Eastern European satellites this year.
 Food output is expected to be considerably above the'
 poor year of 1956 and in some areas may achieve the
 high levels of 1955.  The increase will not be suffi-
 cient, however, to overcome the dependence of the satel-
 lites on imports of grain nor to satisfy the demands
 for a higher standard of living.
 NATIONALISM PERVADES POLAND'S "LIBERATION DAY"
 CEREMONIES    .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . .  .  .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 In celebrating National Liberation Day on 22 July,
 Poland this year departed from practices which have be-
 come customary on such occasions in Communist satellites.
 No high-level delegations from other bloc countries at-
 tended, and public declarations on the occasion omitted
 reference to the Soviet role in the liberation.  Two
 days later, Poland announced the public commemoration
 of the 1944 Warsaw uprising, not heretofore honored in
 the Communist world- wo      e held in August and Septem-
 ber .
 CZECHS TO EXPAND AIR,SERV ICE TO MIDDLE EAST  .  . . . . .  Page  9
 Czechoslovakia's drive to expand its network of air
 services in the Middle East has resulted in the conclu-
 sion of air agreements with Syria on 24 July and Lebanon
 on 27 July.   In addition to the Damascus and Beirut
 routes, service to Cairo will be inaugurated sometime
 in 1957.  Czechoslovakia paved the way for resumption
 of flights to Middle East capitals by acquiring land-
 ing rights in Greece in September 1956.
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS TO CRACK DOWN ON STUDENTS . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 10
 Peiping's current antirightist campaign, original-
 ly directed toward a handful of puppet party leaders,
 is now aimed at a much larger group.  Peiping seems par-
 ticularly disturbed at the moment by student involve-
 ment in alleged rightist intrigues.  Repressive poli-
 cies will increase the basic dissatisfaction among the
 students.   F__          I

 NAHA ELECTION TO TEST STRENGTH OF PRO-COMMUNIST
 OKINAWAN MAYOR . . . .    .  . . .    . . . . .  . .  . . . . .  Page 11
 A close contest is expected between the supporters
 of pro-Communist Okinawan Mayor Senaga and the opposing
 conservatives in the election on 4 August of the Naha
 municipal assembly.   Senaga's opponents, who must win
 at least 20 seats to oust him,-are handicapping them-
 selves by remaining aloof from the electorate, while
 the leftist candidates are being led by the mayor in a
 vigorous campaign.
 THE PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SITUATION .  . .  . .  . . . .  . . .  Page 12
 Overwhelming endorsement of President Carlos
 Garcia as presidential nominee of the Nacionalista
 Party at its convention on 27 July may have averted
 a serious split in the administration party.  Selec-
 tion of Garcia's running mate, as well as of a sena-
 torial slate, has been turned over to the Nacional-
 ista executive committee, which may delay its deci-
 sion until after the opposition Liberal convention
 which opens on 3 August.  The Liberals are expected
 to nominate Jose Yulo and Diosdado Macapagal, but
 they will face a strong battle in the November election
 if Nacionalista cohesiveness is maintained.
 SOUVANNA PHOUMA DESIGNATED TO FORM LAOTIAN GOVERNMENT   .  .  Page  13
 Former Laotian prime minister Souvanna Phouma has
 been designated to form a government and is confident
 he will receive the support of all parties.  Ostensibly
 committed to the firm policy on the Pathet Lao problem
 espoused by his Nationalist Party colleague Katay, he
 has revealed that he will nevertheless press for a co-
 alition government with the Pathets without prior safe-
 guards.

 THREAT OF VIOLENCE IN CEYLON DIMINISHED   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  14
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike and Tamil leaders agreed
 on 26 July to give official recognition to Tamil as the
 language of Ceylon's minority population of Indian descent.
 The civil disobedience campaign planned by the Tamils for
 20 August has been canceled.  The settlement is likely to
 be temporary, however, and agitation on the Tamil-Singha-
 lese issue will almost certainly continue.                                   25X1

 SINO-CEYLONESE TRADE IN RICE AND RUBBER  . . . . .  .  . . .  Page 15
 The Ceylonese delegation expected in Peiping on 2
 August to renegotiate the expiring five-year rice-rubber
 agreement seems likely to have some difficulty.  Commu-
 nist China has less need for Ceylonese rubber and may
 drive a harder bargain than in 1952.  There are signs
 that the USSR may be willing to negotiate an arrange-
 ment if China does not renew its commitments to Ceylon.
 OPPOSITION TO SUHRAWARDY IN PAKISTAN . .  . .  . . . .  . . .  Page 17
 Prime Minister Suhrawardy  will face threatening
 political situations in both East and West Pakistan
 when he returns from his six-week tour abroad on 4
 August.   In addition to an apparent weakening of Suhra-
 wardy's support in provincial politics, opposition to
 his pro-American foreign policy has been strengthened
 as a result of the formation on 25 July of a new na-
 tional party uniting pro-Communist elements in both
 provinces.  r-                             I

 The Legislative Council election on 12 August in
 British Guiana is expected to result in a popular ma-

 Progressive Party, which London ousted from office in
 October 1953.  The victors will probably be allowed to
 form a government under the safeguards provided by a
 new constitution, and a period of internal instability
 is likely.  There probably will be no early change in

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL FREEDOM IN POLAND  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page 1
 Polish intellectual life, which first showed signs
 of a revival in 1955 and was encouraged by the Soviet 20th
 party congress in February 1956, has received greater scope
 for free development since Gomulka's accession to power in
 October 1956.  Polish intellectuals have been renewing
 their traditional cultural, educational, and artistic ties
 with the West.  This development could in time extend be-
 yond the cultural sphere and strongly influence political
 thinking in Poland, creating for the Warsaw regime the
 problem of containing the reorientation within bounds com-
 patible with Communism.
 NORTH KOREA' S jSTAT.U  IN ?T$E BI,,O                                    Page 4
 North Korea remains a "hard-line" Soviet satellite,
 untouched by the repercussions in the rest of the Sino-
 Soviet bloc of the de-Stalinization "thaw" following the
 20th party congress, Mao's "hundred flowers," and the
 "separate roads" of Yugoslavia and Poland.  The Kim I1-
 sung regime continues to suppress any news or commentary
 which might inform Korean intellectuals of liberaliza-
 tion developments elsewhere in the bloc.  The political
 orientation of the present leadership is Soviet rather
 than Chinese.  The Chinese Communists have a voice in
 military matters, however, and help formulate Pyongyang's

 The South Korean armed forces probably could defend
 their country unaided against an attack by North Korean
 troops for only a short period of time.  The army's 20
 divisions are lightly outfitted and much of the equip-
 ment is obsolete and worn out.   Corruption is a serious-
 problem.  Many South Korean officers recognize the de-
 sirability of reducing the size of the army, but Presi-
 dent Rhee probably will continue strongly to oppose a re-
 duction until convinced that smaller forces--if well
 equipped and efficiently or anized--would be more effec-
 tive.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 The surface calm in Guate-
 mala since the assassination of
 President Carlos Castillo Armas
 on 26 July may break in the
 near future as political fac-
 tions line up for a power strug-
 gle.   Although the army, under
 the powerful defense minister,
 Col. Juan Francisco Oliva, is
 in virtual control of the gov-
 ernment and has thus far main-
 tained order, reports of plot-
 ting and impending violence
 are increasing.   Prospects for
 political stability in the com-
 ing months appear slim.
 High government
 officials remarked to US Ambas-
 sador Sparks on 30 July that
 the only solution would be for
 Oliva to resign as  defense
 minister in order to become
 constitutionally eligible to
 run for president.
 Under the constitution,
 cabinet ministers must resign
 six months prior to elections.
 This would necessitate exten-
 sion of the state of siege for
 60 days after Oliva's resigna-
 tion in order to extend to six
 months the legal four-month
 waiting period before elections.
 Oliva reportedly feels that
 emergency financial aid from
 the United States is necessary
 to implement his plans.   High
 government and army leaders
 have indicated their support
 for Oliva's candidacy.
 Leftist opposition activity
 is largely confined to exiles,
 principally in Mexico.   Poorly
 organized and weakened by con-
 flicts between Communist and
 non-Communist elements, the
 exile groups will probably not
 become a major threat.   The
 Mexican,   Salvadoran,   and
 Honduran governments have in-
 creased vigilance over exiles
 and are taking measures to pre-

 borders.  Guatemala has ordered
 all its consulates to cease is-
 suing entry visas.
 In the internal struggle
 for power, Oliva is maintain-
 ing the dominant position he
 assumed following the assassi-
 nation.   His principal rival,
 Ambassador to the United States
 Col. Jose Luis Cruz Salazar,
 is being sent back to Washing-
 ton.   He had arrived in Guate-
 mala unexpectedly on 28 July,
 apparently intending to gain
 a leading position in the gov-
 ernment.
 The ease with which Oliva
 influenced President Gonzalez
 to eliminate Cruz Salazar from
 the political scene is a good
 measure of the defense min
 ister's power.  As long as the
 pro-Castillo administration
 maintains its position, Oliva
 will probably retain his key
 position in the government.
 The army is persisting in
 its efforts to assign blame
 and define motives for the as-
 have been made, and there are
 rumors that torture is being
 applied in some cases to exact
 confessions of collusion with
 the assassin in an alleged Com-
 munist-inspired plot to seize
 the government.                      25X1
 The Rebellion in Oman
 Britain has initiated
 further air strikes against
 rebel forts and supply lines
 in interior Oman, while small-
 scale movements o  British-led
 native troops have been under-
 taken to contain the rebellion.
 The RAF now has the mission of
 interdicting rebel "military
 movements" during daylight
 hours, preceding its attacks
 with leaflets calling for sup-
 port of Britain's ally, the
 Sultan of Muscat.
 The Sultan has moved a
 British-led force, the 200-man
 Sohar Regiment, from the coast
 inland to Ibri, north of the
 rebellious area.  The British-
 officered Trucial Oman Scouts
 have been concentrated at the
 strategic Buraimi Oasis, from
 which a detachment has moved
 to reinforce the Sultan's force
 at Ibri.   The British ground
 force in the Persian Gulf area,
 consisting principally of an
 infantry battalion,  has head-
 quarters on Bahrein.   Two
 companies of this battalion
 have been moved toward the
 troubled sector--one to Sharja
 and one to Buraimi.   British
 air operations are being mounted
 against the rebels from Sharja
 and Bahrein.   Transport air-
 craft are deploying the Sultan's
 troops and tribal forces in
 position to press the rebel
 area from all sides.
 The British have also
 established native ground pa-
 trols in an effort to prevent
 supply of the rebels overland
 from Saudi Arabia.   A naval
 force consisting  of  three

 be in the possession of the

 The Egyptians are believed to
 have departed at the end of
 1956.   The Omani force, under
 Talib ibn All, brother of the
 Imam of Oman, returned to Oman
 in May and June 1957.   Inflam-

 calling on native troops to

 British Prime Minister Mac-
 millan told Ambassador Whitney
 on 26 July that he is determined
 not to let the problem get out
 of hand and not to employ Brit-
 ish troops, which in any case
 could not function effectively
 in central Oman's 130-degree
 summer heat.  The Foreign Of-
 fice's Arabian peninsula chief
 considers that the revolt is
 primarily a political rather
 than a military problem, in
 which the key is the allegiance
 to the tribal sheiks.  He ex-
 pressed a "reasonable hope"
 that the RAF action would bring
 the disaffected tribal leaders
 back to support the Sultan.
 Despite a British desire
 to avoid a politically unreward-
 ing and militarily difficult
 ground campaign against the
 rebels, the chief British of-
 ficial in the gulf area indi-
 cated that if air attacks are
 not wholly successful, ground
 forces would have to be used.
 Presumably the Trucial Oman
 Scouts, freed for use in the in-
 terior by the arrival of British
 troops, will be used initially.
 The plan evidently is to re-
 establish the Sultan's influence
 in the rebel area, break up the
 trained rebel military force,
 and seize or expel its leaders.
 The British official also said
 that the Sultan would not be
 content to restore the status
 quo ante in interior Oman, is
 determined to crush the rebels
 once and for all, and is un-
 willing to permit Talib and
 the Imam to remain at large.
 British Foreign Secretary
 Lloyd has conceded that RAF
 action alone might take a long
 time to achieve results.  There
 is no indication, moreover, that
 the air action so far has in-
 flicted losses on the trained
 rebel force, which remains
 capable of intimidating sheiks
 whose support of the revolt
 might be waning.
 Yemen Provokes New Hostilities
 The Yemenis have in re-
 cent weeks again provoked hos-
 tilities on the Aden Protectorate
 frontier, and British air and
 ground forces have been in ac-
 tion against them.  The Yemenis
 have occupied several points
 within the area claimed by a
 local ruler in the remote Beihan
 Valley of Western Aden Protec-
 torate, and are constructing
 a road from interior Yemen in-
 to this salient.  The road
 project suggests that the
 Yemenis may plan to bring re-
 cently acquired Soviet military
 vehicles into this sector, where
 the gravel plateau affords the
 only extensive area in the pro-
 tectorate suitable for armored
 movement.  Yemeni control of
 this area would open the way
 for extension of influence in
 the Eastern Aden Protectorate.
 SOVIET HINTS OF FOREIGN POLICY TRENDS FOLLOWING PARTY SHAKE-UP
 Since the party presidium
 shake-up, a number of Soviet
 officials have provided--mostly
 in private conversations--clues
 to the direction Moscow's for-
 eign policy may take.  Nearly
 all of these officials have

 1 August 1957
 and for increased high-level
 contacts, particularly with the
 United States, but have offered
 little indication of a changing
 Soviet stand on the main issues
 that divide East and West.  The
 return of a large number of So-
 viet ambassadors to Moscow has
 aroused speculation that some
 new diplomatic offensive may
 be in the wind.
 Relations With US
 A number of the Soviet
 spokesmen, including Mikoyan,
 have stated that as a result
 of the shake-up a more flexible
 Soviet approach could be ex-
 pected, making it possible to
 settle some of the outstanding
 issues little by little but
 that there would be no modifi-
 cation of basic Soviet policies.
 Mikoyan remarked that the op-
 position group had interfered
 with these policies, but had
 not been successful in blocking
 them.  Lower-ranking Soviet
 spokesmen described the ousted
 presidium members as "suspicious
 malcontents" and the new mem-
 bers as friendlier toward the
 United States.
 In answer to a question
 about a more flexible Soviet
 policy toward the West, Khru-
 shchev said this depended on
 Western, particularly American,
 confidence in the sincerity of
 Moscow's desire to relax ten-
 sions.
 t was ex-
 tremely important for the less-
 I    25X1
 ening of international tensions
 that the recent presidium shake-
 up and Khrushchev's policies
 be received with "understand-
 ing and support" by the United
 States, implying that if they
 were not, Khrushchev's position
 would be weakened and he might
 be forced to change course.
 High-level Meetings
 The central committee com-
 munique ousting Malenkov, Kag-
 anovich, and Molotov accused
 the latter of opposing the
 .policy of "establishing personal
 contacts between the Soviet
 leaders and the statesmen of
 other countries."  Since then,
 the contacts theme has been
 repeated by a number of Soviet
 spokesmen.  Premier Bulganin,
 in his letter to British Prime
 Minister Macmillan on 20 July,
 urged such high-level visits.
 Soviet propaganda organs
 have devoted considerable at-
 tention to the second anniversary
 of the Geneva summit conference
 but have made no specific pro-
 posals for a new summit meeting.
 Nor have they commented on Pres-
 ident Eisenhower's remarks about
 a visit by Marshal Zhukov.  The
 Italian Communist paper L'Unita,
 in a dispatch from its  os~ cow
 correspondent, however, reported
 on 23 July that "circles worthy

 of trust close to the Soviet
 government" considered the
 President's suggestion a "log-
 ical and sensible idea and
 hence worthy of being received
 and examined with maximum at-
 tention."  It regretted that
 the American government had
 "backed out" on the idea.
 Soviet embassy officials
 in Washington in remarks to
 the press indicated great in-
 terest in the possibility of a
 Zhukov visit and curiosity
 about whether an invitation
 would be issued, as well as in-
 terest in an exchange of visits
 between President Eisenhower
 and Khrushchev.
 The USSR has also shown
 an interest in expanding lower-
 level contacts with the United
 States by proposing in a 24
 June aide-memoire that the sub-
 ject be discussed along with
 the exchange of radio and tele-
 vision programs proposed by
 Washington.
 Disarmament-Germany
 The few statements by So-
 viet spokesmen concerning specif-
 ic  problems troubling interna-
 tional relations have provided
 little evidence of any softening
 in Moscow's positions.  Valerian
 Zorin, chief delegate at the
 London  talks, said that the
 presidium shake-up improved
 the prospects for a disarmament
 agreement if the allies of the
 United States did not block
 it.   Marshal Zhukov
 was very pessimistic
 about the disarmament negotia-
 tions, mainly because the West
 appeared to consider it neces-
 sary to retain atomic weapons
 to counterbalance the greater
 Soviet manpower.  He said he
 was willing to open up the en-
 tire Soviet Union to inspec-
 tion.    t                           25X1
 he price would be So-
 viet inspection of the rest of
 the world.
 The Bulganin letter to
 Macmillan suggested that the
 USSR is still insisting on a
 suspension of nuclear weapons
 tests unconnected to other
 disarmament agreements.   In
 this one substantive field
 where negotiations are now
 under way, there has been no
 change in the Soviet stand.
 The public line on Germany
 also remains unchanged.  Bul-
 ganin?s letter to Macmillan
 repeated the standard formula
 that unification must be nego-
 tiated between the two German
 states, and the East German
 government has just issued a
 unification plan based on con-
 federation of the two states
 rather than on free elections.
 Yugoslavia-Arabs
 The party central commit-
 tee communiqud blamed Molotov
 for opposing measures to im-
 prove relations with Yugoslavia,
 and the USSR has now agreed to
 go ahead with major aid projects
 in Yugoslavia which it postponed
 last winter when relations with
 Belgrade were particularly
 tense.  Khrushchev's statements
 in Czechoslovakia, however, were
 a curious blend of optimistic
 remarks about the good pros-
 pects for ending Yugoslav-So-
 viet differences, sarcastic
 criticismsoi the Yugoslavs,
 and demands for unanimity in
 the socialist camp--including
 Yugoslavia.

 casts to the Middle East have

 Arabs that Soviet policy in
 that area will not change,
 despite the departure of Shepi-
 lov.
 New Approach
 The prospect of some new
 departure in foreign policy has
 arisen from reports that at
 least 17 Soviet ambassadors to
 free world nations have returned
 to Moscow in June and July.
 Like the satellite and Western
 Communist leaders who have re-
 cently visited Moscow, these
 ambassadors are presumably be-
 ing briefed on the presidium
 shake-up and its foreign policy
 implications.   Although no
 dramatic change in Soviet for-
 eign policy is anticipated, a
 reappraisal of diplomatic tactics
 may be under way, possibly in-
 volving a substantially increased
 economic  aid  program aimed pri-
 marily at areas peripheral to
 the Sino-Soviet bloc.
 Other speculation about
 the nature of any new Soviet
 initiative in international
 affairs includes some dramatic
 bid for high-level talks, re-
 designed collective security
 proposals for Europe or Asia
 or some scheme linking both
 areas, and a Soviet bid to sign
 up as many nations as possible
 in formal support of its nu-
 clear test suspension plan.
 SOVIET ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE CONTINUES
 The Soviet economic of-
 fensive in the underdeveloped
 countries has continued to ex=
 pand since the June shake-up in
 the presidium.   In recent weeks
 several new large credit and
 aid agreements have been signed,
 and the responsibility for di-
 recting economic relations with
 foreign countries has been as-
 signed to a newly formed state
 committee under M. G. Pervukhin
 --a move which reflects the in-
 creasing importance and broad-
 ening responsibilities of the
 former Chief Directorate for
 Economic Relations,(GUES).  .
 On 24 July, Khrushchev
 suggested to the Ceylonese am-
 bassador that the USSR would
 assist Ceylon in developing its
 rubber industry and would take
 all the resulting increase in
 production.
 The USSR signed an agree-
 ment with Syria on 30 July ex-
 tending to that country a $112,-
 000,000 credit after persistent
 Syrian pleas for financial aid,
 and during the visit of the
 King of Afghanistan to the USSR,
 which ended on the same date,
 agreed to expand the Soviet
 economic assistance program in
 that country.
 The USSR has also recently
 been pressing the implementation
 of aid and credit agreements al-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Syria
 Reports on the Syrian mis-
 sion which arrived in the USSR.
 on 24 July indicate that  the
 main object is to secure a large
 loan.   An authoritative leftist
 newspaper in Damascus has as-
 serted that an agreement to
 provide Syria with a credit
 equal to $112,000,000 will be
 signed and a communique issued
 from Moscow on 3 August,   This
 agreement, while ostensibly
 to cover future economic proj-
 ects,may also be designed to
 assist Syria-in meeting current
 obligations.
 Syria reportedly has de-
 faulted on an arms payment due
 Czechoslovakia on 15 July, and
 there is no chance of its meet-
 ing the next two quarterly in-
 stallments.   Moreover, Syrian
 Prime Minister Asali has been
 put on notice by Finance Min-
 istry officials that unless new
 sources of revenue are found,
 government employees may go
 unpaid after the next three
 months.   Asali's official public
 statements have been equivocal
 on the purpose of the Moscow
 mission; he has said merely
 that the mission was visiting
 the USSR, as well as other coun-
 tries, to secure cooperation in
 "vital" projects, and that
 Syria welcomed "unconditional"
 assistance from any source.
 tries which continues to focus
 on the "neutral" zone in Jeru-
 salem.   In the face of vehement
 Jordanian protests, the Israe-
 lis have gone ahead with activi-
 ties which they claim are prep-
 arations for a forestation
 project they intend to carry
 out in the area around UN truce
 headquarters when the weather
 becomes suitable, probably at
 the end of October.  The Jor-
 danians remain highly suspicious
 that this project is in fact
 part of an Israeli attempt to
 establish a demarcation line
 through the neutral zone and
 occupy part of it, particularly
 the commanding height southeast
 of the Arab-held Old City of
 Jerusalem.
 At the end of last week
 the Jordanians moved some army
 units into a blocking position
 east of Jerusalem, while the
 Saudi units on the eastern side
 of the Jordan River were alerted.
 Egypt
 The Egyptian defense minis-
 ter, General Hakim Amir, has
 accepted an invitation to visit
 the USSR but begged off from
 setting a date.  The publicized
 acceptance by Amir sets the
 stage for a possible return visit
 by Marshal Zhukov to both Syria
 and Egypt; it also supports
 other information that Nasr
 has once again postponed his
 own oft-scheduled visit to the
 USSR.

 climactic note.   It had a
 fierier tone, however, and, in
 contrast to his previous speech,
 attacked the other Arab states
 except Syria for having "sold

 Syria was also singled out as
 the only state which had as-
 sisted Egypt in the Palestine
 war of 1948-49, an assertion
 which offended press opinion
 in the other states.
 Even left-wing newspapers
 elsewhere in the Arab world
 found it hard to find specific
 items in Nasr's speeches which
 they could praise; they simply
 played up his general attack
 on American policy since the
 creation of the Baghdad Pact.
 The relatively moderate words
 of his first speech appear to
 have encouraged the Jordanian
 government to believe Nasr might
 be in a mood for reconciliation.
 However, the Jordanians were
 disillusioned after the Alex-

 NEW PRESSURE FOR CHANGE IN FRANCE'S ALGERIAN POLICY
 Opposition to the Lacoste

 French military circles are ap-
 parently beginning to insist
 on the necessity for a political
 move to break the Algerian im-
 passe.   The government still

 possibility of a fresh approach

 the Algerian nationalists.
 High army figures appar-
 ently have concluded that ulti-
 mate military success in Algeria
 is dependent primarily on new
 political and diplomatic meas-
 ures.   Press articles, presum-
 ably inspired by a group of
 young army officers, insist
 that the army will irretrievably
 damage its prestige and effec-
 tiveness if it continues trying
 to play the dual role of soldier
 and policeman, hampered by
 varied political restrictions
 and increasingly entangled in
 civil administration.   The
 articles assert, moreover, that
 the army is being too closely
 identified in the mind of the
 French public with the formula-
 tion of over-all policy on Algeria.
 Die-hard proponents of
 pacification will continue to
 favor an all-out military ef-
 fort without quarter.   The
 defense minister optimistically
 predicted on 30 July that the
 rebellion would be crushed by
 the end of September. Despite
 this trend, the emphasis on the
 necessity for drastic political
 moves implies a growing recogni-
 tion that the time for a "hard"
 policy is passing.
 Political opposition to
 Lacoste's pacification policy
 is also increasing, particularly
 within the Socialist Party,
 which is the mainstay of Premier
 Bourges-Maunoury's support.   In
 the National Assembly vote of
 19 July giving the government
 special powers to deal with
 Algerian terrorists in France,
 29 out of 100 Socialists broke
 party discipline and abstained.

 Moreover, four officers of the
 party's parliamentary group,
 including the chairman, have
 resigned their positions in pro-
 test over Algerian policy.
 In apparent response to
 these and other pressures, the
 premier is drafting a political
 program aimed at giving the
 widest possible measure of local
 self-government to the Algerians
 without weakening France's
 sovereignty.   This plan is being
 examined by the cabinet, and the
 National Assembly may be re-
 called in early September for
 debate on a draft statute be-
 fore the Algerian issue is
 brought up again in the United
 Nations General Assembly.
 A plan for the economic
 development of Algeria will
 reportedly also be ready for
 cabinet consideration this
 month.   A government-sponsored
 research group has made con-
 siderable headway in planning
 for industrial development,
 aiming at exploitation of the
 resources of the Sahara, which
 Paris is separating, in its
 political program, from the
 northern coastal departments.
 Meanwhile, behind-the-
 scenes efforts have again been
 made to sound out the Algerian
 nationalists on their willing-
 ness to negotiate.   The nation-
 alists deny that top leaders
 have been contacted, but it ap-
 pears that at least one meeting
 has been held in Tunisia, and
 there are indications that the
 rebels may be reconsidering
 their demand that France recog-
 nize their right to immediate
 independence.
 The British cabinet's re-
 cent discussions on Cyprus have
 resulted in a plan to invite
 Greece and Turkey to confer in
 London on 3 September.  Turkey
 may accept the invitation.
 Athens feels its best prospects
 lie in UN consideration of the
 problem.  Evidently the British
 government's minimum hope is
 that the initiative of calling
 a conference will redound to its
 political credit both at home
 and  abroad  before  the  UN
 General  Assembly convenes
 this fall.
 Domestic pressure to "get
 Cyprus off our backs" has been
 permeating upward in official
 circles and has evidently been
 reinforced by the new defense
 planning, in which Cyprus ap-
 parently is required primarily
 for air and communications fa-
 cilities.  The government is
 apparently prepared to face new
 charges that it is "scuttling"

 revision won a majority of the
 205 constituent assembly seats
 in the 28 July elections, but
 strong opposition was registered,
 particularly through the many
 Peronista-inspired blank ballots.
 An increase in political jock-

 general elections on 28 Febru-
 ary 1958.
 No single group of the more
 than 30 parties received what
 could be considered a clear man-
 date for the February general
 elections.  The progovernment
 People's Radical Civic Union
 led the race with almost one
 quarter of the total.  Blank
 ballots, as urged by the outlawed
 Peronista Party, were cast by
 nearly a quarter of those voting.
 The antigovernment Intransigent
 Radicals, led by demagogic
 Arturo Frondizi, polled over a
 fifth of the votes, but evidently
 failed in efforts to attract
 widespread Peronista support.
 The Communist Party polled a rec-
 ord vote of about 228,000--out
 of a total of nearly 8,000,000--
 and reportedly elected at least
 two delegates.
 Constitutional revision by

 POSSIBLE MOVE TO ENLARGE UN DISARMAMENT SUBCOMMITTEE
 The USSR may seek to en-
 large the five-member United
 Nations Disarmament Subcommit-
 tee when the 12-member Disarma-
 ment Commission meets to con-
 sider the subcommittee's report
 due on 1 August.  The often-
 expressed desire of such states
 as India to become party to the
 subcommittee discussions, cou-
 pled with allegations of pro-
 NATO bias on the part of the
 four Western members of the sub-
 committee, may result in General
 Assembly support for increasing
 the subcommittee's membership--
 to the detriment of the West's
 effort to reach a carefully
 worked out agreement with ade-
 quate inspection and controls.
 British Foreign Secretary
 Selwyn Lloyd on 18 July pointed
 out that the subcommittee's
 status in the UN would be ad-
 versely affected as long as
 NATO must consider Western dis-
 armament proposals before they
 are presented.  He commented
 that the subcommittee--made up
 of representatives of the United
 States, Britain, France, Canada,
 and the USSR--was the most pro-
 NATO group the UN had ever es-
 tablished and that if this re-
 lationship were over-emphasized,
 the General Assembly would be
 sure to add India and other
 states to the subcommittee.
 French  Delegate Jules Moch
 concurred with Lloyd.  On
 14 July, during his speaking
 tour in Czechoslovakia,
 Khrushchev had referred to the
 "NATO subcommittee" and remarked,
 "You can imagine, therefore, how
 difficult it is to debate there
 on the question of disarmament."
 During the 27 July discus-
 sions about the form and sub-
 stance of the subcommittee's
 1 August report to the UN Dis-
 armament Commission--which con-
 sists of 11 members of the Se-
 curity Council plus Canada--
 Soviet Delegate Zorin insisted
 that after 1 August, the sub-
 committee should meet subject
 only to the guidance of the
 commission.  The American dele-
 gate believes this Soviet em-
 phasis on the .role of the com-
 mission may signal a tactical
 move for an early commission
 meeting in which an attempt will
 be made to expand the subcommit-
 tee's membership.
 The USSR has actively cham-
 pioned India's attempts to pre-
 sent its views on disarmament
 orally before the subcommittee.
 At last year's General Assembly
 session, the USSR introduced a
 proposal calling for the en-
 largement of both the commission
 and its subcommittee.   India
 was to be included in both.
 The commission was to have been
 increased by four--Egypt, India,
 Poland, and a Latin American
 country; the subcommittee by
 India and Poland.  This sugges-
 tion, along with all proposals
 relating to disarmament, was

 referred to the subcommittee
 for consideration.
 The USSR can be expected
 to exploit the growing impa-
 tience of most of the other
 members of the UN with the lack
 of substantive progress by at-
 tempting to have the General
 Assembly enlarge the membership
 of the subcommittee--as has been
 urged in corridor talk at the UN
 in previous years.
 INCREASED PROMINENCE OF SOVIET SECRET POLICE
 There are indications that
 the Soviet secret police is
 being quietly strengthened and
 that the standing of KGB chief
 Serov may have improved.
 In mid-May, Serov, although
 not a Supreme Soviet deputy,
 attended special joint sessions
 of the legislative committees
 of the Supreme Soviet, together
 with Soviet Public Prosecutor
 Rudenko and Supreme Court Chair-
 man Gorkin.  Although sessions
 were held to consider draft
 legislation, the three officials
 attended only those sessions
 concerned with "certain other
 questions." The presence of
 the three men, who respectively
 investigate, prosecute, and
 preside at the trials of anti-
 state crimes, strongly suggests
 that the "certain other ques-
 tions" included jurisdiction
 of the KGB.
 The transfer of the border
 troops from the Internal Affairs
 Ministry to the KGB may also
 have been discussed during the
 meetings.  The transfer seems
 to have been completed before
 9 June, when the Polish party
 paper Tr bona Ludu announced
 the rec~f a -congratulatory
 telegram from the commander and
 political officer of the "Bor-
 der Troops of the USSR Commit-
 tee of State Security."  The
 move may have been accompanied
 by a similar transfer of the
 Soviet internal security troops.
 The KGB also seems to have
 stepped u  its activity in

 25X1
 they may have or- 25X1
 dered the large number of ar-
 rests which recently took place
 in Budapest and other localities.
 In the Krasnaya Zvezda
 account of tie 25 June recep-
 tion for Chief of the Yugoslav
 General Staff Gosnyak, Serov
 was identified as "chairman of
 the Committee of State Security
 and general of the army."  Pre-
 viously Serov has been referred
 to only as an army general and
 listed among other officers of
 that rank in alphabetical order.
 On this occasion, however, he
 was listed by full title among
 other USSR ministers who at-
 tended, and ahead of several
 marshals of the Soviet Union
 who are first deputy ministers
 of defense.
 The public identification
 of Serov in these terms may mean
 that the regime now considers
 that its efforts over the past
 two years to portray the KGB
 as a highly efficient, tightly
 controlled, and respectable
 servant of the Soviet state have
 been successful.  Despite the
 evidently enhanced status of the
 KGB and the coincidence of the
 new identification of Serov with
 the session of the central com-
 mittee, plenum which ousted the
 Malenkov-Molotov-Kaganovich
 faction, there have been no
 indications that the KGB played
 a role in the downfall of the
 "antiparty" presidium gro

 AGRICULTURE IN THE SATELLITES
 Generally fair to good
 harvests appear to be in pros-
 pect in the Eastern European
 satellites this year, but im-
 ports of grain will still be
 necessary.  Food output is
 expected to be considerably
 above the poor year of 1956 in
 the southern satellites, and
 some areas in the north may
 achieve the high levels of
 1955.  High yields of winter-
 sown grains seem assured for
 the northern satellites--
 Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
 Hungary, and Poland.  The out-
 look is less favorable for
 spring-sown crops because of
 poor weather.  Bulgaria and
 Rumania will harvest larger
 crops than last year, but are
 not likely to achieve their
 plans or the high levels of
 1955.
 To deal with rising de-
 mands for a higher standard of
 living, most of the regimes are
 trying to encourage peasants,
 both individual and collectiv-
 ized, to increase food produc-
 tion.  The campaign against
 kulaks has ceased, pressure for
 collectivization has eased, and
 economic concessions of various
 kinds have been granted.   Ma-
 chinery and fertilizer are in
 short supply, however, and the
 peasant's lot has been only mod-
 erately improved as food deficits
 persist.
 All the satellites are offer-
 ing higher prices than usual for
 compulsory deliveries as well as
 for deliveries under the contract
 system, and the peasant is al-
 lowed more flexibility in de-
 ciding what products he will
 raise and how much he will sell.
 The compulsory delivery sys-
 tem has been abolished in Hungary,

 has since expanded to 26 per-

 NATIONALISM PERVADES POLAND'S "LIBERATION DAY" CEREMONIES
 In celebrating National
 Liberation Day on 22 July, Po-
 land this year departed from
 practices which have become
 customary on such occasions in
 Communist satellites.   No high-
 level delegations from other
 bloc countries attended,  and
 public declarations on the oc-
 casion omitted reference to
 the Soviet role in the libera-
 tion.
 The official party news-
 paper declared that this year's
 celebration,  "pervaded by the
 October events," would differ
 from those in previous years,
 and stated that no "slogans or
 phraseology attempting a doc-
 trinaire flight from reality"
 were to be in evidence this
 year.   The Polish press agency
 and central radio took the oc-
 casion to elaborate the benefits
 which will accrue from follow-
 ing "an independent and crea-
 tive" road to socialism.
 Public speeches by Party
 First Secretary Gomulka and
 Premier Cyrankiewicz failed to
 credit the Soviet Union with
 aiding in the liberation  of
 Poland 13 years ago, and both
 described the October events
 in Poland as marking the begin-
 ning of all favorable Polish
 developments.
 Defense Minister Spychalski,
 who expressed Poland's debt
 to all Polish forces at home
 and abroad who fought the Nazis,
 did mention Soviet military
 help.   He emphasized, however,
 that the primary duty of the
 Polish army today is the "con-
 solidation of independence" and
 gave only secondary considera-
 tion to the task of aiding in
 the building of socialism.
 Spychalski justified Poland's
 adherence to the Warsaw pact
 solely on the grounds of con-
 tinued West German militarism
 and revanchism.
 Other than Ho Chi Minh,
 who is on an East European tour,
 no satellite leader attended
 the Polish ceremonies,  in marked
 contrast with previous years.
 However, Polish embassy parties
 in all Communist capitals were
 heavily attended by top-ranking
 bloc leaders.
 Poland's announcement two
 days after the ceremonies that
 the Warsaw uprising of 1944,
 never before honored in the
 Communist world, would be marked
 by observances in August and
 September is a further indica-
 tion of Polish emphasis on na-
 tionalism.   The 63-day uprising
 was not Communist in composi-
 tion, and the underground forces
 were abandoned to destruction
 by the Germans despite the pres-
 ence of Soviet forces only a
 few miles from the city.   The
 Polish people believe the up-
 rising was fomented by Moscow
 radio to encourage German troops
 to destroy all non-Communist
 political forces in Poland prior
 to the Soviet occupation.

 way for resumption of flights
 to Middle East capitals by ac-
 quiring landing rights in
 Greece in September 1956.
 Although the Czech Nation-
 al Airlines   (CSA) service was
 well established in the Middle
 East in 1948, operations in the
 free world steadily declined
 following the Communist take-
 over that year.   Czech service
 to Tehran, Baghdad, Lydda, Cairo,
 Istanbul, Ankara, Algiers, and
 Athens, as well as to Western
 Europe, was discontinued, and
 by 1953, CSA's only flights
 outside the bloc were to Copen-
 hagen, Stockholm, Helsinki,
 and Vienna.
 Other bloc countries, in-
 cluding the USSR, have moved to
 establish passenger service in
 the Middle East, but trail the
 Czechs with their extensive
 prior contacts.   Czechoslovakia
 has purchased three Soviet TU-
 104 jet transports, of which
 there are only about 50 avail-
 able in the USSR, and will prob-
 ably use them for flights to
 the Middle East.
 The agreement for service
 to Beirut, the most active in-
 ternational air terminal in
 this area, gives Czechoslovakia
 access to a major Middle East
 air center which can be used
 in logistic support of Commu-
 nist activities in the area.
 Peiping's current anti-
 rightist campaign, originally
 directed toward a handful of
 puppet party leaders, is now
 aimed at a much larger group.
 Peiping seems particularly dis-
 turbed by student involvement
 in alleged rightist intrigues.
 Peiping's concern probably
 stems from the fact that Chi-
 nese university students have
 played a leading role in spark-
 ing major political unrest ever
 since the revolution of 1911
 and were used extensively by
 the Communists themselves in
 the civil war which ended in 1949.
 Mao Tse-tung admitted "un-
 healthy tendencies" among col-
 lege students in his speech on
 contradictions last February
 and observed wryly that Marxism
 is "not so much in fashion"
 with young people.   Since then
 manifestations of student un-
 rest have multiplied.   Shouts
 of "kill the Communists" were
 reported at student meetings
 held last spring, and the Chi-
 nese Communist press has carried
 accounts of a "bomb-throwing"
 incident involving a Communist
 university official.
 At Peiping University,
 students formed a "Hundred Flow-
 ers Study Society" for the ex-
 change of antiregime views, and
 there has been a wave of pro-
 tests against Chinese Communist
 Party interference in education-
 al work.   College students have
 vigorously objected to the arbi-
 trary assignment of jobs and
 some have refused to accept
 their posts.
 The students have appar-
 ently drawn support from dis-
 sident professors, some of whom
 have spoken out against the Com-
 munist Party.  One of these men,
 a leading Chinese sociologist,
 recently called the mood of the
 students today "extremely seri-
 ous" and commented that the
 situation is similar to previous
 periods preceding revolts led

 party was to blame because it
 either denied students the
 chance to express their views
 or ignored what they had to say.
 The professor was forced
 to confess to his anti-Commu-
 nism,buthis views apparently re-
 ceived close attention within
 the party.  Chinese Communist
 officials, commenting on the
 danger in permitting student
 unrest to become a rallying
 point for popular discontent,
 noted with alarm an increasing
 identification of the populace
 with the disgruntled students.
 Peiping apparently intends
 to rely on nonviolent measures,
 at least for the time being, in
 its efforts to halt student in-
 discipline..   Some erring stu-
 dents have been forced to forego
 their summer holiday in order
 to undertake special "ideologi-
 cal studies."  A State Council
 directive issued on 17 July re-
 quires stringent political in-
 vestigation of all future grad-

 The ouster of pro-Commu-
 nist Mayor Kamejiro Senaga of
 Naha, Okinawa, will depend on
 the results of the city assembly
 elections on 4 August, made
 necessary by Senaga's dissolu-
 tion of the assembly following
 a no-confidence vote against
 him in June.  Most estimates
 by political observers on Oki-
 nawa indicate a close contest
 between the anti-Senaga conserva-
 tives and the mayor's leftist
 supporters.   Senaga's opponents
 do not appear confident of win-
 ning the 20 seats necessary for
 a second no-confidence vote.
 The election campaign for-
 mally opened on 16 July with 46
 registered candidates.  Of these,
 29 are opposed to Senaga,  13
 are pro-Senaga, and four are un-
 committed.
 The conservatives are hand-
 icapped by factionalism,                    al-
 though some of the anti-Senaga
 forces, supported by local fin-
 anciers, have formed a loose-
 knit group called the Naha City
 Administration Reconstruction
 League.  The league's candidates
 may be endangering their pros-
 pects by their tendency to re-
 main aloof from the electorate,
 talking down to their audiences,
 and generally failing to iden-
 tify themselves and the issues
 with the interests of the in-
 dividual voters.
 The leftist candidates, on
 the other hand, are being led
 by Mayor Senaga in a vigorous
 campaign.  By holding more
 rallies and making them color-
 ful and interesting, Senaga's
 men are reaching twice the total
 audience of their opponents.
 Senaga seems to have re-
 tained popular sympathy as a
 champion of Okinawan grievances

 addition, the leftist campaign
 is emphasizing such popular.
 issues as opposition to lump,
 sum payments for land used by
 the American forces, reversion
 of Okinawa to Japan, and corrup-
 tion in the previous city ad-
 ministration.
 The anti-Senaga forces, who
 held 24 seats in the last assem-
 bly, must win at least 20, since
 two thirds of the 30-member as-
 sembly must be present for a
 vote of confidence..  The vote
 itself requires only a simple
 majority.  The pro-Senaga forces
 will have to gain five seats. in
 addition to their previous six
 to block it.
 A second no-confidence vote
 would forge Senaga to resign
 but would not eliminate him
 from the political scene.  He
 could still run in the subse-
 quent mayoral election and has
 indicated he will do so if he
 is ousted.
 THE PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SITUATION
 President Garcia's over-
 whelming first-ballot nomina-
 tion as Nacionalista presiden-
 tial candidate at the party con-
 vention on 27 July may have
 averted a serious split in the
 administration party before
 the Philippine elections in
 November.  However, a conven-
 tion deadlock developed among
 five rival aspirants for the
 vice-presidential nomination,
 and final selection of Garcia's
 running mate, as well as of the
 eight-man senatorial slate, has
 been entrusted to the party's
 executive committee.   The com-
 mittee may now withhold its
 decision until after the nomi-
 nating convention of the oppo-
 sition Liberals, scheduled to
 begin on 3 August, in the hope
 of minimizing defections by dis-
 appointed office seekers to the
 opposition.
 One reason for the Nacion-
 alista convention vice-presi-
 dential maneuver may have been
 to prevent the vice-presidential
 candidacy of House Speaker Jose
 Laurel, Jr., who led the con-
 vention balloting but failed to
 obtain the required 60 percent
 of the vote for nomination.
 Despite indications prior to the
 convention that Garcia was pre-
 pared to run with Laurel, there
 have been strong objections to
 the speaker on the grounds of
 his anti-American bias and high-
 pressure political tactics.  The
 executive committee may there-
 fore compromise on a dark-horse
 candidate, with such proved vote-
 getters as Senators Gil Puyat,
 Lorenzo Sumulong, and Cipriano
 Primicias, a candidate from the
 Liberal stronghold of northern
 Luzon, being mentioned in this
 connection.
 The Liberal convention,
 which begins on 3 August,"is ex-
 pected to nominate with little
 dissension former House Speak-
 er Jose Yulo as its presidential
 standard bearer and pro-Ameri-
 can congressman Diosdado Maca-
 pagal as his running mate.   The
 only candidate openly opposing
 Yulo is Antonio Quirino, younger
 brother of former president
 Elpidio Quirino, who has served
 principally as a rallying point
 for several old-guard Liberals,
 now being sidetracked by the
 present leaders as too closely
 identified with the corruption
 of Quirino's administration.
 The Liberals still hope
 to persuade some of the younger
 politicians closely identified

 Many of these men, however, are
 placing their hopes in a new
 party, the Progressives, whose
 presidential candidate is former
 customs commissioner Manuel
 Manahan.  Yulo has apparently
 refused to team up with Manahan
 as his running mate for fear of
 antagonizing the already weak-
 ened Liberal Party machine,
 while Manahan has so far re-
 fused to give up his candidacy
 to head the Liberal senatorial
 ticket.
 Although there are reports
 that Manahan, whose political
 outlook resembles that of Mag-
 saysay,r is meeting increasing
 success in provincial campaign-
 ing, most observers believe his
 party's late start and lack of
 provincial organization handicap
 his election prospects.
 With the Nacionalista Party
 still showing signs of cohesive-

 strong election battle in which
 it may need to come to terms

 Former Laotian prime min-
 ister Souvanna Phouma, propo-
 nent of a soft policy toward
 the Pathet Lao, has been des-
 ignated to form a government
 following the announcement by
 his Nationalist Party colleague,
 Sasorith Katay, that he lacked
 sufficient support for assembly
 confirmation.   Souvanna is con-
 fident he will be able to form
 a government in which all par-
 ties will participate.  Although
 all party leaders have "agreed
 in principle" to support Sou-
 vanna's government, there are
 nevertheless critical conflicts
 over the distribution of cab-
 inet portfolios and policies
 which remain unresolved.
 The Nationalist Party in
 its caucus on 26 July reported-
 ly committed Souvanna to the
 firm policy on national unifi-
 cation formulated by Katay in
 his first bid for investiture.
 There also is a reported dis-
 position within the party to
 circumscribe further Souvanna's
 tendency to "freewheel" by stip-
 ulating that he should hold no
 substantive portfolio in addi-
 tion to the prime ministership.
 Despite his profession of
 support for Katay's firm policy
 toward the Pathet Lao, Souvanna
 apparently will press for early
 implementation of his agree-
 ments with the Pathet Lao with-
 out making a resolute effort
 to obtain the prior safeguards
 demanded by Katay for dissolu-
 tion of Pathet forces and re-
 imposition of royal government
 control over the two northern
 provinces.  He told an American
 official on 26 July that the
 Pathet Lao must be speedily re-
 absorbed into the national com-
 munity in order to destroy Viet
 Minh control over the movement.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 The settlement envisioned
 by Souvanna would involve giving
 the Pathets one or two -port-
 folios in a coalition govern-
 ment and then holding supple-
 mentary elections, in which
 the Pathets would participate,,
 to expand the National Assembly
 from 39 to 60 deputies.  Sou-
 vanna claimed that both his
 brothers--Pathet Chief Souphan-
 nouvong and Viceroy Petsarath--
 approved of this solution to
 the unification issue.
 Meanwhile, recent events--
 Katay's near-success in forming
 a government and the relatively
 poor showing of left-wing leader
 Bong Souvannavong in his bid for
 investiture--may lead to a more
 conservative Communist estimate
 of the Pathets' political influ-
 ence and a greater Pathet will-
 ingness to compromise.
 THREAT OF VIOLENCE IN CEYLON DIMINISHED
 The threat of widespread
 violence in Ceylon in connec-
 tion with the civil-disobedience
 campaign planned by the island's
 Tamil-speaking minority'seems
 greatly diminished..  Following
 several, conversations between
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike and
 Tamil leaders, an agreement was
 reached on 26 July, and the
 Ceylonese Basic Linguistic Divisions
 SECRET
 campaign, scheduled
 to begin on 20 Au-
 gust, was canceled.
 The agreement
 provides for offi-
 cial recognition
 of Tamil as the
 language of Ceylon's
 2,000,000 people of
 Indian descent and
 for the use of Tamil
 in the administra-
 tion of the northern
 and eastern provinces
 of Ceylon, where
 this population is
 concentrated.   It
 also provides for
 regional councils
 to oversee Tamil
 affairs in these
 provinces.
 The widespread
 publicity regarding
 preparations for
 violence, including
 the recruitment of
 "private armies" by
 Tamil and opposing
 Singhalese groups,
 apparently aroused
 sufficient alarm to

 persuade both sides to seek a
 peaceful solution.
 Although most political
 leaders welcomed the cancella-
 tion of the disobedience cam-
 paign, the Tamil Federal Party
 accepted the agreement merely
 as an intermim adjustment and
 reiterated its demands for a
 federal Tamil state, Tamil-
 Singhalese language parity, and
 Ceylonese citizenship for per-
 sons of Indian descent.  To
 date, the Ceylonese government
 has given citizenship to only
 about 10 percent of those ap-
 plying, while New Delhi has
 consistently refused to accept
 as emigrants Tamils disenfran-
 chised in Ceylon.
 The United National Party
 working committee denounced the
 language agreement as a viola-
 tion of law and the regional-
 councils agreement as a betrayal
 of the Singhalese.   Singhalese
 extremists, though bitter about
 the concessions made by Ban-
 daranaike, will probably confine
 their activity mainly to verbal
 criticism of the agreement for
 the present.   Any outbreaks of
 violence in the near future seem
 likely to be small and sporadic.
 The relaxation of tensions
 resulting from the settlement
 is likely to be temporary, how-
 ever.   Prime Minister Bandara-
 naike will probably continue
 to be subject to strong politi-
 cal criticism from both right
 and left on the basic issues
 of citizenship and language
 rights for Tamils.
 25X1
 The Ceylonese delegation
 expected in Peiping on 2 August
 to renegotiate the expiring
 five-year rice-rubber agreement
 seems likely to have some dif-
 ficulty.
 Ceylon  shipped its first
 rubber to Communist China un-
 der private contracts in Octo-
 ber 1951, when 5,633 metric
 tons were exported.   It pur-
 chased its first rice from
 China in 1952 under an agree-
 ment which reportedly specified
 cash payment for 80,000 tons
 but which was apparently paid
 for with rubber.  During that
 year, Ceylon exported about
 24,000 tons of rubber to China.
 In 1952, Ceylon faced a
 bad slump in world market prices
 for rubber and a world short-
 ages of rice,  of which the is-
 land imports about half its
 total consumption.   The result
 was the five-year Sino-Ceylonese
 rice-rubber agreement, which
 became effective on 1 January
 1953.   Under its terms, Ceylon
 was to export 50,000 tons of
 rubber and to import 270,000
 tons of Chinese rice annually.
 China agreed to pay a premium
 above world market prices for
 Ceylonese rubber.   Prices of
 both commodities were to be
 renegotiated each year.
 The agreement not only
 provided Ceylon with a stable
 market for rubbber for five
 years but also assured it of a
 much-needed rice supply.   China,
 in turn, benefited from Ceylon's
 breaking of the tight rubber
 embargo then being enforced by
 other exporters.
 In 1953 and 1954, prices
 of rice and rubber were fixed
 at a single figure for the
 full year.   In mid-1955, how-
 ever, changes in world prices
 made the agreed Sino-Ceylonese

 prices unrealistic,  and the two
 countries adopted a sliding-
 scale system which is still in
 use.   China guarantees a floor
 price for rubber and pays pre-
 miums varying from three to
 four cents per pound depending
 on the world price for each
 grade.   Prices of rice were also
 brought more into line with
 world prices, dropping from the
 original figure of $109.20 per
 ton to about $98,00..
 In 1953 and
 1954,  shipments of
 rice and rubber ap-
 proximated the amounts
 specified in the
 agreement.   In 1953,
 however, Ceylon,   "
 still searching for
 an assured rice sup-
 ply, signed a four-
 year agreement with
 Burma for 200,000 to
 600,000 tons annual-

 Prime Minister Suhrawardy
 will face threatening political
 situations in both East and West
 Pakistan when he returns from
 his six-week tour abroad on 4
 August.   In addition to an ap-
 parent weakening of Suhrawardy's
 support in provincial politics,
 opposition to his pro-American
 foreign policy has been strength-
 ened as a result of the forma-
 tion on 25 July of a new na-
 tional party uniting pro-Commu-
 nist elements in both provinces.
 The convention of Pakistan's
 leftist political groups or-
 ganized by Maulana Bhashani,
 who recently resigned his mem-
 bership in the East Pakistan
 Awami League, met in Dacca on
 25 and 26 July.   Nearly 800
 leftist delegates from East
 Pakistan joined with some 80
 opposition leaders from West
 Pakistan to launch a new left-
 ist organization known as the
 National Awami Party.   The key
 components in the merger are
 the Bhashani supporters from
 various political parties in
 the eastern province and the
 Pakistan National Party of
 West Pakistan, led by Mian
 Iftikhar-ud-Din and Abdul
 Ghaffar Khan.   Both groups are
 heavily infiltrated by Commu-
 nist Party workers and sympa-
 thizers.
 The heterogeneous elements
 which have joined in the new
 front have little in common
 aside from their opposition to
 Pakistan's present leadership.
 Two major demands have provided
 the group a basis for common
 action: a neutralist foreign
 policy--"freeing the country
 from imperialism"--and provin-
 cial autonomy.
 The success of the leftist
 alliance may be limited to a
 considerable degree by the wide
 divergence of interests and
 objectives of the various groups,
 as well as by the personal
 rivalries among their leaders.
 However, the new organization
 will probably maintain a sem-
 blance of unity during the peri-
 od preceding  the general elec-
 tions which have been promised
 for next March.
 The National Awami Party
 is likely to attract considerable
 mass support if it continues
 to play on such popular themes
 as anti-imperialism and regional
 autonomy and exploits public
 discontent over deteriorating
 economic conditions.   In an
 election campaign, the leftist
 front, led by such popular
 leaders as Bhashani and Ghaffar
 Khan, could make serious inroads
 into the support now enjoyed by
 anti-Communist parties in Paki-
 stan.
 A number of followers of
 Bhashani have defected from the
 East Pakistan Awami League to
 join the new party.   Unless the

 by British authorities, he and
 his wife Janet have extended
 their international Communist
 connections and strengthened
 the organization of their fac-
 tion of the PPP.  They appeal
 to local economic grievances
 and seek independence outside
 the Commonwealth, opposing any
 move to associate British
 Guiana with the developing
 federation of Britain's West
 Indies colonies.   The loss of
 political and financial support,
 entailed by the recent defec-
 tion of three PPP leaders could,
 however, undercut Jagan's ex-
 pected victory.
 Those seats not won by the
 Jagan group are expected to be
 gained by Lyndon Burnham and
 his faction of the
 PPP, which split with
 the Jagans in April
 1956 over personal
 rivalry and party
 policy and has since
 publicly attacked the
 Jagans as Communists.
 The remaining polit-
 ical elements dis-
 trust Burnham as an
 opportunist and have
 refused to join forces
 with him.
 Under the new
 constitution granted
 by London last year,
 the governor may ap-
 point up to 11 mem-
 and thus neutralize Jagan in
 the council.
 In any case, an unstable
 situation full of risks for in-
 ternal security and for British
 interests in the Caribbean area
 is likely to result.   London has
 wanted, for example, to persuade
 British Guiana, which produces
 about a fifth of the free world's
 bauxite, to add economic strength
 to the developing West Indies
 federation by joining it, but no
 early change in British Guiana's
 opposition seems possible.
 Meanwhile, the 16-24 July
 conference in London between
 representatives of the federation,
 the United Kingdom, and the
 United States has concluded with

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 Polish intellectual life,
 which first showed signs of a
 revival in 1955 and was encour-
 aged by the Soviet 20th party
 congress in February 1956, has
 received greater scope for free
 development since Gomulka's ac-
 cession to power in October 1956.
 Polish intellectuals, figura.
 tively turning their backs on
 the East, have been renewing
 their traditional cultural,
 educational, and  artistic
 ties with the West.   This turn
 could in time extend beyond the
 cultural sphere and strongly in-
 fluence political thinking in
 Poland, creating for the Warsaw
 regime the problem of containing
 the reorientation within bounds
 compatible with Communism.
 The administra-
 tive and scholastic
 controls imposed on
 the universities by
 the old regime have
 been almost complete-
 ly removed.   The uni-
 versities have been
 granted the authority
 to operate independ-
 ently within broad
 limits and to elect
 their own rectors
 and deans.   The High-
 er Education Minis-
 try, shorn of its
 broad authority, now
 is empowered only to
 draw up a budget un-
 der which the sepa-
 rate institutions
 can work out their
 own plans.   Many of
 its former functions
 have been entrusted
 to the Main Council
 on Higher Education,
 made up of represent-
 atives of the insti-
 tutions themselves.
 George here has settlea this as far as the flowers are concerned,
 but whom shall we appoint to do the thinking?
 In recent months
 $"' i
 professors   have                  1 AUGUST I9CO   t
 H     AL
 regained their position of au-
 thority in the universities.
 In addition, the stern disci-
 pline exercised over students
 has slackened considerably.
 Even before October 1956, at-
 tendance at lectures on Marxism-
 Leninism had ceased to be en-
 forced, and Communist doctrine
 was finding an increasingly
 apathetic response among uni-
 versity students.   The Polish
 writer Adam Schaff reported in
 the leading party daily last
 February that Marxist-Leninist
 courses had been completely
 abolished:  "I am deeply con-
 vinced," he said,  "that this
 is no loss for Marxism at all."
 Students are being encour-
 aged to work independently, par-
 ticularly in  the   scientific

 field.     Seminars are favored
 over lectures.     Rigid planning
 and excessive report require-
 ments have been eliminated.   In
 addition, worthy graduate stu-
 dents are being given assistant-
 ships without regard to their
 political beliefs.   Fully one
 half of them are provided quar-
 ters in dormitories, and approx-
 imately 70 percent receive schol-
 arships  or other monetary aid.
 Young pro-Western moderate
 elements are deliberately turn-
 ing Marxist-Leninist revolution-
 ary philosophy against the Com-
 munist system in its present
 form and carefully cloaking
 their opposition program in
 Marxist-Leninist terminology.
 These rebels, banded together
 in anti-Communist organizations
 such as the Karl Marx Club,
 take the attitude that Communism
 should be fought with its own
 weapons, since these are the
 best known to the people today.
 Religious Training
 Possibly in order to have
 teaching staffs able to match
 the influence of the priests
 now permitted to teach religion
 in the schools, the regime is
 stressing professional compe-
 tence rather than political ac-
 ceptability in its newly en-
 larged program for training
 teachers for the lower schools.
 The pro-Gomulka weekly Polityka,
 declaring on 4 May that the "lay
 character of the school" must
 be maintained, complained that
 priests were mingling religious
 instruction with natural science,
 history, and "the theory of
 knowledge" and thus giving these
 subjects a religious cast.   The
 party believes that in permit-
 ting religious education it has
 made a sufficient concession to
 Polish Catholics.   It aims to
 insist on the lay character of
 the schools "in the full mean-
 ing of the word" and to persuade
 the people of the inherent fal-
 sity of the religious view.
 Though  operating within
 limitations   imposed by the
 regime early this year, the
 Polish press is enjoying a new
 independence  and has  even
 adopted some features of the
 Western press in order to break
 away from the uniform drabness
 that has characterized the Com-
 munist papers.
 Almost all periodicals,
 however, except the illustrated
 weeklies and the intellectual
 youth periodical Po Prostu are
 having serious f inanc-Uif -
 ficulties  resulting in part
 from the withdrawal of govern-
 ment subsidies.                                                              The daily
 papers have raised their prices,
 with the result that they have
 suffered a total decline in
 circulation of nearly 750,000.
 The problem is serious:   a
 Warsaw monthly recently com-
 plained, "Some newspapers...
 are being reproached for turn-
 ing to unhealthy sensationalism
 and pornography in order to
 save their circulation."  Some
 correspondents have had to be
 dismissed, but, many  purged
 journalists  are  being  reha-
 bilitated and rehired by the
 press.
 While some  censorship
 still exists, polish journalists
 have much greater freedom to
 write as they please than be-
 fore Gomulka.  The weeklies,
 if not the daily press, have
 gained  in popularity.  Po
 Prostu, Nowa Kultura, anWPrze-
 gladKulturalny are well-known
 libeera weeklies read regularly
 today by people concerned with
 political, social, and cultural
 developments.
 Po Prostu has a circula-
 tion oa 153( 000, and each of
 the others 70,300.  Particular-
 ly good guides to the current
 political line are Nowe Drogi,
 th party's theoretical journal;
 Zeszyty Teoretyczno-Politiczne,
 a 'monthly political magaz ne;
 and Polityka, recently estab-

 Mr. Director, are you going to the Council of

 paper for rural readers, has a
 circulation of 939,000.  Szpilki
 is a popular satirical ann --
 humorous weekly with a circula-
 tion of 100,000, which criti-
 cizes regime policies and pokes
 fun at life in Poland.   Among
 new publications, a monthly
 statistical review has become
 available--in a country in which
 statistics have been closely
 guarded secrets.
 New radio-programing poli-
 cies--in sharp contrast to those
 applied in other Communist coun-
 tries--have resulted in more
 objective and timely news re-
 porting and more popular broad-
 casts.   People now willingly
 listen to official broadcasts,
 which do not conceal even the
 most bitter truths.   This trend,
 which began after the Geneva
 summit meeting in 1955, can be
 attributed in part to the fact
 that since foreign broadcasts
 are no longer Jammed ,the Polish
 radio has been forced to provide
 immediate replies to foreign
 opinions and commentaries.
 Cultural Exchanges
 Many opportunities are now
 available to Poles for study
 abroad and other cultural ex-
 changes, especially with the
 West.   Young or unorthodox (in
 Communist terms) writers are
 frequently permitted to travel,
 a privilege until recently re-
 served mainly for loyal party
 members.   Scientific personnel,
 including architects, physicians,
 meteorologists, economists,
 archaeologists, and nuclear
 physicists, are going to the
 West, as well as to Soviet bloc
 countries, in increasing numbers.
 In contrast to a total of three
 Polish Academy of Science members
 who went to nonbloc countries in
 1952, some 360 visited the West
 in 1956.
 Cultural groups such as the
 Polish Jewish Theater are going
 to the West.   In addition, pure-
 ly private trips to the West
 for tourism or visits to rela-
 tives have greatly increased.
 At the same time increasing
 numbers of foreigners are coming
 to Poland.
 The enthusiasm recently
 shown in Poland for the Ameri-
 can participation in the Poznan
 fair and for the Cleveland Sym-
 phony performances reflects a
 basic friendliness for the West.
 This friendliness, while in
 part a reaction to the deep-
 seated Polish antagonism toward
 Russia, also reflects the strong
 traditional attraction of the
 West, especially of the French,
 for Poland.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 NORTH KOREA'S STATUS IN THE BLOC
 North Korea remains a
 "hard-line" Soviet satellite,
 untouched by the repercussions
 in the rest of the Sino-Soviet
 bloc of the de-Stalinization
 "thaw" following the 20th party
 congress, Mao's "hundred flow-
 ers," and the "separate roads"
 of Yugoslavia and Poland.  The
 Kim Il-sung regime continues to
 suppress any news or commentary
 which might inform Korean intel-
 lectuals of liberalization de-
 velopments elsewhere in the bloc.
 The political orientation
 of the present leadership is
 Soviet rather than Chinese.
 The Chinese Communists have a
 voice in military matters, how-
 ever, and help formulate Pyong-
 yang's foreign policy in those
 fields where Peiping has a
 special interest.
 Geographically,North Korea
 acts as a buffer state protect-
 ing both Soviet and Chinese
 Communist borders and provides
 a valuable base from which sub-
 versive activities can be con-
 ducted in the Far East.  The
 large Korean  minority in Japan,
 most of which is sympathetic to
 Pyongyang g has been well or-
 ganized to spread Communist
 progaganda.   It is a constant
 irritant to the Japanese govern-
 ment, particularly in Tokyo's
 efforts to improve relations
 with Seoul.   In support of the
 Communist objective to dominate
 all of Korea, Pyongyang's prop-
 aganda stresses appeals to
 Korean nationalism, with the
 northern regime posed as the
 legitimate government of the
 whole peninsula and the govern-
 ment of President Rhee continu-
 ally vilified as "fascist."
 Political Orientation
 Unlike Tito Mao or Ho Chi
 Minh, Premier Kim 11-sung, who
 is also party leader, was origi-
 nally installed in power by the
 Soviet army.  Kim and the other
 top leaders in Pyongyang--many
 of whom have dual Soviet-Korean
 citizenship--are all "hard-line"
 Communists.  They have never
 displayed any sympathies for
 "national Communism" nor ques-
 tioned orthodox measures for
 effecting the transition to
 socialism.   The regime's major
 programs--land reform, concentra-
 tion on heavy industrial develop-
 ment, five-year planning--have
 been copied from either Soviet

 In foreign affairs, Pyong-

 ary that both parts of Vietnam

 United Nations.   In contrast,
 Hanoi was silent on this point.
 Although Pyongyang has
 never openly disagreed with
 Moscow, it feels free to ignore
 bloc ideological issues which
 might prove damaging to Korean
 Worker (Communist) Party con-
 trol.  The cult of the individ-
 ual has been referred to only
 occasionally in the press, and
 Stalin's personal guilt has
 never been expounded, presumably
 to forestall any analogies be-
 tween Stalin and Kim.   Unlike
 Hanoi, Pyongyang did not re-
 print the Chinese Communist
 Party statement of 4 April 1956
 which dealt with Stalin's mis-
 takes, and Pyongyang never al-
 luded to Khrushchev's secret
 speech at the 20th party con-
 gress.
 Chinese Communist pro-
 nouncements with a liberal
 tinge, such as the official
 text of Mao's "secret" February
 speech, were not published in
 the North Korean press.  To
 avoid opening a Pandora's box,
 Kim I1-sung has refused to al-
 low the discussion of liberal=ization measures elsewhere.
 The Hungarian crisis last fall
 was reported, but only after
 the rest of the bloc had al-
 ready commented on it.  Pyong-
 yang then joined the chorus de-
 nouncing "Western imperialist
 interference" in Hungarian in-
 ternal affairs.  Polish develop-
 ments have been largely ignored.
 Kim Il-sung probably hopes
 that such censorship will dis-
 courage a repetition of the
 factional strife which divided
 the party from the close of
 World War II through 1953.
 During those years, three
 groups fought for control of
 the party--a domestic faction
 which had operated the Korean
 underground, a Chinese Yenan-
 trained faction, and a Soviet-
 sponsored faction, which was
 the most willing to subordinate
 national interests to those of
 the Kremlin.   Kim 11-sung, lead-
 er of the Soviet faction, elim-
 inated his rivals in a series
 of purges and since 1953 has
 succeeded in tightening his con-
 trol over the party apparatus.
 Implicit in the party's
 large membership--over 1,000,000
 in a population estimated at
 8,000,000--is the continuing
 danger that nationalism may
 reinfect the apparatus.  A party
 shake-up last August suggests
 the presence of a more liberal
 group within the party which
 might in time gain considerable
 support.   In any event, the emer-
 gence of native Korean cadres
 who do not have dual Soviet
 citizenship will in all likeli-
 hood increase the tensions with-
 in the party over the next few
 years.
 Economic Ties to Bloc
 Although endowed with a
 fair variety of natural re-
 sources and geographically well
 located to complement the econ-
 omies  of Machuria and the So-
 viet Far East, North Korea has
 been a doubtful economic asset
 to the Communist bloc.  Wartime
 devastation has necessitated
 major bloc aid, and the economy
 is not yet completely rehabili-
 tated.   Never a food-surplus
 region, North Korea since the
 Korean war has suffered from
 large grain deficits as a result
 of adverse weather and an acute
 manpower shortage and remains
 a net importer of food.
 The three-year rehabilita-
 tion program, completed in 1956,
 was made possible by extensive
 Sino-Soviet bloc aid.   Shortly
 after the armistice in 1953, the
 USSR extended $25,000,000 in aid
 for the program, and in November
 1953 Communist China agreed to
 grant North Korea credits of
 $325,000,000 for the years 1954-
 57.  Other bloc countries con-
 tributed lesser amounts.
 Soviet advisers supervised
 the program and the USSR supplied

 large amounts of industrial
 equipment.        The Eastern Euro-
 pean satellites sent technicians
 and a smaller quantity of equip-
 ment.  China furnished large
 quantities of consumer goods
 and raw materials, and the Chi-
 nese army supplied a consider-
 able amount of labor, particular-
 ly in the reconstruction of the
 transportation system.   In spite
 of the large Chinese contribu-
 tion, Pyongyang's propaganda
 has given the USSR the great
 majority of the credit for its
 economic rehabilitation.
 The First Five-Year Plan
 (1957-61) is an ambitious pro-
 gram for restoring over-all in-
 dustrial production  to at
 least the levels reached under
 the Japanese and for achieving
 self-sufficiency in agriculture.
 After 1957, only about 10 per-
 cent of the original bloc
 grant-in-aid will remain to be
 spent on the rehabilitation
 program and no new large credits
 have been announced for the
 Five-Year Plan.   If North Korea
 is forced to underwrite  its
 economic development after this
 year,the success of the plan
 will be in doubt, particularly
 since the country is deficient
 in resources suitable for ex-
 port.
 A decline in Sino-Soviet
 aid, however, is unlikely to
 loosen North Korean economic
 ties to the bloc.   Pyongyang,
 which has no diplomatic rela-
 tions with free-world countries,
 will continue to rely on the
 bloc for technical assistance
 and advice and for the bulk of
 its imports.
 The South Korean armed
 forces constitute the largest
 anti-Communist military force
 in Asia.   The army, with a to-
 tal strength of approximately
 610,000 men, is the third larg-
 est in the free world.   It
 demonstrated physical rugged-
 ness and determination to fight
 during the Korean war and is
 now entrenched in strong def en-
 sive positions along the moun-
 tainous demilitarized zone.
 All combat elements are reported
 combat-ready.
 The army's 20 divisions
 are lightly outfitted by Ameri-
 can standards, however, and
 much of the equipment is obso-
 lete and worn out.   The air force
 is greatly inferior in numbers
 to its North Korean counterpart,
 and the navy's ships and equip-
 ment are of World War II vin-
 tage.  Corruption is a serious
 problem,   especially  for the
 army.
 Capabilities
 The South Korean forces,
 unaided, are capable of main-
 taining internal security and
 defending South Korea's bound-
 aries against minor intrusions,
 but they could conduct a suc-
 cessful defense against a North
 Korean attack for only a short
 time.   Obsolescent equipment
 and the lack of logistical sup-
 port would prevent a sustained
 defense without outside assist-
 ance.                                                               If Communist China joined
 an assault, immediate assistance
 would be needed.

 escorts, can do little more
 than patrol its own waters.
 Mine-sweeping, antiaircraft,

 are limited by the obsolescence

 capability is restricted to sup-

 The offensive and defen-

 craft to oppose the 400-odd
 jet fighters and 20-odd jet
 bombers based in North Korea.
 South Korea's only marine

 River estuary.   It is believed
 incapable of advancing along
 the army's seaward flank during
 a reconquest of all Communist-
 held territory south of the 38th
 parallel--a project for which
 President Rhee has ordered an
 operational plan made.
 The South Korean army has
 many shortcomings, one of the
 most serious of which is in-
 creasing corruption.  The army
 reportedly received in 1956
 only 84 percent of its needed
 supplies because pilferage of
 railroad car parts had reduced
 the number of freight cars in
 service.   In addition, sale of
 gasoline drums on the black
 market produced a critical fuel
 shortage by December.
 estimated in October   a  only
 50 percent of the gasoline
 shipped in Korea was reaching
 its destination.
 the South Korean
 army could not fight a success-
 ful defensive action unless

 shortages were overcome,
 in
 April that 25 percent of all
 American military aid goods
 was being sold illegally be-
 fore reaching its destination,
 The deficiency of rail-
 road transportation has been
 alleviated, but new problems
 have arisen.   The lack of funds
 in the military budget has re-
 sulted in the possibility that
 the troops will go hungry un-
 less more funds are made avail-
 able.   Some reports have indi-
 cated that black-marketeering
 of food by officers is at least
 partly responsible for the prob-
 lem, and that a food shortage
 has prevented one reserve divi-
 sion from completing its an-
 nual training program.   Army
 headquarters is reported con-
 sidering plans to furlough
 large numbers of troops in or-
 der to reduce food requirements.
 Another problem, ,a man-
 power shortage, was. eased con-
 siderably last year.   In the
 past, draft-dodging has been
 relatively easy in Korea.   The
 police, responsible for the
 apprehension of draft dodgers,
 have been prone to accept bribes.
 This has made it necessary to
 keep conscriptees in service
 for a period considerably, longer
 than the legal three-year term.
 In the fall of  1956 a
 full-scale program to apprehend
 draft dodgers was instituted
 and thousands have been induct-
 ed.                 Conscription of students
 also began this spring.  As a
 result, army leaders now hope

 year 100,000 of'the 240,000 en-
 listed men who have served for
 more than three years.   It is
 questionable, however, whether
 or not South Korea has the man-
 power to support the existing
 establishment with only a
 three-year term of service.
 Considerable progress was
 made during,the past year  in
 implementing the reserve pro-
 gram.  The ten reserve divisions,
 each of which has a nucleus of
 20600. regular personnel assigned
 to its training site, have be-
 gun to train their assigned
 reservists in regular 30-day
 training programs.  These re-
 serve divisions are expected
 to.be fully equipped with small
 arms and, as funds'become avail-
 able, with mortars and recoil-
 less rifles,  The training is
 reportedly being conducted ef-
 ficiently, despite the fact
 that the families of many re-
 servists inevitably suffer con-
 siderable hardship while the
 breadwinner is away.

 because these services are re-

 suffer from materiel shortages.
 Artillery ammunition for train-
 ing purposes is in short sup-
 ply, and the air force still
 needs more T-33 jet trainers.
 In addition, World War II-type
 vehicles and signal equipment
 are wearing out and replacement
 parts are unavailable.
 A number of South Korean
 officers believe the best solu-
 tion for many of the problems
 of the armed forces would be to
 reduce the size of the standing
 military establishment and in-
 crease the reserve.  In  this
 way, the remaining troops could
 be better equipped and fed, the
 military budget reduced, and
 striking power augmented. In
 addition, such a step would per-

 eliminating one of the basic
 causes of corruption within the

 maximum possible combat strength
 in preparation for a "march
 north," has so far refused to
 listen to proposals for a re-
 duction in the size of the
 services.   He will probably
 maintain this view unless con-
 vinced that combat efficiency
 would be increased rather than
 decreased by a personnel cut.
 Morale and Leadership
 The morale and leadership
 of the South Korean armed forces
 have shown some improvement
 during the past year.   A sharp
 increase in the number of de-
 fections to North Korea, which
 caused considerable alarm a
 year ago, has been reversed.
 Nevertheless, basic discontent
 with the Rhee administration
 remains strong at many levels
 within the services.  Morale
 may suffer if high-ranking of-
 ficers attempt to repeat the
 25X1
 practice during last year's
 presidential election and swing
 the army vote to the Liberal
 Party during next year's Na-
 tional Assembly elections.
 Factionalism within the
 services has declined for the
 time being following the recent
 transfer from key positions of
 Generals Chong Il-kwon and Yi
 Hyong-kun, the two principal
 rivals for power.   The other
 full general on active duty,
 Paek Son-yop,  is now army chief
 of staff.   So far, he has not
 attempted a major reshuffle of
 the army high command.   The re-
 cently announced appointment
 of the former air force chief
 of staff, Lt. Gen. Kim Chung-
 yul, as minister of defense
 may also inhibit the develop-
 ment of factionalism in view
 of Kim's relative freedom from
 such associations.
 In the 12 months the Com-
 munists have held office in
 Iceland's coalition government,
 they have been gradually en-
 trenching themselves in govern-
 ment agencies--particularly in
 those controlling the economic
 life of the country.   Iceland's
 foreign trade continues to shift
 toward the Soviet bloc, and the
 Conservative opposition is being
 steadily weakened.  Although
 the Communists have suffered
 some losses in the trade unions,
 there are no signs of an immi-
 nent breakup of the Progressive-
 Social Democratic-Labor Alliance
 coalition cabinet.
 The Communist-dominated
 Labor Alliance entered the gov-
 ernment in late July 1956 fol-
 lowing the general election of
 24 June which left it holding
 the parliamentary balance be-
 tween the Progressive-Social
 Democratic electoral alliance
 and the Conservative Party.
 Protracted bargaining gave the
 Labor Alliance two cabinet
 posts--the Ministry of Social
 Affairs and the Ministry of
 Fisheries and Trade--in a coali-
 tion headed by Prime Minister
 Hermann Jonasson, the leader of
 the largely agrarian Progressive
 Party, and including the So-
 cial Democrats.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 The coalition has endured,
 despite some strains and fre-
 quent rumors of impending rup-
 ture, because each party has
 been primarily intent on enjoy-
 ing the, fruits of office.  The
 Communists have been content
 to concentrate for the time
 being on entrenching themselves
 in the government,  leaving
 foreign policy as such to the
 other parties.   In December,
 for example, they tacitly ac-
 cepted a revised agreement with
 the United States discontinuing
 discussions on the withdrawal
 of American forces from the
 NATO air base at Keflavik,
 though the party had for years
 demanded the total expulsion
 of American forces from Iceland.
 Communist Gains
 This tactic of the Com-
 munists has paid off in a con-
 siderable extension of influ-
 ence within the government and
 over the economy of the coun-
 try.  Through the allocation
 of patronage among the parties,
 they have obtained directorates
 on the boards of the three gov-
 ernment banks.
 The Communists have ex-
 ploited their control of the
 Fisheries Ministry, which has
 extensive powers over the is-
 land's chief industry and, by
 Icelandic practice, is semi-
 autonomous.   The Communist
 minister has indirectly in-
 jected himself into foreign
 policy by calling for an ex-
 tension of territorial waters,
 a popular cause'among the high-
 ly nationalistic Icelanders
 and the subject of a long-
 standing dispute with Britain,
 The success of the coa-
 lition  government  in obtain-
 ing,                  foreign  assistance for
 its   economic' development
 schemes has augmented its
 prestige and consequently that
 of the Communists. In the
 last year,  Iceland obtained
 three loans from the United
 States totaling $11,000,000.
 The Soviet government recently
 offered a general loan amount-
 ing to $25,000,000 for 20 years
 at 2 percent, as well as a 15-
 year loan of $1,000,000 for
 refinancing the purchase of 15
 fishing vessels from East Ger-
 many.   If these loans material-
 ize, the position of the Com-
 munists will be still further
 enhanced.
 As a result of continuing
 internal differences on the
 advisability of the coalition
 with the Communists, the So-
 cial Democrats are weak.   The
 more formidable Conservative
 Party, despite efforts to re-
 verse the trend, has been re-
 duced in influence by a number
 of the same developments which
 ICELANDIC PARLIAMENT
 24 PJW 1956
 have strengthened the Commu-
 nists.                                                                               The new fiscal and
 banking legislation. reduces
 the economic power of the busi-
 nessman-entrepreneur element,
 and various members of the
 Conservative Party are being
 gradually squeezed out of their
 government posts.  Foreign
 loans have undercut the Con-
 servatives' argument that a
 government with Communist mem-
 bers cannot expect economic
 assistance from non-Communist
 sources.
 Communist Difficulties
 Communist leaders have at
 the same time had some trouble
 in holding their rank and file
 in line.   The Hungarian revolt
 made a strong impact on the
 normally isolationist Icelander
 and resulted in some party dis-
 content with the dominant Mos-
 cow faction.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 A more serious difficulty
 is the unpopularity in trade
 union circles of the wage re-
 straint policy adopted by the
 coalition government in its
 effort to arrest Iceland's in-
 flationary spiral.   Since Com-
 munist leaders in the unions
 have been obliged to forego
 their usual practice of spear-
 heading the drive for higher
 wages, they have suffered seri-
 ous losses to Conservative-
 Social Democratic coalitions
 in a number of union elections
 during the first half of 1957.
 The Conservatives have sought
 to alienate labor from the gov-
 ernment by prolonging the
 shipping strike, now in its
 seventh week, in the hope that
 the government would be obliged
 .to resort to compulsory arbi-
 tration.
 Communist control of the
 Labor Alliance is being chal-
 lenged by Hannibal Valdimarsson,
 the renegade Social Democrat
 who holds one of the
 Labor Alliance's
 two cabinet posts
 and heads the Com-
 munist-dominated
 Icelandic Federation
 of Labor.   Fearing
 his ouster from the
 latter post as a re-
 sult of Communist
 losses in the union
 elections, Valdi-
 marsson--so-far with-
 out success--is rej-
 portedly trying to
 convert the Labor
 Alliance into a new
 left-wing party,
 consisting of nob-
 Moscow Communists
 and splinter groups
 from the Social
 landic Labor Party."   This new
 organization would replace both
 the Labor Alliance and the ex-
 isting Communist party and
 would aim at retaining the
 backing of the non-Communist
 voters in the Labor Alliance-
 and ultimately becoming the
 country's sole left-wing party.
 With increasing influence
 over Iceland's national policy,
 the Communists'. first objective
 would probably be to orient
 the country's economy even
 further toward the Soviet bloc.
 Growing trade with the bloc
 and financial assistance from
 the USSR would greatly reduce
 the economic importance of the
 dollar earnings of the Keflavik
 base, which will be approxi-
 mately $11,000,000 in 1957.
 This in turn would put the Com-
 munists in a  much stronger
 position to press for execution
 of their demand for American
 troop withdrawal in line with
 0L

 and to offset their losses in

 doubt as to whether Iceland

 resumption of the "discontin-
 ued" negotiations for withdrawal.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 August 1957
 It can be argued that the re-
 sponsibility for evaluating
 the international situation and
 the defense needs of Iceland
 has been transferred primarily
 from the North Atlantic Council
 to an American-Icelandic joint
 defense board.   This board has
 not yet been convoked.
 Iceland's foreign trade
 continues to shift toward the
 Soviet bloc.   By 1956 the coun-
 try was obtaining 26.4 percent
 of its imports from the bloc
 and sending 30 percent of its
 exports there.   In the first
 four months of 1957, with a
 slightly lower volume of trade,
 these proportions rose to 34
 and 35 percent respectively.
 Iceland now obtains most of its
 petroleum, much lumber, and a
 wide variety of metal goods
 and manufactured products from
 the bloc, and sends about 70
 percent of its frozen fish and
 about half its salted herring
 to bloc markets.   Icelandic
 fish are being priced out of
 nonorbit  markets.
 Iceland's economic depend-
 ence on the Soviet bloc is al-
 ready of sizable proportions.
 Extensive loans from the USSR,
 now under consideration, would
 still more firmly tie the Ice-
 landic economy to the bloc and
 enable the USSR to exercise
 considerable influence,  direct
 or indirect, on the Icelandic
 economy and the policies of
 the government.                     25X1
