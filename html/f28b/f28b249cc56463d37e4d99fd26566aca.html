 . The Soviet Union and China have turned
 to- Canada and Australia to fill the embar-
 rassing  grain  gap  which  repeated  5-year
 plans, crash fertilizer programs, and one
 Great Leap Forward have left unfilled.
 The Soviet Union, with vast agricultural
 resources relative to her population, has im-
 ported as much wheat in the past three years
 as India.
 Communist China is using nearly 40 per-
 cent of all her foreign exchange earnings
 to import food and fertilizer.  China's an-
 nual population growth of 15 million per-

 Australia" each year, good weather or bad.
 Latin America's per capita calorie supply
 slips backward slowly but relentlessly.  Om-
 inously, sheer numbers seem to thrive best
 where agricultural production stagnates.
 In such a world, food and the means to
 produce it have become ianportant instru-

 for aid if carefully used; more powerful than
 arms if strategically planned-America's food

 DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES SUCCESS-
 FUL IN FIRST VITAL TRIAL IN
 SOUTH  VIETNAM-PEOPLE  DE-
 SERVE                   CREDIT   FOR  THEIR
 COMMITMENT  TO  CITIZENSHIP
 THROUGH USE OF THE BALLOT-
 OUR            OWN  NATION  HAD       ITS
 EMERGING TRIALS AND TRIBU-
 LATIONS
 Mr.  RANDOLPH.     Mr. President,
 many of my colleagues have spoken of
 the heartening news of the apparent suc-
 cess of the recent elections in South
 Vietnam.  I, too, am impressed and opti-
 mistic at the size of the voter turnout in
 the face of terrorist activities and real
 and threatened violence.
 Although the healthy, and-according
 to news releases-clean elections do not.
 necessarily mean that this Asiann}lation
 is now finally on firm internal footing, it
 is an indication that the help we have
 been giving, in men, arms, material
 goods, and lives, has not been given In
 vain.
 Among the editorials I have read, the
 commentory appearing in the Tuesday,
 September 13, issue of the New York
 Daily News sums up in cogent terms the
 results of these elections and their mean-
 ing for the people of South Vietnam and
 our own country.
 Mr. President, I have been among the
 supporters of the administration In its
 efforts to assist the Vietnamese toward
 a stable, self-sufficient and democratic-
 ally oriented government.  The path
 which the past three Presidents have
 chosen is a difficult one for them, and
 for us.  But many of our paths have
 been difficult, since our inception born
 of the most difficult step of all-rebellion
 against our own "motherland," England,
 which began in earnest with the Battle
 .of Lexington-Concord on April 19, 1775.
 The editorial to which I refer draws
 some parallels between voting in South
 Vietnam and. in our Republic.  But I
 think other parallels can be drawn-and
 those have to do with our Revolution,
 and our emerging as a democratic con-
 stitutional republic.
 I have mentioned that our Revolution
 began in 1775. It continued, Mr. Presi-
 dent, for 8 years-ending in 1783. Then,
 as we all know, there was still work to
 be done by our forefathers in building
 the kind of government which we hive
 today, and through which we have be-
 come a great nation.  The Founding
 Fathers met to draft our Constitution,
 first on May 25, 1787. But it took many
 months before their work was done, and
 still longer for ratification by the several
 States.  It was 3 years later, May 29,
 1790, before Rhode Island ratified the
 Constitution of our Republic, thereby
 giving it full and binding force, on all
 of us.
 In the months and years ahead, while
 the South Vietnamese delegates struggle
 with the momentous task of framing
 their own governmental system, Mr.
 President, let all of us remember our
 origins.  Let us not expect of them any
 more, or less, than ?is written of us in
 our own history. Let us wish them- wis-
 dom in their counsels, calmness in their
 deliberations-and let us remain with
 them for whatever time it takes, rather
 than giving them just so much time, and
 no more, in which to perform their tasks.
 For there is no greater task, Mr. Presi-
 dent, no more serious responsibility, than
 that of framing the principles by which
 a people shall be governed.  Our con-
 tribution to the people of South Vietnam
 now must be patience, understanding,
 and continued support.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the editorial in the New York
 Daily News be printed at this point in
 the body of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows :
 A SMASH VIET VOTE VICTORY
 Sunday's election in South Viet Nam were
 an overwhelming victory for the government
 headed by Premier Nguyen Cao Ky, and a
 humiliating defeat for Communism as rep-
 resented variously by the Viet Cong, North
 Viet Namese Boss Ho Chi Minh, Red China,
 and Red Russia.
 The Viet Cong tried every kind of terrorist
 tactics from murder on down to scare voters
 away from the polls.
 Premier Ky would have considered a 60%
 voter turnout a victory.  Instead, about 80%
 of those eligible to vote went to the polls and
 cast ballots-though some of these may have
 been blanks.
 It's sensational-especially when you recall
 that in our 1964 Presidential election only
 62% of our total voting-age population saw
 fit to vote.
 The Sunday South Viet Nam elections pro-
 duced- a 117-member Assembly which is to
 write a constitution for the strategic South-
 east Asian nation.  Premier Ky calls the
 event "the beginning of the end for the
 Communists."
 That may be over-optimistic. But the vic-
 tory at least indicates, we think, that it is
 time to junk any notion that the Viet Cong
 are 10 feet tall or that their terrorist hold on
 large parts of South Viet Nam is unbreakable.
 It is time, too, we believe, to get on with
 winning the war as soon as may be, ignoring
 the home-front Vietniks and all foreign
 kibitzers in the process.
 The South Viet Nam elections strongly in-
 dicate that the great majority of South Viet
 Namese want Communism rooted out of their
 country. Let's help them, to the best of our
 ability.

 PRIZE-WINNING ESSAY BY VIC-
 TORIA ASARE, OF GHANA
 Mr. INOUYE.  Mr. President, school
 children in Ghana were recently offered
 a prize for the best essay on "Democ
 racy: What It Means To Me" in a con-
 test sponsored by the U.S. Information
 Agency and the Ghanaian Ministry of
 Education.
 The winner, out of 4,500 entries, was
 Miss Victoria Asare, 19.  Her essay was
 published in the September 10 issue of
 the Christian Science Monitor.
 Since this essay gives each of us an op-
 portunity to see how one young African
 views democracy, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the essay be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the essay
 was ordered to be printed in the REC-
 ORD, as follows:
 [From the Christian Science Monitor
 Sept. 10, 1966]
 DEMOCRACY AS SEEN BY A GIRL IN GHANA
 (By Victoria Asare)
 Democracy is such a wide and diversified
 concept that to my mind it defies definition.
 However, although it may seem impossible
 to capture its essence in one neat phrase, one
 can say that. democracy rests on a trinity of
 permanent values; liberty, fraternity, equal-
 ity.
 The latter two fall easily into line but how
 can one and the same system incorporate lib-
 erty and equality since liberty of its very
 nature would seem to demand diversity?
 Edward Lindeman puts it like this: "Where
 conformity is imposed as an external dis-
 cipline, liberty is by definition excluded."
 But to my mind it is this very tension be-
 tween liberty and equality that gives democ-
 racy its vital force.  It leaves room for a
 fruitful clash of ideas resulting in new devel-
 opments.  Edmund  Burke,  believing  that
 liberty was "the dearest of the democratic
 graces" more or less ignored the idea of equal-
 ity.
 On the other hand, Rousseau held that
 since men were by nature unequal, it was
 the work of society to make them equal.
 What exactly he meant by making them
 equal I am not sure, but, it seems to me that
 under a democratic regime all should have
 equal  opportunities  to  develop  whatever
 talent they may possess since all are equally
 worthy of respect on account of their dig-
 nity as human beings.
 All    through  the   ages  men  have  been
 searching for a way-a system of living that
 would set them free, help them to live in
 harmony with their inner selves and with
 other men.
 Plato, Rousseau, Lincoln, Aggrey are just
 a few of the apostles of democracy.  With
 each of them the ideal became more and more
 fully realized till today there is hardly a cor-
 ner of the world which is not in love with
 freedom.
 Africa is no exception, nor is Ghana. The
 very fact that "Animal Farm" was once con-
 fiscated in our schools shows that the youth
 were wide awake but applying the moral too
 closely to home!
 BATTLE CRY TWISTED
 The trouble about democracy is that it
 is something which has to mature over a
 long period, otherwise it loses its roots and
 withers.  No one will deny that the battle cry
 of the French revolutionaries was "liberty,
 fraternity, equality," yet in their fanatic pur-
 suit of their ideals their cry was turned into
 "licence, fratricide, inequality."
 The quest for liberty, fraternity, equality
 must be a patient one and the leader of a
 democratic government must be prepared
 for many false starts and disappointments.

 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400110013-2         ~,
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE      September 13, 1966
 "Instability, tension, and Immaturity are
 inevitable when people are just beginning to
 face collectively and individually, a wide
 range  of  new  situations and  problems"
 (Adrian Hastings in his article "The Second
 Revolution"-New Blackfriars, March, 1966).
 And to try to make everyone follow "the
 party line" just because one thinks it the
 best for them is to invite disaster as we
 have already seen here in Ghana.  There
 must be a democratic approach.  A leader
 'must be willing to see his plans only partially
 There must be give and take and it is here
 that Africans have an advantage over more
 developed countries.  Living close to the
 soil and living with its slow, peaceful rhythm,
 most Africans can wait patiently for growth.
 The large and extended family system, too,
 gives every opportunity for give and take.
 It is futile to argue that a newly inde-
 pendent country "cannot afford" to be demo-
 cratic. , A one-party system may seem to be
 the inevitable choice for a developing coun-
 try which has to build up Its economy, give
 an illiterate population much guidance, and
 do In 10 years what other nations have
 taken hundreds of years to do.
 This may seem on the face of it very wise
 indeed, but recent events iiS our country
 have shown it to be a short-sighted policy.
 The 80 percent Illiterate population soon
 tired of the forced , "guidance."  They were
 not willing to be led by the nose forever.
 FAMILY FRAMEWORK
 This goes to show that people who thought
 that democracy was not practicable in a
 country like Ghana were all wrong.  They
 seemed to Imply that we ought not to try out
 democracy until we had become wise and
 good under dictatorship.  What folly! Any
 man who resolves never to get into the
 water until he has learned to swim will in-
 deed wait forever and never learn.
 We could do worse than base our teaching
 of democracy on a framework which we know
 already-the family.  If I mention family, it
 includes  not  only  my  father,  mother,
 brothers and sisters, but the extended family
 or group of relatives living in single or in
 neighboring communities. We are under the
 leadership of the elder men of the family,
 one of whom is popularly acknowledged as
 the head.
 I remember once there arose the problem of
 sending to a secondary school one of the girls
 `whose parents were dead.  All the relatives
 met together and discussed how they were
 going to do this.  It was finally decided that
 three of the uncles who were fairly well-off
 should  contribute  a  certain  amount  of
 money each month.
 Though the head died, this system con-
 tinued to operate because once they had
 given their opinion and come to a satisfac-
 tory agreement they considered that out of
 loyalty to the family and respect for the
 head their promises must be kept.
 This being the normal family's way of
 dealing with problems, it should not be hard
 to get people to understand democracy on
 a larger scale.
 Besides, they are already familiar with
 democratic government, though not con-
 sciously so.  I am referring to chieftaincy
 which holds in embryo almost all the essen-
 tial features of democracy.
 TENURE WITH STRINGS
 A chief is made eligible for office by his
 birth into the royal family, but his ultimate
 selection to community headship depends
 upon the clear recognition of his acquired
 abilities to lead, by three powerful groups:
 first, by the members of his own family, then
 by the council representatives of all the other
 families in the community, and finally and
 most democratically, by the individual mem-
 bers of all the families who register approval,
 or disapproval through their own representa-
 tives.
 His tenure, like that of the family head,
 depends upon his behavior.  If he fails to
 please, out he goes, to be replaced by another
 member of the royal family who can gain the
 necessary approval.  In this way autocracy is
 prevented.
 Nowadays, we find that the claims of the
 native chiefs are often unduly overlooked
 when native questions are being dealt with.
 The chief was formerly a man of very great
 importance.  But his present position is
 anomalous.   Both his rights and duties are
 ill-defined, and, as a natural consequence,
 he has lost a great deal of self-respect.
 I think that it is the duty of any demo-
 cratic government to endeavor to restore the
 native chief to his former position of trust
 in the community.  He must be given real
 power, definite responsibilities, and definite
 rights and duties.
 If this is done I feel sure we will be de-
 veloping along lines of natural evolution in-
 stead of substituting for our own laws and
 customs, a system that we think is better
 just because it. happens to be in force in
 Great Britain or Russia.
 Improvement on, and not mere imitation
 of the views of the Western democratic cre-
 do, whether in morals, manners, and cus-
 toms, or in dress, art, or industry is the trade
 keynote of civilization throughout the world.
 If democracy is to have the proper en-
 vironment in which to develop there must
 be a stable economy and more and varied
 educational opportunities.
 "In general the economy is not develop-
 ing comparably with education and there is
 a real danger that higher educatiori-espe-
 cially if it is Incomplete will come to put
 people out of a job, rather than into one.
 "This is especially true as so little of the
 educational effort is directed toward a trade
 or craft.  It is academic, geared to profes-
 sional work or to the white-collar jobs of
 an advanced industrial society, but that so-
 ciety hardly exists yet in Africa"  (Adrian
 Hastings).  Therefore, there is need for more
 emphasis on technical training so that there
 will be skilled workers to fill tjie jobs made
 available by an expanding economy.
 But preparing people to fill posts is only
 a minor part of education.  Democracy is
 not just a form of government, it is an atti-
 tude of mind and in educating people for it
 there are many factors to be considered.  I
 shall deal with only two extremes.
 First, there are those whose ideas Of free-
 dom have been so blunted that they may
 have to be shaken out of a servile frame of
 mind.  To such people it must be pointed
 out that they have a right to speak their
 mind, to fight against injustice, to vote for
 The  headmaster  eventually  decided  to
 teach them a lesson.  He allowed the stu-
 dents' food committee to take over com-
 pletely the  ordering                                                                                                                        of  provisions. They
 were to be entirely responsible for handing
 out the food to the cooks and hardest of
 all for keeping within a fixed budget. The
 experiment failed.
 After a week the boys tired of the extra
 work involved,  and,  worse still,  half the
 school was reporting at the dispensary with
 stomach-aches !
 But the committee had learned at least
 this: That democracy Is not all shouting for
 rights.
 Freedom has limits and we should all re-
 spect each other's.  What makes a society
 Is a common aim; and to have a solid, last-
 ing society there should be rules and some
 basic moral  standards.  What  should  be
 learned is that we are what we are today be-
 cause of our neighbors, their personalities,
 and the influence of all those we have ever
 met.
 Therefore, we should respect the Ideas of
 other people and accept and bear our own
 mistakes if we are in the wrong, for we are
 all fallible.
 EDUCATED MINORITY
 People who have recognized their freedom,
 its limits, and their fallibility form a free
 state.  A man of a free state is bold enough
 to stand by the light given him.  This means
 he is able to bear witness to the right and
 wrong he sees.  He need not close windows
 and doors in order to talk about the govern-
 ment, religion, or a frivolous book on poli-
 tics found in the library.
 This does not mean that he may always
 criticize the government if it intervenes in

 Quite obviously, it supports the view
 of President Johnson and strongly en-
 dorses our stand against Communist
 aggression in Vietnam.
 The President has declared again and
 again that we do not seek any territory
 or any special rights in Vietnam.  Like-
 wise, he has made it very clear that we
 are fighting the cause of liberty for the
 South Vietnamese and, in consequence,
 for all men.
 The President has warned the Com-
 munists that we will not quit and that
 we will stay until peace is achieved at
 the conference table or until the aggres-
 sion is halted.
 The editorial to which I previously re-
 ferred goes back 30 years to reinforce its
 case.  Certain events of that period are
 written on history's darker pages.
 In 1936 France decided not to chal-
 lenge Hitler's remilitarization of the
 Rhineland.  By the time it became ap-
 parent that he would never stop, Hit-
 ler had marshaled a mighty army, a
 fleet of marauding U-boats, and a power-
 ful air force.
 Hitler stacked up his dominoes, as the
 Indianapolis newspaper recalled.  They
 consisted of Austria, the Sudetenland,
 then all of Czechoslovakia, and ultimate-
 ly Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, the
 Baltic States, the Balkans, France, and
 North Africa.
 Parenthetically,  it  should  also  be
 pointed out that during those years Mus-
 solini's Italy. subjugated Ethiopia, and
 Japan penetrated farther and farther
 into Manchuria.
 With the rest of the world, many Amer-
 icans also looked upon these invasions
 with the illusory hope that the aggressors
 would soon be satisfied.
 But now we choose to resist. The his-
 tory of three decades ago is not repeat-
 ing.  Wp are determined to stem the
 Communist tide before it overruns all of
 southeast Asia.  Responsible Americans
 realize that giving in to aggressors can-
 not stop them. That, we are reminded in
 this perceptive editorial, is why we are
 fighting in Vietnam.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the entire editorial be printed
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Indianapolis (Ind.) Star, Aug.;14,
 19661
 HISTORY DIDN'T REPEAT
 France in 1936 chose not to fight Adolf
 Hitler when he remilitarized the Rhineland.
 Most French leaders thought he would stop
 there.
 By the time they realized he would never
 stop-that it would take superior force to
 stop him-he had all of the trump cards, a
 lightning war land army, a fleet of U-boats
 and a powerful air force.
 The United States today chooses to fight
 Asian Communism as it applies armed force
 to seize South Viet Nam.  We aim to stop
 the Red tide before it overruns 64 Southeast
 Asia.
 The peaceniks today do not consider Viet
 Nam to be the Rhineland of our generation.
 The appeasers of the 1930s did not consider
 the Rhineland of 1936 to be a crucial issue
 for their generation.  They scoffed at the
 "domino theory" of Winston Churchill and,
 other tough-minded, realistic men.
 Hitler began stacking up his dominoes-
 Austria, the Sudetenland sections of Czecho-
 slovakia, finally all of Czechoslovakia, ulti-
 mately Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, the
 Baltic states,  the Balkans, France, North
 Africa.
 The chief peace advocate of that tragic era
 was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who
 after pleading with Hitler at Munich not to
 start a war, and offering Czechoslovakia as
 appeasement, flew back to England and an-
 nounced to the world it was assured of "peace
 in our time."
 Responsible American leaders realize today
 that you cannot stop aggressors by giving in
 to them.  That is why we are fighting in
 Viet Nam.
 But the peaceniks go on believing, as Ne-
 ville Chamberlain believed, that you can stop
 aggressors by giving them what they seek at
 the moment.  Some people never learn.
 EXCLUSION OF PIECE RATE FARM-
 WORKERS  FROM  WAGE  AND
 HOUR BILL
 Mr. ROBERTSON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 at this point in the RECORD a statement
 indicating why I intend to support the
 motion that will be made tomorrow by
 the Senator from Vermont [Mr. PROUTY]
 to instruct Senate conferees on the wage
 and hour bill to insist on the Senate pro-
 vision for the exclusion of farmworkers
 who are paid on a piece rate basis.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY SENATOR ROBERTSON
 Senator A. WILLis ROBERTSON, Democrat of
 Virginia, announced yesterday he will sup-
 -port a move to be made in the Senate this
 week to send the Fair Labor Standards bill
 back to conference for exclusion from cover-
 age of hand-harvest workers who are paid on
 a piece-rate basis.
 "On Wednesday, the Senate plans to act on
 the conference report on the wage and hour
 bill,"  said  Senator   ROBERTSON.   "Senator
 PROUTY,   of Vermont, will offer an amend-
 ment to instruct the Senate conferees to
 insist on the Senate provision for exclusion
 from coverage of piece-rate farm workers.
 "In Virginia, that would apply primarily to
 those who are paid by. the bushel to pick
 apples, but the definition would be for all
 piece work.
 "If  the Prouty motion is  adopted, the
 House conferees would probably ask for in-
 structions from the House, and the House
 may approve, although the motion made in
 the House on May 26 to recommit the bill
 to eliminate completely the coverage of agri-
 culture, was defeated by a vote of 231 to 168.
 "The inclusion of thousands Of agricul-
 tural workers will, I believe, only lead to
 further mechanization of farms with a re-
 sulting loss in job opportunities.
 "And, as was pointed out by Senator HOL-
 LAND, it is a forerunner of a move to apply
 the minimum wage to all farm-workers, to be
 followed, of course, by their unionization.
 "More and more, the Government is en-
 croaching upon a rather unique and vital
 principle of our representative democracy-
 private enterprise.  The framers of our Con-
 stitution in embodying private enterprise in
 that great document intended that the Gov-
 ernment would be only an umpire of fair play
 between management and labor.  The pend-
 ing bill is an evidence of a modern trend in
 the direction of a managed economy-a poor
 substitute for private enterprise and doomed
 to failure when it controls management but
 not labor."
 FLY ASH: A WASTE PRODUCT THAT
 ,CAN CUT COSTS
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, our
 colleague, Senator ROBERT  C. BYRD of
 West Virginia, has written a revealing
 and thoughtful article in the September
 15 edition of Public Utilities Fortnightly
 on a project sponsored by Federal funds
 involving the use of coal fly ash. Senator
 BYRD has explained the great value of
 reusing this waste product which now
 represents a costly disposal problem for
 our public utilities.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 article printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 (By the Honorable ROBERT C. BYRD, U.S. Sen-
 ator from West Virginia)
 Last year when I amended a bill to add
 $275,000 to Office of Coal Research funds for
 the purpose of constructing a pilot plant at
 West Virginia University to produce building
 brick from fly ash, a colleague on the Senate
 Appropriations Committee remarked:
 "I would vote that amount just to find
 places to get rid of the stuff."
 Disposing of fly ash has been a growing
 problem since piles of cinders from beehive
 ovens began to blight areas of West Virginia
 and Pennsylvania in the latter part of the
 last century.  In more recent years, as the
 electric utility industry developed equipment
 to capture fly ash before it leaves the stack,
 the dilemima has spread to every area where
 there is a coal-fired power plant.  Today fly
 ash is being used to fill swampy land and
 old quarries; it is dumped at sea and in any
 place where it can be hidden.
 Slowly, American industry is waking up
 to the fact that wanton discard of fly ash-
 is not only costly; it is also wasteful.
 The value of fly ash was first recognized by
 the Romans, who used volcanic ash and lime
 to make hydraulic cement for the cons:truc-
 tion of their buildings.  While a great deal
 of experimentation took place through the
 years, the use of the material in modern
 times did not begin on a large scale until
 after World War II, when electrostatic pre-
 cipitators came into wide use to remove
 solids from the flues of coal-fed steam plants.
 For some time it has been known that
 fly ash could be used as a mixture for con-
 crete, but the extent of this utilization has
 been entirely too limited.  Probably no more
 than 5 per cent of the 20 million tons col-
 lected last year was put to constructive use.
 With the addition of electric generating ca-
 pacity this year and in the years ahead, the
 accumulation will spiral upward, especially
 because of increased efficiency in the arrest
 of particulate matter in the boiler plant op-
 eration.  Modern precipitators can trap as
 much as 99.5 per cent of the fly ash that
 occurs in combustion.  Used advantageously,
 this material can help defray the cost of ex-
 pensive air pollution control equipment.
 Costs of disposing of fly ash are estimated
 at from 50 cents to $2 a ton, depending
 largely upon the distance it must be hauled.
 Mere eradication of this expense can bring
 important  savings  to  electric  companies;
 when demand for the by-prouduct is es-
 tablished, sales will further reduce Opera-
 tional costs and, in effect, strengthen coal's
 competitive position in the utility market.
 The brick-making project at West Virginia
 University appears to have outstanding po-
 tential.                                                                                                                            In planning a production of 1,000
 cured bricks and 8,000 uncured bricks per
 eight-hour day, the university will demon-
 strate the value of the process to commer-
 cial firms.  Experimentations to ? date have
 indicated  that  the  coal-based  bricks  can

 meet or exceed all standard requirements,
 and the cost of producing them will be rea-
 sonable and competitive.
 HOW FLY ASH MAY BE USED
 Whatever the outcome of this project,
 however, there are already numerous proven
 uses for fly ash, but the value of the product
 is not likely to be quickly recognized with-
 out proper marketing stimulus on the part
 of the coal, and electric industries.
 A unique pamphlet published by the Balti-
 more Gas and Electric Company points out
 that, when fly ash is mixed with cement, the
 end product contains these features:
 Improved Workability.   Concrete in the
 plastic state flows more readily and finishes
 better when it contains fly ash. It is more
 cohesive and plastic and is less prone to
 segregation and bleeding.    Less vibration is
 required when concrete contains fly ash.
 Better Appearance. Smoother surface with
 less  cracking.   Fewer  voids  and sharper
 edges.
 Lower  Permeability.    Fly  ash  concrete
 shows less susceptibility to water penetra-
 tion.  This is of particular importance when
 concrete is in contact with sea water.
 Improved Chemical Stability.  Many tests
 have shown that fly ash concrete resists the
 action of sulphates and sulphuric acid.
 Less Heat of Hydration.  Fly ash concrete
 demonstrates as m?ch as 25 per cent less
 temperature rise when compared with con-
 crete that does not contain fly ash.  This
 feature Is of considerable value in mass
 concrete.
 Lower Shrinkage.  Fly ash concrete shows
 less tendency for cracking during the initial
 setting and drying.
 Continued Strength Gain. The pozzolanic
 action of  fly ash concrete continues over
 many' years  and  insures  higher  ultimate
 strength than all cement concrete.
 More Uniform Color.  The presence of fly
 ash in a concrete mix produces 4 more uni-
 form color.
 Resistance to Thermal and Chemical Ef-
 fects.  Fly ash concrete is more resistant to
 freezing and thawing and to salts used as
 ice removers.
 Fly ash has been used as a concrete rein-
 forcement in the construction of some of
 the world's largest dams.  It has added years
 to the life of the concrete highway.  It
 serves as a mineral filler In asphalt paving.
 The Santa Fe Railway is using it to stabilize
 its roadbed.
 GREATER UTILIZATION IS FORTHCOMING
 J. P. Capp, chemical engineer at the Mor-
 gantown (West Virginia) Coal Research Cen-
 ter, U.S. Department of the Interior, foresees
 a multimillion-ton outlet for fly ash in light-
 weight aggregate, which currently accounts
 for more than one-third of fly ash consump-
 tion in this country.  Consolidated Edison
 Company is operating a lightweight, aggre-
 gate sintering plant in New York city, and
 another such plant is in operation near De-
 troit Edison's River Rouge facility.
 Smaller sintering plants are producing on
 a semipilot-plant scale in Detroit and Phila-
 delphia.
 The potential would seem almost unlim-
 ited, yet activity in fly ash utilization con-
 tinues uninspiring.  In an effort to spur its
 use, I have recently appealed to the Secre-
 tary of Commerce, who is authorized under
 the Appalachian Development Act to require
 each participating state, to the maximum
 extent possible, to use coal derivatives for
 purposes of research and development in the
 construction of highways and roads.  The
 initial results are encouraging and hope-
 fully will prompt states outside Appalachia
 to take advantage of fly ash availability at
 generating stations within proximity of the
 highways they are building or planning.
 Earlier this year Robert E. Lee tall, vice
 president of the. National Coal Association,
 told the Electric Club of Los. Angeles that
 use of coal by southern California utilities
 will open the way for utilization of fly ash
 in that area's building industry.  He pre-
 dicted that introduction of fly ash to West
 coast industry will begin as soon as the
 Southern California Edison Company plant
 in Clark county, Nevada, goes into operation.
 The economic benefits of fly ash may have
 been established nationally when the Clark
 county station goes on the line four or five
 years hence.  But, meanwhile, neither coal
 nor the utilities should be satisfied with the
 present pace of fly ash sales. Experience in-
 dicates that proper promotion would more
 than pay for itself.
 WHAT'S  HAPPENED  TO  RESPECT
 FOR                    LAW  AND  ORDER?
 Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, with an
 alarming increase in the crime rate in
 the country, as reflected by the reports of
 the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it is
 reassuring to read of a citizen's pride
 which results from respect for law and
 order.
 That pride is expressed in an article,
 entitled "What's Happened to Respect for
 Law and Order?" written by Senator
 ROBERT BYRD of West Virginia and ap-
 pearing in the September 1966, edition
 of Future magazine.  The magazine is
 published by the U.S. Junior Chamber of
 Commerce.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 article printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 WHAT'S HAPPENED TO RESPECT FOR LAW AND
 ORDER?
 (By Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, Democrat, West
 Virginia)
 A serious domestic crisis Is facing our Na-
 tion today.  I refer not only to the crime
 crisis as it appears in widely publicized sta-
 tistics and to the fact that the rate of serious
 crime has increaseed six times faster than the
 rate of our population growth since 1958.
 I refer to the dangerous breakdown of re-
 spect for law and order sweeping this Country
 today which recently has shown itself in the
 demonstrations in "protest" of the foreign
 policies of our Federal government, specifical-
 ly giving aid and comfort to the Communists
 by opposition to our military efforts in Viet
 Nam.
 The- freedom to protest has become, at the
 least, a means of cheap exhibitionism for
 restless, unoccupied adolescents;  and more
 fearfully, a way of denigrating our carefully
 conceived national policies and a cause of
 suffering and death.

 respect and significance.  Recent events have
 emphasized that there has been a violent
 breach  of two cardinal    principles of our
 American society-the respect for law and
 order and the recourse to orderly process of
 law to seek redress of wrongs.
 A line from the creed of the U.S. Jaycees
 affirms, "That government should be of laws
 rather than of men."  I am sometimes led
 to wonder whether the people-most of them
 quite young-who are attacking this coun-
 try, its laws, and its foreign polices have
 heard. of Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini, if
 they have any conception of the kind of gov-
 ernment that would result if they were suc-
 cessful in their attempts to undermine the
 laws, to discredit the men who endanger
 their lives to enforce these laws, and to cause
 doubt  and disaffection among those men
 who stalwartly serve in support of our Na-
 tion's military commitments.  The govern-
 ment of men inevitably follows the failure
 of the government of laws,
 The time has come for the lawabiding
 citizens of this country to realize that law
 and order are as vulnerable as they are val-
 uable, and with this in mind, to put their
 full weight behind the laws and those men
 who enforce them.   The members of the
 progressive organization, the United States
 Jaycees, are ideally suited to show the way.
 The Nation needs your help.
 I have been very interested to learn about
 the Jaycees' statewide project in Wisconsin
 to rally public support behind the police.  I
 understand this project is extremely success-
 ful, and that other Jaycee organizations are
 considering initiating similar ones.  I would
 strongly encourage them to do so.
 At one time, a suggestion was advanced in
 the District of Columbia that a campaign be
 undertaken to enlist the active support of
 the  business  and professional  community
 in combating crime, in the belief that this
 could make     an  immense  contribution to
 justice in the community.
 It is my belief that, on a national scale,
 an intensive effort toward encouraging sup-
 port of and cooperation with the police and
 other law enforcement officers would be an
 effective element in the prevention of crime.
 Moreover, I believe that if the Jaycees would
 so desire to undertake the organization. of
 such effort, and could campaign to increase
 public  support  for  law  observance  and
 greater responsibility of action in support of
 duly constituted authority, they would prove
 to be a truly independent and effective voice
 In encouraging decency of public action and
 in protecting the civil rights of all, the ma-
 jority as well as the minority.
 The U.S. Jaycees represent the very op-
 posite end ofthe pole from these dangerous
 and irresponsible elements of society about
 which I have been talking. Your goal is serv-
 ice, to the community and to humanity.  We
 need more people In this country today who
 equate freedom with responsibility, or we
 will soon be in danger of losing both.
 Western civilization cannot endure with-
 out preserving Its basic principles of justice
 and humanity for all, and our American so-
 ciety cannot endure if it drifts into lethargic
 acceptance of breaches in the strong body of
 our law, as based on our Constitution.
 When we reach the stage where some peo-
 ple can break the law without punishment in
 the name of individual freedom, then it is
 obvious who will be the loser.  The loser will
 be John Q. Citizen-you and me, our wives
 and  children,  old  and young,  black  and
 white, in cities and hamlets all over America.

 THE VOTE IN VIETNAM
 The turnout in the South Vietnamese elec-
 tion-some 80 percent of the eligible voters-
 is being hailed with ample justification as
 a victory for the Saigon government and,
 indirectly, for the United States.
 It is a victory because the Viet Cong tried,
 and failed, to so intimidate the voters that
 they would stay away from the polls.  To a
 lesser degree it is also a victory because
 Buddhist elements tried, and failed, to per-
 suade the people to boycott the elections.
 Most observers, in these circumstances, would
 have been sa.tisfied with a 60 percent turn-
 out. Anything in excess of that can properly
 be regarded as a welcome bonus.
 It is too early, of course, to know what the
 heavy vote means in terms of support for or
 opposition to the Saigon government and its
 conduct of the war.  The purpose of this
 election was to choose members of a con-
 stituent assembly which is expected to draft
 a new constitution by next March.  After
 that will come the selection of a legislative
 assembly to restore civilian rule to South
 Viet Nam.  These are the significant tgsts of
 what the shape of the political future will be.
 None of this, however, detracts from the
 importance of the response by the South
 Vietnamese to this opportunity to demon-
 strate their interest in making a political
 choice.  Had the voter turnout been small,
 that would have been seized upon as evi-
 dence that the people were fed up and wanted
 nothing more than to be left alone. Certainly
 this is what Hanoi hoped for in its effort
 to keep the voters away from the polls.  That
 it didn't happen, that the people turned out
 in record numbers despite the years of war,
 privation and oppression, is a heartening in-
 dication that the South Vietnamese believe
 the future holds something better for them
 thail submission to the-agony of Communist
 domination.

 SMASHING VICTORY IN VIETNAM
 What took place in South Viet Nam yes-
 terday was the most reassuring, progressive
 and promising thing that has happened
 there in years.  Surpassing all predictions,
 over three-fourths of the country's registered
 voters went to the polls to elect a national
 assembly.  The enormous turnout means a
 smashing victory for the Saigon government,
 and a clear defeat for the communists.
 For  weeks  communist  agents,  following
 Hanoi's line, had been calling on South Viet-
 namese to boycott and "crush" the "sham
 elections," and backed up their demand with
 threatened, and actual, terror attacks. The
 militant Buddhist monks also tried to un-
 dercut the elections by urging on followers
 "non-co-operation" toward the balloting.
 The names of yesterday's winners won't be
 known until later this week, but the massive
 turnout, witnessed and verified by a host of
 foreign observers, means a government vic-
 tory, ' By that we don't mean, necessarily,
 a victory for Prime Minister Ky and the
 ruling generals.  We mean a declaration of
 loyalty to and faith in those men in author-
 ity who, for all their faults and shortcomings,
 represent the non-Communist alternative.
 We have long believed the South Viet-
 namese people are basically against the Viet
 Cong, because they know their aims and
 their methods.  Despite many disappoint-
 ments, they are disposed to look to Saigon
 for the answer to the communists.  That is
 what this election means: that millions of
 Vietnamese overcame their skepticism and
 apathy-and fear of Viet Cong retaliation-
 to register their faith in a non-communist
 future for their country.
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Post,
 Sept. 13, 1966]
 SOUTH VIETNAM'S ELECTION
 The large vote in the South Vietnamese
 elections is a triumph for the government,
 more                   complete  than  anyone  would  have
 dared predict in advance.                  If the country
 were as completely dominated by the Viet-
 cong as some critics have alleged, such a
 turnout would have been impossible.
 The big vote, in the face of Vietcong terror,
 is at once a revelation of the weakness of the
 dissidents and a vindication of the political
 awareness of the rank-and-file of the.peo-
 ple.  The world has learned enough about so-
 called "elections" in Communist and Fascist
 states, to know that elections can be man-
 aged.   It is sufficiently familiar with elec-
 toral frauds to know that elections in which
 voters have no alternative to a dictated slate
 may not be a meaningful index of the extent
 that democracy prevails.
 In this election, however, the fact of vot-
 ing in itself disclosed something about af-
 fairs in the country-whatever the voters
 voted for or against.  To participate in the
 election at all was to defy the Vietcong, to
 repudiate its methods and to opt for the al-
 ternative offered by the government.
 It is what the elected Constituent Assem-
 bly does that will fix the place of this elec-
 tion in history, of course.  The opportunity
 now exists to establish in South Vietnam a
 government with the priceless endowment of
 legitimacy.  No Communist critic can chal-
 lenge successfully or convincingly the cred-
 entials of this elected body.    It has a better
 claim to sovereignty than critical govern-
 ments where the voting has been by bullet
 and not by ballot.
 It will be difficult for the Constituent As-
 sembly to perfect a constitution acceptable
 to all the people, or to an overwhelming ma-
 jority of them.  It will be hard to get a new
 government, functioning under the constitu-
 tion, launched in the midst of war and rebel-
 lion. But the people of South Vietnam have
 made a brave beginning that is a credit to
 them,
 INTRODUCTION OF SENATOR ERVIN
 TO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
 RAILROAD TRIAL COUNSEL
 Mr. TALMADGE.  Mr. President, on
 August 22, the distinguished Senator
 from North Carolina [Mr. ERVIN] ad-
 dressed the National Association of Rail-
 road Trial Counsel in White Sulphur
 Springs, W. Va.  He was introduced by
 our mutual friend, Charles J. Bloch, of
 Macon, Ga.
 Mr. Bloch's introduction of Senator
 ERVIN was a well-deserved tribute to one
 of the most outstanding and dedicated
 Members of this body, whose vast knowl-
 edge of the law and unswerving allegi-
 ance to sound constitutional government
 have served the Senate and the Nation
 with great distinction for many years.
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr.
 Bloch's introduction of Senator ERVIN be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the intro-
 duction was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 If there ever was a time in the history of
 the American Republic in which leadership
 was needed, it is now.
 21427
 And, if there was ever a man fully endowed
 and equipped for such leadership, it is our
 speaker this morning.
 Essential qualifications for such leadership
 are  (1)  Birth  and  heredity  which have
 familiarized the man with the fundamental
 principles  of   American  government: (2)
 Courage; (3) Integrity; (4) Intelligence, (5)
 Experience.
 Seldom are such characteristics combined
 in one man.      If and when they are, there
 should be your leader.

 uated from University of North Carolina in
 1917, SAM ERVIN, JR., son of a distinguished
 North Carolina lawyer, served in France with
 the famed First Division in World War I.
 Twice wounded, twice cited for gallantry, he
 returned to complete his legal education at
 Harvard and to marry his boyhood sweet-
 heart, who is here today.  Practicing in the
 place of his birth, as A.D.C. of Southern
 Railway Company for one of his clients, he
 served his country i   the North Carolina
 Legislature and as a superior Court Judge;
 then his district as a Representative in Con-
 gress; then for six years as a Justice of the
 Supreme Court of North Carolina.  On June
 11, 1954, he was appointed U.S. Senator from
 North  Carolina.  Reelected  that autumn,
 and again in 1956 and 1962, today he serves
 his State and Nation as U.S. Senator and as
 a member of its Judiciary Committee and
 Chairman of its   Committee on Constitu-
 tional Rights.   He has been cited by the
 American Legion for "devotion to the Con-
 stitution"; by the Patriotic Order of Sons of
 America "for great and inspiring public
 services"; by the U.D.C. for defense of Con-
 stitutional Rights.  I, to you, cite him as the
 outstanding American of today, possessing to
 a unique degree those essential characteris-
 tics of leadership America so sorely needs-

 WIRTZ  SUPPORTS WAGE GUIDE-
 LINE ADJUSTMENT FOR COST OF
 LIVING
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I thank the Sen-
 ator from Colorado for his generosity in
 yielding to me.
 Mr. President, I was delighted to notice
 in this morning's New York Times that
 the Secretary of Labor, Mr. Wirtz, has
 formally and publicly committed himself
 to an adjustment of the wage-price
 guidelines to include the increase in the
 cost of living.
 This is mighty welcome news.  To my
 knowledge, the administration has not
 previously recognized the inequity that
 the wage-price guideline represents for,
 the workingman who is held to a wage
 increase that may be exceeded - by the
 rise in the cost of living.
 At  yesterday's  House  hearings  on
 wage-price guidelines, Economist Ger-
 hard Colm suggested that part of the in-
 crease in the cost- of living be permitted
 above the strict productivity guideline,
 but not the entire cost.
 Mr. President, it is most important for
 the President and Congress to recognize
 the' present  wage-price  guideline  in-
 equity for two reasons :
 First, unless we do recognize it, the
 injustice of the present administration
 of the wage-price guideline will kill the
 whole concept.  This would be unfortu-
 nate.  Since President Kennedy insti-
 tuted the concept, it has served the coun-
 try well, in spite of the severe criticism
 it has suffered. In a period of tight de-

 mand, falliig unemployment, rising uti-
 lization of plant capacity, it has kept the
 rise in the cost of living, well below what
 it was in the years prior to its conception.
 Second, the guidelines as presently
 administered represent a clear inequity.
 The worker producing more will actually
 receive less in real wages if prices rise
 more rapidly than the guideline.  Even
 if the cost of living rises less rapidly, it
 erodes the productivity increase the
 worker has earned.
 Secretary Wirtz' suggestion would meet
 this weakness and correct it.
 ., I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
 ticle in the New York Times, reporting
 Secretary Wirtz' commitment, be printed
 at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 GUIDEPOST CHANGE BACKED BY WIRTZ-COST-
 OF-LIVING RISES WOULD BE FACTOR IN PAY
 RAISES
 (By Eileen Shanahan)
 WASHINGTON, September 12.-Labor Secre-
 tary W. Willard Wirtz endorsed today a
 basic change in the Administration's anti-
 Inflationary   wage-price  guideposts.  The
 change would recognize a rise in the cost of
 living as a valid basis for union wage
 increases.
 Mr. Wirtz told a House government opera-
 tions  subcommittee  that  he subscribed
 "completely" to the idea that the guideposts
 should be amended to take consumer price
 increases at least partly into account when
 determining what a fair wage increase was.
 Union leaders have generally argued that
 the guideposts should allow wage increases
 that  fully  reflect  increases  in  consumer
 prices, plus the improved productiveness of
 workers.
 Productiveness is the only guidepost test
 now.
 The proposal for a cost-of-living amend-
 ment to the guideposts was made by HENRY
 S. Rsuss, Democrat of Wisconsin, who con-
 ducted the subcommittee's hearings on plans
 to Improve the guideposts,
 Mr. Wirtz received no support for his view
 from the other Administration official who
 testified at the hearing  Gardner Ackley,
 chairman of the President's Council of Eco-
 nomic Advisers.  On the other land, Mr.
 Ackley did not express disagreement either.
 Instead, he begged off any discussion of
 revisions of the guideposts in language that
 suggested-but did not clearly say-that the
 Administration might be considering a cost-
 of-living amendment.
 "The price increases, Mr. Ackley said, "that
 have raised the workers' cost of living have
 ,undeniably made it more difficult to ask-
 and surely more difficult to expect-orga-
 nized workers to refrain from seeking not
 only wages that would be consistent with
 cost stability but something more to offset
 all or part of the rise in consumer prices.
 "However, I know that you will not ask
 me to discuss whether we may contemplate
 proposing any temporary departure from the
 pure productivity standard for wage in-
 creases in the face of this rise in living
 costs."
 The reasoning behind a partial, but not
 complete, recognition of cost-of-living in-
 creases in the wage guidepost formula was
 outlined by another subcommittee witness,
 Gerhard Colm, chief economist of the Na-
 tional Planning Association.
 The guideposts, he said, "were formulated
 under the assumption that price stability
 could be maintained," but "price stability
 has not been maintained."
 '.'By  allowing,  partial--not  complete-
 adjustment to actual and prospective in-
 Creases in the cost of living, [unionized]
 workers in any one industry are not made
 to bear the full burden of society's failure
 to stabilize prices," Mr. Colin declared. "But
 they are also not permitted to pass this bur-
 den on entirely to other groups in the popu-
 lation with less flexible incomes."
 PRICE INDEX RISES
 The discussion of the cost of living oc-
 curred as the Labor Department was report-
 ing that the index of wholesale prices rose
 again in August for the fifth straiight month,
 Increases in the Wholesale Price Index are
 generally followed by increases in consumer
 prices a few months later.
 The rise in August was an unusually large
 one, four-tenths of a point, and brought the
 Wholesale  Price  Index to  106.8, with the
 average prices of the 1957-59 period taken
 as the base of 100.  The index was nearly
 4 per cent higher than in August a year ago.
 The rise In August was entirely confined to
 foods and farm products,    which  rose  1.4
 points to 111.3.
 Although food price increases affect con-
 sumer budgets, they are often caused by
 purely seasonal factors or such noneconomic
 influgnces as drought.  Economists, there-
 fore, tend to look more at industrial prices
 in determining whether there are general in-
 flationary pressures in the economy.
 The index of wholesale prices of industrial
 commodities remained unchanged in August,
 at 105.2, marking the first month since last
 December that this index did not rise.
 The hearings before the government oper-
 ations subcommittee today focused mainly
 on a plan to make the wage-price guideposts
 more effective, rather than ideas for amend-
 ing them.
 All: the witnesses  expressed some doubt
 about legislation sponsored by Mr.  REUSS
 and Senator JOSEPH S. CLARK, Democrat of
 Pennsylvania, which would give Congress a
 hand in deciding the size of wage increases to
 be permitted under guidelines.
 Except for Dr. Carl II. Madden, the chief
 economist for the Chamber of Commerce of
 the United States, all the witnesses said they
 thought it would be desirable for Congress
 to hold hearings on the guideposts annually,
 in the Interest of public education and to
 give labor and management their say on the
 subject.
 However, Mr. Ackley and Mr. Wirtz agreed
 that there were defects in the idea of per-
 mitting Congress to revise the President's
 guideposts.
 Dr.  Madden  expressed  fears  that  Mr.
 R-uss's proposal would lead to making the
 guideposts mandatory, not voluntary as they
 are now.  He said Government reliance on
 the guideposts to control inflation bad lead
 the Government "to shirk its responsibility
 to do something about the cause of infla-
 tion--o verspendi ng."
 THE AMERICAN INDIAN-ONCE
 FIRST-NOW LAST
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, in head-
 lining its September issue editorial, the
 Plainsman magazine, published in Oma-
 ha, Nebr., states:
 Our "Earliest Americans" really might de-
 serve a bit more attention than they now
 receive.
 The editorial kicks off a most inter-
 esting and enlightening discussion. of the
 problems confronting the American In-
 dian. The editorial; an excellent article
 by Robert Savage, entitled "The Proud,
 Fierce Sioux: Where Are They Today?"
 and an interview with Indian Affairs
 Commissioner Robert L. Bennett by
 Washington  correspondent  Kenneth,
 Scheibel constitute an important docu-
 mentation of the victimization of the
 Indian by the white man when his lands
 were taken and the tribes were shunted
 off onto reservations.
 That part, of course, is well-known
 history, but it is worth recalling over
 and over to demonstrate that there is a
 continuing obligation on this country to
 take  whatever  steps  are  required  to
 achieve  the equality  of   opportunity
 which has been denied for so long. This
 record should also warn us all against
 too much paternalism by the Federal
 Government and the devastating conse-
 quences of suppressing the initiative and
 circumscribing the freedoms of any race
 or any segment of our society.
 With respect to that obligation, the
 interview with Mr. Bennett, as well as
 Mr. Savage's assessment, outline some
 of the steps which are being taken and
 review some of the possibilities which
 are available or which can be developed
 to help the Indians help themselves.
 Mr. President, in my capacity as the
 ranking minority member of the Appro-
 priations Subcommittee on Department
 of the Interior Matters, I am familiar
 with the programs and the effort which
 have been and are being made for the
 Indians of America, of which a large
 number reside in my State of South
 Dakota.
 Some of these activities have o?rig-
 inated with officials of the Bureau of
 Indian Affairs, some have been devel-
 oped from ideas presented by the In-
 dians and their tribal officials, other rec-
 ommendations  have  come from the
 membership of our Appropriations sub-
 committee itself, as we all strive to move
 forward in this problem of vital concern.
 To those who serve on the subcom-
 mittee the articles to which I invite the
 attention of the Senate are familiar sub-
 jects.  Those who do not serve on the
 subcommittee or on other committees
 which have a relationship to the prob-
 lems of the American Indian will, I be-
 lieve, find in these articles information
 of great interest, and I am pleased to
 bring them to the attention of the Senate.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have the editorial, the article,
 and the interview printed at this point
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the edito-
 rial, article, and interview were ordered
 to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Plainsman, September 1966]
 OUR  "EARLIEST  AMERICANS"  REALLY  MIGHT
 DESERVE A BIT MORE ATTENTION THAN THEY
 NOW RECEIVE
 The American Indian, who represents a
 widely-neglected minority race amid several
 years of hue and cry for civil liberties, for
 equal rights and Opportunities among Negro
 Americans, Mexicans and Puero Ricans, has
 been chosen for study in some depth by the
 Plainsman since we feel that his story often
 has been ignored, in at least three of our
 so-called long, hot summers.
 The Indian people, representing the tribes
 that we know so well in the Great Plains,
 have not participated apparently in the sit-
 ins,- sit-downs, the chain-ins, marches, the
 flag waving, speech-making and even rioting
 that has erupted so violently and so fearfully
 in the major cities of the North.
 Perhaps this Is due to three factors:
 First, the Plains Indian is not in a large
 measure a city dweller, where much of the
 racial turmoil has inspired continual and
 decidedly dismal headlines.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE      September 13, 1966
 sharply criticized by George Baldanzi, Inter-
 national President of the United Textile
 Workers of America, in a speech to some 250
 delegates from 75 locals at the union's an-
 nual Southern conference, held Sept. 9-11
 at the Mountain View Hotel.
 Noting that Rep. CURTIS is one of four U.S.
 government advisers to the Kennedy round
 of tariff-cutting talks now in progress in
 Geneva, Baldanzi called on the Johnson ad-
 ministration to "repudiate Cua'is's views as
 contrary to U.S. policy and to do everything
 possible  to protect the American textile
 worker and the American textile industry
 against unfair foreign competition rooted in
 greed, exploitation and substandard wages."
 "If the Curtis program is adopted," Bal-
 danzi said, "thousands of American textile
 workers will lose their jobs.  The scrapping
 of international agreements would intensify
 the drive of the American textile industry, in
 its struggle to survive against foreign compe-
 tition, to introduce automated methods of
 production In a haphazard manner, without
 proper planning, the chief victim of which
 would be the American textile worker."
 Baldanzi, who is also a member of the
 Management-Labor Textile  Advisory  Com-
 mittee, which advises the Government on
 matters concerning the cotton textile indus-
 try, noted that in the speech In which Rep.
 CuRTis proposed that all international tex-
 tile agreements be terminated, the congress-
 man suggested that the American industry
 export some of its know-how and capital to
 lesser-developed countries to produce textiles
 for sale there.  Such a movement, Mr. CuRTIS
 said, would mean that these American firms
 could remain prosperous, pay high dividends
 to their stockholders, contribute to the de-
 velopment of needy countries and promote
 more economic use of world resources.
 "Nowhere", Baldanzi said, "does Mr. CURTIS
 express any concern for the American textile
 worker.  Apparently he is to be abandoned
 and thrown out of work, while industry sends
 its know-how and capital to other countries
 where it can take advantage of the substand-
 ard wages available there."
 "It is no secret," Baldanzi said, "that
 textile machinery of the latest design is
 available to everyone.   The raw materials
 needed in the manufacture of textiles, spe-
 cifically cotton, are available to everyone
 at the same price in the world market.  Ex-
 pert knowledge is likewise universally avail-
 able. Thus, given equal access to machinery,
 raw materials and technical information, the
 foreign manufacturer has just one advantage
 over  his  American  competitor-the  sub-
 standard wages he pays his workers.                                Is it
 these substandard wages that Mr. CuRTrs
 finds so attractive when he suggests that
 American industry export its know-how and
 capital?
 "We  believe  that  the  American  textile
 worker and the American textile industry
 can compete with any textile worker and
 any textile industry anywhere in the world,
 provided they do not have to compete with
 low wages. If wages elsewhere were raised
 to American levels, then the American textile
 worker and the American textile industry
 could  withstand  competition  from  any
 source.
 "The United Textile Workers of America
 would agree to the abolition of all restrictive
 tariffs if a world-wide system of equitable
 standards were established.  But under pres-
 ent conditions the only way to protect the
 jobs  of  American  textile  workers  against
 unfair foreign competition is through the
 estali'hshment of quotas by category for every
 branch of the textile industry--cotton, wool,
 synthetics, etc."
 Baldanzi said that if the Curtis program
 were adopted, "and apparently the Congress-
 man does not confine his proposals to the
 textile industry, perhaps millions of Ameri-
 can workers would lose their jobs, and this
 could lead to serious economic and social
 unrest.' This no American worker-whether
 organized or unorganized, whether in the
 textile, or any other, industry-will tolerate."
 Delegates  to  the  three-day   conference
 represented members of the United Textile
 Workers of America in Kentucky, Tennessee,
 Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia,
 and  Alabama.  Speakers,  in  addition  to
 Baldanzi, were  International   Secretary-
 Treasurer Francis Schaufenbil, regional and
 legislative directors of the union, and repre-
 sentatives of various federal and state agen-
 cies.                                                          The members of the union's Southern
 organizing and administrative staff also par-
 ticipated in the conference.
 I cite the entire news release to em-
 phasize the high character of the par-
 ticipants and the time given to labor's
 involvement, and sense of responsibility
 to the textile industry-the problems of
 which are a standing concern of this
 Senate.
 Mr. President, I conclude by saying
 that while this is sharp language and
 very emphatic language, I agree with the
 tone and the essence and the content of
 that release.  I hope that those who
 represent sections of the country which
 do not have the economic problem that
 we have experienced in Rhode Island
 would read and reread and give some
 heed to the statement made by Mr.
 Baldanzi.
 In States like mine where vital textile
 mills have been closed and thousands of
 textile workers have been put out of their
 jobs-even when other American indus-
 try was enjoying a boom-this matter of
 textile imports and foreign textile com-
 petition, in general, pose a threat to peace
 of mind, certainty of a job and security
 of the home-let alone the security of a
 natioxi to which textiles is second only to
 PORT FOR U.S. COMMITMENT IN
 VIETNAM
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the critics
 of our commitment in Vietnam have
 sought to convey the impression that
 little support exists for this commitment
 elsewhere in the world.
 That this is clearly untrue has been
 made evident many times.  In fact, it
 often seems that foreign observers view
 events in Vietnam with more real under-
 standing of the stakes in that conflict
 than do many American critics.
 In a recent editorial, entitled "This Is
 the Third World War," a leading English
 magazine, the Economist, describes the
 reason for standing firm in Vietnam and
 making it clear, at this time and place,
 that aggression will not be permitted to
 succeed:
 China has nominated Vietnam as a test-
 case for what it claims to be a new kind of
 war.  It is a land war, fought by relatively
 small formations of very brave men who are
 prepared to persist for years with the tactics
 of ambush and terrorism until the other
 side's nerve cracks.  Those who believe that
 this technique of "people's war" should be
 opposed, because its aim is to set up an ac-
 ceptable form of society, have little choice
 but to fight it on its own terms: that is, by
 a land war.
 The Economist points out that it is not
 "the right war, in the right place," and
 notes that "Defensive wars seldom are."
 If Vietnam were to fall to the Commu-
 nists, this would simply initiate similar
 attempts at power throughout Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America. To critics of
 the American commitment, the Econ-
 omist poses this question:
 The deal the Americans cannot reasonably
 be asked to strike is one that threatens to sell
 the pass to the whole southern Asia.  This Is
 Mr. Johnson's enormous problem.  It is also
 the problem of those who criticize his deci-
 sion to take America into the war.                                                                                                                                                Those of
 them-an  increasing      number-who  agree
 that America has a responsibility towards the
 non-Communist  nations  of  Asia    cannot
 dodge the question it poses. How else can
 you suggest holding the line, if not by fight-
 ing in Vietnam?
 I wish to share this important article
 with all Senators, and therefore ask
 unanimous consent that it be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows :
 THIS IS THE THIRD WORLD WAR
 There is no Mao but Mao, and Lin Piao is
 his prophet.
 That is what the past week's events in
 Peking (see page 719)  boil down to.  The
 communique from the Chinese communists'
 central committee at the weekend, followed
 by the ominously martial rally in Peking on
 Thursday, with a uniformed Mao Tse-tung
 presenting his "close friend in combat" Lin
 Plao to the people, mark out unmistakably
 the path Mao means China to follow.  It was
 predictable that the central committee, in
 the sort of words Stalin once made Russians
 use about him, would duly declare Mao Tse-
 tung a genius, "the greatest marxist-leninist
 of our era."  After the Mao-organised purges
 of the last four months, and his baptism
 in the Yangtse last month, this was inevi-
 table.   Like all  monopolists  of  temporal
 power, from the Roman emperors to Stalin,
 Mao is spending his last years in arranging
 to become a god.
 What was not Inevitable is the emergence
 of Marshal Lin Piao as China's number two,
 and the meaning this has for China's foreign
 policy.  The only other Chinese mentioned
 by name among the encomiums to Mao in the
 central    committee's    communique-and
 twice at that-is Lin Piao.  At Thursday's
 rally in Peking it was Lin Piao who took
 precedence immediately after Mao himself,
 before the country's president and prime
 minister and the communist party's secre-
 tary-general.    It was Lin Piao who made
 the main speech under the approving gaze
 of Chairman Mao.  Sick man or not, palely
 self-effacing  or not, the defence minister
 has risen to the rank of Mao's chief assist-
 ant                                                                                                                                         and his  successor-apparent.   He  has
 done this partly because he can speak for
 the army, and partly because he has loyally
 used the army as a guinea-pig for the "cul-
 tural revolution" dose of salts with which
 Mao is now purging the whole country.    But
 Lin Plao has probably risen for another rea-
 son too, and this is bad news.
 A year ago Lin Piao wrote the famous ar-
 ticle, "On People's War," which said that
 China's  foreign  policy  was  to  encourage
 guerrilla wars In the "countryside of the
 world"-Asia, Africa and Latin America-in
 order to encircle and destroy the imperial-
 ists                                                                                                                                         In the  "cities       of  the world,"  north
 America  and     western  Europe.        The  year
 that has passed since Lin Piao wrote his
 article has been a bad one for China's for-
 eign policy, in Indonesia, in Africa and now
 even in North Korea       (see page 721). It
 would have been reasonable to expect China
 to whistle its revolutionary tune under its
 breath this year.  Not a bit of it.      The cen-
 tral committee has picked out the Lin Piao
 article for a pat on the back as a scientific

 analysis of "the world revolution of our
 time."  And Mao has picked out Lin Plao as
 his ' chief assistant.  The meaning is clear.
 Mao Tse-tung, now almost mystical in his
 certainty, is  not backing down  one  Inch
 from his hopes of ideological expansion.
 This is the most important fact about Asia
 today.  It is the background against which
 the debate on American policy in the Par
 East   has to be measured.  Whether the
 United States has a job to do in Asia is not,
 at bottom, something to be decided in Wash-
 ington.                      It has already been decided in Pe-
 king.                     The Americans were a Pacific power
 long before they became an Atlantic power.
 In Europe they have generally had a com-
 forting layer of friendly countries between
 them and their main potential enemy, Ger-
 many or Russia.  Across the Pacific, there
 is nothing but cold water.  That is why the
 Americans sent Commodore Perry to Japan
 a century ago, when all they were asking of
 Europe was to be left alone by it.  It is why
 they now have virtually no choice but to
 resist what China is trying to do.  No one
 else can.  It will take the other Asians at
 least a decade to summon up the strength
 to look after China themselves.     The Brit-
 ish are still snarled up in the non-sequitur
 of thinking that belonging to Europe means
 not belonging to the rest of the world.  The
 Russians took a long step in the right direc-
 tion at Tashkent this year, when they de-
 clared their interest in the stability of the
 Indian subcontinent; but they have still not
 been able to bring themselves to say out loud
 that China's idea of universal revolution is
 a hell of a way to run the world.  They prob-
 ably will in the end.  But meantime the
 Americans, and the Americans alone, are in
 a position to do something about the prob-
 lemman of the 1960s;     Mao the evangelist,
 with his hot gospel of guerrilla liberation
 tucked under his arm.
 None of this is really in dispute.  Mr. Wal-
 ter Lippmann, the most persistent and intel-
 ligent of President Johnson's critics, agrees
 that it is right for the United States to use
 its strength to establish a balance of power
 against the Chinese.  The argument is about
 how much strength will be needed, and where
 it can best be applied.
 It can be argued that in the end the whole
 business of restraining China's missionary
 zeal may turn out to be much easier than it
 looks right now.  China is a very poor coun-
 try indeed.  An article on page 720 argues
 that its chances of ever becoming a rich one,
 or even of building up a modestly successful
 industry, are much dimmer than most peo-
 ple have usually assumed.  If China does re-
 main a poor country, its hope of inspiring
 revolutions all around the world will be ra-
 tioned by the amount of help it can actually
 send to would-be revolutionaries.  And that,
 to be fair to Mao, is all he aims to do.  He is
 not an expansionist In the sense of wanting
 to push China's own territory beyond what
 he considers its historic boundaries.  He just
 wants to spread the good word-but "out of
 the barrel of a gun."  Ten years hence, if
 China is still too poor to export many guns
 and  many missionaries,  Lin  Piao's   thesis
 about "the revolution of our time" could look
 as punctured as President Nasser's grandiose
 aims of the 1950s look now.  This Is the op-
 timistic way of looking at things.  There is
 nothing wrong with hoping that the worst
 will not happen.  But it is not a basis for
 policy.  You look so stupid if the worst does
 come.    Until and unless there is solid evi-
 dence that China does not intend to do what
 Lin Piao says it wants to do, or cannot do it,
 the only safe assumption for the Americans
 or anybody else to make is that the Chinese
 mean every word they say.  That is where
 any sober Asia-policy starts from.
 That is where It starts from. Did it really
 have to lead to what is happening in Viet-
 nam?  Mr Johnson's critics say that it need
 not have done. But lately it has looked very
 much as if some of the steam has been going
 out of the critics' arguments.  This is not
 because they like this singularly beastly war
 any better than they used to.   Nobody does.
 It is because, if one leaves aside the Marxists
 and the honourable pacifists, a good many
 of the critics are finding it increasingly hard
 to disagree with the basic premise of Mr
 Johnson's policy-that it is at present Amer-
 ica's job to try to keep China's evangelism
 under control.  Having accepted that, they
 then find it increasingly hard to suggest any
 positive alternative to doing it in Vietnam.
 And every time Mao Tse-tung does some-
 thing that seems to justify everybody's worst
 fears, the critics' job gets that much tougher.
 Senator Fulbright, for instance, has not
 taken direct issue with the policy for Asia
 that President Johnson spelled out at White
 Sulphur Springs on July 12th.  He preferred
 to argue that the President ought to have
 consulted Congress first.  It is an argument
 that would have carried more weight if Mr
 Truman had consulted Congress before de-
 ciding that the Americans must take over
 the job of defending Greece and Turkey- .
 the "Truman doctrine'=in 1947.  Mr Lipp-
 mann, for his part, has walked into a couple
 of traps.  He tried to argue on July 26th
 that there Is no  connection between the
 guerrilla war in Vietnam ("one small corner
 of the world")  and other possible guerrilla
 wars that might follow it elsewhere.  But
 Marshal Lin Piao saw the connection all
 right for China's purposes in the article on
 "people's war" that the Peking central com-
 mittee has just commended:
 The people in other parts of the world
 will see     . that what the Vietnamese peo-
 ple can do, they can do too.
 That was one trap, and Mr Lippmann
 dropped into it.  The other is bigger and
 deeper, and goes right down to the funda-
 mental question about the whole war: how
 can you defend the non-communist parts
 of Asia unless you are ready to fight a war
 In Asia?  Mr Lippmann says, quite rightly,
 that with the single exception of Korea in
 1950 the United States has always avoided
 land wars in Asia like the plague.  So he
 argues that the Americans should discharge
 their responsibility to the Asians by means
 of sea and air power alone-which means,
 in effect, by air power deployed from air-
 craft carriers and from islands off the Asian
 mainland.  But Mr Lippmann himself has
 scathingly pointed out how limited the uses
 of air power have been in Vietnam.  If air
 power has not yet succeeded in tipping the
 scales in a war to which the Americans have
 committed 300,000 troops, how on earth can
 it protect non-communist Asia all by itself?
 The blunt truth is that this Is now an
 academic argument.  China has nominated
 Vietnam as a test-case for what it claims to
 be a new kind of war.  It Is a land war,
 fought by relatively small formations of very
 brave men who are prepared to persist for
 years with the tactics of ambush and terror-
 ism  until  the  other side's  nerve  cracks.
 Those who believe that this technique of
 "people's war" should be opposed, because
 its aim is to set up an unacceptable form
 of society, have little choice but to fight it
 on its own terms; that is, by a land war. It
 is not the "right war in the right place."
 Defensive wars seldom are.  It is not the
 sort of war that the Americans will be able
 to bring themselves to fight time and time
 again in other parts of the world.  But if it
 comes out right In Vietnam, it will with luck
 not have to be fought all over again else-
 where.  If the dissident minority in South
 Vietnam fails to take power by force of arms,
 dissident minorities in other places will think
 twice before they believe Lin Piao's tip that
 they are on to a winner.
 But If the technique of "people's war" does
 succeed in Vietnam, the past week's events
 in Peking will take on a new light.  Those
 who do not like the war in Vietnam, but
 21435
 equally do not want to see Mao Tse-tung's
 beliefs sweeping across Asia in a wave of
 guerrilla wars, have a duty to ask themselves
 where else they think the wave can be stop-
 ped.  Thailand?  But the non-Communist
 Thais are not going to call for help from a
 defeated-American army, and in any case it
 is logistically much harder to get help into
 Thailand than into Vietnam,  Burma?  Not
 on the cards.  India, then?  But the mind
 swerves away from the difficulty of doing any-
 thing to help that fragile country if the guer-

 Kerala or wherever.
 The fighting in Vietnam, it is said, could
 grow into the third world war.  In a sense, it
 already is the third world war. It is not by
 the Americans' choice that this has become
 a testing-ground for the theories of Mao Tse-
 tung and Lin Piao.  It need not have been.
 If there were any reasonable grounds for
 thinking that a communist victory in Viet-
 nam would not be followed by communist
 bids for power in the rest of Asia-starting
 in Thailand, and moving from there towards
 India-it would not be necessary to make a
 stand in Vietnam.  It would not be necessary
 if Lin Piao had not written what he has
 written, and had not now been given Mao's
 accolade for writing it.   It would not be
 necessary if Russia were able to assert its
 authority over the communists of south-
 east Asia and guarantee that a stable truce
 line, like the line between the two parts of
 Germany, could be drawn along the Mekong
 between a communist Indochina and a non-
 communist Thailand.   If either of  those
 things applied, a. deal could be done in Viet-
 nam tomorrow.  The only losers would be
 those  South Vietnamese,  Buddhists and
 Catholics alike, who keep on telling anyone
 who will listen that they do not want to be
 ruled by communists.  It would be a cynical
 deal; but it could be struck,
 The deal the Americans cannot reasonably
 be asked to strike is one that threatens to
 sell the pass to the whole of southern Asia.
 This is Mr. Johnson's enormous problem.
 It is also the problem of those who criticise
 his decision to take America into the war.
 Those of them-an increasing number-who
 agree that America has a responsibility to-
 wards the non-communist nations of Asia
 cannot dodge the question it poses,  How
 else can you suggest holding the line, if not
 by fighting in Vietnam?
 THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. MARCOS,
 OF THE PHILIPPINES, WILL VISIT
 THE UNITED STATES
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr, President,
 President and Mrs. Ferdinand Marcos;
 of the Philippines, are to pay this Nation
 a state visit this week. Our two coun-
 tries have traditionally close ties, dating
 back to 1895, and the Philippines in 1946
 was the first Asian country granted its
 political independence by a large power.
 Americans vividly recall the role played
 by the people of the Philippines in World
 War II.  President Marcos, the sixth
 popularly elected Chief Executive of his
 Country, is  known  as  the  most-
 decorated Philippine soldier in that con-
 flict.
 President Marcos received 27 decora-
 tions for his heroism.                                                                                                                                 A survivor of the
 Bataan death march, he joined the U.S.
 Army as a lieutenant. He was wounded
 five times, captured by the enemy and es-
 caped to return to battle.  His decora-
 tions include the T..S. Silver Star and the
 Distinguished Service Cross, and he at-
 tained the rank of a full colonel.
 President Marcos is a man not only of
 physical bravery, but of outstanding in-

 of the Philippine Congress and in numer-

 The visit to this Nation comes almost
 11 months after President Marcos was

 600,000-vote majority over his opponent.
 Both he and his lovely wife are active in

 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 -IMEI.DA MARCOS: THE FIRST LADY OF ASIA-
 THIS  BEAUTY  AND HER HUSBAND,  PRESI-
 DENT  OF THE  PHILIPPINES,  WILL  PAY  US
 A STATE VISIT
 (By Vera Glaser)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-Imelda Romualdez
 Marcos, the brunette wife of the president of
 the Philippines, who is about to visit the
 U.S. comes on strong.  Besides magnificent
 honey-colored skin, eyes of fiery topaz and
 the figure of a beauty queen, she has brains
 and energy to boot.
 When President and Mrs. Johnson get their
 first look at "Meldy," as 32 million adoring
 Filipinos call her, they will discover why she
 is regarded in some quarters as the First Lady
 of.Asia.  Her style, cultural flair and interest
 in much needed welfare projects, set against
 the backdrop of the young democracy her
 husband leads, have earned her comparison
 with Jacqueline Kennedy and Eleanor Roose-
 velt.
 "It's a privilege to be associated with them,"
 Mrs. Marcos said in rippling silk accents-her
 folk singing on the campaign trail helped
 elect her husband-"but I would rather be
 myself."
 At $6 Mrs. Marcos, mother of three Is the
 glamorous teammate of 49-year-old Ferdi-
 nand E. Marcos, World War II hero and po-
 litical wonder boy, who was elected the Phil-
 ippines' sixth president last November, oust-
 ing incumbent Diosdado Macapagal.  Over-
 coming her early distaste for politics, she
 barnstormed for her husband by plane, car,
 jeep and outrigger canoe.
 "He's hired a movie star," a political foe
 charged after Mrs. Marcos had enchanted
 voters by singing in Ilocano, the tongue of
 her husband's province in northern Luzon,
 and in her own Visayan dialect.  In pointed
 heels and bright Philippine terno, the tradi-
 tional  floor-length  dress  with  butterfly
 sleeves, she hiked back the rutted road to
 prove she was really the candidate's wife.
 Now she is official hostess at Malacafiang,
 the rambling white presidential palace set
 among acacias and circled by a wrought-iron
 fence,  in  teeming,  humid  Manila.  The
 Palace was formerly the residence of Spanish
 and U.S. governors.   Choosing their private
 apartment there was a problem, Mrs. Marcos
 recalled humorously, 'because in one wing
 of the Palace all the presidents died, and in
 the other all the presidents lost."
 Finally they settled on a four-bedroom
 suite.  There, in endless, animated private
 talks, they mull over plans for their current
 effort to renew Filipino pride in a national
 heritage tracing back to 3000 B.C.
 "You're In charge of culture and welfare,"
 the president told his wife at his inaugural,
 an event attended by Vice President and
 Mrs. Hubert H. Humphrey.
 Ina nation still battling poverty and cor-
 ruption, the assignment might seem stag-
 gering to anyone but "Meldy," who in less
 than a year has lanuched a flurry of projects
 which have captured the popular imagina-
 tion, inspiring the "haves" to dig deep into
 their pockets for her causes.
 Her kickoff for a 35-million-peso cultural
 center raised the first million in a single
 night.  She managed the feat, by gathering
 political and social leadera"together for a gala
 benefit of Flower Drum Song with an all-
 Filipino cast.  The remainder of the money
 was collected from private sources in four
 months, and construction on the combina-
 tion theater, library, and museum is sche-
 duled to begin shortly.
 Now Mrs. Marcos is boosting a national
 market for Philippine art and handicrafts.
 In addition, she is up to her eyelashes in
 promoting  tourism,  selling  beautification
 and coordinating a cradle-to-grave welfare
 program for which private and government
 agencies equally share the costs.  Children,
 juvenile delinquents, unwed mothers, pri-
 soners, the mentally retarded and the aged,
 all are due to benefit.
 "When you are First Lady, you can work
 yourself to death, or you can sleep," con-
 tends Mrs. Marcos. "When I lie down even
 for a minute, I tell myself I could be help-
 ing a hundred, perhaps a thousand people,
 In that time."
 A BEATLE  BOO-BOO
 Filipinos  respond  with a fierce loyalty.
 In July the Beatles, given the, red carpet
 treatment on their arrival in Manila, were
 lucky to get away alive after affronting the
 First Lady by failing to keep a Palace
 luncheon date.  Shouts of "Scram!", "Get
 out of our country!" and a score of unprint-
 able curses were hurled by the angry crowd.
 The  mop-haired troupe  was  pushed  and
 shoved, and one of their party was kicked
 to the ground.  Police protection and other
 courtesies were withdrawn.
 Mrs.   Marcos's warmth  and   charm  are
 lavished on friend and critic alike. When
 the Philippine congress voted to send troops
 to fight beside the U.S. In South Vietnam,
 pro-Communist demonstrators picketed the
 Palace.  President Marcos called in the lead-
 ers, but his wife ventured outside to wave
 and smile to the pickets.  Applauding, they
 departed quickly.
 Public life is not new to this First Lady.
 She Is a member of the Romual.dez family
 of Leyte, a powerful political clan which has
 produced senators, congressmen, ambassa-
 dors. a Supreme Court justice, governors and
 bank presidents.  Her father was Dean of
 Law at St. Paul's College, where she earned
 a bachelor's degree in. education and later
 won a music scholarship and worked at teach-
 ing and writing.  Her younger brother, Ben-
 jamin, is the newly named ambassador to the
 U.S.
 "MISS  LEYTE"
 Imelda grew up in Manila.  She was sent
 there to study after her mother's death.  She
 was then 8 years old, and she lived with her
 uncle, the Speaker of the Philippine House,
 who served as her guardian.  At 18, her good
 looks, lyric soprano voice and 36-23-35 meas-
 urement,,s won her the title of "Miss Leyte."
 At 24, her whirlwind romance with Marcos
 was a national sensation.
 The love story began when Imelda and her
 aunt visited the capitol during a late session.
 Marcos,  a  young  congressman  who  had
 emerged from the war with nearly every dec-
 oration bestowed by the Philippine and U.S.
 governments,  was in the thick  of battle
 again--this time fighting the administration
 on its budget.
 Although 13 years Imelda's senior and con-
 sidered                                                                                             Manila's  most  eligible  'bachelor,
 Marcos succumbed after one look and sought
 an introduction.  But "Melly" refused to give
 him  her  telephone number.         Undaunted,
 Marcos pursued her to Baguio, the summer
 capital,  where   the  courtship   flourished.
 Eleven days after their first meeting, they
 were married in a civil ceremony.  To the
 bridegroom's surprise, Mrs. Marcos refused
 to enter the hotel suite he had reserved, until
 a church wedding could be arranged 10 days
 later.
 To this day the presidential pair believe 11
 is their lucky number.  As Mrs. Marcos ex-
 plains it, "My husband was born September
 11.  We were married after 11 days of court-
 ship.  We had our first child, Maria Imelda,
 about 11 months afterward. We were sure we
 were going to win this election because this
 Is the 11th year of our marriage."
 Most evenings the president takes time to
 help his children, Maria Imelda, 11, Ferdi-
 nand Jr., 7, and Irene, 6, with their studies
 in Tagalog, the official Philippine language,
 as well as English and Spanish.
 Then, at the end of each day, Mr. and Mrs.
 Marcos enjoy comparing notes.
 Besides Philippine styles, she wears slacks,
 Paris frocks, Italian knits and American suits
 but seldom dons her fabulous jewels.  The
 president describes his wife, who dances the
 frug and jerk, as "irrepressible."  She de-
 scribes their marriage as "out of this world."
 "Whatever I am, I am Ferdinand's crea-
 tion," the First Lady claims.  "He has helped
 me to grow with him, not side by side, but a
 little behind him."

 MARVIN GLEN SHIELDS
 Mr. JACKSON.   Mr. President, I was
 proud and honored to be present at the
 White House today as the widow of Navy
 Seabee Marvin Glen Sheilds, of my State
 of Washington, received the Congres-
 sional Medal of Honor in his behalf post-
 humously. Mr. Shields, a native of Port
 Townsend, Wash., is the first member of
 the Seabees to receive the Medal of
 Honor.  This heroic young man, who
 died in the service of his country, re-
 ceives this highest of awards on the eve
 of the 25th anniversary of the Navy
 Seabees. A construction mechanic, third
 class, his honor is a tribute to the more
 than 300,000 Americans who have served
 in the Seabees since Its inception In 1942.
 I wish to point out also that Marvin
 Glen Shields is the first Navy man to
 receive this award in the Vietnam war.
 Four Army men have won the Medal of
 Honor In Vietnam. Significantly, Army
 Special Forces 1st Lt. Charles Williams
 won a Congressional Medal of Honor in
 the same action at Dong Xoai in South
 Vietnam on June 10, 1965, that took the
 life of Marvin Shields and posthumously
 won for him the Medal of Honor.
 Lieutenant Williams, who was present
 at the presentation of the Medal of
 Honor to Mrs. Shields at the White
 House today, asked for a volunteer to
 accompany him in an attempt to knock
 out an enemy machinegun emplacement
 which was endangering the lives of a
 beseiged special forces, Seabee, and Viet-
 namese camp at Dong Xoai.  Williams
 and Shields, in a heroic effort, were suc-
 cessful in silencing this Vietcong weapon,
 and Shields, whose mission at this camr
 was in construction, lost his life.
 I am also proud of the 8 other Seabees
 who fought with the 11 special forces
 men in that incident at Dong Xoat.  Oi
 these nine Seabees, eight won Purple
 Heart medals. All nine won awards foi

 Mr CRALEY. Mr. Speaker, on Sun-
 (Mr. HANNA (at the request of Mr.
 MATSUNAGA) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this paint in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. HANNA.  Mr. Speaker, today I
 have introduced legislation which would
 provide for the participation, of the De-
 partment of the Interior in the construc-
 tion and operation of a large prototype
 desalting plant off the Orange County
 coast in southern California.
 This project will be constructed on
 an artificial offshore island. It will uti-
 lize two nuclear reactors with an elec-
 trical capacity of about 1,800 megawatts
 and a sea water desalting plant which
 will produce 150 million gallons daily
 of distilled water-enough to supply a
 city the size of San Francisco.
 The total capital cost of the dual
 power  producing  and  desalinization
 project will be $400 million of which the
 Department of the Interior is being
 asked to participate in the amount of
 $57.2 million.
 A very detailed study of this proposal
 has been conducted by an independent
 engineering firm, and it shows the proj-
 ect will have a very high level of return
 in, comparison with the initial expendi-
 ture.  It shows that large scale desalt-
 ing is economically feasible, and that
 the excess power produced by the reac-
 tors can be used to help fulfill our ever-
 growing need for electrical power.
 The project has the support, both in
 terms of capital and cooperation, of two
 of the Nation's leading private power
 companies-Southern California Edison
 Co. and the San Diego Gas & Electric
 Co. -These  companies  have  further
 agreed to purchase all the excess power
 produced.

 AFTER THE ELECTION
 The natural sequel to the successful elec-
 tion in South Vietnam on Sunday is to try
 to calculate what effect it may have on the
 efforts to bring about negotiations and an
 ultimate truce or peace.
 Logically,  the  results  should  convince
 Hanoi that the Saigon Government now has
 an enhanced and legitimate status of its own
 as a national entity.  Whatever government
 finally comes out of the long process of con-
 stitution making, congressional or legisla-
 tive assembly meeting, will not change the
 general picture insofar as the prosecution of
 the war is concerned.  If there is to be a
 change it has to be on the North Vietnamese
 side and this is not going to be an overnight
 development.
 But the election may lead in time toward
 a better balance of the forces within the two
 Vietnams.  Marshal Ky was understandably
 elated by the results, but he was much too
 optimistic in saying, as he did yesterday,
 that "we now have the conditions for final

 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. HALPERN] is
 recognized for 15 minutes.
 Mr. HALPERN.  Mr. Speaker, the war
 in Vietnam continues to arouse the grav-
 est  anxiety among people here and
 abroad who are earnestly concerned with
 building peace and order in the world.
 The President has repeatedly stressed
 that our objectives in southeast Asia are
 limited. The assistance we are rendering
 does not give us license to dictate the po-
 litical destiny of the South Vietnamese.
 This is a point which must be reem-
 phasized, and which must be made credi-
 ble to the Asian peoples. The President
 has reaffirmed that American forces are
 in Vietnam to help the Vietnamese de-
 feat aggression and defend self-deter-
 mination. This can only be interpreted
 as a carefully prescribed engagement.
 As a foreign power on the Asian Conti-
 nent, we should resist the tendency to
 ,escalate both the commitment and the
 means of military self-defense.
 Several weeks ago, Premier Ky was
 quoted as welcoming an invasion of
 North Vietnam and an eventual con-
 frontation with Red China.  Although
 this statement has been subsequently
 modified, militarists may be setting their
 sights far beyond the expressed aims of
 our own Government, whose interest lies
 in insuring that the South Vietnamese
 people can freely choose their political
 and social course. There can be no am-
 biguity on this point; we must consist-
 ently disavow professed ambitions which
 outrun the American purpose in Viet-
 nam.
 Those who understand the limited na-
 ture of our stand in Vietnam must not be
 tempted into arguing blithely for some
 wider war which, supposedly, can more
 speedily produce what is described as
 "victory."
 The world must know that American
 policy, despite the deployment of over
 300,000 men, aims at a peaceful solution
 of this conflict.
 It is doubtful as to whether the bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam, and the contin-
 uing increase of American manpower,
 can alone bring about the conditions
 conducive to negotiation.  Indeed, the
 truth may be that escalation breeds
 counter escalation, and that a broader
 military employment strengthens the
 resolve of the North Vietnamese.  Be-
 cause these questions, in terms of the
 future, cannot be answered with surety,
 the United States must redouble its ef-
 forts, through all available channels, to
 find the path to peace.
 One recent, welcome development was

 valor in the performance of a daring
 exploit on the lower Delaware in 1777.
 With four small boats he had cut out an
 armed British schooner without the loss
 of a man, and captured at the same time
 a -.Umber of transports and a large quan-
 i:ty                of supplies destined for British
 t pops.
 Barry then volunteered for duty with
 the American Army and participated
 with distinction in the Trenton cam-
 paign.  He was then given command of
 the Raleigh, 32 guns, with which he
 fought a gallant and obstinate battle
 against superior forces, finally being
 obliged to beach his ship, but saving
 most of his men from capture.
 His most successful cruise started in
 February of 1781 when he sailed from
 Boston for France  commanding the
 Alliance.  He captured the privateer
 Alert en route. He put down a mutiny,
 and then captured the privateers Mars
 and Minerva. After a fierce engagement
 he forced two British brigs, the Atlanta
 and the Trepassey to strike their colors.
 Barry was severely wounded in the
 action.
 To Barry belongs the distinction of
 having fought the last naval action of
 the War for Independence.  Aboard the
 Alliance he arrived at Martinique early
 in January of 1783 and found orders to
 proceed to Havana.  Leaving that port
 he encountered the Sybille.  His first
 mate, John Kessler, wrote as follows
 about the engagement:
 Two of the enemy's ships kept at a dis-
 tance on our weather quarter as if waiting
 to ascertain about the French ship, while
 the  other was in our wake with topsails
 only and courses hauled, as was also the
 case with the Alliance.   The French ship
 approaching fast, Captain Barry went from
 gun to gun on the main deck, cautioning
 against too much haste and not to fire until
 the enemy was right abreast.  He ordered
 the main topsail hove to the mast that the
 enemy (who had already fired a bow gun,
 the shot of which struck into the cabin of
 the Alliance) might come up as soon as he
 was abreast, when the action began, and
 before an half hour her guns were silenced
 and nothing but musketry was fired from
 her.  She appeared very much injured in
 her hull.  She was of thirty-two guns and
 appeared   very full of men,  and  after  an
 action of forty-five minutes she sheered off.
 Our injured were, I think, three killed and
 eleven wounded (three of whom died of
 their wounds) and one sail and rigging cut.
 During all the action the French lay to as
 well as the enemy's ships.
 As soon as the ship which we had engaged
 hove from us, her consorts joined her and
 all made sail, after which the French ship
 came down to us, and Captain Barry asked
 them why they did not come down during
 the   action.   They   answered   that  they
 thought we might have been taken and the
 signal known and the action only a sham
 to decoy him.   Their foolish idea thus per-
 haps lost us the three frigates, for Captain
 Barry's commencing the action was with the
 full expectation of the French ship joining
 and thereby not only be able to cope, but
 in fact subdue part, if not the whole, of
 them.  The French captain proposed, how-
 ever, giving chase, which was done: but it
 soon appeared that his ship would not keep
 up with us, and the chase was given over.
 Years later, in 1794, when the Con-
 gress of the United States ordered the
 construction of six frigates to combat
 the depredations of the Algerian pirates,
 Barry was named senior captain and
 placed in command of the United States,
 being, as was said:
 Of all the naval captains that remained.. .
 the one who possessed the greatest reputa-
 tion for experience, conduct, and skill,
 During the hostilities with France,
 Barry was placed in command of all the
 naval forces in West Indian waters, re-
 maining there until the beginning of
 May 1799. In December of that year he
 escorted the American envoys to France.
 On his return he took command of the
 Guadaloupe station in the West Indies,
 a position he retained until 1801.  He
 died 2 years later at the head of the U.S.
 Navy.

 More Harm Than Help
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GERALD R. FORD
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 13, 1966
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  Mr. Speaker,
 although the House has rejected Mr.
 PATMAN'S  proposal for controlling the
 interest rates, I believe the editorial in
 the Detroit News for September 1, 1966,
 entitled "More Harm Than Help," is of
 special significance.
 Under leave to extend my remarks I
 include this editorial:
 PATMAN'S PLAN To CUT INTEREST RATES:
 MORE HARM THAN HELP
 The furor over high interest rates is reach-
 ing a fever pitch.  Rep. PATMAN, Texas Dem-
 ocrat, self-styled friend of the "little man"
 and arch-foe of the "bankers," has proposed
 a bill cutting the interest rate banks pay on
 certain time deposits.  The proposal is more
 senile than sensible.
 PATMAN  wants to impose a 41/2  percent
 interest rate ceiling on certificates of de-
 posit.  These CDs, now paying a maximum
 51/2 percent, are special time deposits which,
 it is claimed, have attracted funds from sav-
 ings  and                                                                           loan  associations  paying lower
 interest rates.
 As a device to cut interest rates, the bill is
 clearly  nonsensical.  It  would make bank
 credit more difficult to obtain than it is now,
 and the cost of borrowing would rise still
 more.    Bank lending capacity depends on
 the volume of deposits.  If new deposits are
 obtained, more loans can be made.  But if
 banks lose deposits because they cannot pay
 a competitive return, bank lending quickly
 dries up.
 PATMAN  deludes himself and  others by
 arguing that the interest rate rollback would
 return funds to the savings and loan associa-
 tions, relieving tht ultra-tight market for
 home mortgages.  The general level of inter-
 est rates is now so high that neither the 4
 percent paid by federal savings and loan
 associations nor the proposed 41/2  percent
 offered by banks would be able to attract
 funds.  Instead,  savings would move into
 into bonds and other financial paper which
 continue to pay higher and more competitive
 rates.
 While PATMAN'S bill would do nothing to
 help the savings institutions, it might have
 an unfavorable effect on banks.  Forced to
 pay below-market rates, the banks could ex-
 perience a rapid exodus of funds and find
 themselves in a squeeze.  The monetary au-
 thorities would have  little  choice but to
 rescue them by easing the supply of money.
 And in turn, this would refuel whatever in-
 flationary fires tight money has been able to
 extinguish.
 If PATMAN, or any of his supporters, wants
 lower interest rates to help the "little man,"
 there is only one way to get them.  Take
 enough excess demand out of the economy
 so that tight monetary policy is no longer the
 sole policy bulwark against inflation. This
 can be done only if Congress cuts spending
 or increases taxes.
 Since  the  "little man"  must pay taxes
 along with everyone else, his congressional
 friends might show their affection by putting
 a c iling on government spending instead of
 puluing fruitless battles with the bankers.

 Writes Firsthand Report on Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 13, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, I am
 a firm supporter of the view that there
 is no adequate substitute for actual ex-
 perience.  Our late President, John F.
 Kennedy, must have had this in mind
 when he asked his military commanders
 to parade before him a division of men-
 just so that he could see for himself the
 size of a division.
 Unfortunately, time and circumstance
 do not always permit us the benefit of
 real experience, so we must rely on sec-
 ondary sources of information to bring
 us as close as possible to actual experi-
 ence.  I should therefore like to share
 with my colleagues a recent newspaper
 article which, in its sweeping coverage of
 the Vietnam war, could readily serve as
 a vicarious substitute for those of us
 who are unable to make an actual study
 of the situation in that country.
 Written by Associate Editor John Grif-
 fin of the Honolulu Advertiser, the front
 page article is a "must" for those who
 wish to know what is going on in Viet-
 nam.  Of particular interest, in the light
 of announced troop increases, is Editor
 Griffin's comprehensive account of troop
 commitments in the various parts of
 Vietnam. His discussion of the military
 zones-the four corps areas-provides
 the reader a clear and up-to-date pic-
 ture of the war in Vietnam.
 I am pleased to submit the Honolulu
 Advertiser August 24 article for inclu-
 sion in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:

 labor market which is constantly upgrading
 its educational and technical requirements,
 spells a serious dilemma indeed.
 Problems of urbanization
 Other "costs" of population growth are

 tional facilities, congested traffic conditions,
 air and water pollution, the deleterious ef-
 fects of increased internal migration on in-
 tergroup relationships-just to  list a few
 To ignore the problems of our cities, or to
 close our eyes to such isues as chronic un-
 employment 'or rising welfare costs, could
 well be the road to economic suicide.  As
 businessmen, we must participate actively
 in constructive programs on all such fronts.
 This participation will prove to be helpful
 only if we approach these problems armed
 with the facts.  That's why the proposed
 research in depth on population problems by
 the National Industrial  Conference Board
 appeals to me so strongly.
 Rapid population growth not necessary to
 economic health
 One point should be heavily emphasized.
 A rapidly growing population is not a neces-
 sary precondition for the continued develop-
 ment of our economy. A declining birth rate
 need not have an adverse effect on busi-
 ness.  Although the traditional assumption
 in this country has been that a rapidly grow-
 ing population leads to increased demand
 and, hence, stimulates. investment, a careful
 analysis of the world situation, as set forth
 above, shows that rapid population growth
 may and frequently has operated to inhibit
 economic development.
 If It is surmised that there will be devel-
 oped a twenty per cent increase in purchas-
 ing power during the next five or ten years
 (certainly not an outrageous assumption),
 the effect on the growth of the economy
 wot{ld offset a considerable decrease in the
 rate of population growth.  To be sure, rapid
 population growth in our own economic his-
 tory and, In the history of the West in gen-
 eral seems to have stimulated economic de-
 velopment.  But in these instances, unlike
 the situation in many developing countries,
 the man-land ratio was low and a greater
 population was needed to achieve the eco-
 nomies of large-scale production.  Today,
 however, the situation is very different. We
 no longer live in a traditional frontier so-
 ciety. We are living, however, on an entirely
 new kind of frontier.
 The American business system will con-
 tinue, most assuredly, to be characterized
 and propelled by inventiveness, imagination
 and enlarged appetites and interests.  Man-
 kind has thousands of unmet needs and, in
 the future, we will learn to express and ful-
 fill needs of which we are at, present un-
 aware. Increasing productivity to meet such
 new and diversified needs Is the future to
 which we should look.  Our economy no
 longer requires  the  stimulation  of  rapid
 population growth to keep it healthy.
 V. THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN VALUES
 In closing, I respectfully submit that busi-
 ness should never become so involved with
 statistics as to lose sight of the importance
 and dignity of the individual.
 Whether we are talking about population
 problems here in the U.S., In the developing
 countries, or in the world at large, we must
 never forget that we cannot measure prog-
 ress simply by aggregate statistics reflecting
 per capita living standards.  We must also
 strive to see that each person is assured the
 Opportunity to possess the ingredients of a
 full and satisfactory life.  These include not
 merely the basic necessities such as food,
 housing, health, and education, but also the
 satisfaction of those political, cultural, and
 spiritual needs that are: fundamental to all
 men.  Only in this way can we meet the
 need and responsibility to supply moral lead-
 ership in a tormented world.
 If we truly accept this responsibility and
 sincerely  and  thoughtfully  become  con-
 cerned with the quality of life, we have no
 choice but to be also concerned with the
 quantity of life.  Since we are growing to
 believe In the right to the with dignity, per-
 haps we will eventually espouse a compara-
 ble belief in the right to be born with
 dignity.  It seems that we might well en-
 dorse the current proposal to add a fifth
 freedom-freedom of the right of everyone
 to make: intelligent choices as to parenthood
 and the birth of children.
 Whatever may prove to be the ultimate
 resolution of this essentially moral question,
 we In the business community must work
 together with government and private groups
 to forge a common point of reference in. this
 most sensitive area of human behavior.  We
 must find a high and feasible principle which
 can be embraced by all people regardless
 of economic or ethnic background and reli-
 gious belief.  In all probability we will not
 live to see this work fully completed, but we
 will know that it has been begun.
 Prayers in Public Schools
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. E. ROSS ADAIR
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 13, 1966
 Mr. ADAIR.  Mr. Speaker, much has
 been said about the proposal to amend
 the Constitution to permit prayers in. the
 public schools. In this connection, I
 think an article by Mr. Clifford B. Ward
 in the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel ex-
 presses the views of many people, and I
 include it herewith:
 (By Clifford B. Ward)
 Senator EvSSRETT DIRKSEN,  determined to
 get a Constitutional amendment to permit
 voluntary prayer in public schools, must feel
 that the ground is being cut out from under
 him by some strange people, namely clergy-
 men of the major faiths, who are opposing
 him.
 Yet the Senator, as a politician close to the
 people, feels rather strongly that most of the
 common people up and down the United
 States are in favor of his amendment.
 The odd thing about those who argue that
 prayer in schools, even voluntary prayer, will
 break down the wall between church and
 state, is that they do not contend there was
 even the slightest breaching of the wall dur-
 ing the 150 years in this country when such
 prayer was legal.  Nor do they contend,
 at least not yet, that it Is any breaching
 of  the church-state  wall,  for  a  chaplain
 to open each daily sessionof the Congress.
 One of the arguments used against volun-
 tary prayer in schools is that a very tiny
 minority  of  children of  atheistic  parents
 should not be embarrassed in school by an
 exercise in which they do not take part.
 If all rights come from God, is there a right
 not to worship God?   Not a right in my book,
 but a free will, if you wish.
 MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE
 Actually, and In spite of Supreme Court
 decisions, this is a country in which the
 majority of people believe in God and show
 that belief in almost everything they do.
 Few are those who are completely secular.
 They baptize.  They hold Bar Mitzvah.  They
 marry before ministers, priests and rabbis.
 Afl77 z
 And they insist upon religious services at
 their funerals.  Atheists are as uncommon
 as trees in a desert.
 The greatest religious influence in this
 country undoubtedly comes from within the
 family unit, which in turn draws its inspira-
 tion from the organized fonts of religion,
 which are churches, temples and synagogues.
 Yet the family can not do the job complete-
 ly when its sphere of influence is limited in
 a society such as ours, where all members
 of the family are for many hours of the
 day separated from each other.
 No child of course should be compelled by
 government to say a prayer.  But govern-
 ment should, under the First Amendment,
 provide the opportunity for a free exercise
 of religion without harassment.  Voluntary
 prayer in schools Is the provision of such
 an opportunity.
 DENIAL OF BAN SILLY
 There are those who say that the Supreme
 Court has not banned the Bible in public
 schools  This to my mind is a quibbling over
 words in a                               childish  manner.   The  Court
 has banned readings from the Bible in public
 schools in any manner that admits the na-
 ture of the Bible as a religious work.                                                                                                                                                                 It
 may be admired as a literary work Only.                              It
 may be admired as an example of the print-
 ing art, or the bookbinder's art.  But it may
 not be used in any way that would suggest
 that it is something inspired by God.
 It is difficult for most ordinary persons to
 follow the reasoning of, church leaders who
 suddenly see a danger in voluntary prayer
 that never existed for one hundred and fifty
 years.  Unless religion is to be department-
 alized to a point where it is only operative
 inside the walls of a home, then voluntary
 prayer in schools makes sense.

 flict that won us our national indepen-
 dence from British tyranny must never
 be forgotten. His valor and his victories
 must be acknowledged in the bicenten-
 nial observances that will take place in
 the future, and they must be recognized
 today on the anniversary of his death.
 He was born at Tacumshane, County
 Wexford, Ireland, went to sea as a boy,
 and about 1760 settled in Philadelphia.,
 where he eventually became a prosperous
 shipmaster and shipowner.  In 1776 he!
 showed an Irishman's enthusiasm for the
 cause of the Colonies against British op-
 pression and was placed in command of
 the brig Lexington by the Continental.
 Congress. On April 17, 1776, he captured
 the British tender Edward.  This was
 the first capture in actual battle of a
 British warship by a regularly commis-
 sioned American cruiser.

 ulations of General Washington for his

 quick trip to the, 25th Division's base camp
 at Cu Chi, some 20 miles away:-
 But it is possible to better see the rough
 outlines of a military war that cannot be
 envisioned in terms of traditional fronts.
 it is best viewed as a series of minor and
 major explosions 'across a countryside that
 ranges from swamp  to sand dunes,  flat
 flooded ricelands to grassy highlands or jun-
 gled mountains, from isolated hamlets with
 a dozen huts to busy cities.
 As countries go, South Viet Nam is a small
 one, about as long as California and half as
 wide.
 But it, makes a vast battlefield, with over
 1,200 miles of coastline to be patrolled and
 1,000 miles of often wild and ill-defined land
 border that is often used as both an entry
 and escape point by the enemy.
 That enemy-termed by a top U.S. com-
 mander as "the best guerrilla fighter the
 world has ever known"-is everywhere.
 Total enemy strength is now estimated at
 about 300,000 (compared to perhaps 15,000
 five years ago).  Some 50,000 are said to be
 North Vietnamese troops, infiltrated down to
 the South mostly over the past year.
 About 110,000 of the overall total are fight-
 ing              in regular        North' Vietnamese or Viet
 Cong "main force" regiments from the South.
 A number of North Vietnamese and Viet
 Cong regiments are being integrated.
 Fighting with and supporting these more
 traditional units are 120,000 or more guer-
 rillas who operate in their home areas, per-
 haps 8,000 combat troops and over 40,000
 political cadres or civilian leaders from North
 and South.   ?
 Against this tough and growing enemy
 army of 300,000 are close to a million military
 men on the South Vietnamese government
 side.
 Included are about 290,000 Americans (only
 about half combat troops, the rest clerks,
 drivers, mechanics, etc.), South Vietnamese
 army forces, a" variety of paramilitary re-
 gional and police forces, and relatively small
 but effective military units from South Ko-
 rea, Australia and New Zealand.
 There are many kinds of battles going on
 in South Viet Nam, but basically they break
 down to variations of two kinds of warfare:
 1) Small to medium scale guerrilla actions
 where enemy units attack patrols, outposts
 or towns, and 2) Limited regular war with
 major battles involving upwards to 15-20,000
 U.S. troops at a time.
 Indications are we are doing well in the
 second kind of fighting but still have a long
 way to go meeting the equal threat of the
 guerrilla.
 There are several ways to envision the
 sweep of the war.  Inevitably some parts get
 overlooked, like the contribution of the Navy
 and Coast Guard.  This would include 7th
 Fleet carrier operations, not just pilots but
 tens of thousands of men who serve yet
 never see Viet Nam, or the 12,000 men who
 patrol the coast in everything from seagoing
 artillery  for  troop support  to  lumbering
 junks to sleek new fiberglas scout craft and
 hovercraft that probe the rivers and by-ways
 of the Mekong Delta.
 ,PROFILE OF WAR
 One of the easier ways to review the war In
 the South is with the geography of the mili-
 tary war zones, the four corps areas.
 The accompanying map shows those zones;
 each tells something about the war.
 I Corps is the narrow portion of the coun-
 try right under the 17th parallel and the thin
 demilitarized zone that makes up the border
 with North Viet Nam.
 "Eye Corps," as it is called, is the preserve
 of the 76,000 U.S. Marine troops in Viet Nam.
 Headlines early this month told of grim
 fighting in Operation Hastings, a helicopter
 assault that put 8,000 Marines and , 3,000
 South Vietnamese troops into major battle
 with North Vietnamese units that had in-
 filtrated across the 17th parallel.  It was a
 tough, bloody victory.
 But Hastings was not typical of the war the
 Marines have fought.  Early last year they
 landed, and the struggle has been a slow,
 painful one to spread out from the populated
 coastal region back into the fertile valleys
 and rugged mountains that have been VC
 strongholds.
 Now it's conceded they haven't been able
 to link up enclaves at Da Nang and nearby
 Cu Lai and Phu Bai and properly pacify the
 area.  Estimates now are that 100,000? men
 are needed for that job.
 II Corps is the biggest of the four areas
 with the least number of people.
 For the past year, it has been considered
 the area of most immediate danger because
 it was felt enemy strategy was to drive a
 wedge from the central highlands to the
 coast, cutting the country in half.
 The central highlands have become the
 scene of the major battles, hundreds of heli-
 copters, thousands of men engaging North
 Vietnamese units in operations with names
 like  Hawthorne,  Paul  Revere  and  Crazy
 Horse.
 REALLY ZAPPED
 Some vital victories have been won, but
 they don't tell all the story, as perhaps is
 indicated by one incident in Saigon.
 I was having dinner with Washington Post
 correspondent Ward Just  (just back after
 being wounded in Hawthorne).  Two young
 soldiers crowded next to us in the restaurant
 listened for a while, then one said:
 .",You guys are correspondents, huh.  Well,
 why don't you tell the whole story.   You
 make everything sound like a big victory.
 Most of the time' we slog around looking.
 And we get the hell shot out of us some-
 times, really zapped ... 11
 Despite the important qualifications how-
 ever, the victories In II Corps have been the
 equivalent of a successful goal-line stand.
 Without them, the game would be all but
 over.
 Overshadowed by the inland fighting has
 been the major contribution of the Korean
 marines and army units along the II Corps
 coast at Qui Nhon and Tuy Hoa.
 III Corps makes up the area around Saigon,
 the stronghold of the government and of
 the Viet Cong.
 It is a mixture of most else in Viet Nam-
 mangrove swamps on the coast, flooded delta
 ricelands, crowded urban centers, hot, scrub-
 by plains, rubber plantations and jungle.
 Even from Saigon it takes little imagina-
 tion to envision the war:
 Over late evening drinks from the top floor
 bar of the Majestic Hotel you can look across
 the Saigon River and see planes dropping
 flares,  watch  tracers  flying  and hear  the
 sound of guns     . "We've been here five
 years, and we're still fighting on the out-
 skirts of Saigon," says an important U.S.
 military figure . . .
 Even the rumble of bombs from B-52s
 could be heard in the predawn Saigon dark-
 ness as the Guam-based planes blasted a
 Viet Cong forested hideout 20 miles from the
 city...
 There were no terrorist incidents while I
 was in Saigon.  But helmeted guards with
 guns at the ready in sandbagged positions
 outside every U.S. installation attest.to the
 fact it is only a matter of time     .
 Estimates are there are 20,000 Viet Cong
 agents   in Saigon,   but   nobody   really
 knows    . One of Premier Ky's ministers
 told a French correspondent that "40 per cent
 of my    staff  are  Viet  Cong  men    and
 women"     . It is that kind of a war.
 The big enemy forces, of course, ale far-
 ther out from the capital.                                                                           Australians have
 been fighting them in good-sized battles near
 the coast in recent days.
 A4779
 ROLE OT 25TH
 And the 25th Division from Hawaii is in
 a vital spot west of Saigon at Cu Chi, not far
 from where a tongue of land from Cambodia
 reaches down Into Viet Nam.
 There on a searing, dusty plain that is
 honeycombed with abandoned Viet Cong
 tunnels and emplacements, the division op-
 erates, surrounded by barbed wire, sending
 out patrols and bigger units into a country-
 side that for 20 years has been virtually
 governed by the enemy.
 Right next door is the infamous Ho Bo
 Woods, where reportedly the National Libera-
 tion Front  (the enemy political arm)  was
 formed in 1961.  It is still a Viet Cong strong-
 hold.
 The South Vietnamese army's 25th Divi-
 sion (still located nearby) was shattered and
 almost ineffective when the U.S. 25th ar-
 rived in January "not a moment too soon,"
 say military sources.
 Progress has been made and units from
 the 25th operate around the area.  But you
 find few illusions about the tough job that
 remains.
 The artillery in the camp still fires out 360
 degrees in troop support, and when I asked
 one officer what he thought the big accom-
 plishment had been in seven months, he
 said: "We haven't lost any ground."
 Considering the history of the area and its
 high significance as a threat to Saigon, it is
 an important statement.
 OUR FOURTH FRONT
 IV Corps is mostly the famous Mekong
 Delta, an almost endless expanse of steamy
 paddyland, swamp and mangrove, cut by a
 few canals, countless twisting streams and
 some major rivers.
 It holds over a third of the people in South
 Viet Nam-more than five million-and is
 perhaps the richest ricebowl in the world.
 It is also soon expected to become the
 "Fourth Front" of the war for U.S. forces.
 South Vietnamese forces, of course, operate
 in the other three corps areas, and in most
 still carry the brunt of the day-to-day war
 against enemy guerrilla units.
 But the contribution of Vietnamese army
 units has been downgraded.  Quite naturally
 U.S. military men in statements play up the
 better side: "They fight well when well led,
 which is not always true."  Some units work
 and fight well with Americans.
 But correspondents and others tell stories
 of understandable war weariness, high de-
 sertion  rates,  internal                                                                                                                                   political  bickering,
 and reluctance to fire new artillery weapons
 for fear of attracting enemy wrath.
 The delta, unlike other areas, is the sale
 preserve of the Vietnamese army.  There are
 no U.S. fighting troops there, only advisers,
 helicopter and navy units helping the three
 Vietnamese army divisions against 80,000 Viet
 Cong.
 Pressed as it was to fight the enemy in the
 north; the U.S. was content to let this be.
 For a time, the official line was that things
 were going well in the Delta.
 Slowly, however, the realization has come
 through that that is not so.  At best, it is
 viewed as a combination military standoff
 and hostile gentlemen's agreement with the
 government holding the major towns and the
 Viet Cong running much of the countryside,
 using it as a source of food and military
 recruits.
 Some suggest the enemy is creating diver-
 sions further north while it rebuilds popular
 support in the Delta and prepares for a bit-
 ter guerrilla warfare showdown.
 Whatever, there are many who might agree
 with the Vietnamese commander of the area
 who said: "The war began in the Delta and
 it will end there."
 Reports are that it is now only a matter
 of weeks and available troops before the U.S.
 moves into the Delta.  It will be a small
 buildup at first, but the leaked estimates of
 four divisions or 100,000 men are hardly out

 of line with military thinking about how the
 job should be done.
 WALL-TO-WALL TRAGEDY
 Nothing so tragically points up the prob-
 lems of the air war in the South as the way
 U.B. Air Force jets bombed and strafed a
 Delta hamlet near Can Tho, killing or wound-
 ing more than 100 civilians.
 Indications are such things happen far
 more often than officials like to admit.  One
 can argue that the peasants blame the Viet
 Cong even more for drawing the bombs to
 the hamlet, but there is still no doubt that
 our own misplaced air power can be, and has
 been, a weapon against us.
 It is one thing to hear an air force officer at
 a  briefing  say  "we  can  put  wall-to-wall
 napalm down on any area of the country,
 right in front of our troops." It is something
 far grimmer to envision that weapon broiling
 innocent villagers trapped with the enemy.
 There is, 1iowever, the tremendously posi-
 tive side of air power's contribution to the
 war.  Some feel that in the critical months
 last year it was the difference.
 Certainly it is an impressive operation:
 Day and night bombers circle in the sky; they
 can be over a target almost anywhere in the
 country in 15 minutes, usually less. * * * At
 night lumbering DC-3s, converted into com-
 bination flare ships and gun platforms, are
 aloft, ready to light up and strafe an attack-
 ing enemy. * * * A new radar technique can
 guide bombers in monsoon rains to drop
 bombs on an enemy attacking the very fringes
 of an Isolated. Special Forces camp in the re-
 mote highlands. * * * Reconnaissance, jets
 flash over a forest at night, taking infrared
 photos that show the heat from enemy camp-
 .fi.res as bright dots; a B-52 strike can hit the
 camp within hours. * * *
 ELEPHANT  AND ANTS
 There is much more to the Viet Nam war.
 But it all adds up to a picture of tremendous
 effort certain to get bigger.
 U.S. forces will go well past 400,000 by the
 end of the year.  Despite the flap over what
 Marine Commandant General Wallace Greene
 did or did not say at an off-the-record ses-
 sion with newsmen in Saigon, the estimate
 that 750,000 troops and at least five years will
 be needed is not shocking in the light of what
 seems to be Saigon and private Washington
 thinking today.
 In fact, a "realist" in the frame of current
 thinking might estimate it will take upwards
 to a million troops, (for a limited time) and
 15 to 20 years to save and secure South Viet
 Nam.
 And that's if we are winning.  There are
 those who question our approach and wheth-
 er well really be able to outsmart and outlast
 the enemy on his home ground, no matter
 what we spend.
 This will be touched on in a later article.
 But part of the point was made by an Amer-
 ican correspondent:
 "You can't help being impressed with the
 bravery of our troops and the proportions the
 buildup will reach over the coming months.
 "But after we get the elephant built, . I
 Wonder if he'll really be able to step on all
 those ants.".
 An American official with long experience
 put it another way: "This war may not be
 win-able, but at least we've made it militarily
 unloseable."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WALTER S. BARING
 OF NEVADA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 13, 1966
 Mr. BARING.                         Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks I would like
 to insert a poem in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD composed by my staff on the oc-
 casion of the retirement of my faithful
 friend and assistant, George H. "Tim"
 Seward.
 Tim Seward has been my friend and
 my aid for 25 years. His leaving creates
 a void in my office and he shall be missed
 by my entire staff, by whom he IS much
 loved, and by me in particular.
 The poem follows:
 TIM SEWARD DAY
 We all sat for days in meditation
 About a way to show our appreciation
 For the many things that Tim has clone
 To make our life better-and much more fun.
 We asked one of our group to try to compose
 A poem or a verse in eloquent prose,
 And the very best that she could do
 As our last and final tribute to you
 Is merely to propose a toast
 Without being nostalgic or too verbose,
 So lift your glasses and drink to Tina
 We wish the best of everything to Pike and
 him:
 And, if  after  they've  left,  they  try  to
 remember
 This particular day in the month of Sep-
 tember,
 We hope they'll know that we've tried to say
 We have proclaimed this as "Tim Seward
 Day."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN C. KUNKEL
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 13, 1966
 Mr. KTJNKEL.                                                    Mr. Speaker, there
 came into my hands some time ago a
 compilation of writings by a constituent
 of mine, Mr. Fletcher Thomas Beck, of
 Newport, Pa. The collection is entitled
 "The  Taunting Treasure  and  Other
 Selected Publications."  It includes a
 number of short stories, essays, and
 character studies.
 I have read the works with a great
 deal of enjoyment, largely for Mr. Beck's
 clear style and the worthwhile messages
 he has woven into his compositions.
 There is one particular story in the col-
 lection which would seem both to typify
 the author's approach quite well and to
 appeal to readers of the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD.  Its title is "Faith: The Secret."
 It is about an old gravedigger a:nd his
 philosophy of life.  The setting is a most
 beautiful one in the region of Pennsyl-
 vania from which I come.
 At a time when national and inter-
 national crises bear down upon us so
 ominously-when all manner of prob-
 lems beset us on every side-it occurred
 to me this story might provide a source
 of hope and inspiration.  For those in-
 clined to cower under the sheer im-
 mensity of our troubles, its last words
 carry  an  appropriate  reminder  that
 "Faith is the great healer."
 The story follows:
 FAITH: THE SECRET
 (By Fletcher Beck)
 Old Kady, the gravedigger, had a philos-
 ophy of life incongruous to his occupation.
 I met him first on a June day.  Sitting
 on my cottage parch overlooking the village
 graveyard, I could see his old sou'wester,
 rakishly askew, bobbing up and down as he
 picked away at the substrata of the grave
 which almost hid him from the world.  I
 decided I would like to talk to such a dif-
 ferent-looking person.,
 As I approached, he shoved his hat back
 and examined me with his fine brown eyes,
 alive with kindness and humor. Evidently
 I had made the grade, for after a moment of
 silence he drawled with a smile, "Mighty nice
 to see you, Bub."
 We had talked several minutes before I
 was aware that the kindness and goodness
 of this mountaineer gravedigger had warmed
 my heart like rays of'a sunrise.
 Here was a man, with calloused and horny
 hands, doing a depressing job-the last per-
 son, I thought, to go about singing, "Just
 around the corner, there's a rainbow in. the
 sky."
 When night came he would plod home-
 ward along a winding path among the hills.
 Tired, as I knew he must have been, he
 would sometimes sing lustily as if to show
 the world that we are prone to magnify our
 anxieties out of all proportion to their im-
 portance.
 A clear mountain stream went tumbling
 by his cabin door, while all around violets,
 laurel, and woodbine bloomed profusely be-
 neath a sky kindling with the magic of
 summer clouds and glorious sunshine.  Cat-
 bird and thrush vied for a place of honor,
 as the bobwhite solemnly called its half-
 grown brood together for the night.
 Here, earth and sky, fragrance and shad-
 ow, color and sound blended into one grand
 symphony  which  this  gravedigger whole-
 heartedly embraced, gaining from it a pre-
 cious treasure-peace of mind and peace of
 soul.
 One day I said to him, "Kady, you always
 have the air of someone who has just dis-
 covered a gold mine.  How do you get that
 way?"
 "Hey, Bub, see this?" pointing in the di-
 rection of the sun, which was slowly sinking
 behind the blue Juniata Mountain.  "The
 Master Artist who painted that sunset can
 paint beauty just like it in your soul if you'll
 give him a chance.  And what's in your in-
 nerts is always reflected through your skin."
 It was evident that his gold-mined de-
 meanor had won for him a host of friends.
 This, coupled with his desire- to be of service
 to his neighbors, made it easy to see why he
 was so often singled out by his friends with
 a special kind of greeting:  "Hello, Kady!
 Where do we go today?"
 A typical answer: "Just across. the hills to
 see Jim.  Hear Banie, the youngest kid, is
 sick.  These oranges may bring her a bit of
 cheer."
 In his response reposed his secret-,his
 philosophy of life.  He completely forgot him-
 self in his desire to bring cheer and comfort
 to a neighbor in need.  Everyone understood
 that beneath his blue denim jacket beat a
 heart with kindly feeling for his fellow men.
 It was not so difficult to understand the
 esteem of the mountain folk for this unusual
 little man.  Anyone having a birthday was
 almost sure to receive a greeting in one form
 or another from Kady.   It might be just
 "Hello, Andy, happy birthday."  Or it might
 be a few choice hazelnuts, a bunch of medic-
 inal herbs, a rare wild flower, or he might
 come smiling through your cabin door with
 a string of pike or bass.
 Once in a while Kady told, a big fish story
 to crack the ice on the face of some frosty
 old mountaineer.
 "You know," he said, "the last time I was
 fishing I pulled a big 'un out on the bank
 and mounted it like you would a bucking
 bronco.  But it just dipped into the water
 with Kady on its back and away we want
 lickerty-split. The old boy Jonah didn't have
 much on me.  Well, me and that big fish
 came back-for here I am."
 "Yes,    Kady," said  neighbor Jim,  "but
 where's the fish?"
