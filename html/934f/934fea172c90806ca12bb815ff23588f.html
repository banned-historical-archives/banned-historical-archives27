 REPORT
 together with
 INDIVIDUAL VIEWS
 [To accompany H.R. 3231]
 [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
 The Committee on Education and Labor, to whom was referred the
 bill (H.R. 3231) to further the national security of the United States
 and the Nation's economy by providing grants for foreign language
 programs to improve foreign language study for elementary and sec-
 ondary school students and to provide for per capita grants to reim-
 burse institutions of higher education for part of the costs of pro-
 viding foreign language instruction, having considered the same, re-
 port favorably thereon with an amendment and recommend that the
 bill as amended do pass.
 The amendment strikes out all after the enacting clause of the bill
 and inserts a new text which appears in italic type in the reported bill.
 H.R. 3231 authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish two
 state-run model foreign langauge grant programs. In the first, states
 would compete for grants to help fund model programs in local school
 districts. In the second, states would compete for grants to help fund
 model programs in community and junior colleges. In both cases, the
 local model program would have to evaluate the foreign language pro-
 ficiency of participating students and provide those evaluations to the
 state. Also in both model programs, states receiving grants would
 have to set aside one percent of the grant for foreign language teacher
 training.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 The bill also authorizes the Secretary to make grants to colleges
 and universities that have more than five percent of their students
 enrolled in approved foreign language courses. If the institution's
 first and second year language course enrollments exceed five percent
 of the total enrollment of the institution, the award would be $30 for
 each student over the five percent level. For each student enrolled in
 courses beyond the second year, the school would be eligible to re-
 ceive $40. And if the student is enrolled in a course that teaches a less
 commonly taught language (as determined by the Secretary), the
 award to the institution is increased by $40 per student.
 Finally, H.R. 3231 authorizes the Secretary'to award grants of $30
 for each student enrolled at colleges and universities that require two
 years of foreign language for either entrance to the schools or for
 graduation from them.
 The bill authorizes $10 million for the elementary and secondary
 model programs, $4 million for the community and junior college
 model programs, $13 million for foreign language course enrollment
 grants and $60 million for the grants to schools with entrance and
 graduation requirements.
 In November 1979, the President's Commission on Foreign Lan-
 guage and International Studies said in its report :
 We are profoundly alarmed by what we have found; a
 serious deterioration in this country's language and research
 capacity, at a time when an increasingly hazardous interna-
 tional military, political and economic environment is mak-
 ing unprecedented demands on America's resources, intel-
 lectual capacity and public sensitivity.
 The Commission went on to conclude that as a result of this der
 terioriation in foreign language capacity, "Nothing less is at stake
 than the nation's security."
 On November 17,1980, the House of Representatives went on record
 in support of improved foreign language. study when it passed House
 Concurrent Resolution 301, which indicates it is the sense of the Con-
 gress that local school districts and institutions of higher education
 "should consider strengthening the study of foreign languages and
 cultures." The same resolution passed the Senate December 8, 1980.
 The international situation remains at least as hazardous as when
 the Commission issued its report. And yet, as Admiral Bobby R.
 Inman, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified
 at the Postsecondary Education Subcommittee's July 1981 hearings
 on H.R. 3231, "The foreign language capability of our country is poor
 and is getting worse." Admiral Inman added that this failure presents
 "a major hazard to our national security."
 The Admiral continued :
 In our operations area, we are now losing many of our most
 experienced people who have. had 20 or so years of service
 using a second and third language. Replacement of these
 people has been made difficult by the fact that many uni-

 versities and colleges no longer have, foreign language re-
 quirements as part of their mandatory curriculum ... We
 need to be able to recruit and hire people who already possess
 capability in a foreign language and not lose the time re-
 quired to train them in this skill after they are on board.
 Major General Richard Larkin, Deputy Director of the Defense
 Intelligence Agency, told the Subcommittee :
 Recent trends show that intelligence opportunities based
 on language skills are increasing rapidly, while the avail-
 ability of language-trained professionals has been gradually
 shrinking. This problem is directly related to the inability
 of our educational system to continue to provide the talent
 required for understanding foreign cultures and interpret-
 ing their behavior.
 And Mr. Craig Wilson, speaking on behalf of the Secretary of
 Defense, delivered the following graphic evidence of the need for
 national action on foreign languages:
 Intelligence units to support the RDF (Rapid Deployment
 Force) will require an estimated additional 874 military lin-
 guist positions for six major Middle East and African lan-
 guages and dialects. For these, as well as most all languages,
 there is not a trained, recruitable base within the American
 population.
 Support for federal action to remedy this problem is not limited to
 the military and intelligence communities. The President of Standard
 Oil Company (Indiana, Richard Morrow, in response to a survey of
 leading U.S. corporations, wrote :
 The United States can no longer afford to remain a mono-
 linguist nation, expecting the rest of the world's peoples to
 adjust to our ways. Thus the need for Americans to learn
 foreign languages is more urgent than ever.
 And John McDougall, Executive Vice-President of Ford Motor
 Company, wrote :
 It is precisely this combination of foreign language ability
 and business expertise * * * that is now needed and will be
 required even more in the future by U.S. companies if they
 are to compete successfully in these (Asia, the Middle East,
 Eastern Europe) markets.
 Incentives for foreign language study, seem likely to in-
 crease the pool of available talent in this country, to the bene-
 fit of both U.S.-based corporations and the U.S. Government.
 H.R. 3231, by offering such incentives, must be counted as a
 major step toward this goal.
 The Chairman of Ogilvy & Mather, International, John Elliott, Jr.,
 said:
 The ineptitude of Americans (including me) in foreign
 languages is an embarrassment .for our country. It contrib-
 utes to our image of arrogance.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Vice President for Corporate Affairs with Philip Morris, Inter-
 national, Andrew Whist, commented :
 The lack of language training of Americans is a broad
 social issue, but one whose impact is dramatic in the inter-
 national business sector.
 And the Vice Chairman of Doyle Dane Bernbach, Inc., Robert H.
 Levenson, wrote :
 I agree completely that Americans doing business abroad
 are significantly disadvantaged by poor and insufficient train-
 ing in foreign languages. There is always a suitable, but dis-
 tinct, loss of the "upper hand" when one cannot make oneself
 understood.
 At one of the Subcommittee's field hearings on H.R. 3231, Mr.
 Manuel A. Menica, international representative with the Florida De-
 partment of Commerce, presented testimony which indicated that U.S.
 foreign language inadequacies have :
 Created a self-enacted trade barrier more effective than
 any protective tariff ever established. While our competitors
 continue to succeed in penetrating even our most traditional
 markets due to their ability to adapt their product conditions
 to the cultural patterns of the target country, Americans con-
 tinue to transact business, as well as diplomacy, through inter-
 preters. Consequently, it is no surprise that we are con-
 stantly outmaneuvered by our competitors in business deals
 where delicate, on-the-spot negotiations are necessary.
 While the problem is well-documented, finding a solution is not
 among the top priorities of most schools in this country. For this is
 a national problem and is thus a federal responsibility.
 The Joint National Committee for Languages testified that only 15
 percent of all U.S. high school students are enrolled in foreign lan-
 guage courses today. And just eight percent of U.S. colleges require
 it foreign language for admission.
 Total college enrollment has increased from 6.9 million in 1968 to
 9.9 million in 1977. However, enrollment in modern foreign languages
 has dropped over that same period from 1.1 million to just 883,000.
 Without some outside incentives, such as those offered in H.R. 3231,
 the decline is likely to continue.
 At the end of his statement to the Subcommittee, the CIA's Admiral
 Lnman concluded :
 Decisive action should be taken on the federal level to
 ensure improvement in foreign language training in the U.S.
 so that we can.cope with the problems we will face in future
 years as the pace of our involvement with the rest of the
 world becomes ever more important to our own survival and
 well being.

 on.dary school students and to provide for per capita grants to reim-
 burse institutions of higher education for part of the costs of providing
 foreign language instruction, was introduced by Representatives
 Simon, Coleman, Perkins, Ford of Michigan, Weiss, Peyser, Erdahl,
 DeNardis, Panetta and Oberstar in the House of Representatives on
 April 10, 1981, and referred to the Subcommittee on Postsecondary
 Education and the Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary and
 Vocational Education of the Committee on Education and Labor.
 Hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa-
 tion on H.R. 3231 on July 14, July 15, and September 25, 1981.
 On October 7, 1981, the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa-
 tion met in open legislative session and reported H.R. 3231 with an
 amendment to the Committee on Education and Labor by a voice vote.
 On October 20, 1981, H.R. 3231 was ordered reported by the Com-
 mittee on Education and Labor by a vote of 21-9.
 H.R. 3231 would establish state model foreign language program
 grants and grants to institutions of higher education as follows :
 States would be able to apply to the Secretary of Education for
 money to help fund innovative model foreign language programs
 designed and operated by local school districts and by community
 and junior colleges. Pending approval of state applications, each state
 would be eligible to receive (1) under the elementary and secondary
 model program, $50,000 plus 4 cents times the state's population and
 (2) under the community and junior college model program, $30,000
 plus one cent times the state's population.
 Higher education institutions with foreign language course enroll-
 ments that represent at least five percent of the total enrollment at
 the institution would be eligible to receive grants to help pay the costs
 associated with foreign language instruction.
 if total first and second year foreign language course enrollments
 exceed five percent of the institution's total enrollment, then the school
 would be eligible to receive $30 for each first or second year language
 student that represents an excess over the 5 percent figure.
 .For students enrolled in language courses beyond the second year
 the school could receive $40.
 And if the language students are enrolled in courses teaching lan-
 guages that the Secretary of Education determines to be less com-
 monly taught (eg.: Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, etc.), the
 school would be eligible to receive an additional $40 for each of those
 students.
 PER CAPITA COURSE REQUIREMENT GRANTS
 Each institution of higher education that requires either two years
 of secondary school foreign language courses for entrance to the in-
 stitution or two years of postsecondary foreign language courses for

 B. Estimate of the convnittee
 In compliance with clause 7(a) (1) of rule XIII of the Rules of
 the House of Representatives, the committee adopts the estimate pre-
 pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
 Pursuant to clause 2(1) (4), rule XI of the Rules of the House of
 Representatives, the Committee estimates that the enactment of H.R.
 3231 will have little inflationary impact on prices and coss in the
 operation of the national economy. It is the judgment of the Com-
 mittee that the inflationary impact of this legislation as a component
 of the total Federal budget is negligible.
 In compliance with clause 2(1) (3) (A) of Rule XI of the Rules of
 the House of Representatives, this report embodies the findings and
 recommendations of the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education,
 established pursuant to clause 2(B) (1) of rule X of the House of
 Representatives and rule 18(a) of the Rules of the Committee on
 Education and Labor.
 No summary of oversight findings and recommendations made by
 the Committee on Government Operations was available to the Com-
 mittee with reference to the subject matter specifically addressed by
 H.R. 3231.
 No specific oversight activities, other than hearings accompanying
 the Committee's consideration of H.R. 3231 were made by the Com-
 mittee, within the definition of rule XI of the House.
 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
 Section 1 contains findings which indicate the need for expanded
 foreign language study in the United States.
 Section 2 (a) authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants
 to states which apply to establish model foreign language programs
 in local school districts. States whose applications are approved by
 the Secretary would be eligible to receive $50,000 plus the sum of 4
 cents times the state's population. Funding at that level would con-
 tinue for two more years, pending approval by the Secretary.
 Section 2(b) outlines the requirements that state applications must
 meet in order to receive approval by the Secretary. Those require-
 ments are : (1) the model programs described must represent a variety
 of innovative approaches to foreign language study; (2) model pro-

 grams in local districts must be open to all children aged 5 through
 17 who live in the district; (3) the state must assure the Secretary that
 the model program will have enough money from state, local and fed-
 eral sources to carry out the program as described in the state applica-
 tion; (4) model programs must evaluate the language proficiency of
 students in the programs and give copies of the evaluations to the
 state; and (5) the state must set aside one percent of the grant money
 received under this section for inservice training of foreign language
 teachers.
 Section 2(c) authorizes the Secretary to ratably reduce the grants
 if the funds appropriated are not sufficient to fully implement the
 law.
 Section 3(a) authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants
 to states which apply to establish model foreign language programs
 in community and junior colleges. States whose applications are ap-
 proved by the Secretary would be eligible to receive $30,000 plus the
 sum of one cent times -the state's population.
 Section 3(b) outlines the requirements that state applications must
 meet in order to receive approval by the Secretary. Those requirements
 are : (1) the model programs described must represent a variety of
 innovative approaches to foreign language study; (2) the state must
 assure the Secretary that the model programs will have enough money
 from state, local and federal sources to carry out the program as
 described in the state application; (3) model programs must evaluate
 the language proficiency of students in the programs and give copies
 of the evaluations to the state; and (4) the state must set aside one
 percent of the grant money received under this section for inservice
 training of foreign language teachers.
 Section 3(c) authorizes the Secretary to ratably reduce the grants
 if the funds appropriated are not sufficient to fully implement the law.
 Section 4(a) authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants
 to colleges and universities to pay part of the costs of foreign lan-
 guage instruction at those institutions. In order to receive any funds,
 the school must apply to the Secretary and more than five percent of
 the school's enrollment must be enrolled in foreign language courses.
 The Secretary is also authorized to establish criteria for evaluating
 programs assisted by the grants and to require an annual, report of
 the institutions. That report should evaluate the progress and pro-
 ficiency of foreign language students in the assisted programs.
 Section 4(b) outlines the amounts of the grants and the conditions
 under which they will be made. If the total number of first and second
 year language students at a school is greater than five percent of the
 entire school's enrollment, the school is eligible to receive $30 for
 each student above the five percent figure. For all students enrolled in
 courses beyond the second year, the institution is eligible to receive
 $40. And for all students enrolled in less commonly taught languages
 (as determined by the Secretary) the per capita grant is increased
 by $40.
 Section 4(c) authorizes the Secretary to ratably reduce the grants
 if the funds appropriated are not sufficient to fully implement the law.
 Section 5 (a) authorizes the Secretary of Education to make $30
 grants to colleges and universities for each student enrolled at the

 schools if the schools (1) require 2 years of high school language for
 entrance or (2) require 2 years of college language courses (or dem-
 onstrated proficiency) for graduation.
 Section 5 (b) allows the Secretary to ratably reduce the grants if the
 funds appropriated are not sufficient to fully implement the law.
 Section 6 states that funds may be distributed under this Act only
 as is provided for in the appropriation act.
 Section 7 defines the terms used in this Act.
 Section 8 sets the authorization levels at: $10 million for Section 2;
 $4 million for Section 3; $13 million for Section 4; and $60 million
 for Section 5.
 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING LAW
 In compliance with clause 3 of Rule XIII of the Rules of the House
 of Representatives, H.R. 3231 creates a new authority and makes no
 changes in existing law.

 INDIVIDUAL VIEWS OF THOMAS E. PETRI, ON H.R. 3231
 If our nation is to continue playing a superpower role on the world
 stage, we badly need a corps of individuals who are experts in the lan-
 guages and cultures of other peoples, especially subgroups, small tribes
 and obscure languages. Such individuals should be able to spend time
 in the countries they study in order to get to know the local people,
 become known by them, and even to become their trusted friend. These
 experts should also be available to conduct seminars, brief government
 officials and businessmen, and generally provide solid expertise to
 assist in the conduct of our foreign policy and private groups' relations
 with other peoples.
 Of course we already have some experts of the kind I am describing,
 primarily in our universities, but we need many more of them and we
 need to use them better. One particularly sad example of our failures
 in this area was the occasion a few years back when our ambassador to
 Afghanistan was kidnapped and none in our embassy could speak the
 local language in order to communicate with the kidnappers. We
 didn't even have the national language covered, to say nothing of hav-
 ing experts who were comfortable among the various tribes in the
 provinces.
 The Canadians have a Translation Board, which provides, besides
 translation services, an institutionalized body of knowledge of the kind
 I am trying to describe. I don't know exactly how the British do it, but
 they often seem to have individuals who are knowledgeable about
 obscure tribes and cultures, who visit them regularly, and who are on
 good terms with the local populace and leadership groups.
 II.R. 3231 provides a tiny subsidy indiscriminately to hundreds of
 thousands of students for foreign language study. It may help in some
 very marginal way to meet the need I am describing, but I feel that
 some other completely different approach is necessary. I believe the
 first requirement is for a long term program that will attract capable
 people to foreign area studies and enable them to pursue these studies
 effectively. A second requirement is to facilitate the use of these experts
 by the government and others.
 I don't necessarily believe that adding positions to the State Depart-
 ment or the CIA is the answer. Rather the best approach might be to
 support a lot of professorships at universities and provide funds for
 regular travel abroad, with the understanding that holders of these
 positions will be able to get away from the university regularly and
 will be available for a variety of activities through which their knowl-
 edge can be used. There would also have to be a coordinating body to
 allot; these positions, distribute travel funds, keep track of similar
 resources that are available, and facilitate the use of these resources by
 the government and others.
 In any case, it is extremely important that we do not let consider-
 ation of H.R. 3231 be the end of our concern for the promotion of
 foreign language and area competence in our nation.

 NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
 THROUGH FOREIGN LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT
 TUESDAY, JULY 14, 1981
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 SUBCOMMITTEE ON POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION,
 COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR,
 Washington, D.C.
 The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9 a.m., in room
 304, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Paul Simon (chairman of
 the subcommittee) presiding.
 Members present: Representatives Simon, Coleman, and Bailey.
 Staff present: William A. Blakey, counsel; Nicholas J. Penning,
 staff assistant; and Betsy Brand, minority legislative associate.
 Mr. SIMON. The subcommittee hearing will come to order.
 Today and tomorrow we will be discussing a little known but
 very real threat to our national security and our economic health.
 This shortage hasn't received as much publicity as the oil shortage
 but, like the oil shortage, it hurts our economy and affects our
 ability to function in today's world.
 The shortage I am talking about is our national deficiency in
 foreign language skills. Fewer than 4 percent of our public high
 school graduates have more than 2 years of foreign language study,
 and I might add this has declined. We are the only country where
 someone can graduate from college, even get a Ph. D., without
 having a single year of instruction in a foreign language.
 As a result of this language shortage, we are losing potential
 markets and potential diplomatic friends at a time when we need
 them most. We compete with the Soviet Union for influence with
 developing nations; and we compete with Japan, Germany and the
 major exporting nations for markets all over the globe. But because
 of our language deficiencies we are going to bat against these
 countries with one hand tied behind our back.
 During the subcommittee's recent trip to the Soviet Union and
 West Germany, the delegation relied almost exclusively on the
 translation and interpretations of the Soviets to conduct high level
 policy discussions. On one occasion, a high Soviet official, who
 speaks and understands English very well, corrected the Russian
 translator as he attempted to translate his statement into English.
 It is very likely that this occurred when the same translator inter-
 preted our remarks into Russian.
 When the American Embassy in Tehran was taken, only six of
 our 52 hostages could speak Farsi. When our Ambassador to Af-
 ghanistan was kidnapped and slain, we could not negotiate with
 the kidnappers because none of our Embassy personnel could speak
 the local languages.

 The State Department has 1,222 positions that have been identi-
 fied as requiring foreign language ability, but as of this January
 only 67 percent of those positions were adequately filled. The De-
 partment of Defense has more than 488,000 active duty military
 personnel stationed overseas, but only 314 persons, less than one-
 tenth of 1 percent, were classified by the military as linguists last
 year.
 Our inability to communicate with the rest of the world has also
 hurt us economically. While the Germans and Japanese are fever-
 ishly learning new languages and aggressively developing new
 markets, our businesses continue to take a let-them-learn-English
 attitude toward potential customers. Our trade deficit last year was
 $20.3 billion.
 How much of that was caused by our refusal to learn other
 languages?
 Then in my prepared statement I have some more specifics
 where we have had embarrassment businesswise.
 But American corporations don't deserve all the blame for those
 blunders. Our schools are not turning out graduates proficient in
 the languages of developing nations, and the Federal Government
 is not doing enough to encourage schools to offer comprehensive
 language programs.
 The bill that is the focus of these hearings, H.R. 3231, would help
 elementary and secondary school districts to establish model for-
 eign language programs and would provide foreign language grants
 to colleges and universities.
 Today and tomorrow we will be hearing from representatives of
 the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, busi-
 ness persons and educators. It is my hope that their testimony will
 awaken Americans to the fact that, as one writer put it, "What we
 don't know can hurt us."

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL SIMON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
 FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
 Today and tomorrow we will be discussing a little-known but very real threat to
 our national security and our economic health. This shortage hasn't received as
 much publicity as the oil shortage, but like the oil shortage it hurts our economy
 and affects our ability to function in today's world.
 The shortage I am talking about is our national deficiency in foreign language
 skills. Fewer than 4 per cent of our public high school graduates have more than
 two years of foreign language study. We are the only country where someone can
 graduate from college-even get a Ph. D.-without having a single year of instruc-
 tion in a foreign language.
 As a result of this language shortage, we are losing potential markets and poten-
 tial diplomatic friends at a time when we need them most. We compete with the
 Soviet Union for influence with developing nations; and we compete with Japan,
 Germany and the major exporting nations for markets all over the globe. But
 because of our language deficiencies we are going to bat against these countries
 with one hand tied behind our back.
 During the Subcommittee's recent trip to the Soviet Union and West Germany,
 the delegation relied almost exclusively on the translation and interpretations of
 the Soviets to conduct high level policy discussions. On one occasion, a high Soviet
 official (who speaks and understands English very well) corrected the Russian
 translator as he attempted to translate his statement into English. It is very likely
 that this occurred when the same translator interpreted our remarks into Russian.
 When the American Embassy in Tehran was taken, only six of our 52 hostages
 could speak Farsi. When our Ambassador to Afghanistan was kidnapped and slain,
 we could not negotiate with the kidnappers because none of our embassy personnel
 could speak the local languages.
 The State Department has 1,222 positions that have been identified as requiring
 foreign language abililty, but as of this January only 67 percent of those positions
 were adequately filled. The Department of Defense has more than 488,000 active
 duty military personnel stationed overseas, but only 314 persons-less than one-
 tenth of one percent-were classified by the military as linguists last year.
 Our inability to communicate with the rest of the world has also hurt us economi-
 cally. While the Germans and Japanese are feverishly learning new languages and
 aggressively developing new markets, our businesses continue to take a "let them
 learn English" attitude toward potential customers. Our trade deficit last year was
 $20.3 billion. How much of that was caused by our refusal to learn other languages?
 There are numerous examples of the linguistic blunders made by American
 corporations when they attempted to sell overseas. "Come Alive with Pepsi" was
 translated into German as, "Come Alive Out of the Grave." General Motors tried to
 sell its Chevy II Nova in Puerto Rico and South America and didn't realize that "no
 va" means "it doesn't go" in Spanish.
 But American corporations don't deserve all the blame for those blunders. Our
 schools are not turning out graduates proficient in the languages of developing
 nations, and the federal government is not doing enough to encourage schools to
 offer comprehensive language programs.
 The bill that is the focus of these hearings, H.R. 3231, would help elementary and
 secondary school districts to establish model foreign language programs and would
 provide foreign language grants to colleges and universities.
 Today and tomorrow we will be hearing from representatives of the Defense
 Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, business persons and educators. It
 is my hope that their testimony will awaken Americans to the fact that, as one
 writer put it, "What we don't know CAN hurt us."
 Mr. SIMON. I want to also enter into the record statements from
 two people who are not able to be here as witnesses, Wayne Freder-
 icks, from the Ford Motor Co., and Bob Payton, from Exxon Educa-
 tion Foundation.

 DEAR PAUL: Many thanks for your invitation to testify before your committee on
 foreign language instruction in this country.

 As you know from our service together on the President's commission, I feel
 strongly about the inadequacies of foreign language competence among Americans.
 After studying H.R. 3231 during the Memorial Day weekend, I do want you to
 know that I personally support the objectives and program of the bill. Unfortunate-
 ly, I will not be able to testify because of my travels. I depart this week for for
 Nigeria and Europe and will not be back in this country for several weeks.
 It was good to hear from you.
 With best wishes,

 EXXON EDUCATION FOUNDATION,
 New York, N. Y., July 2, 1981.
 Mr. PAUL SIMON,
 Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PAUL: As it turns out, my prior commitment in New York will preclude my
 participation in the hearings on the important issue of foreign language education.
 From the vantage point of the private sector, there appears to be two outstanding
 problems that inhibit progress: the first is the widespread skepticism in the business
 community about the utility of foreign language education, compared to other
 educational needs; the second is the fact that no philanthropic foundations or
 corporate contributions programs have made foreign language education a major
 area of attention. I'm pleased that Exxon Education Foundation has been able to
 increase its support of international education, and to provide some important help
 in foreign language study to John Rassias and Richard Lambert. But there needs to
 be a much broader variety of support from the private sector if the consciousness of
 the public sector is to be raised.
 Your own special contributions to the field are widely recognized and deeply
 appreciated by educators and others concerned about American competence in
 world affairs. Keep up the good work.
 Sincerely,
 ROBERT L. PAYTON,
 President.
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Bailey, do you want to add anything before we
 hear from the witnesses?
 Mr. BAILEY. I think we should proceed with the witnesses.
 Mr. SIMON. First let me call Mr. Erland C. Heginbotham, the
 Director General of the Foreign Commercial Service, International
 Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.
 I might add that the commercial attaches were switched recently
 from the Department of State, the responsibility for them, to the
 Department of Commerce, so we are interested in what you have to
 say, Mr. Heginbotham.
 STATEMENT OF ERLAND C. HEGINBOTHAM, DIRECTOR GENER-
 AL,  FOREIGN  COMMERCIAL  SERVICE,  INTERNATIONAL
 TRADE ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. Thank you very much.
 I would like to speak from a perspective of 25 years of personal
 experience working in the foreign service in support of American
 business activities and from 15 months of perspective as the head
 of the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service.
 Certainly-my own personal experience and our experience with
 the Commercial Service confirms generally the findings of the
 Rand study concerning the problems of demand for language skills
 from American business and from American Government.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 I think a contrast in country practices, to add to your list of
 illustrations, is noteworthy.
 By contrast with what the Rand study accurately points out as a
 general indifference to hiring language skills for U.S. business in
 Japan, a Japanese company recently brought in its new American
 manager, provided the official with 6 months of overlap with his
 predecessor in the United States, and had previously given him a
 year of graduate MBA studies, as well as prior training in the
 language.
 The Japanese Diplomatic Corps provides in-depth college level
 study at a local university in the country to which those officers
 will subsequently be assigned, so that the contrast anecdotally
 between American and Japanese companies in terms of their man-
 agers ability to deal with the countries in which they are located is
 very unfavorable to the United States.
 The American company recourse is to hire foreign nationals
 because it is cheaper and as we have seen in our own regular
 Foreign Service, managers give less weight to language than to
 other types of skills and experience.
 For example, I have acquired from a Japanese linguist, with
 extensive Ph. D. studies in Japanese and some business experience,
 a list of recent graduates of 2 or 3 years ago and the difficulties
 they have had acquiring employment with American firms.
 The pattern is that those individuals with superb credentials
 from the best institutions in the United States who have searched
 for upwards of a year or more for employment with American
 companies without success, and have taken jobs with Japanese
 firms or foreign firms competing with American firms abroad.
 The consequence is that both in our own Government foreign
 services and in business the decisionmakers lack a real understand-
 ing of what makes foreign markets different from the United
 States and from each other. The loses to the United States in
 balance of payment terms must indeed be very great.
 U.S. Government language priorities are similarly low. In my
 own case in the Foreign Service, not once in 25 years has the U.S.
 Government suggested that I take language training in preparation
 for a foreign assignment. I did acquire 2 weeks of language train-
 ing prior to going abroad on assignment after threatening virtual
 mayhem to get that kind of training. Yet the Peace Corps provides
 language training for a 1 year tour abroad. The U.S. military of
 course has the best program.
 The Foreign Commercial Service would indeed like a higher
 proportion of language skills in its service than is generally availa-
 ble in the Foreign Service as a whole.
 The need for us to know and understand in-depth the language
 and culture and customs and business practices makes language a
 prime requisite. Yet, given the lack of resources we have, it is
 extremely difficult to make that priority effective.
 I would like to point for just a moment to the costs-of our
 inability to develop a sufficient demand for language skills.
 The costs in business terms and, therefore, in strategic economic
 terms are particularly high in the most exotic languages, such as
 Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, and the Eastern European languages,

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 where the number of nationals versed in English is particularly
 low.
 A second area that is of particular concern to me is the area of
 technology frontiers. It is my belief that the United States is
 within 5 years of determining whether or not it will remain a
 ?      major industrial nation in the modern technologies.
 The degree to which other nationalities are increasing, taking
 the lead in those higher technology areas, is becoming dramatic.
 Our ability as a Nation to keep in touch with those technological
 leads through our own nationals becomes particularly critical.
 We are now reaching the stage where the Japanese in particular
 are developing technological leads. Without language and area ca-
 pabilities to track those developments we face a severe disadvan-
 tage. In some ways that is compounded by the fact that the Japa-
 nese society and culture is a closed and very difficult society to
 penetrate in terms of business practices. Yet ironically they pub-
 lish even more prolifically than in the United States, so if we had
 the language skills and the motivation, tracking those develop-
 ments would be relatively easy.
 Another area where we see dramatically on a daily basis the
 hazards of dependence on foreign nationals for language skills
 involves competing for government procurement abroad. With the
 completion of the MTN agreement, now there is opportunity for
 American firms to compete for more foreign government business.
 Yet our inability to respond in the language in which bids are
 invited and must be submitted is an important disincentive to our
 ability to respond effectively and compete effectively.
 I would like to point out some areas for remedying some of those
 problems of inadequate demand for language skills.
 In fact, government efforts to force-feed language development
 could even aggravate the national disadvantage in languages,
 unless attention is given first to remedying the obstacles to
 demand.
 I have seldom met a more disillusioned group of individuals than
 skilled linguists with business background. The fact that they have
 sought in vain for positions with American firms has led them to
 feel that their education was misplaced, that they can only wind up
 serving foreign nations, so unless we address this demand and
 increase instead only the supply we are going to add to the disillu-
 sion and, to the pool of linguists of whom foreign nationals can
 take advantage of in improving their competitive position in the
 4 United States.
 It is my estimate on a brief survey in Japanese language skills,
 for example, that only one out of six has been able to find employ-
 ment with a U.S. employer.
 Some of the structural factors in the weak private sector demand
 are not adequately addressed by the Rand study. We cannot com-
 pensate for the dollar devaluation when it had an impact, lower
 productivity in the short term, and we can't compensate for the
 low proportion of trade in the national economic activity.
 In Europe, of course, exporting accounts for some 30-40 percent
 of the total national economic activity and as a result the market
 incentives and priorities for language are very high.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 By contrast the United States has given itself certain unique
 disadvantages. For example, it has prevented the development of
 one of the major institutions with a large-scale demand for lan-
 guage and country studies. This is the institution of export trading
 companies. Our customs or practices have prevented those from
 developing, so that only 2 percent or less of U.S. manufacturers are
 exported by those companies; it ranges from 30-45 percent for
 other industrial countries.
 The result is that until we have passed the necessary legislation
 to permit the development of those companies, one of the major
 market motivations is for the use and development of language
 skills will not exist, because those companies thrive on in-depth
 knowledge and understanding of foreign languages and cultures.
 We are also unique in that we alone with Switzerland tax the
 earnings of our citizens on income earned abroad, making the cost
 of our nationals employed abroad uniquely great compared with
 hiring of the foreign nationals.
 The Rand study estimates 3 per 1,000 employees is the approxi-
 mate ratio of American to foreign nationals serving in U.S. compa-
 nies abroad. I would submit that that ratio would be substantially
 higher if it had not been for the effects of the toughening of
 taxation several years ago.
 The cost to the U.S. balance of payments of resultant repatri-
 ation of accumulated years of U.S. nationals experienced in foreign
 languages and cultures was tremendous and the demoralizing
 effect on the demand for languages must indeed have been substan-
 tial.
 Finally, we have a unique additional factor which mitigates
 against investment in language skills by the major sources of
 demand, and that is the high dependence the country has on equity
 capital. This forces an acute overbalance of attention on short-term
 profit and loss, and when you are concerned with short-term prof-
 its, you don't invest 1, 2, 3 years in language training for your
 employees.
 Among our foreign competitors the emphasis is much more on
 building market shares, building long-term capabilities to pene-
 trate the market. That difference in emphasis deriving from the
 financial structure, I believe, is a major factor in our lack of
 interest in acquiring language skills for U.S. nationals in business
 activities abroad.
 So my own view would be that probably the most cost-effective
 way of increasing language skills in the United States would be to
 attack first some factors which inhibit the market demand and
 market rewards for such skills. If there were more language em-
 phasis in business, there would also be more emphasis on govern-
 ment as well in acquiring the language skills to support American
 business.
 I hope that the committee will give attention and support to:
 First, legislation fostering formation of trading companies; second,
 liberalization of taxes on overseas income which create artificial
 discentives to hiring Americans with language skills, and third,
 encouragement of greater use of language skills in such other
 business areas as tourism where government service is also in-
 volved in assisting business.

 The Foreign Commercial Service as a source of demand is an
 infinitesimal factor in the marketplace, but we reflect in major
 respects ways in which language disabilities of the American econ-
 omy are an important factor in our difficulties in competing
 abroad.
 The subcommittee's attentions are in an exceptionally important
 cause, and I would encourage the members to give early and high
 priority to attacking problems of the weak demand as the most
 cost-effective approach to this problem.
 Thank you.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much.
 Simply to bear out one of your assertions, I jotted down an
 illustration told to me here a few weeks ago.
 Firestone made a major error because Michelin printed in a
 French technical journal why a certain process had fundamental
 flaws in producing radial tires. Unfortunately, no one in Firestone
 read the French technical journal, and we lost millions of dollars
 in the process.
 You frequently used Japan as an illustration. It is interesting,
 because often people say, well, we don't learn another language
 because we are isolated. We are not as isolated in reality as Japan
 is.
 Let me touch on a few other things in your testimony. What I
 was interested in is where you say you were in the Foreign Service
 for 25 years and at no point were you encouraged to take any full-
 time language study.
 Did I hear correctly?
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. Unfortunately, sir, that reflects the fact that
 both Mr. Boeker and I were in the economic area where there was
 a general shortage of officers. As a result, I think we probably both
 found in our careers that there was much more emphasis in our
 getting out to posts to fill an immediate vacancy than there was on
 doing language studies.
 I learned the local language, but mainly in after-hours work on
 my own, usually without Department funding. In fact, I don't think
 I ever had Department funding and just studied on my own. It
 reflects exactly what is reflected in business. The generalist's skills
 command a higher premium and are given higher attention.
 Mr. SIMON. You mentioned this difficulty of people who have
 skills finding jobs and yet at the same time I get letters from
 companies saying we can't find anyone who speaks or can trans-
 late, whatever the language might be.
 Is there a possibility the Commerce Department could set up a
 skills bank for business, just a computer where you feed in the
 demand as well as the potential?
 Has that been considered at all, and I might preface it by saying
 my reason for mentioning this, I have an amendment I am going to
 offer to your appropriation requesting such a study by the Com-
 merce Department.
 Has that been looked at at all?
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. Not that I am aware of. It is an intriguing
 idea, because your point is well taken. There are certain languages
 where there are probably surpluses and others where there may be

 a total absence, so some sort of a clearinghouse of information
 would be immensely useful.
 I am not sure what the right governmental agency for that
 would be, but certainly there is a definite role for a clearinghouse.
 It might well be a joint government/private sector undertaking.
 Mr. SIMON. I don't know what the right answer is either.
 What are you doing in the area of commercial attaches on this
 question?
 Are you getting us moving in the right direction?
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. Well, sir, this is a difficult thing for us to
 deal with. We have increased the number of language designated
 positions compared to what they were upon our assumption of
 those positions from the State Department.
 The difficulty is that we are so severely understaffed. There was
 a 21-percent reduction in the number of commercial positions over-
 seas in the 5 years before the FCS began operations. The result is
 that we are pushed ever more into gaps between assignments and
 difficulties just filling the jobs that we have available, so we have
 tried to do a number of things which are really secondary in
 impact to improve our language capabilities.
 We have lengthened tours. It sounds unrelated to language skill,
 but it is an important factor. If a person is on an 18-month tour
 and knows a language, it usually takes an officer a year to develop
 enough contacts to be really conversant and effective in an econo-
 my. Usually your last 6 months are preoccupied with getting ready
 to leave so you count that out. Thus in an 18-month tour you get
 zero effectiveness out of an officer.
 In a 2-year tour you get 6 months. In a 3-year tour you get a
 tripling, to 18 months of effective time. We have increased our
 standard length of tour to 4 years with a preferable 5 wherever
 possible. The result is, by that process alone, multiplying many fold
 the language effectiveness of our officers.
 Secondly, the State Department has had in the past to worry
 about "clientitis" in the sense if they have an officer too long in a
 post he might develop an undue affection for the local country. Our
 "clientitis" is not a danger. Our client is the business community,
 and we cannot be too familiar with it.
 For example, we have an officer in Japan who is expert in the
 language, culture, and economy. We have an informal pact with
 him that he may spend the rest of his career in Japan if he chooses
 to do so. We can encourage that kind of country, and language
 specialization without the disadvantage that might occur the diplo-
 matic or in intelligence services.
 Thirdly, we are trying to recruit for language skills but, once
 again, there are quite a number of people we have looked at who
 have superb language skills but not an adequate mix of business
 skills. We need to stress the commercial skills very heavily also.
 We also have nine positions in which we can provide long-term
 language training. That in a corps of 162 officers is relatively small
 proportion.
 In sum, we have made a cut at the problem but we are really not
 satisfied that we have the resources or answers to develop the
 degree of language and country expertise we would like.

 Mr. SIMON. The one point you mentioned is one that the higher
 education community has to consider, and that is our language
 training has tended to be literature-oriented, preparing language
 teachers rather than having MBA's who are also skilled in Japa-
 nese or whatever it might be.
 You mentioned that 9 of 166 positions, can you go over that
 again?
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. Yes, sir. When you take an officer from a
 position abroad you can't encumber that position for a year while
 the officer takes language training, so separate positions have to be
 set up as training positions.
 For example, you take an officer from Africa who is going to a
 Latin America assignment, bring him back to the United States for
 a year of-well, in Latin America you wouldn't need it-but China,
 a year of "hard language study. We use fully the facilities of FSI in
 language and area studies.
 Mr. SIMON. You mentioned one other thing and that is that you
 increase the number of language designated positions.
 Why did you do that?
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. The purpose was to give greater incentive
 and to place greater emphasis on language skills for selecting jobs.
 The Foreign Commercial Service has something between a twenti-
 eth to a fortieth of the "manpower"-you will take that in a non-
 sexist sense-available to other competing foreign commercial serv-
 ices. As a result we have to be highly effective. What we do in
 language and country skills are critically important to that effec-
 tiveness. So we have to compensate for our comparative disadvan-
 tage in numbers by increased skill and effectiveness, and in that
 respect language emphasis is more important for us by a consider-
 able margin than for the general foreign service.
 Mr. SIMON. I thank you very, very much.
 I would like to keep the record open. We may want to submit
 some additional questions to you.
 We thank you for your testimony, and I appreciate your attitude
 and your interest in this area.
 Mr. HEGINBOTHAM. It is a great pleasure. I wonder if I could
 submit for the record a letter I received from one of our Japanese
 linguists, entitled,  "Language-Trained Horror Stories by the
 Apathy of U.S. Multi-Nationals."
 It is a great title which I did not suggest. That might be of
 interest because it gives a number of case illustrations of people
 having difficulty placing their language skills with U.S. companies.

 I am delighted to be here, particularly on such an important
 issue as the one you have raised with respect to the teaching of
 foreign languages.
 Mr. SIMON. We think it is important and it is not one that has a
 great deal of sex appeal and growing a lot of interest to a lot of
 people, but is vital to the future of the Nation.
 We can hear your testimony if you wish to enter it in the record
 or read it, however you wish to proceed, Mr. Richardson.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. I would be glad to enter it into the record and
 to touch on a few of the highlights now orally.
 Mr. SIMON. Why don't you do that.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. With the thought that we could then develop
 any points that seemed of interest to you.
 First of all, there is really nothing I can add to the very thor-
 ough and eloquent diagnosis of the problem that you yourself have
 already furnished through your various writings on the subject of
 the inadequacy of our present foreign language capabilities and the
 need for more adequate and more widespread teaching, and so on
 that score I would simply wish to be understood as fully endorsing
 your findings.
 I could only add from a background of personal experience that
 it seems to me important to look at the need for language capabili-
 ties on two dimensions. The first is in the context of the actual
 business, diplomatic, economic, and military that is conducted by
 the United States around the world under circumstances of ever-
 increasing interdependence between the United States and people
 using other languages.
 On that plan, the need clearly is for mastery of languages and
 particularly for emphasis on languages that are often not taught
 and not taught widely enough.
 It is obviously no substitute for being able to speak Indonesian,
 to have a good command of Japanese or French, and we do need
 people to deal with individuals in that very populous and imporant
 country.
 The need is for making more widely available opportunities to
 learn those less frequently taught languages, and your bill properly
 focuses on the need for encouraging that objective.
 On a second plane, there is the use of languages that American
 citizens generally may have occasion to use as they travel abroad
 and have contacts with other people.
 Here I think the need is less for the mastery required for eco-
 nomic business or diplomatic purposes as it is for a degree of
 familiarity with foreign languages that encourages people to seek
 to pick up what they can when they can in circumstances where
 they are in another country or relating to people from another
 culture.
 As you have appropriately pointed out, Mr. Chairman, a lan-
 guage is a profound form of expressing the individuality of culture,
 and there is no higher compliment one can pay to a person from
 another culture than to show respect for their language by the
 effort to use it, even though this may fall short of the perfection
 that would have been needed in a business situation.
 Beyond this, Mr. Chairman, I touch on a point which I am bound
 to do. I don't know how well recognized but my longstanding advo-

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 cacy of block grants, and that is that there needs to be in my view
 understood the proposition that those block grants that have
 served their original purpose, and have merely contributed to in-
 creasing the clutter of competing, matching grant opportunities
 from the standpoint of the educational administrator or the admin-
 istrator of some office service, ought to give way to, first of all, a
 kind of clearance process designed to shrink down their number
 and then to the understanding that there ought to be a kind of
 last-in, first-out approach maintaining the, more or less, distin-
 guishing categorical grants to be responsive to the most urgent
 needs from a national perspective.
 And so I don't think that the block grant approach, on the one
 hand, should be seen as an approach carrying with it the condem-
 nation of any and all categorical grants, but I see it as a step
 toward simplification of the existing excess, the pruning away of
 that excess, in order then to leave room for a selected number of
 categorical approaches to crticially important needs.
 Given that approach, I would see the categorical program that
 you have described as deserving to be among those programs in a
 much reduced list, with the idea that then at a later date, 5, 10, or
 15 years or periodically, we would look over the roster of categori-
 cal programs and decide which ones of them had sufficiently served
 a stimulatory purpose so that they could be dropped or folded into
 a block grant approach and which new claims and Federal leader-
 ship would justify adding a program in a new area.
 I had some question, Mr. Chairman, with respect to the degree to
 which this program as drafted would have a stimulatory approach,
 particularly in the case of that part of it which provides for a per
 capita amount for students enrolled in excess of 5 percent of the
 existing enrollment.
 Here, as I read it, there is either on the one hand no specific
 device to expand teaching to the extent that an institution could
 qualify on the basis of any numbers of students enrolled is already
 above 5 percent, or it relies wholly on the ability of the Secretary
 to stimulate the institution into doing more through the manner in
 which standards are established and administered.
 The latter is, or the former seems to me a little too loose, and the
 latter could be subject to abuse, and so I would simply flag this as a
 question that might be looked at further in the context of the final
 drafting of the bill itself.
 These are basically my comments, Mr. Chairman.
 [The prepared testimony of Elliot Richardson follows:]
 PREPARED TESTIMONY OF ELLIOT L. RICHARDSON, FORMER AMBASSADOR AT LARGE
 Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support for
 the goals of this legislation. The decline of foreign language instruction at every
 level of our school system and the increasing scarcity of Americans able to commu-
 nicate in any language other than their own is a serious problem that affects our
 national security and economic growth. I support your efforts for these very tangi-
 ble reasons and because I think that an increase in the number of foreign language
 students would be very much in our national interest.
 As United States contact with the rest of the world increases, our trade and
 diplomatic ties with other nations become more complex. To be truly effective in
 promoting our interests, international businessmen and diplomats should speak the
 native tongue of the countries with which they work. But even those Americans
 without a professional or vocational need for foreign language training would bene-
 fit from an increased understanding of another culture.

 When I travel in another country for any length of time, I always try to learn as
 much of its language as I can. Just being able to speak a few sentences in the
 language of your host country is a compliment and a gesture of goodwill. The Ugly
 American is a symbol of a culture which assumes that it is superior and does not
 even attempt to understand or assimilate any other civilization. While English is
 spoken all over the world and most Americans abroad can use it to convey their
 basic needs and ideas, it cannot help us to appreciate fully the social mores and
 philosophy of another land. What does it matter that the United States can make
 its positions and ideas understood to the rest of the world if the world does not
 believe we have an interest in hearing their ideas in return? Our lack of foreign
 language students and speakers has a tremendous psychological and symbolic effect,
 as well as a practical impact, on our dealings with other nations.
 I applaud your initiative, Mr. Chairman, in taking this step towards opening the
 minds of Americans to other languages and cultures. I am bound to say, however,
 that I have a reservation about the fact that we would be adding to an endless
 accumulation of categorical grants. A given number of such programs can effective-
 ly promote specific national priorities but, as their number increases, we reach a
 point where state and local administrators may select from an overly large bunch of
 Federal carrots only those categorical grants which feed the activities which they
 would have undertaken without any special inducement.
 I think that this saturation point was reached long ago. To justify any new
 categorical program we must first reduce the number of grants to an effective level.
 This is the fundamental justification of the block grant proposal that has been
 advanced by President Reagan. Given a limited total of programs addressing critical
 national priorities, it would then be appropriate to include this one among them. To
 keep this system efficient, any newly emergent need would have to displace an
 established program. Adding this foreign language education incentive to the exces-
 sive number of existing grants would be a disservice to your program, Mr. Chair-
 man, and would render it unproductive.
 While I support wholeheartedly the aims behind H.R. 3231, I feel I must question
 certain provisions which might restrain or diffuse its effectiveness. For instance, if I
 read Section 3 correctly, it occurs to me that any university with over 5 percent of
 its students already enrolled in foreign language classes would qualify for a grant
 without further action. Authorizing the Secretary of Education to establish addition-
 al standards could eliminate abuse of the provision but, in general, I feel the bill
 gives him overly broad discretionary powers. I also wonder whether requiring each
 student at a university to devote one eighth of his curriculum to foreign language
 studies is not too strenuous a condition for a federal grant. It could be seen as a
 restraint upon the academic freedom of our educational system. My final concern is
 that the financial incentives for increasing the study of less commonly taught
 foreign languages are not sufficient to encourage raising student participation past
 a level at which the university would need additional faculty or facilities to meet
 the demand.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to share with you and your distin-
 guished colleagues my views on this issue. I hope that your efforts to give our
 country a better chance at communicating with the rest of the world are as success-
 ful as our need is great.
 Mr. SIMON. I appreciate them very much.
 As many titles as you have had, I don't know whether to address
 you as Mr. Secretary, Mr. Ambassador, which do you prefer?
 Mr. RICHARDSON. I answer to any one of them, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Richardson will do all right.
 Mr. SIMON. I have a sensitivity to the categorical proliferation
 problem. I serve on the Budget Committee, in addition to being on
 the Education and Labor Committee.
 I have to say I could not find any other practicable way of
 stimulating our schools to move in this direction other than the
 categorical approach.
 That is why I somewhat reluctantly moved in this direction.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. I would agree with that, Mr. Chairman. If you
 take it as is given that a problem for which primary responsibility
 is vested in State and local agencies is nevertheless of sufficient
 national concern, so that it is important to stimulate a greater
 response to that problem than would otherwise occur.

 You have no real alternative to some form of Federal financial
 encouragement, whether through a demonstration project grant,
 which is essentially what your elementary and secondary schools
 part of the bill would provide, or categorical grant, and I think it is
 a mistake.
 I hope I have already indicated this, to use the undesirable
 consequences of the proliferation of categorical grants as a basis for
 condemning any and all categorical grants.
 The problem with what we have now is that there has been such
 an excess that the stimulatory purpose intended is no longer effec-
 tively served because you are dangling, as I say in my testimony,
 such a language bunch of carrots in front of the State or local
 administrators, that they respond only to the carrots that are of
 interest to them already.
 The result is, therefore, while you have accomplished a resource
 transfer at great expense, you have not stimulated any action that
 would not have occurred anyway. This is in my view a fundamen-
 tal reason why the number should be cut down in order, therefore,
 then to make it possible for the holding out of a specific incentive
 to have a specific response that would not otherwise have occurred.
 Mr. SIMON. I concur in that general approach, and that is what
 we are aiming for here.
 The 5-percent figure you mentioned, frankly, was put in there
 primarily for the community colleges. We face a problem, if you
 were to exclude the community colleges, there is no reason we
 cannot simply say the colleges and universities that require lan-
 guages either for entrance or for graduation, will get this categori-
 cal assistance, period. But what you do then is you almost com-
 pletely exclude the community colleges.
 I am not at all wedded to this particular formula and if someone,
 either one of the witnesses or anyone else, can come up with a
 better approach to how we encourage community colleges, I would
 welcome that. But that is the reason for that particular provision.
 It is one that does offer something of a carrot to the community
 colleges.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. My problem with this, Mr. Chairman, was not
 that it sets the level too low, but that it does not on its face embody
 a stimulatory device.
 If, for example, before enactment of this legislation, the commu-
 nity college or other postsecondary insitutiton happened to have an
 enrollment' in some kind of language course of 90 percent of its
 students, 4 percent of the enrollment would qualify for this per
 capita grant, and they would continue to get it without having
 done any more by way of language teaching than they were al-
 ready doing, so the question I was raising really is, how do you use
 this money in a manner that is more sharply directed at getting a
 response that wouldn't otherwise occur?
 Could you, for example, increase the amount of money per
 capita, but aim it only at or largely at, say, the numbers of stu-
 dents enrolled in language courses above the number enrolled in a
 base year?
 Mr. SIMON. There may be some formula like that we can devise.

 We face the general situation in community colleges which is not
 very encouraging, one out of five community colleges offer no
 foreign languages whatsoever.
 There are, in fact, very few now that reach the 5-percent figure.
 Digressing from the community colleges, we have State universi-
 ties that offer no foreign language, including one in the State of
 Illinois which I find an incredible kind of a thing.
 I am joined by the ranking minority of this subcommittee.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you Mr. Ambassador; it may be that we
 will have to work to keep _5 percent.
 Recently on a trip to the Soviet Union, we had the opportunity of
 'visiting a foreign language institute, and I asked the people there,
 the Soviets, how they interpreted our lack of willingness to learn a
 foreign language and lack of understanding foreign languages and
 so forth, and I asked them to be candid and their response was,
 well, it may just show that you are not interested, and I think, as
 you well know, in the positions that you have held, it may be
 perceived overseas and elsewhere that the United States and the
 people of our country are not as interested as others, if we don't
 devote our resources and talents toward learning other languages
 and other cultures and I find that opposite to what a great number
 of people in this country do feel.
 If we don't show it in our tangible evidence, it is going to be very
 difficult for us to overcome that psychological hurdle.
 I appreciate your coming today, and your testimony and find it
 very worthwhile.
 Mr. SIMON. If I can add one comment to my colleague's state-
 ment, one of the interesting things was to learn right now you get
 a choice of starting a foreign language either in the first or the
 fourth grade, depending on where you live, but starting in the
 1.990's, everyone will start getting a foreign language in the first
 grade, and we are not quite to that point in the United States, to
 put it mildly.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. In fairness to Americans, there is a major
 difference between the situation in the Soviet Union and the situa-
 tion in the United States, as a consequence of, in large measure, of
 the colonizing activities in Great Britain in the 17th, 18th, and
 1.9th centuries.
 I have been serving as the head of the U.S. delegation of the Law
 of the Sea Conference, and this is the largest conference ever held
 in terms of national representation, and indeed, perhaps numbers
 of delegates as well.
 We have had up to 160 countries represented which is just about
 all there are, and even little countries like Andora and San
 Marino, Holy See, spelled S-e-e, I just felt it had oceanic interest.
 It is interesting in that conference, although the formal proceed-
 ings are conducted in the six recognized United Nations languages
 with simultaneous translations, all the serious negotiations have to
 take place in English, because English is the common denominator;
 and if the Russians in that situation didn't know and use English,
 they would be out of it; whereas, we of course, already using
 English, are able to get along all right without having to rely on
 another language, and this is so far true, that it tends to operate as
 a disincentive which is why I distinguished earlier in my testimony
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 between the importance of mastery of language, including many
 different languages for people who will be part of the whole U.S.
 extension of its economic, diplomatic activity around the world.
 The problem here is that if what you need to do is to speak Thai,
 for example, and there are people in our Embassy in Washington,
 and people representing U.S. multinational corporations in Bang-
 kok who should be in a position to speak Thai, but it will not, it
 does not teach them Thai to have started to learn Spanish, let's
 say, in the third grade, but it does, at least, to have started a
 language creates a different psychological attitude toward the proc-
 essing of learning another language.
 I am personally, for example, although I come closest to speaking
 French with any fluency, and I have at one time or another studied
 German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, I guess that is about it.
 I don't speak any of them really at all fluently but come close in
 Spanish, but I have the feeling it would be relatively easy for me to
 learn any of those languages in a few weeks in a situation where I
 needed to know them and I have that feeling largely because I
 have at least had enough exposure early in life to the process of
 learning languages so that it does not intimidate me and the
 adaption of my tongue and the creation of a "foreign" sound does
 not seem to me to be an insurmountable task, and it would seem to
 me this at least is the kind of foundation that would be valuable
 for the first purpose I mentioned earlier, and it would be relevant
 also to the second one, that is, the general cultural respect, and
 that is an early appreciation of any foreign language helps to give
 insight into the inseparable role of language as the expression of
 cultural uniqueness.
 Mr. SIMON. We thank you very much, Mr. Richardson, for being
 here and for your testimony, and for your public service.
 Mr. RICHARDSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. May I
 thank you as a citizen for leadership you and your colleagues on
 this subcommittee are showing in a matter of such national
 urgency.
 Thank you very much.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you. Ambassador Boeker, we thank you for
 letting us interrupt your testimony there. You were just about to
 begin.
 Ambassador BOEKER. Well, with your permission, Mr. Chairman,
 I could just as easily review some of the highlights of my state-
 ment.
 Mr. SIMON. Enter your full statement in the record at this point,
 and you can review some of the highlights.
 [The prepared statement of Paul H. Boeker follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL H. BOEKER, DIRECTOR, FOREIGN SERVICE INSTITUTE,
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Mr. Chairman, I welcome this opportunity to speak about foreign language train-
 ing and its importance to the U.S. Foreign Service. As others have, I want to
 commend the role you are playing in bringing the issue of our country's capabilities
 in foreign languages to the attention of the nation through your writing and other
 initiatives, including these hearings.
 The U.S. Foreign Service has a variety of difficult jobs to carry out overseas. Our
 political officers need a deep understanding of the currents of change in the host
 country's society. Commercial officers have to develop opportunities to promote U.S.
 trade. Military attaches must be intimately familiar with the operational effective-
 ness as well as the political mood of the local military. Public affairs officers need to

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 be particularly persuasive in presenting American policies and accomplishments in
 ways that engage the attention and understanding of foreign audiences. A skill that
 all these officers need if they are to master their jobs is the ability to communicate
 effectively with the people with whom they deal. In the vast majority of embassies
 and consulates, this means doing so in a foreign language.
 In my own overseas assignments, I have seen how the performance of our diplo-
 mats is directly related to their capability in using the local language. I would make
 the same observation about Americans who represent the private sector abroad.
 I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the American educational system has not
 done an adequate job in preparing our citizens to work with foreign languages
 abroad either in government or in business. Even among those students oriented
 toward careers in foreign affairs, language competence is limited. Over the last 20
 years the percentage of new Foreign Service officer candidates with a professional
 level of competence in a foreign language has averaged about 25 percent. This
 limited base has put a heavy responsibility on the Foreign Service Institute to
 provide the necessary training and imposed a significant additional cost on the
 Department. It takes $10,000 in instructional cost to train a U.S. Government
 employee for 44 weeks in an intensive language course at the Foreign Service
 Institute-plus the employee's salary for the period which is also a training cost.
 The Department of State has made a major investment over the past 20 years in
 providing in-service language training to its personnel. Out of a total of 3,681
 Foreign Service officers, 2,820 have a professional level of competence in at least
 one language (in other words about 77 percent). Of these, 911 have such competence
 in two languages; 263 in three; 81 in four. Moreover, before a junior Foreign Service
 officer can receive career tenure, he must now achieve professional competence in
 at least one language.
 To encourage candidates with language backgrounds to apply for the Foreign
 Service, new members of the Service who bring professional level competence with
 them receive additional pay. In addition, officers in Service who can speak lan-
 guages for which there is a critical requirement, receive pay incentives when they
 achieve certain levels of proficiency. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 improves these
 incentives, which in some cases will reach 15 percent of base pay. The Department
 is also at work to implement Section 2207 of the Foregin Service Act, which
 provides for the designation of model foreign language competence posts. At our
 posts in the field, nearly 6,000 U.S. Government employees are studying local
 languages on a part-time basis.
 I believe the Foreign Service Institute has a clear record of accomplishment in
 language training, but we intend to enhance this record in the future. At the
 Institute we are working both to improve the quality of language training and to
 provide it to more U.S. employees. We have undertaken a successful effort to
 integrate more effectively the language studies of our students with an improved
 curriculum in area studies. Our aim is to provide U.S. Government employees going
 abroad with the linguistic and substantive tools to do their jobs.
 We are also applying the concept of training for specific job needs to our full-
 length language courses, which range in length from 5 months to 2 years. This is
 being done by introducing in the courses exercises which simulate accurately the
 work problems that employees will need to solve overseas by using the local lan-
 guage. In preparing these exercises, we are developing key skills such as the ability
 to present a U.S. position on an issue, interview for information, rebut criticism and
 persuade a foregin official. I believe that these simulation exercises, which will be
 introduced during the 1981-82 school year, will represent a signifcant improvement
 in the quality of FSI language training. I also believe that training in specific job-
 relevant language skills is a concept that should have wide appeal to the U.S.
 business and academic communities.
 Another important new program now underway consists of short-term language
 courses ("FAST" courses we call them) designed to meet the needs of employees
 whose overseas jos do not require a full professional level of fluency, but whose
 work effectiveness and morale would be improved by a basic functional knowledge
 of the local language. These courses are also designed for the language needs of
 family members. This is a critical area, since a rewarding experience in living
 abroad for family members can make a profound difference in the performance of
 the employee. We now have language courses of 6 to 10 weeks duration in 14 of the
 most widely spoken languages. These courses prepare students for the specific work,
 logistical, and social situations they will neet overseas. Enrollments in these short
 courses have been high, and student response has been very enthusiastic. We plan
 to expand this program to include other languages and expect to use it to achieve
 over time a significant increase in the number of U.S. personnel overseas with basic
 foreign language facility.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 In this connection, I want to mention that many of FSI's language teaching
 materials are available to the public through the Government Printing Office and
 the National Audio-Visual Center at a modest cost. We believe that these represent
 a significant resource which the nation's schools and colleges can draw on now in
 their language programs. As we develop new materials, as we are now doing with
 the new generation of FAST courses, we intend to assure that the results of this
 development work are also available to the public. FSI is also making a contribution
 to the academic community's language training efforts in the field of testing and
 rating language proficiency. The testing system for measuring speaking competence
 that FSI has developed is now widely used in colleges and schools.
 The Foreign Service Institute's job is different from that of the schools addressed
 by H.R. 3231. Nevertheless, our experience provides some relevant conclusions. Our
 objective is teaching language as a capacity to communicate, not as a branch of
 literature or any particular discipline or field of study. We are continually working
 to provide this communicative capability in the most compact course possible. It
 seems to me that postsecondary schools in particular should provide a similar
 version of foreign language training if it is to be available to those preparing for a
 great variety of professions, with limited time available to acquire the additional
 skill of a competence in a foreign language. Several semesters of grammar and
 reading before something called "conversation" begins are not very attractive to,
 say, a business degree candidate who would like to augment a nearly full course
 "load" in this field with some competence in, say, Spanish or French.
 In general we have found that quality of instruction, over the 45 languages we
 teach, is the most difficult problem and the one most important to maintaining high
 student motivation and achievement. The Institute, therefore, has devoted a great
 deal of its effort to the essentials of maintaining high quality of instruction. Good
 instructors, adequately compensated, continuing training for instructors, continual
 development of imaginative new materials and rigid testing of student achievement
 as a control on individual course quality are the critical elements of our program.
 We have this past year, for example, significantly increased our investment in
 training of our instructors, and we believe the results are already apparent. Lan-
 guage programs in schools face the same problem of maintaining quality instruction
 so that students' motivation and interest are engaged and they are brought as
 quickly as possible to the capacity to communicate that makes the language learn-
 ing experience enjoyable and worthwhile in educational and professional terms.
 I know that this aspect of the problem will be part of the Subcommittee's consid-
 erations.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Ambassador BOEKER. Even in the highlights, I have to repeat by
 tribute to you. Mr. Chairman, because I think it is a sometimes
 lonely, but hopefully not always so, service that you and the sub-
 committee are performing in bringing this issue to the attention of
 our Nation.
 I would like to talk a bit about how our Nation's faulty capabili-
 ties in foreign language impact upon the U.S. Foreign Service and
 its mission.
 People in the U.S. Foreign Service have a great variety of jobs to
 do. They are called upon to be people of all times and seasons, but
 a common element of everything that they do is the need to com-
 municate effectively with the people around the world. In the vast
 majority of our missions overseas, that means doing so in a foreign
 language.
 Our experience is such that we have to agree with your general
 conclusion, Mr. Chairman, that the American educational system
 has not done an adequate job in preparing our citizens to work in
 foreign languages aboard, whether in the Government or in the
 business sector.
 In the U. S. Foreign Service, we see this most dramatically in
 the people coming into the Service, and the foreign language capa-
 bilities they bring with them.
 These capabilities have varied little over the years. We find that
 only 25 percent of the people entering the U.S. Foreign Service
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 have a professional level of competence in any foreign language.
 This limited starting base for our diplomatic service places a very
 heavy responsibility on the Foreign Affairs agencies and the For-
 eign Service Institute to provide the necessary training to our
 people to carry out their jobs. Also it imposes a very significant
 cost on the U.S. Government.
 The primary cost of training is personnel time. It means you
 need higher employment levels and the positions to provide train-
 ing, as well as to staff all of your working jobs at home and abroad.
 Therefore, it becomes especially difficult to increase that personnel
 investment at a time when your overall work force is stagnant or
 declining.
 The Department of State has made a major investment in provid-
 ing in-service language training to its personnel over the last two
 decades. Of a total of 3,700 Foreign Service officers, about 2,800 of
 them have a professional level of competence in at least one lan-
 guage, and many of them have that level of competence in several
 languages.
 In addition to trying to create a system that over time signifi-
 cantly upgrades our capabilities, we have made it a requirement
 that junior officers must achieve professional level of competence
 on one language before they can be tenured as Foreign Service
 officers.
 We have established the system of language-designated positions
 in our posts abroad as a systematic guide to our language require-
 ments overseas. Also we are significantly increasing our invest-
 ment in training time.
 In the 2 coming fiscal years, we expect to increase our overall
 personnel investment in training substantially and by about 30
 percent in language training alone.
 To encourage candidates with language backgrounds to apply for
 the Foreign Service, new members of the Service who bring a
 professional level of competence in foreign language with them
 receive additional starting pay. Second, officers once in the Service,
 who have a professional level of competence in certain critical
 languages which are in short supply receive pay incentives for
 having that particular skill. Under the Foreign Service Act of 1980,
 the amount of those incentives has been increased.
 At the Foreign Serice Institute, we have approximately 2,000
 U.S. Government employees annually studying foreign languages.
 Under our programs, we also finance continuing foreign language
 study at posts overseas for an additional 6,000 U.S. Government
 employees each year.
 Our major effort currently is to increase the quality of our
 training programs and provide them to more U.S. Government
 employees. In our full-length language courses our overriding objec-
 tive is to enhance training for specific jobs needs. Our major new
 vehicle for doing this is that of introducing into all our courses
 exercises that depart considerably from the classic textbook, tape,
 and grammar drill experience.
 These excerise will put people through role plays that accurately
 reproduce the kinds of work problems that they will need to con-
 front and solve overseas in the local language. From now on, in all
 of our language courses, U.S. Government employees preparing to
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 go overseas or to acquire a professional level of competence in a
 language will go through exercises in which they will have to make
 representations of U.S. positions, persuade people to change their
 mind, interview people for set pieces of information, or simply try
 to convey certain specific points which they know, but their listen-
 er does not.
 This kind of demanding, simulated professional exercise should
 significantly increase the capabilities of our people to communicate
 and carry out professional tasks in foreign languages.
 A second program we now have underway consists of a whole
 series of short-term language courses-FAST courses, we call
 them-which are designed to meet the needs of employees whose
 work effectiveness and morale would be significantly improved by
 a basic functional knowledge of the local language.
 We think these courses will be ideal for employees going to
 positions overseas which are not necessarily language-designated at
 a high professional level, but for which they will require some
 language proficiency; the courses are also ideal for a number of
 support staff members and for family members.
 These courses range up to 10 weeks in length, and we now have
 them to cover the 14 most widely spoken languages in the world.
 We expect to expand that over the coming years to cover perhaps
 twice that many.
 These courses are based on learning by going through situations,
 that people will confront in their life and work overseas.
 They are rather dramatically different kinds of courses-with
 much less emphasis on structure and much more on actually trying
 to cope with specific situations that people face in living and work-
 ing overseas.
 We have run these courses several times this year and reviews
 from them are quite enthusiastic. We expect to use them over the
 coming years to achieve a very significant increase in the number
 of U.S. Government employees we send overseas annually who
 have a working facility in the language of the country of their
 assignment.
 Many of the materials that the Foreign Service Institute has
 developed over the last 25 years in its work on language teaching
 are available to the public at a very modest cost through the
 Government Printing Office for books and through the National
 Audiovisual Center for tapes. It is our belief that these materials
 represent a very significant resource for the Nation's schools and
 colleges.
 As we continue with our new materials and, in particular, the
 new generation of FAST courses that we are developing right now,
 we intend to assure that the results of this development work are
 also available to the public at modest cost.
 Another aspect of our work that has already been used widely in
 the academic community is the Foreign Service Institute's testing
 and rating of proficiency in foreign languages. It is a widely accept-
 ed system, and is used by a number of schools to assure that people
 get accreditation for language communications facility actually ac-
 quired, no matter how many hours they spent in the classroom. It
 can be used to significantly upgrade the rewards that one gets for a
 year of study overseas because coming back and testing for your
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 proficiency in a language, you can get a number of credit hours for
 that facility in addition to the credit hours you receive for your
 actual study in the classroom.
 The job of the Foreign Service Institute is different from that of
 the schools addressed in H.R. 3231. Nevertheless, I think our expe-
 rience provides some relevant conclusions, two of which I would
 like to mention.
 First, our objective in teaching language is as a capacity to
 communicate, not as a branch of literature or of any particular
 field of study and it presumes no particular background.
 We are continually working to provide that communicative capa-
 bility in the most compact course possible. Post-secondary schools
 in particular, if they are doing their job, should try to provide a
 similar version of foreign language training, so it can be available
 with a very minimal investment in time to people preparing for
 careers in a great variety of professions, so they don't have to sit
 through semesters of basic grammar, structure, and literature
 before they get to something called communication which might be
 the much more relevant skill to their own profession.
 Our own experience shows that one can teach by going directly
 from the beginning to that communications capacity and get a
 much higher level of achievement earlier.
 In general, we have found that the quality of instruction, over
 the 45 languages that we teach, is the most difficult problem and
 the one most important to maintaining high student motivation
 and achievement.
 The critical elements of our program we have found to be good
 instructors, adequate compensation, and continuing training for
 those instructors, continual development of imaginative new teach-
 ing materials and rigid testing of student achievement as a control
 on individual course quality.
 America's schools face the same problems in maintaining quality
 instructional programs. From that quality comes the maintenance
 of the students' motivation and interest to insure that they are
 engaged and brought as quickly as possible to the capacity to
 communicate that makes the whole experience worthwhile, both
 educationally and professionally. I know this important factor of
 the quality of programs will be part of your considerations as well.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much for your testimony.
 You were here when Mr. Heginbotham testified.
 Ambassador BOEKER. Yes, I was.
 Mr. SIMON. He testified, in 25 years in the Foreign Service, not
 once was he ever encouraged to study the foreign language, and at
 no time did he receive any compensation in, or assistance for the
 foreign language study he did do voluntarily.
 Is it still possible for someone to have 25 years in the Foreign
 Service and have that kind of experience?
 Ambassador BOEKER. No; it is not. First of all, the requirement to
 have professional level proficiency in one foreign language before
 you are tenured, would, in effect, mean an officer, one way or
 another, would have to acquire that proficiency to rise above the

 In addition, there is incentive pay which strongly encourages
 study of hard languages. There is the system of language-designat-
 ed positions; the kind of positions that Mr. Heginbotham or I have
 held overseas are now positions where language proficiency is re-
 quired, and, therefore, people assigned to them are assigned to
 language training in advance of going there. But he was an over-
 achiever, Mr. Chairman, and he could learn that all on the side at
 nights.
 Mr. SIMON. What about the language-designated positions; 67
 percent are now filled? What I am interested in, is that percentage
 increasing, and No. 2, the process by which various positions are
 language-designated, or is it sensible to give as much responsibility
 to an ambassador in a country and as former ambassador yourself,
 you can view it from both perspectives and to have an ambassador
 who, in effect, say ambassadors who say language isn't important.
 We had one country in Africa where we had that precise situa-
 tion up until a few weeks ago.
 Ambassador BOEKER. It is hard for me to imagine. It was my own
 experience not only to give very careful consideration to what
 positions were language designated, but also to insist that people at
 post continue their language training, even though they already
 had enough to meet the LDP designation of their job. I found that
 that was not really difficult. As long as continuing language train-
 ing was encouraged, people felt that the hour every morning could
 be taken. If they had the mission's blessing, they were delighted to
 do it.
 Mr. SIMON. That was kind of an arbitrary decision on your part
 as Ambassador?
 Ambassador BOEKER. It was in my authority to make that deci-
 sion, and I thought that was essential to the work of our mission.
 We did virtually everything we did in Spanish.
 Mr. SIMON. Yes.
 Ambassador BOEKER. The number of people who spoke English
 even at high levels, was very small.
 In effect, I would say all the officer-level personnel and about
 half of the secretarial personnel at my mission had to have some
 knowledge of Spanish to do their job.
 Mr. SIMON. At how many embassies totally that we have would
 you guess that that is the situation?
 Ambassador BOEKER. That would be a judgment one would have
 to make going over them post by post, but a significant number. I
 think certainly in Latin America, for example, Spanish is not only
 the language of the society, but a language they are very proud of
 and a language in which they can communicate with all their
 neighbors. You really can't get anywhere without it.
 In Latin America, that is very definitely the case.
 Mr. SIMON. Isn't that true, that very description you make, true
 of almost all countries? There are exceptions, but, for example, I
 just notice where 13 of 80 of our personnel in Saudi Arabia are
 proficient in Arabic. I would almost think Arabic is essential.
 Ambassador BOEKER. It is very difficult to do many of our jobs
 there without Arabic.
 That really gets to the heart of the resource problem, though,
 because for every person in an Arabic language-designated posi-

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 tion, you are talking about a 2-year investment in training. In
 effect, if people are there on an average 2-year tour, your personnel
 force has to be twice as large.
 It has to be larger by every position you have there that is
 language designated for 3-3 in our terms of proficiency in Arabic.
 That is a very significant personnel cost and a major problem with
 the management of this system.
 The tendency Government-wide has been to go on creating lan-
 guage-designated positions without drawing any implications for
 the work foce. Every time you increase the number of language-
 designated positions, you are, in effect, creating new training posi-
 tions and requiring an increased work force to fill them. To do so
 without changing your work force level creates tensions that are
 very difficult to relieve.
 Mr. SIMON. You were about to show me a graph there.
 Ambassador BOEKER. You had asked about language-designated
 positions. Our record there is improving.
 We now have over 200 more people in language-designated posi-
 tions at a fully qualified level than we did 8 years ago, going up to
 780 officers who are fully qualified for the positions they fill.
 That still leaves us at the 67 percent level that you mentioned.
 In another sense the record is better than that: Inclusion of people
 who are very close to full professional proficiency in the language
 would bring that total to 78 percent.
 These people who are within half a point of the required level
 should be able to reach it after 6 months' experience in country
 and with the help of continuing language training at their posts
 under the past language program.
 Mr. SIMON. One comment.
 You mentioned the quality problem which is a major problem
 and you say good instructors adequately compensated, continuing
 training for instructors, continual development of imaginative new
 materials, and rigid testing and student achievement as a control
 on course quality are critical elements.
 As I look over those criteria, good instructors adequately com-
 pensated, foreign language teachers in the United States are not
 highly paid. Continuing training for instructors, we are doing very
 little. New materials, probably we are doing better there. Rigid
 testing of student achievement, we are doing very well, so in the
 use of your criteria, we have a long way to go.
 Mr. Coleman.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Tonight, there will be a reception in Washington
 for members of the German Parliament. We all talk in English.
 They speak better English than we do, I think.
 One of the things about your program you opened it up to other
 U.S. employees, and I availed myself of the early morning Foreign
 0 Service Institute language courses last semester. I got a lot out of it
 and was trying to brush up on my French.
 When the word got out that a couple of Members were taking
 the course, I heard other Members of the House mention, one that
 didn't know about it, and two, they would like to participate, but it
 seems as if, because of our schedules and our lives and what have
 you, that better time or a better place might be more appropriate,
 and I toss this out as a suggestion, that besides the Foreign Service

 and State Department employees, there is probably no more visible
 traveler to foreign countries than Members of Congress, and if
 those of us who are interested in coming up with a proficiency to
 the degree we can venture out to speak to their leadership in their
 own language, just the intent is enough to win friends and influ-
 ence people, that we try to do this for Members of Congress.
 I notice in my circle of friends that knew about it, I could name
 you five people to get together immediately to start a course. I
 think it is very important and you might consider this. Also, the
 availability to the public of your tapes and your books is a very
 well kept secret. I didn't know about it until after I took the
 course, and if there is some way that we could justify a little bit of
 advertising in this area, there would be a lot of people do it on
 their own.
 I had to go to the Government Printing Office over at State to
 find out that they actually sold the tapes publicly. Of course,
 members of the class, we ran our own tapes off on the machines,
 but that would be a great opportunity for a lot of people to expand
 your influence and also help the problem.
 Ambassador BOEKER. Let me first commend your Spartan
 achievement.
 Mr. SIMON. When I visited there, you mentioned, I think, four
 Members of Congress. I regret to say I was not among them, Tom
 Coleman, Paul Tsongas, I believe, Charles Mathias?
 Ambassador BOEKER. And Congresswoman Ferraro, of New York.
 Mr. SIMON. And Robert Garcia.
 Ambassador BOEKER. I believe over the past year, we have had 12
 different people from the Congress taking language instruction, but
 we would be delighted to have you.
 We offer this and we are very glad to do it. Certainly, if it would
 be more convenient to Members of Congress to get together in
 groups at a different location or even individually, we would be
 glad to respond.
 We just want to get you away from the phone in your office
 during language classes. That is all.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Wonderful.
 Ambassador BOEKER. We have tried to get the Government Print-
 ing Office to make the availability of Foreign Service Institute
 tapes and texts as widely known as possible but publication of
 wares available from the Government Printing Office is not some-
 thing that is a high priority at the moment for them.
 Unfortunately, I think the availability of these tapes and books
 has been broadcast more widely by the private sector than by the
 Government itself. There are a number of private outfits that do
 acquire our tapes and books and sell them for four times the cost.
 They advertise widely.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Right; the first ad I saw was in the New Yorker
 with an outfit for Spanish and French, which said, this is the same
 course given to our Foreign Service officers.
 Ambassador BOEKER. It is annoying to me personally that many
 taxpayers are paying about four times as much as they need to for
 these materials developed by their Government.
 Mr. SIMON. Could you talk to members of your staff and to
 others in the State Department and say you are being pushed by

 this subcommittee, which you are, and to make known a little
 more widely what is available, and that we would like, within 60
 days, to get some kind of response from you on this?
 Ambassador BOEKER. We shall do that and make sure you get
 such a response.
 Mr. SIMON. Well, we thank you, sir, very, very much for your
 testimony and the job you are doing in the Foreign Service. It is
 terrific.
 Ambassador BOEKER. Thank you.
 Mr. SIMON. Our next witnesses are on a panel, Dr. Rose Hayden,
 the Executive Director of the National Council on Foreign Lan-
 guage and International Studies, and one of the more, probably the
 most prolific writers in this field in the Nation, and Dr. O. Le-
 Grand Eliason.

 Mr. SIMON.  Forgive me. He is president of Eliason International,

 [The prepared testimony of Earl McGrath follows:]
 PREPARED TESTIMONY OF EARL J. MCGRATH, FORMER U.S. COMMISSIONER OF EDU-
 CATION AND PRESENTLY CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF ADVISERS, WESTERN INTERNATION-
 AL UNIVERSITY, PHOENIX, ARIZ.
 At the very outset, Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate you and your nine
 colleagues for introducing H.R. 3231. May I also put in the record, Mr. Chairman,
 the studied opinion that your recently issued book, "The Tongue-Tied American," is
 one of the most convincing briefs for instruction in foreign languages that I have
 read in my professional experience. It ought to be read not only by educators, but by
 thoughtful citizens in all walks of life who are concerned about our economic and
 cultural position in today's world.
 On this occasion, I address you as a former officer of the government and as a
 private citizen who has visited over a score of foreign countries where English is not
 the native tongue. I wish to endorse without reservation the statement of purpose in
 your bill "to further the national security of the United States and the nation's
 economy by providing grants for foreign language programs." To discuss the subject
 in full would require more time than we have on this occasion. The three topics you
 mention in your letter of invitation will, however, enable me to express my thoughts
 on the provisions in the bill.
 First, my experience with our language failures. If you will pardon a personal
 reference, I would like to relate my experience as the chairman of a U.S. delegation
 of five at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. Duplicates of this experience, and other
 valuable information in this important subject are presented by Nick Thimmesch in
 the February, 1981, issue of Reader's Digest. The Geneva conference was attended
 by representatives of over fifty nations. The two official languages of the meeting
 were English and French. Except the members of our delegation, all of whom had
 had an extensive higher education, I met no one, even those from countries with
 limited opportunity for higher education, who could not use a language other than
 his own. The most embarrassing experience occurred when I observed the language
 facility of the chairman of the Egyptian delegation. From the conference floor he
 spoke intermittently English and French. With the delegates of Germany, he used
 their tongue. And naturally he spoke Arabic. Whatever its other notable achieve-
 ments, and they are many, our educational system had failed to prepare its careful-
 ly selected representatives for direct communication on matters of international
 importance.
 Returning home, as United States Commissioner of Education, with the help of
 officers of the Modern Language Association, I organized two national meetings
 here in Washington. As studies referred to in your book conclusively show, Mr.
 Chairman, those who learn any language at an early age most easily achieve
 fluency and a proper accent in its use. Since at the time language instruction was
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 rarely offered in elementary schools and not required for a diploma in many high
 schools, I stressed the need for action at those two levels.
 To my gratification, these conferences were attended by several hundred persons,
 not exclusively educators, but also representatives of several branches of govern-
 ment, notably the State and Commerce Departments and executives of commerce
 and industry. The participants in these sessions exhibited intense interest in in-
 creasing the study of languages. The non-educators especially expressed a desire to
 support efforts to make American citizens internationally more knowledgeable and
 capable of using languages other than their own.
 In the years immediately following 1952, reports of the Modern Language Associ-
 ation showed a sharp rise in the number of school systems offering language
 courses, and a corresponding rise in interest in colleges and universities. For rea-
 sons to complex to treat here, this swift burgeoning of instruction in foreign lan-
 guages became dwarfed over the intervening years. For financial reasons, some
 public school systems have since dropped such instruction in the elementary and
 high school grades, and many colleges which for a century or more had imposed
 such requirements have abandoned them. The cultural and vocational inadequacies
 resulting from these policies have now become threateningly clear. The situation
 imperatively needs the thoughtful attention and civic action of all citizens.
 Whatever failures have occurred in providing adequate foreign language instruc-
 tion for Americans cannot fairly be attributed to teachers of these subjects. Since
 the Second World War, the universities have produced a corps of teachers compe-
 tent in the idiomatic use of languages and skilled in the cultivation of language
 skills at all levels of our educational system. What we need to correct the present
 deficiences is an aroused public opinion among citizens in all walks of life. The
 passage of this legislation could be instrumental in calling attention to existing
 inadequacies.
 Second, Mr. Chairman, I wish to focus my remarks on the internationally strate-
 gic and economic importance of having citizens well-versed in the everyday use of
 languages. Consider first the ecomonic value of foreign language study to the
 individual student. Enrollment figures and studies of student interests show that
 many young people are avoiding instruction in the humanities, especially languages.
 Many do this on the assumption that those who are intensively, but narrowly,
 trained in business subjects will be assured of preferred vocational treatment. I do
 not depreciate programs in the field of business. I wish to point out, however, that
 those who supplement career-oriented instruction with skill in foreign languages
 will find a host of vocational doors open to them that would otherwise be closed.
 College students today are not sufficiently informed about the career opportuni-
 ties available to those who achieve competence in their major field and also facility
 in a foreign tongue. Business executives confirm the opinion that many of their
 corporations need the services of personnel in marketing their products abroad.
 Representatives of industry, commerce, and education can serve their own organiza-
 tions, our people generally, and especially ambitious young people, by informing
 students in our schools and colleges of these opportunites. By doing so they will not
 only benefit youth. They will perform an indispensable public service.
 Members of the Congress know better than I that the health of our economic
 system will depend upon a more equitable balance of trade than now prevails
 between the United States and other nations. To a not inconsiderable extent, the
 openness of foreign markets will depend upon the effective communication of our
 business representatives in selling our products abroad. Person to person relation-
 ships and the attitudes of other nationals toward us may be the decisive factor in
 making sales. That these attitudes are affected by the easy and precise use of
 another's language is indisputable. We cannot hope to have a healthy economy at
 home without the understanding and trust of business men in other countries.
 Hence, those interested in preserving the merits of our free enterprise system on an
 international scale can do so by improving commerce between our country and
 other nations. At the same time, the resultant sale of our products can contribute to
 the economic well-being of our people. Knowledge of foreign languages can help in
 these efforts and the Congress can play an imporant part in achieving these goals
 by enacting H.R. 3231. Even more important than the economic benefits it would
 produce is the strategic value in increasing the likelihood that civilization as we
 know it can be preserved.
 No thoughtful observer of the international scene today can doubt that the
 human enterprise is in danger of destruction. While military build-up may be
 essential, while parity or even superiority may temporarily engender a feeling of
 security, in the long run only understanding among the peoples of the world can
 assure their survival. Informed scientists and military leaders agree that already
 both the United States and Russia have arsenals of nuclear weaponry sufficient to
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 destroy virtually all life on this globe, and the end results will be the same no
 matter which adversary makes the first strike. Moreover, many other nations will
 soon be adequately equipped to initiate, if not complete, such a holocaust. No matter
 how much of the worlds productive capacity and human ingenuity are spent in
 armed defense, the effort will be futile unless it is continuously paralleled by
 unrelenting efforts by members of the human family to achieve common under-
 standing and common goals. Such objectives could, of course, be attained more
 easily if we all talked in one tongue, but we don't. Yes, the resolution of issues and
 problems will require not only competence in the use of other languages, but insight
 into subtle cultural differences-ignorance of which presently erect formidable bar-
 riers to understanding and the rational reconciliation of national differences.
 Mr. Chairman, some may consider this digression into the larger subject of
 national, indeed human, destiny to be irrelevant to the teaching of foreign lan-
 guages. To be sure, there are many other compelling reasons for such instruction. It
 can lead to great satisfactions, including the gaining of insights into other ways of
 life, other philosophies, other ageless literatures, other value systems and other
 spiritual commitments. There is an abundant literature on all these outcomes of the
 study of foreign languages. None, however, exceeds in importance the potential
 benefits in international understanding and lasting peace.
 For these reasons, I consider H.R. 3231 a strategically important piece of legisla-
 tion. If enacted, as I hope, it will accomplish these things:
 1. It's passage will signalize to educators and others throughout the nation that as
 a people we recognize the cultural, the economic, and the strategic importance of
 skill in the use of foreign tongues. Parenthetically, I should like to observe that we
 need instructional programs in language not now commonly found in the school
 systems such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and others which will be needed in
 business transactions and in diplomatic relations.
 2. The bill will strengthen the efforts of educators in the states and in local
 communities in their advocacy of additional programs of foreign language instruc-
 tion. In this connection, I wish a copy of "The Tongue-Tied American  could be
 distributed to every local school system and every college and university in the
 country in order to stir up the most vigorous discussion of this subject. In all
 modesty, I wish tha the national meetings I initiated in the early fifties could be
 duplicated today. I feel confident that with vigorous leadership, such efforts would
 result in a wide response and highly fruitful results.
 3. The bill would attract the moral and fiscal support of the business world for
 such programs.
 4. The bill would indirectly open new occupational opportunities for American
 youth and thus contribute to their economic well-being and their enjoyment of the
 satisfactions of foreign travel and experiences in different cultures.
 5. The bill will not only contribute significantly to our national economic strength
 but to our soical and political position of leadership in the world.
 In conclusion, I wish to comment very briefly on several provisions of the bill. It
 does not require the federal government to assume the total financial responsiblity,
 or even a large part of it, necessary to launch and sustain these efforts. It can,
 however, call immediate attention dramatically and convincingly to the related
 national educational needs and the intiatory efforts required to fulfill them. Long-
 run support is left to local educational units where, in our tradition, it properly
 belongs. But this fractional government aid would, I believe, initiate a lasting
 development of beneficial activities at all levels of our educational system. These in
 turn would have a fateful affect on our national destiny and perhaps on our fellow
 human beings everywhere. I hope, therefore, that the Congress will act favorably on
 this promising legislation.
 Mr. SIMON. Dr. Hayden, pleasure to welcome you here.
 STATEMENT OF ROSE L. HAYDEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NA-
 TIONAL COUNCIL ON FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND INTERNA-
 TIONAL STUDIES
 Ms. HAYDEN. I am Rose Hayden, newly appointed executive di-
 rector or the National Council on Foreign Language and Interna-
 tional Studies.
 I am especially happy to be here today given the fact that
 Congressman Simon is a member of our council, which was estab-
 lished in 1980 upon the recommendation of the President's Com-
 mission on Foreign Language and International Studies.
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9

 Created as a joint effort by private foundations, business corpora-
 tions, and government agencies, the council is a nonprofit organiza-
 tion focusing public attention on the crucial importance to the
 United States of effective communication with and comprehensive
 understanding of the world beyond our borders.
 The primary task of the council is to make a coherent, persua-
 sive, and persistent case that high-quality foreign language and
 international studies are truly vital to America's future.
 Council members are distinguished citizens from various walks of
 life and different regions of the country who share a concern that
 the present decline of foreign language and international studies
 endangers our national well-being-our security, our commercial
 competitiveness, and the quality of our educational system.
 Finally, the council's interests encompass all elements of lan-
 guage and international studies in the United States: Advanced
 training and research; overseas study; global awareness; primary,
 secondary and collegiate education; citizen and community educa-
 tion; and the needs of business, labor and Government.
 In sum, the council strives to prove to the general public and to
 policymakers alike that, indeed, the future is now and that our
 national needs can be more adequately served through foreign
 language and international competencies.
 In my remarks this morning, I will not repeat the excellent
 insights and suggestions which have already been presented by
 others, and will be the focus of other testimony today.
 Rather, let me state, at the outset, that H.R. 3231 represents a
 necessarily ambitious response to an endemic national challenge-
 that of assuring America's viability in a global system which is as
 complex as it is unstable.
 The overwhelming fact of international life is this: Americans
 must know more about the rest of the world, or we will be increas-
 ingly at the mercy of peoples and nations whose languages we do
 not speak, and whose realities and motives are a mystery to us.
 As Clifton R. Wharton, Jr., chancellor of the State University of
 New York, and national council member observed, we can be disen-
 franchised by ignorance. Often we are content to be served by
 cadres of technicians and specialists who thereby gain an ominous
 amount of control over our lives.
 A recent futurist tract argued that our fear and ignorance about
 prevailing technologies put us in danger of becoming modern-day
 serfs-techno-peasants. One could extend the analogy and argue
 with some justification that our fear and ignorance about other
 peoples, languages, and cultures places us in equal danger of disen-
 franchising ourselves, of becoming globo-peasants whose lives are
 deeply affected by world events, but whose individual capacity to
 shape those events is virtually nil.
 Truly our professional interests in foreign language education
 have never been more compatible and more visible to an ever-
 growing segment of our population. The recent election and subse-
 quent developments suggest very strongly that the United States is
 entering a marked phase in its national history in which the most
 dynamic and consistent areas of Federal policy formulation are
 likely to be in the foreign affairs and defense fields and in overall
 economic policy-particularly those aspects relating to the control

 Well, up there to the north I got about 200 yards, and over there to the west I got
 50 yards, and there to the east about another 75 yards, and down there to the south
 I got about 200. How big a farm you got?
 And the Texan said, "Well, my friend, my spread is so big that I
 can get into my car in the morning at sunup and drive all day
 long, and at sunset I'm still not at the end of my land."
 "Ayup," replied the Vermonter, "I once had a car like that."
 So times really have changed.
 Someone once said that an optimist builds castles in the sky, a
 dreamer lives there, and a realist collects rent from both of them.
 Let us work with you and the Congress to make sure that we
 actually get to move into this particular castle.
 of inflation, to reindustrialization, to energy self-sufficiency, and to
 export promotion.
 The challenge to the foreign language field is to deepen the
 emerging links between international and foreign language studies
 within educational establishmnts, and through this difficult but
 necessary integration, thus serve our national needs for a more
 secure and economically viable future.
 With respect to national security, estimates are that America's
 defense expenditures will increase by about $1.3 trillion in the next
 5 years. Yet the resources to assure brainpower as well as firepow-
 er are not similarly forthcoming. Thus, the signal importance of
 H.R. 3231 is that despite the disappointing record of our Govern-
 ment with respect to funding foreign language, international stud-
 ies, and exhanges, H.R. 3231 dramatically encourages foreign lan-
 guage study at all levels and restates an essential Federal respon-
 siblitiy to support such programs in the national interest.
 With respect to economics, between 1950 and 1979, American
 exports increased from $10 billion to $175 billion, and American
 assets abroad grew from $19 billion to $377 billion. Foregin direct
 investments in the United States rose from $3.4 billion to $40.8
 billion. The net impact of all this on the man in the street is that
 1-in-7 manufacturing jobs in this country is directly dependent on
 foreign trade, and that 1-in-3 acres produces food for export.
 Yet we could be doing a whole lot better if you consider that
 there are 300,000 firms in the United States, and only 250 of these
 firms account for well over 80 percent of Amercia's exports. If we
 hope to export more in the future, it is axiomatic that we master
 the languages of the buyer.
 Having noted that on the one hand, the times are propitious for
 integrating national and professional agendas, it is only fair to note
 that, on the other hand, foreign language educators enter the
 public arena at just that time when the mood is one of deepest
 concern with America's fiscal circumstances.
 Times have indeed changed, and it will be necessary for the field
 to realize that if there ever was a good old days phase, we are no
 longer in one-the point of this anecdote about a Texas rancher
 and a Vermont farmer, a true metaphor for educators in the
 1980's:
 It seems that a Texan was visting some relatives in Vermont and came up on a
 farmer who lived nearby, and they started to talk. "Well, my friend," said the
 Texan, "how big a spread your got here?"
 The Vermonter responded slowly:

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 H.R. 3231 is not intended to provide a comprehensive answer to
 all of the endemic problems of foreign language and international
 studies, but it does include these needed elements:
 One, H.R. 3231 ties American foreign language competence to
 America's military, political and economic security and future via-
 bility;
 Two, in section 2, the emphasis is on those constitutionally re-
 sponsible for the provision of educational services-the States. As
 .,such, by funding model local projects through the State educational
 agencies, H.R. 3231 respects, embodies and energizes the so-called
 "new federalism." Cost and responsibilities are truly shared;
 Three, alternative instructional modes are stressed, as is access
 to quality language instruction. If it remains true that one in five
 high schools offers no instruction in any foreign language, modern
 or ancient, then H.R. 3231 plays a needed role in assuring equal
 educational opportunity, open access to all students to attain a
 vocationally as well as personally valuable foreign language skill;
 Four, section 3 enhances the prospects that more postsecondary
 institutions will require foreign language instruction of students;
 and
 Five, study beyond the entry-level years is furthered in this bill.
 Without going into detail, suffice it to say that a creative and
 necessary partnership has evolved between the public and private
 sectors with respect to H.R. 3231. This partnership must be
 strengthened so that these necessary steps will be taken.
 One, public and political support must be registered so that H.R.
 3231 is both passed and appropriated; and
 Two, administrative officials and representatives of the foreign
 language teaching professional groups must collaborate in the
 design of effective guidelines for the use of any funds. In such a
 fashion, proficiency, quality and continuity of effort will be natural
 consequences of programming funded under the aegis of this bold
 new bill.
 Mr. Chairman, in conclusion let me focus on the three areas
 which you posed. You asked first about my own experience with
 languages. My experience with = our language failures is, of course,
 deeply personal. As the eldest daughter of immigrant parents, I
 was taught that the maintenance of my parents' mother tongue
 was a social liability in this country, a mark of inferior social
 status.
 As a high school student, I was required to take a foreign lan-
 guage sequence to be in the college-bound curriculum. Luckily, an
 excellent Spanish teacher and an overseas experience as a Red
 Cross volunteer in Chile in 1960 propelled me to a fluency level
 and degree of interest not typical of the general student.
 As an undergraduate, my interests waned in that the literary
 approach in the language department was not useful to me, and
 the attitude of the professors was often repugnant to boot.
 After graudate school, I both taught and used my Spanish and
 Portuguese, moved on to administrative duties in the university,
 and then on to language-related assignments such as that of
 Deputy Director for Latin America and the Caribbean for the peace
 Corps.

 Forgive the autobiography, but in terms of my own lifelong
 involvement with foreign languages, I can say that an excellent
 teacher, an overseas experience, a vocational need, and a personal
 joy in being able to communicate with others in their language and
 on their terms has been uniquely rewarding.
 Naturally, I am describing an ideal situation, but I still believe
 that access to quality instruction at all levels, plus an emphasis on
 the utility and personal enrichment of foreign language proficiency
 are keys to future student motivation and subsequent performance.
 You also asked for my comments on the strategic and economic
 importance of having citizens well-versed in languages. My answer
 has been included, at least obliquely, in the text of my comments.
 With your permission, I would like to insert a recent article and
 speech for the record, both of which provide a more adequate
 statement of need.
 Mr. SIMON. It will be inserted in the record.

 THE FUTURE IS NOW: SERVING NATIONAL NEEDS
 (Remarks by Dr. Rose Lee Hayden presented at the May, 1981 meeting
 of the Northeast Conference. Dr. Hayden, former Staff Director of
 U.S. Government Exchanges Policy in the International Communication
 Agency, is now the Executive Director of the National Council on
 Foreign Language and International Studies.)
 To quote Jacquin's Postulate on democratic government:  No
 man's life, liberty or property are safe while the legislature is
 in session." This has always been particularly true when the topic
 of legislative attention has been foreign language and international
 studies support. At just this moment in our national history when
 the world is so tightly wired together that a short circuit could
 fry all of us, support for foreign language and international studies
 once again experiences underwhelming increases and an uncertain
 future in these budget-cutting times.
 It is surely appropriate that I am with you today, my last
 official day of service in Washington, D.C. as the soon-to-be former
 Staff Director of U.S. Government Exchanges Policy in the International
 Communication Agency. The reason that this is so is that I am about
 to begin a most challenging assignment as Executive Director of the
 National Council on Foreign Language and International Studies. The
 National Council, as you know, was established in 1980 upon the
 recommendation of the President's Commission on Foreign Language and
 International Studies. Created as a joint effort by private foundations,
 business corporations, and government agencies, the Council is a non-
 profit organization focusing public attention on the crucial importance

 to the United States of effective communication with and comprehensive
 understanding of the world beyond our borders. The primary task of
 the Council is to make a coherent, persuasive, and persistent case that
 high-quality foreign language and international studies are truly vital
 to America's future. Council members are distinguished citizens from various
 walks of life and different regions of the country who share a concern
 that the present decline of foreign language and international studies
 endangers our national well-being -- our security, our commercial
 competitiveness, and the quality of our educational system. Finally,
 the Council's interests encompass all elements of language and
 international studies in the United States: advanced training and
 research; overseas study; global awareness; primary, secondary and
 collegiate education; citizen and community education; and the needs
 of business, labor and government. In sum, the Council strives to
 prove to the general public and to policy-makers alike that indeed,
 the future is now and that our national needs can be more adequately
 served through foreign language and international competencies.
 In my remarks this morning, I will not repeat the excellent
 insights and suggestions which appear in your conference volume. In
 all of my professional life, I have never been more impressed with
 the intellectual preparation and sensible approach of any group as
 much as I have been favorably oriented by your own, the Northeast
 Conference. I congratualte the authors and editors for an outstanding
 job, and salute all of you for participating in what promises to be

 a first-rate, timely and exceptionally interesting conference. This
 morning I prefer to concentrate on the politics of the field of
 foreign language and international studies in the sense of presenting
 the case in the national interest, and will conclude by citing some
 promising developments in the field itself.
 Truly, our professional interests in foreign language education
 have never been more compatible and more visible to an ever-growing
 segment of our population. The recent election and subsequent develop-
 ments suggest very strongly that the United States is entering a
 marked phase in its national history in which the most dynamic and
 consistent areas of federal policy formulation are likely to be in
 the foreign affairs and defense fields and in overall economic
 policy -- particularly those aspects relating to the control of
 inflation,  to reindustrialization,  to energy self-sufficiency, and
 to export promotion. Our challenge as a field is to deepen the
 emerging links between international and foreign language studies
 within educational establishments, and through this difficult but
 necessary integration, thus serve our national needs for a more secure
 andbeconomic ally;;viabl8.- ilu.ture.;;Yes, I will turn to specifics
 shortly.
 Having noted that on the one hand, the times are propitious for
 integrating national and professional agendas, it is only fair to note,
 on the other hand, that foreign language educators enter the public
 arena at just that time when the mood is one of deepest concern with
 America's fiscal circumstances. Times have indeed changed, and it will be

 necessary for the field to realize that if there was ever a "good old
 days" phase, we are no longer in one - the point of this anecdote about
 a Texas rancher and a Vermont farmer, a true metaphor for educators in
 the 1980's:
 A Texan was visiting some relatives in Vermont and came
 upon a farmer who lived nearby and they started to talk.
 "Well, my friend," said the Texan, "how big a spread you
 got here?" The Vermonter responded slowly, "Well, up there
 to the north I got about 200 yards, and over there to the
 west I got 50 yards, and other there to the east about
 another 75 yards,and down there to the south I got about
 200. How big a farm you got?" And the Texan said, "Well, my
 friend, my spread is so big that I can get into my car in
 the morning at sun-up and drive all day long and at sunset
 I'm still not at the end of my land." "Ayup," replied the
 Vermonter, "I once had a car like that."
 Things have changed, and the following no doubt applies to our own
 as well as other fields of endeavor; an optimist builds castles in
 the sky... a dreamer lives there... a realist collects rent from
 both of them. We must transform ourselves from tenants into landlords,
 from dreamers into realists, I suppose, to meet the challenge of
 developing our programs in an age of fiscal weariness.
 It is time to spend a few moments now outlining why our topic
 is in fact central to America's national security, political and
 educational interests, and what professionals can do about the
 decline of foreign language and international studies programs in
 the past decades. The following facts, appearing in the May, 1981
 issue of Harpers, in the section entitled "The Public Record" cannot
 be calmly absorbed by either patriot or cynic:
 ? The United States continues to be the only country in
 the world where you can graduate from college without
 having had one year of a foreign language prior to and
 during the university years.
 ? If China's Deng Xiaoping had not brought his own inter-
 nrator with  hi,  fnr hie Aie........_..-_

 his negotiations may well have gone uncomprehended given
 the fact that the U.S. government does not employ anyone
 fully qualified to simultaneously interpret from Chinese
 to English.
 ? Fewer than ten people in this country know any of the
 languages of Soviet Central Asia. Only two or three of
 them have sufficient experience and scholarly background
 to serve our government.
 ? In the Soviet Union, there are almost ten million students
 of English, but there are only 28,000 students of Russian
 in the United States.
 ? At the height of the Iranian crisis, only one Western
 reporter could speak Farsi at the time, and he represented
 the BBC.
 ? Only one out of twenty of our high school students studies
 French, German, or Russian beyond the second year, and of
 our eleven million or so U.S. students enrolled in higher
 education, fewer than one percent study languages which are
 used by three-quarters of the world's population.
 o A Roper Poll last year revealed that forty-nine percent of
 Americans surveyed believed that foreign trade was either
 irrelevant or harmful to the United States, despite the
 fact that one of seven manufacturing jobs relies on such
 trade, and one of three of our acres of land produces for
 export.
 ? A 1977 survey of all the collegiate schools of business in
 the United States revealed that of close to 4,000 PhD and
 DBA graduates, fewer than ten percent had ever taken a
 course related to international business.
 ? Pan American had to interview 16,000 applicants in 1977
 to fill forty flight attendant positions. Almost seventy
 percent of the applicants were rejected because of insufficient
 language skills.
 ? Of all our students spending an academic year studying overseas,
 over eighty percent are in Canada or Europe, yet close to
 eighty percent of the world's population resides in Latin
 America, Asia, and Africa. In terms of study abroad students,
 Latin America attracts about eight percent, seven percent go
 to Asia, and Africa receives an underwhelming zero percent.

 ? The Tax Fairness Committee last year estimated that the
 United states loses about five percent of its overall trade
 potential given business' heavy reliance on hiring foreign
 nationals to represent subsidiaries around the world. Our
 economy, however, is increasingly dependent on successful
 international competition, and a greater and greater per-
 centage of our GNP is tied up in importing and exporting.
 Thus, in 1960, we exported about five percent of our GNP
 and imported about  four  percent, while in 1980, we
 exported thirteen percent and imported twelve. If this trend
 continues, even in part, it is not difficult to imagine the
 size of this effort by the end of this century.
 Leaving the pedagogical issuesto you at this conference, I would
 like to focus on business today. Are we prepared, as educators, to meet
 America's national challenge of promoting trade? Certainly not if
 Professor Ricks' bevy of business blunders is allowed to continue. Just
 listen to this:
 ? Most blunders spring from cultural misunderstandings.
 A baby food company, with a picture of a healthy little
 baby on the jar, learned that some illiterate people
 depend on the package to tell them just what is inside.
 In this case, they assumed they were being sold ground-
 up baby and were understandably reluctant buyers.
 ? An American hamburger chain decided that they would extend
 their dealings in Munich. To determine where to place the
 facility, they surveyed frequently traveled sections of
 that German city. When the fast food operation was ready
 to open, anxious employees braced themselves for a hungry
 horde that never arrived. It seems that company officials
 never asked just why that section of the city was so popular.
 Too late they learned that a popular brothel was just down
 the street. Quote:"A lot of people were passing by, but they
 weren't interested in hamburgers."
 ? In yet another German incident, "Come Alive With Pepsi"
 was translated "Come Alive Out of the Grave with Pepsi."
 Again, the advertising effect was not appealing.
 ? General Motors had difficulty marketing its Chevrolet NOVA
 in its Latin American dealerships until they changed its
 name. The reason is simple -- NOVA when spoken sounds like
 "No va" in Spanish which means "it doesn't run."

 e The Parker Pen Company once inadvertently advertised that
 one-of ....its:'products_helped~_to prevent unwanted preg-
 nancies when what it meant to say was that leaks and
 stains and unwanted embarrassment would be avoided.
 It is perplexing, to me at least, that business rhetoric about
 the importance of language and area skills does not in any consistent
 fashion match business hiring practices. That businessmen are increasingly
 sympathetic to our cause was revealed in a recent survey conducted by
 Westchester Community College. Company executives that lived in the County
 were surveyed as to their thoughts on the value of learning foreign
 languages, and their response was enthusiastic and supportive. I urge
 you to obtain a copy of the survey for use with your school boards,
 with parents, and with administrators happy to cut language programs
 in these difficult monetary times.
 One often is exposed to nonsense when analyzing,why it is that
 the United States chooses not to learn foreign languages. One of the
 most ridiculous prevailing prejudices is that somehow.people from other
 nations are born with a unique genetic code that enables them to unravel
 other languages with ease, while Americans simply lack the native ability
 to learn about other peoples, cultures and languages. Baloney. Other
 nations and peoples are more successful because they are motivated to
 learn other languages, they invest in instruction, and students spend
 a whole lot of time dedicating themselves to some degree of mastery.
 That-people in other lands have different attitudes toward language
 learning is obvious. One motivation is certainly to learn English or
 another world-use language. Language acquisition is often tied to social
 mobility. In the United States, speaking a second language, the languages
 of immigration, was often considered a mark of inferior social status.

 ]Finally, other educational systems are not as comprehensive as ours.
 Most systems are highly elitist, with distinct tracks for those who
 will lead and those who will follow. Our system is one of the few
 in which so many persons have access to education at all levels. The
 real challenge to all of us is to assure that there is access and
 that instruction is excellent. One need not be labeled an "elitist"
 to insist on proficiency and standards in language learning.
 Other nations have something to teach us about second-language
 acquisition. This is not the place to enter into discussions of com-
 parative educational practices, but the language teachers of this
 nation represent part of an international guild dedicated to one of
 the most frustrating and difficult tasks in the curriculum. If only
 some of the Japanese enthusiasm could rub off on our students. Did you
 know that during a baseball game between two Japanese teams, the broadcast
 was being sent out in English and in Japanese? The viewers called in
 saying it was great to be able to watch the game and be able to practice
 their English. Can you imagine just what would break loose in this country
 if the Super Bowl was beamed out in Russian or German or Spanish, let
 alone in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese or Swahili? Also, an American woman
 was accosted in her hotel lobby by three young Japanese medical students
 who didn't want to play doctor. They wanted to buy her a drink and to
 practice their English.
 Congressman Paul Simon once surveyed 74 nations to see what languages
 were required in schools around the world. Even countries like Botswana
 require more languages by the fourth grade than we require altogether.

 To get into a university in Austria, you must have eight years of living
 foreign language plus four years of Latin. In the Arab Emirates, English
 is required from fifth through twelfth grades, while in Egypt, starting
 in the sixth grade, six years of English study are required. Honduras
 expects its students to fulfill a five-year foreign language requirement,
 India has a complex system requiring all students to study two languages
 other than the mother tongue. The Swedes, contrary to American opinion
 that they are born that way, have studied nine full years of English
 by the time they graduate from high school, and have also studied
 either French or German from grade seven on. Almost all Soviet students
 take one foreign language in high school, one is required for university
 graduation, and a second or third foreign language is required in
 graduate school. In the United States, one in five high schools does
 not offer instruction in any language - modern or ancient. Requirements
 have fallen off, and competence is laughable.
 Let me conclude this section of my remarks by making a simple
 statement: Americans need to know about the rest of the world or we
 are going to be increasingly at its mercy. Despite George Washington's
 warning about entangling alliances, where else but in America could
 you watch a bicentennial minute, sponsored by a Dutch oil company on
 a Japanese television set? At least five reasons for enhancing our
 competence, for closing the gap between our educational system and
 the national interest come to mind:
 - The first reason we Americans must globalize education
 is elemental - survival. We must sustain informed connections
 in order to survive in a competitive and nuclear system.
 -- The second reason is humanitarian. If the "haves" of this
 world do not care and share, we will have little claim to
 self-decency. We will also live in an even more unsrahla

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 The third reason for attempting, through education, to
 relate to.,aUl.peaples and cultures is an inherently selfish
 as opposed to alturistic one - the need for shared brain-power.
 Scientific breakthroughs respect no national borders nor
 languages. Knowledge must be shared to attack our species
 seemingly intractable problems: energy, crime, injustice,
 disease, hunger, population, and so on. As Paul Valery
 once remarked;  The trouble with our times is that the
 future just is not what it used to be."
 If security, compassion or survival do not appeal, another
 reason for other-culture learning would be prescribed as
 the insulin to counteract what one observer termed  the
 excess sugar of a diabetic culture." One way to avoid a
 national nervous breakdown is to be aware of the dazzling
 diversity and joy of human expression, both around the world
 and within our own borders. Full appreciation of human
 existence in music, dance, drama, the arts, sports, cooking,
 literature, gardening, religious rites is unattainable with-
 out an education which opens the mind and cultivates taste.
 There are just so many re-runs of Kojalc that any people can
 ultimately tolerate.
 -- Finally, no democratic leadership, however motivated to build
 a peaceful world order can long risk outrunning the capacity
 of its people to interpret and respond intelligently to
 global challenges and opportunities. The internationalizing
 mission of the schools is clearly tied to the national need for
 a citizenry sophisticated enough to be able to cope with
 international realities.
 In sum, this nation requires that our educational system produce at least
 a minimal cadre of eNperts about other peoples and cultures; professionals
 in business and government who can transact negotiations across national
 borders; scientists and technicians who can extend and share human know-
 ledge on a global basis; and citizens knowledgeable enough to support tough
 leadership decisions and policies in a dangerous and complicated world.
 Just where do we stand, politically, and just what is happening
 in Washington which affects our profession? Let me briefly share some
 thoughts about recent developments. A major theme of our recent election,
 and one  supported by most Americans is the reassertion of America's vision
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 and role in the world arena. While from its birth this nation has always
 been part and parcel of international commerce and politics, the degree
 to which America's history is being shaped by external forces has never
 been greater.
 The Reagan Administration, Congress and by extension all Americans
 want to improve U.S. political leverage abroad, enhance national security
 and increase private sector involvement in the conduct of trade and
 diplomacy. It is my conviction that one of the most cost-effective, proven
 instruments of influence -- international experience and foreign language
 competence -- directly serves America's national interests and serves
 them quite well. Furthermore, I firmly believe that one of the more
 practical, substantive steps which the current Administration can take
 to realize the vision of a strong America in the world is to reverse the
 serious decline in federal support for international education, research,
 exchanges, and foreign language instruction. Support of these programs
 symbolizes our willingness to reinvest in our future. For in a world of
 alarming headlines, Americans need direct and personal international
 contacts and competencies possessed by far too few today. Given the
 twin challenges of reindustrialization and getting America back to work,'
 knowledge about and access to international markets is the name of the
 game. There are over 300,000 firms in the United States, yet only 250
 of these account for over eighty percent of America's total exports.
 Where will we recruit the kinds of cosmopolitan managers our economy
 requires if not from among those Americans educated for the world view
 as well as for the immediate managerial tasks of any given firm?

 Of all the resources that make American diplomacy effective, few
 f
 have been as neglected and misunderstood as the educational, linguistic
 and cultural affairs components of American foreign policy. All the
 weapons in our expensive arsenal are insufficient if we continue to
 underinvest in the non-military aspects of our defense'-- political,
 economic, educational and cultural alliances which serve to counteract
 the distorted images of America in the minds of men and women everywhere.
 We assure our place in a more amenable world order through the sharing
 of information, technology, and ultimately, of basic human values. In
 such a fashion, we shape rather than merely cope with international events.
 Unfortunately, the federal investment in our field is fast diminish-
 ing, even as defense spending is projected for $1.3 trillion increases
 over the next five years. The Fulbright Program, a major vehicle for the
 exchange of persons, has, since 1946, sent 45,000 Americans to foreign
 countries and brought 85,000 foreign students, teachers and scholars to
 our shores. In real terms, the program now operates at only 60% of its
 1965 levels. Funding for Title VI of the Higher Education Act, which
 supports language and area studies programs, is projected for stiff
 cuts in FY 1982. The Peace Corps, which fielded 15,000 volunteers
 per year in the mid-Sixties now barely  fields 5,500. We all know what
 is happening to the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National
 Science Foundation. The International Communication Agency is given less
 money to tell America's story overseas than Proctor and Gamble's annual
 advertising budget. Should we be surprised, then, when other nations do
 not like us or fail to understand us? We are simply not willing to foot
 the bill for assuring American competence and influence, for "brainpower"

 as opposed to "firepower."  There is a false frugality at work. Of
 course, a strong military is important, but arms do not represent
 the sole instrument of America's security. Surely the American taxpayers
 deserve more cost-efficient spending in the name of national security.
 Both our allies and our adversaries seem fully mindful of the
 political and. economic advantages that accrue when Third  World
 leaders are educated in their countries, are trained to utilize their
 technologies, and are participants in their social, political and cultural
 life.  Soviet information/cultural expenditures are estimated to total
 some $2 billion annually -- at least four times the U.S. investment.
 Only 1,800 Africans studied in the United States under our sponsorship
 last year. The Soviets supported 24,000.
 To continue with comparisons, France and the Federal Republic of
 Germany commit almost 1% of their national budgets to educational,
 cultural, and informational activities; the U.S. only 0.1%. Helmut Schmidt
 has defined politics, commerce and public diplomacy as the "three pillars"
 of German policy. The government of France asserts that "cultural relations
 are as important as politics and trade and perhaps more important" to key
 interests.
 Americans cannot and will not accept the decline of this nation's
 international presence and viability, let alone its reputation. We have
 never shirked.our global responsibilities, nor are we about to ignore our
 global opportunities. And the most telling fact of our times is that we
 now know that the world is not, nor will it ever be a better place should
 America withdraw.However, if our profession does not begin to address
 the broad national agenda and make a perceptible difference, then I

 change.
 Let me conclude by citing some evidence of progress in our field.
 These examples prove that the three sectors that you yourselves
 have identified are cooperating to create public awareness and
 competence -- the sectors being professional, public and political
 groups.
 Whereas the federal government is not, has not, and will not be
 the best place to invest expectations, and local and state activity
 will be the key to the next phase of progress, several legislative
 initiatives must be mentioned as significant. Late in 1980, the House
 and Senate did pass a Joint Resolution (#301) which stated the
 concern of the Congress that there is a national need  to strengthen
 course offerings and requirements in foreign language studies and
 international studies in the Nation's schools, colleges and universities."
 In addition, Congressman Simon has reintroduced the Foreign Language
 Assistance Act (H.R.3231), and Congressman Henry Gonzalez is in favor
 of a bill to establish a National Commission for the Preservation of
 Language Resources.
 In the bureaucracies, some hopeful signs are present as well, The
 Comptroller General told the State Department that for the first time
 language competency outside a language-designated position will be
 recognized for reward -- fiscal and promotion -- and that the re-use
 of language skills already developed will be rewarded. The International
 Communication Agency plans to increase attention to its programming
 under the auspices of its Private Sector Programs Office which supports
 community-based efforts to assist Americans to learn more about the
 world. Citizen understanding programs continue to be supported in the

 Department of Education, where cuts in programs other than the international
 ones have been exceptionally severe. A new section of the Department's
 program is aimed at promoting U.S. export performance, and there are some
 of us who hope that all of you will press for appropriations for this
 section. The Agency for International Development is also being told
 to "beef up" private sector programming. The Fund for the Improvement
 of Postsecondary Education and the National Institute of Education are
 finally beginning to show interest in supporting foreign language and
 international studies grants.
 On the professional front, new coalitions are springing up,
 such as the International Education Exchanges Liaison Group, the
 Joint National Committee for Language, the Global Perspectives
 group, and the International Research Opportunities Board. Entering
 the political process effectively is a must if our field is to contribute
 to America's needs for international security and economic success.
 We must be prepared for a sustained effort on our part as it is
 not an accepted part of our political culture to be a "cultured person."
 The political constraints are real, and include American attitudes about
 self-sufficiency; dislike of any possible inference of world government;
 fears about acculturation of immigrants; the lack of trained teachers
 and materials; a return to the "Basics" but not to language education;
 a heavy emphasis on teaching about literature and not on teaching skills;
 and more - so much more.

 -- John Adams, our second President, was a Latin master
 in a grammar school and knew some French. John Quincy
 Adams actually spoke French and Dutch and was fully bilingual
 when he was fourteen years old. Chester Arthur was a Latin
 classics major.
 -- Millard Filmore -- remember him? -- refused to accept
 an honorary degree from Oxford University in England on
 the grounds that it was written in Latin and no one ought
 to accept what he himself cannot read. Herbert Hoover
 failed German in 1893. Franklin Roosevelt did not use an
 interpreter when dealing with DeGaulle, De Gaulle wished
 he had. Teddy Roosevelt spoke softly -- French and German
 that is -- an carried a big stick. When former King Carroll
 of Rumania once tried to engage Harry Truman in a conversa-
 tion and asked him: "Do you speak French?" Truman replied,
 No French, and very little English." The King got the message
 and left.
 The political woods, in sum, may not be lovely, but they are
 dark and deep and as a field, we have miles to go before we can sleep
 easily. Not much, afterall, can be cut in the federal budget.   Our
 programs are small and quite vulnerable, lacking as they do a vocal
 constituency, and running up against deeply held American prejudices
 and practices. For language programs to be successful at all political
 :Levels of support, we must prove that we are effective, and present
 convincing data in that regard. Most funding comes from the state,
 local, and institutional level, yet few lobbying efforts are ever
 directed at the Golden Goose. Congressmen at all levels rarely hear
 from their constituents in support of foreign language and international
 studies programs. We must move beyond preaching to the converted in
 the political arena, and on the professional front, we must assure our
 supporters that students of foreign languages will attain a respectable
 level of fluency. Fluency, after all, is the most potent motivation for
 attracting students of all ages.

 17/ Hayden Speech
 Ladies and Gentlemen, there is much to be done and you are doing
 it. At all levels, efforts are underway to forge a truly operational
 link between the national interest and foreign language and international
 studies.State education departments are moving to require more adequate
 curricular sequences for students; magnet international high schools
 are beginning to spring up across the country; more and more institutions
 are requiring foreign language competencies for graduates; national
 associations have sponsored and continue to sponsor international
 committees; some states have set up their own Foreign Language and
 .International Studies Commissions (e.g. Oregon and Hawaii) while
 others have passed legislation and resolutions in support of our
 field (e.g. Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina); and public
 opinion is increasingly on our side.
 And just to show you that no nation has a monopoly on the
 secret to successful foreign language instruction, and that we must
 all work continually to improve the reach and effectiveness of our
 programs, I end my comments to you with this quote(taken from an
 elevator door in a Rumanian hotel lobby)which appeared in American
 Way magazine:    "THE LIFT IS BEING FIXED FOR THE NEXT DAYS. DURING
 THAT TIME, WE REGRET THAT YOU WILL BE UNBEARABLE."
 Hoping that I have not abused your patience and intelligence
 and have not been similarly unbearable, I thank you all for your
 attention and wish you every success with this fine conference.

 Ms. HAYDEN. I should say that none of this is new to you. After
 all, you wrote the book, "The Tongue-Tied American," as well as
 the Law.
 Finally, H.R. 3231, as I have suggested, is a timely statement of
 public importance, which forges a new relationship between the
 Government and the schools and universities of this Nation, in the
 service of addressing the critical challenge of extending America's
 global competence. It stimulates public awareness of the problem
 and suggests concrete incentives to facilitate action. Viewed in the
 context of an uneven and even fickle Federal involvement with our
 field, H.R. 3231 represents a critical, positive step to meld public
 purpose with private initiatives. It requires the endorsement of all
 branches and levels of government, of business, of the media, and
 of educators if it is to succeed. As its chief architect, we applaud
 your vision and stand ready to assist you as you indicate.
 From the President all the way down the line, foreign language
 competence has not been a strong suit of our people. Historically
 speaking, a researcher named John Krueger discovered that on the
 whole, our Presidents were not and are not speakers of foreign
 languages, to wit:
 John Adams, our second President, was a Latin master in a
 grammar school and knew some French.
 John Quincy Adams actually spoke French and Dutch and was
 fully bilingual when he was 14 years old.
 Chester Arthur was a Latin classics major.
 Millard Filmore-remember him?-refused to accept an honor-
 ary degree from Oxford University in England on the grounds that
 it, was written in Latin and no one ought to accept what he himself
 cannot read.
 Herbert Hoover failed German in 1893.
 Franklin Roosevelt did not use an interpreter when dealing with
 deGaulle-deGaulle wished he had.
 Teddy Roosevelt spoke softly-French and German that is-and
 carried a big stick. When former King Carroll of Romania once
 tried to engage Harry Truman in a conversation and asked him:
 "Do you speak French?" Truman replied, "No French, and very
 little English." The King got the message and left.
 I think that we Americans have to get the message and change
 our habits of arrogance and apathy with respect to others.
 We are often exposed to nonsense when analyzing why it is that
 Americans do not learn foreign languages. The implication is that
 we cannot change. One of the most ridiculous prevailing prejudices
 is that somehow people from other nations are born with a unique
 genetic code that enables them to unravel other languages with
 ease, while Americans simply lack the native ability to learn about
 other peoples, cultures and languages.
 Baloney.
 Other nations and peoples are more successful because they are
 motivated to learn other languages, they invest heavily in such
 instruction, and students spend a whole lot of time dedicating
 themselves to some degree of mastery. If we choose to confront our
 linguistic paralysis, I, for one, am convinced we can achieve im-
 pressive results.

 By increasing its modest investment in foreign language instruc-
 tion, the Federal Government can take a demonstrable step toward
 reversing the decline of American influence abroad by extending
 American competence in world affairs.
 As a nation, the United States must invest its energies, talents,
 and resources so that its level of international influence and re-
 spect remain commensurate with its actual power.
 America has always met her international challenges. Indeed, we
 now know that the world is not nor will it ever be a better place
 should America withdraw from its global vision and role.
 H.R. 3231 is, admittedly, only one modest response to an enor-
 mous national challenge. Nonetheless, its very existence both for
 our field and our Nation gives any collective response to America's
 international quest some promise of future achievement. That, in
 and of itself, is significant.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much.
 I think what I would like to do is hear Dr. Eliason and direct
 questions to both of you.

 STATEMENT OF O. LeGRANDE ELIASON, PRESIDENT, ELIASON
 INTERNATIONAL
 Mr. ELIASON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 As you can see, this is a $100 bill.
 Anata wa kono yo na biru ga watakushi ni kudasainasen ka?
 Obviously, Mr. Simon, you did not understand that I invited you
 to give me another $100 bill that looked just like this one. Some-
 times this is misinterpreted with this kind of an introduction to
 accept my $100 bill.
 I think of the frustration that must have existed in the Ameri-
 can Embassy in Afghanistan when the Russian soldier tried to
 defect. I can see American personnel running aroung hither and
 yon, and the Russian probably speaking louder and louder thinking
 that louder means clearer and this has been my experience when I
 have been in situations or observed situations in which Americans
 assume this.
 Mr. SIMON. If I may interrupt the witness, that Soviet soldier
 happened to also speak German. There was no one at our embassy
 at Kabul who spoke either Russian or German.
 Mr. ELIASON. I appreciate your book. I have not read it, but I
 have read excerpts from it, and read quite a bit from your book.
 One of your phrases concerning the importance of language, it is a
 key to opening minds and attitudes, to speak, read, write and
 understand other languages is the beginning and understanding of
 other people.
 Today there is not time for me to enlarge on the number of
 examples that have happened personally to me. There must be
 literally thousands and thousands in my 12 years in the Orient, in
 my interaction with people in the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan,
 Korea, and the benefits that have come to me as a result of
 understanding some of these languages is just enumerable.
 Language is so important, it seems to me, that one company has
 stressed hiring language-qualified people and teaching in the tech-

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 nical responsibilities of jobs rather than hiring technicians and
 trying to train them in language.
 I think a problem that is often misunderstood in the United
 States today is the fact that there is no relationship between the
 language problem and availability of language-qualified people,
 there are literally at my beck and call, I suppose, I could say,
 thousands and tens of thousands of language-qualified people who
 are interested in obtaining any type of employment in which they
 ?         can use their language skills.
 Some of them are now actively looking, and many of them would
 willingly change their employment were such positions available to
 them.
 I think the entire problem of language in this country is not the
 available or unavailability of languages. I think it is the hiring
 practices of Government and of business.
 I think this will nail down the entire problem and I think that if
 businesses were to hire and give hiring preference to individuals
 who speak foreign languages, if Government would give hiring
 preference to individuals who speak foreign languages, I think we
 would create a demand which would drop down to the public school
 system and enhance the language training.
 Of course, I am in favor of teaching languages at very early ages.
 In my travels throughout the Far East, I have often envied the
 young Japanese or Chinese child at their affluency at their own
 language and I suppose they may envy us for ours.
 I think you mentioned in your book and elsewhere, that the
 State Department does not require an individual to speak a foreign
 language for being hired and yet that same agency is estimating
 that it will cost over $8 million to eliminate the language problems
 within that particular department.
 All the Government agencies have estimated over $34 million
 would be required to train their people to that extent that there
 would be no language problem.
 So my recommendation would be in addition to what I have
 written that a foreign language coordinating council be organized
 in which university presidents from prominent universities and
 prominent business presidents and industrial leaders and Congress-
 men be called together and evaluate language training within the
 United States and the use of the foreign languages and there are
 several things they could do to enhance that.
 One thing would be to, as I mentioned previously, to give hiring
 preference to individuals who speak foreign languages within Gov-
 ernment and within business and I would like to see universities
 matriculate only students who have a background in foreign lan-
 guages and graduate only students who have achieved a certain
 level of foreign language study. And I see where a bill that would
 supplement the universities for the loss and attrition of these
 students. I think that such a requirement by universities and by
 government and by business would require individuals going into
 the universities to have these languages, and businesses would hire
 on a preferential basis those who have the languages, and this
 would impact on the public school system, so if the demand would
 be there, then the supply would automatically come. There would

 64
 be a much higher demand for engineers resulting in an increased
 number of engineers.
 I think in conclusion, we might compare the language study with
 the stockpiling of vitamin capsules. Without use, either of them
 lose their effectiveness.
 Also, if I may take a minute to comment on the items that have
 come to mind as a result of hearing other testimonies here today,
 while I was in the Air Force a number of years ago, in 1963 I
 recommended that military people be assigned overseas on the
 basis of their knowledge of languages as an incentive to get them
 over there, and do away with the ugly American image that so
 many of us have over there and our unwillingness to study foreign
 languages.
 I was given 14 lieutenants, each of which knew different lan-
 guages, and there was a period awaiting intelligence training and
 none of us could get in because we were awaiting our background
 investigations and each lieutenant was assigned different cultures
 to study, et cetera, and they conducted courses down in Texas for
 every American going abroad to encourage them to study the for-
 eign languages and the culture.
 I taught with the University of Southern California and we lived
 in Korea, and I taught also in the Philippines and Kwajlein and
 made an effort to learn a little bit of these languages while I was
 in those countries, having previously studied Japanese and Chi-
 nese.
 I would like to introduce my wife who is vice president of our
 company. The opportunities that have come to us as a result of
 exposure to these languages is just, well, business opportunities for
 example, my wife is managing director of a Japanese company
 right now that is going to be bringing 1,000 Japanese students to
 the United States every year for 1 year of training to become
 acquainted with English, our culture.
 These are the people who are going to be coming back and
 winning business contracts with us. They are going to be head and
 shoulders above us, and we ought to be doing more to insure that
 our people have these opportunities to live abroad.
 After terminating Brigham Young University as an administra-
 tor, I felt so keenly about this problem that I have formed this
 Eliason International, formed solely for the purpose of getting indi-
 viduals placed with international companies where they could use
 the languages.
 I think within 2 weeks to a month I could have 1,000 Japanese
 Americans, that is, Americans who speak fluent Japanese who
 would be willing to be hired and sent somewhere where they could
 use the language.
 Last year I offered to provide 400 Chinese linguists free of chare
 to the United States when we were conducting an expedition in
 Peking. Chinese laws would not permit them to go in, and they
 want to use their own interpreters and they did not have hotel
 space for them, but we have many people within the country who
 do speak languages and should have this opportunity to use them.
 Ambassador Richardson stated this morning just a little knowl-
 edge of the language will open tremendous doors and, I think of my
 experience in Peking last year, when just a short phrase in Tagalog

 opened up doors with some Philippines and some business opportu-
 nities there.
 Just a few words I remembered in Russian created an atmos-
 phere where these two Russians, every time they would see me,
 they would greet me and we would talk, one incident after another,
 just from a small amount of language, and so this would be my
 recommendation, that we, overall, I suppose, that we look at our
 hiring practices within the United States and that we start hiring
 these people and making languages a desirable thing to acquire.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you.
 Your business, as I understand it, is basically a personnel place-
 ment business; is that correct? And you charge either the company
 or the individual for that placement?
 Mr. ELIASON. Another professor and I formed the company, and
 he is continuing his work there, whereas, I terminated and felt I
 had to put my full energy into it, but it was organized really to
 correct what I consider to be a big problem.
 I felt companies around the United States were not aware we
 have such language talent in the country. An ambassador from
 Brazil has written to me, and I get letters from around the world.
 It is the companies that have to open the doors. I have written
 thousands of letters, but very few companies respond.
 I formed another corporation where I feel that many individuals
 who desire to work abroad and to use their language skills, they
 are not prepared, and so we have formed international employ-
 ment enhancement seminars, so that we can hopefully sometime
 run around the country and conduct seminars and tell people what
 opportunities exist, and how to prepare themselves academically
 with cultural problems and really how to get the job.
 There is an awful lot that can be done, and I hope to eventually
 create a company where we will teach young language students
 individual exporting laws, assign companies on an importing basis,
 exporting just one product to get the feel of how to do it, and after
 they have completed the course, they can be assigned to work full-
 time with a company and use these skills.
 There is so much that can be done that we are not doing.
 Mr. SIMON. One of the realities is that if you get to be president
 of an American corporation, and you have never had any language
 skills, you tend to think the system that produced me has to be
 pretty good, and so that it does not seem that important.
 ?    One of the other things that businesses could do that would be
 an asset to them, simply on forms, when you fill out an application
 for a job, say, do you have knowledge of another language, and you
 know, what is your relative skill and so forth. Just a little thing,
 but then business would have a pool of people that, if there are
 guests from Roumania and go through that list and find someone,
 you have turned this into an asset for that company if you find
 someone that speaks Roumanian.
 Dr. Hayden, one of the arguments that is used against passing
 this bill is the argument that says we have a real quality problem,
 and before we start producing quantity, we better take care of the
 quality problem.

 I have argued in response that that was the argument that was
 used against us when we mandated education for the handicapped.
 One of the big arguments was, we don't have quality, or we don't
 have the numbers of people, let's not mandate.
 We found out when we mandated that in fact we improved the
 quality in the process, but having said that, I recognize that there
 is a quality problem. If tomorrow Dr. Rose Hayden were to be
 named Secretary of Education-and in case there is anyone here
 from that office, Dr. Bell's job is not in jeopardy as far as I know-
 but if Rose Hayden were named Secretary of Education, what
 would you be doing at the Federal level to encourage an improve-
 ment in quality education, and then I would like to direct that
 question to you also.
 Ms. HAYDEN. With respect to the original argument that there is
 somehow a zero-sum relationship in protecting quality, I would like
 to share with you one of my favorite phrases: There are two kinds
 of people in the world, those who dichotomize and those who don't.
 I don't.
 The potential for quality is the issue. The fact is that in many
 respects, having geared up an infrastructural system at all levels of
 education for language teaching and having watched it erode over
 time with the student-centered curriculum of the sixties, the drop-
 ping of language requirements in higher education, and the spread
 effect down the line, what we really have in terms of the language
 profession is like the old car that sits in the driveway. If we don't
 start it somehow, if this bill is not a good battery to start it up, it
 will never run. That it may need a new fender and a whole lot of
 other repairs does not spoil the initial judgment which is to get on
 with doing something. That will in a sense push that vehicle again,
 and gear it up so that it performs.
 The potential for quality foreign language instruction has never
 been higher. I think we know more now than we did in the first
 blush of Sputnik, in the sense that some very interesting break-
 through work is occurring in research on attrition of skills, and on
 attainment of actual proficiency in the language of study.
 It is not enough that someone becomes proficient. We must know
 about how and when and why and where, one loses that proficien-
 cy. We know more about proficiency testing than we used to know,
 and we are more and more inclined to want to apply it. So my
 mission, should I decide to accept it as Secretary of Education,
 would be to try to monitor carefully experimental projects and to
 take the point of departure, not of institutional need but of individ-
 ual progress through the system-almost like the pig through the
 python.
 Taking this point of departure, one asks questions like these:
 What happens to the early learner, the K through 12 student, as
 he or she moves through the system? Do they go to a middle school
 that teaches French and on to a high school where either no
 language is taught, or if it is taught, the student has to start all
 over again with the same basic text?
 The point of departure would be to have very experimental grant
 programs, a good strong advisory relationship with language pro-
 fessors who are on top of the field with respect to proficiency
 testing, attrition of language skills, and have a good consciousness

 about what happens to the learner as he or she goes through the
 system, and then some of the critical problems of the field could be
 addressed that effect quality, namely, the provision of more ade-
 quate articulation among levels of language instruction, more
 access to quality education, reinvigorated emphasis on excellence
 in terms of testing, and most important of all, I think, a recogni-
 tion that the government would top off worthwhile experiments,
 would not step on, but rather be in step with those people who
 4 want to do this job well.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you. Doctor?
 Mr. ELIASON. I surely subscribe to what Dr. Hayden has stated. I
 think that I would encourage the participation in foreign exchange
 programs more than perhaps we have been doing, and I would like
 to get a number of university professors or presidents, rather,
 together, and encourage them to go for broke literally, I suppose, in
 some cases by requiring language and matriculation requirements
 into the universities. When I say universities, institutions of higher
 education.
 Mr. SIMON. That is what this bill encourages, nudges colleges and
 universities in that direction.
 Mr. ELIASON. I support that fully and particularly institutions
 that have a limited enrollment. I have been riding Brigham Young
 University for 2 years, while I was still employed and after I left
 there, encouraging them to put this requirement in. It has been
 evaluated by the faculty advisory committee and a similar recom-
 mendation made.
 I suppose there are some concerns there, but they are limited to
 25,000 people and turning away thousands every year who are not
 able to get in, discriminating on a 3.332 GPA, instead of 3.331, well,
 going up three decimal points.
 That is one institution that could be doing something about it.
 There are others, of course.
 I would call them together and say, look, we have got a language
 problem in the country, you can solve it, and if you take care of
 this part of the problem, then we think the public schools will start
 teaching the kids to get into the institution.
 Mr. SIMON. The difficulty now is we are not even communicating
 to the schools that we have a language problem and that is one of
 the fundamentals.
 Ms. HAYDEN. One other comment about how we might look at
 the reward structure and incentives for this. If one were truly
 ?    serious about increasing the quality of foreign language instruc-
 tion, there should be incentives or rewards for those States that
 toughen up their certification and in-service requirements for for-
 eign language teachers by linking these to a proficiency base.
 There should also be some kind of incentive for the outstanding
 teacher and student. Even if each congressional district gave an
 outstanding language achievement award to a few students of
 major languages and to a few teachers of those languages and
 coupled that with a Fulbright or Peace Corps opportunity or what-
 ever, it would send very powerful signals to educators that we care
 about performance. We are not only starting the old engine up
 again, but we want to really fix up this vehicle overall.

 Mr. ELIASON. A national language honors program such as the
 National Spelling Bee or something like that with the different
 languages would perhaps give some students an incentive to work
 a little more diligently in the languages and receive recognition for
 testimony.
 [The prepared statement of LeGrande Eliason follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF O. LEGRANDE ELIASON, PRESIDENT, ELIASON
 INTERNATIONAL
 After no response to my "Hello!" I was determined to get an answer from this
 crotchety, dour-looking individual, and then asked, "How are you?" He replied in a
 gruff manner, "Ya Rossich." I then asked him in Russian, "How are you comrade?
 How is your wife? There isn't a cloud in the sky," and other phrases remembered
 from my study of Russian some 20 years ago. By the time the elevator had descend-
 ed to the first floor we were back-slapping, hand-shaking friends. Just a few words
 in a foreign language had paid off again.
 Mr. SIMON. Good, we thank you both very, very much for your
 1. BACKGROUND
 For several years my concerns have centered on the failure of government and
 business to hire the large number of people in the United States who speak foreign
 languages. My international business was subsequently organized in November 1979
 for the purpose of placing with national and international businesses and govern-
 ment, professionally-qualified individuals with foreign language skills.
 I terminated my employment at Brigham Young University feeling that my full-
 time efforts in contacting multinational corporations and government agencies
 would result in the placement of these people. After all, those whom I would
 represent speak one or more of some 50-70 different languages and most occupation-
 al groups are featured. What I felt would result in a landslide of requests for
 personnel has become instead a real "selling" job.
 I have lived in East Asia for approximately 12 years (Japan, Taiwan, Okinawa,
 Korea, Philippines, and on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands) in the capacity of
 LDS Missionary, USAF Officer, and USC Professor. I speak Japanese and Chinese
 and have formally studied German (2 years), and one year each of Russian, French,
 and Spanish. I have also studied a little Korean, Tagalog, and Marshallese.
 Business positions currently held include: Chairman and President Eliason Inter-
 national and Chairman and President International Employment Enhancement
 Seminars. A future goal is to establish an international foreign language and
 business center within the next 3-5 years.
 II. EXPERIENCE WITH LANGUAGE FAILURES
 U.S. Representatives Paul Simon and Leon Panetta have noted many problems
 caused by cultural or foreign language shortcomings. A few more include:
 A. Former President Harry Truman. President Truman on one occasion addressed
 Chiang Kai Shek as Mr. Shek instead of Mr. Chiang.'
 B. Symposium in Peking/Beidaiho, PRC.-As a participant at the World Coal/
 World Mining Symposium in the People's Republic of China last September, I
 learned that only one caucasian among the 300 plus foreign delegates in attendance
 from over 30 countries could speak Chinese. That more corporations were not
 intelligently represented by persons familiar with the culture and language of the
 host country is unthinkable! A few simple phrases spoken by me in various lan-
 guages to the delegates resulted in increased social interaction throughout the 10-
 day activity and enhanced my business contacts.
 C. Tucson elevator.-A greeting to a Chinese businessman in a Tucson, Arizona,
 hotel resulted in on-doing communication to the present time (three years later).
 LIttle did I realize then that this gentleman was the president of an international
 trade group in Taiwan and that he would be of invaluable assistance to me in the
 years to come.
 D. Planning ahead.-A prominent Japanese businessman in Atlanta, Georgia,
 remarked to me last year that he "loves" America and that it hurt him to see the
 U.S. in its present economic straits. He expressed his feelings that current business

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 problems in the U.S. stem from our failure to plan for the future; that our financial
 interests unfortunately center on the "bottom line" each year. His philosophy
 reflects the patience which characterizes the people of his country. We might note,
 for example, that corporate representatives of one Japanese company have been in
 Burma "preparing" for the past 25 years, but have yet to conclude their first sale in
 that country!2 One wonders how well they speak Burmese.
 E. U.S. Government representatives abroad.-The U.S. Government has failed to
 insure that key military commanders and some other government representatives
 have assigned to them as consultants, persons knowledgeable in the foreign cultures
 and languages. Mr. Robert Tharp, Director of the Chinese Language Program at
 Yale University in the late 1950s and 1960s, has long advocated such a policy which
 would eliminate some of the "problems" caused by our uniformed representatives in
 foreign lands. Better yet would be that key personnel have a strong command of the
 foreign languages and understanding of social customs, thereby eliminating the
 need for consultants. Something is always lost in translation.3
 F. US. Government language training programs.-Strong criticism has been levied
 against various government agencies due to their failure to adequately use the
 foreign language skills taught to personnel at great expense. The U.S. Government
 paid dearly for one year of Chinese language instruction for me at Yale University,
 but subsequently failed to allow me to use my language skills in an official Air
 Force capacity. Some provisions should be made to insure that language training is
 not wasted and that maximum use is made of language skills. The use of individuals
 who already possess language skills should be emphasized.'
 G. US. Government and business institutions.-Probably one of the greatest con-
 tributors to our "language failure" in the U.S. is the failure of government and
 business to use the services of individuals who already posses foreign language
 skills. Reasons for this neglect may include:
 Thoughtlessness or failure by government and business institutions to communi-
 cate their needs to universities;
 Failure of individuals in strategic positions to recognize the value of foreign
 languages (not possessing these skills themselves); and
 Failure to plan ahead; and
 The fear of some corporate representatives to hire foreign language-qualified
 individuals because they fear the loss of their own positions. One corporate manager
 verbally expressed to me his fear of losing his job and, contrary to an employment
 order requested by his superior, failed to hire two exceptionally well-qualified indi-
 viduals.5
 H. Language-qualified professionals.-In the United States there are literally
 thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of individuals who speak foreign lan-
 guages and who possess professional qualifications; yet most are unable to find
 employment in which they can use their language skills.6
 I. Need for U.S. Language Coordinating Committee.-There appears to be little, if
 any, coordination in the United States between foreign language training facilities
 and institutions which would use these services. Hiring practices should be reviewed
 by government, business, and educational institutions with greater emphasis being
 placed on foreign language skills.
 J. Double taxation.-The United States is the only industrialized country in the
 world which taxes its citizens on income earned abroad after they have been taxed
 by the respective foreign governments. This policy adversely affects our competitive
 edge, reduces the number of Americans sent abroad, and increases the number of
 problems resulting from the use of "foreign" representatives.7
 K. Inflation and high costs.-Mr. Walter A. Guyer, Vice President of Internation-
 al Harvester, stated in a recent communication to me:
 "Today's cost of maintaining an American Foreign Service Employee (AFSE) in
 an overseas post has risen to extraordinary levels. As a result, we are currently
 reviewing, on a corporate basis, our business strategy with respect to AFSE's and
 management of our overseas operations.
 "Without a doubt, in the future we will be sharply reducing the number of
 managers transferred to overseas assignments. Those assignments which will be
 filled with AFSE's, in the future, will most certainly be restricted to a relatively few
 key management positions in our large overseas subsidiary companies. The individ-

 III. STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CITIZENS WELL-VERSED IN
 LANGUAGES
 A. Need to export and communicate.-Mr. Erland Higgenbotham, Director Gener-
 al of Foreign Commercial Service, has expressed concern with the large number of
 manufacturers in the United States who fail to export. He expressed his feelings on
 one occasion that a significant reason is ignorance of exporting laws.9 Mr. David
 Edwards, Director of Liaison of the Joint National Committee for Languages, clearly
 explains the necessity of good communication in the statement of purpose of his
 organization.' 0
 B. Japanese high school student exchange programs.-Whether by government
 edict, by business, or by individual perceptiveness, the Japanese are determined to
 learn English and American culture. Japanese high school student exchange pro-
 grams send many students to the U.S. for academic instruction every year. These
 students' English will become polished and their understanding of our culture
 enhanced. One can envision how these students will impact business and interna-
 tional relations in the years to come.
 C. U.S. regional and foreign differences.-Individual traits and mores differ from
 region to region in the U.S. Characteristics typifying citizens in one region are not
 always readily accepted in another. Failure to adjust one's mannerisms to the local
 culture may quickly estrange him from his new community, and such examples
 abound. They intensify with the introduction of a "foreigner" into a community. A
 case in point: Ardeshir Zahedi, former Defense Minister of Iran and Ambassador to
 the U.S., and close associate of the former Shaw of Iran, received his university
 education at a western university in the U.S. He and his fellow Iranians alienated
 themselves from the community in which they lived because of what was interpret-
 ed to be aloofness and arrogance. Their profligate spending at the end of World War
 II in this conservative community created a negative undercurrent, especially fol-
 lowing Mr. Zahedi's purchase of one of the first automobiles manufactured after the
 war, a red Buick convertible. Resentment was vocally expressed by local citizens
 because of the apparent "blackmarket" purchase and their inability to purchase a
 vehicle. This incident in the life of Mr. Zahedi typifies the behavior of too many
 Americans abroad."
 D. Language versus technical skills.-The importance of being able to speak
 foreign languages is graphically represented by the experience and philosophy of
 one U.S. corporation which determined:
 "` * * after many years of not-so-successful attempts in training their personnel
 in languages, that it would be easier to train one in the technical end of the rubber
 business, than to train an expert to speak Spanish and Portuguese `  `  *" 12
 E. Japanese or English.-During many conversations with U.S. businessmen, I
 have been told that during critical business negotiations Japanese representatives
 will switch from speaking English to Japanese. This has frustrated the Americans
 who have expressed concern that they were out-negotiated by this maneuver.
 F. Japanese secrecy.-Some Japanese companies will not hire Japanese-speaking
 Americans, even in the U.S., ostensibly because of their desire to preserve secrecy.
 Other employees of Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S. have reported that in one
 multi-storied structure American employees are not permitted on the top floors.
 IV. H.R. 3231 AND THE IMPACT IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE ON THE LANGUAGE
 SITUATION
 A. Participation in foreign language studies.-Among reasons which contribute to
 poor participation in foreign language studies in the United States include:
 The failure of government and business to emphasize foreign language skills in
 their hiring practices; and
 The failure of institutions of higher learning to require prior foreign language
 studies in matriculation and graduation requirements, or to at least extend admis-
 sion preference to individuals who have studied foreign languages.

 B. Use of foreign language skills.-Passage of H.R. 3231 would enhance the
 teaching of foreign languages. Unfortunately, under present government and busi-
 ness hiring practices, relatively few of these language-qualified persons would be
 hired for positions in which their skills could be used. For example, approximately
 one year ago I interviewed four highly-qualified persons for a managerial position in
 Tokyo. Each of them had received his MBA (one also had a JD) and each spoke
 fluent Japanese (three of them having served as Japanese language instructors!).
 These candidates had been interviewed by a number of U.S. corporations and each
 had received between 6-10 offers of employment, yet each desired the position in
 Japan where he could use his language skills. Financial remuneration played no
 part in the decision. Three of the four are now employed with U.S. institutions in
 which their language skills lie dormant! Each would immediately accept a position
 in which their language skills could be used.
 C. International placement.-Since the organization of my placement service my
 office has been inundated with telephone calls from throughout the U.S. We have
 also received hundreds of resumes from individuals throughout the U.S. and abroad.
 A former ambassador to Brazil has sought our assistance within the past few
 months. All of this activity has taken place with a minimum of advertising! 13
 D. Motivation for foreign language study extant.-In the March 1981 World Press
 Review "Editor's Corneis a summery of U.S. Representative Paul Simon's book,
 "The Tongue-Tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis" (Contin-
 uum, New York, $12.95). Mr. Simon quoted some statistics showing that the over-
 whelming majority of parents desire that their children study foreign languages in
 elementary and secondary schools.14
 E. Pragmatic considerations.-Long-range application of foreign language skills
 employment expectations present a gloomy picture judging from present hiring
 conditions. Parental support exists for language study. Were government and busi-
 ness to lend their support by offering hiring preference to foreign language-qualified
 persons, language would appear more relevant, more pragmatic. If universities
 required prior foreign language study as a matriculation requirement or even gave
 matriculation preference to potential students with foreign language study back-
 grounds then languages would be offered in the public school system. Expenditure
 of federal funds would likely be unnecessary with the financial support provided
 local school districts by parents. Federal funds might be better used to augment the
 loss of tuition by institutions of higher learning which implement matriculation
 policies which require prior foreign language study.
 A. Facts.-
 1. Any attempt to learn a foreign language greatly enhances one's relationship
 with foreigners.
 2. Many government agencies and multinational businesses fail to hire individuals
 with foreign language skills and understanding of foreign cultures, although such
 persons are available.
 3. Some corporate representatives in the U.S. and abroad will not hire Americans
 with foreign language skills because they fear the loss of their own positions. 15
 4. Throughout the U.S. there are thousands or tens of thousands of individuals
 who are qualified in foreign languages and who desire employment in which they
 can use their language skills.' 6
 5. There is a strong need to unify efforts of government, business, and institutions
 of higher learning toward enhancing foreign language study in the United States.' 7
 6. Double taxation of American expatriots (by American and foreign governments)
 has lost a competitive edge in business for American firms.' 8
 7. Approximately 7,000 U.S. citizens now return from foreign countries each year,
 having served as Mormon missionaries. [Between January 1930 and December 1980,
 approximately 96,000 Mormon missionaries have served missions of 2-3 years in
 :length in foreign missions of the church (1930s-3,400; 1940s-5,250; 1950s-9,040;
 1960s-25,000; 1970s-47,400; and in 1980-6,000).] 19 These persons speak one or

 schools, 75 percent would have languages taught in elementary schools, and 84 percent of

 more of some 30 different foreign languages and most of them will resume their
 university education at the sophomore level and they will enter most occupational
 areas of employment. Upon completion of their formal education, a large percentage
 would welcome an opportunity to return to "their" land, where they also are
 acquainted with the culture, for employment.20
 8. There are many job positions in the U.S. which would be enhanced by individ-
 uals who can speak foreign languages. This will become increasingly evident with
 the large contingents of immigrants in the U.S. and those who speak Spanish as
 their primary language.21
 9. U.S. business methods differ from those practiced in foreign countries. Many
 U.S. corporations hire foreign nationals to represent their business interests abroad.
 Costly mistakes have resulted in many instances. For example, a conflict of interest
 between one's country and the U.S. business may exist. How does the foreign
 representative react in such instances?
 10. U.S. expatriot managers too often understand neither the foreign language
 nor the culture of the country in which they are employed. The natural tendency is
 to limit one's associations to the expatriot community.
 B. Assumptions.-
 1. When business institutions and government give hiring preference in all in-
 stances to individuals who have studied foreign languages, and require mandatory
 language skills for designated positions, then institutions of higher learning will
 provide that language instruction.
 2. When institutions of higher learning either require foreign language studies as
 a requirement for admittance, or extend admission preference to those who have
 studied foreign languages, it follows that elementary and secondary educational
 facilities will provide foreign language instruction. (Perhaps federal funding might
 better be used to supplement tuition losses by universities as a result of imposing
 language study as a matriculation requirement).
 3. A demand for foreign language instruction in elementary and secondary schools
 will create a demand for language teachers.
 4. A demand for foreign language teachers will enhance the marketability of
 foreign language skills acquired by university graduates.
 5. A demand by public schools for foreign language teachers will create a need for
 additional funding which can be met by district, state, or federal resources.
 6. A foreign language matriculation requirement by institutions of higher learn-
 ing would enable these institutions to enhance their summer enrollment. Students
 who have not prepared themselves to enter institutions by prior language study
 could boost summer enrollment at such institutions by participating in intensive
 language studies.
 7. Even as the increased demand for engineers by industry resulted in increased
 numbers of engineers, so the demand for language-qualified professionals will en-
 hance the participation in and offerings of foreign languages in public school and
 university settings.
 C. Planning.-Involvement in a variety of business functions throughout the U.S.
 by businesses and institutions of higher learning would enhance the study and
 practical use of foreign languages. One idea which may be of interest to some is
 being planned for implementation by my corporation within 3-5 years. We plan to
 construct a language training and international business center with some of the
 following features and offerings:
 1. International employment enhancement seminars will be conducted for the
 purpose of instructing individuals how to prepare themselves for international
 employment. The criteria will include:
 International employment opportunities;
 How to prepare oneself academically;
 What cultural problems exist for the expatriot and his family; and
 How to write a resume, interview, dress, get the job.
 2. Intensive foreign language instruction (including English) will be provided for
 individuals and for groups.
 Foreign language instruction will emphasize speaking, reading, and writing as
 well as studies of the cultures.
 4. Language instruction will be geared to specific needs/level of understanding of
 the individual.
 5. Courses will be conducted in importing/exporting, and students assigned to
 manufacturing firms for internship experience. Thousands of manufacturers do not

 export because of ignorance of export laws, lack of contacts abroad, foreign language
 problems, and for other reasons. Upon completion of the course or university
 studies, students can be permanently placed with firms through our placement
 service.
 (I. Participating foreign businessmen seeking expertise in certain areas will re-
 ceive instruction from qualified university and business professionals.
 7. All persons employed at the center will be required to speak one or more
 foreign languages. This requirement would include secretaries, cooks, gardeners, etc.
 13. An on-campus residence will be constructed for individuals and for families.
 VI. CONCLUSIONS
 It is suggested that a permanent national council be organized, to consist of
 representatives from government, business, and institutions of higher learning. This
 council would meet frequently in order to assess the foreign language problem in
 the U.S. and to determine and make recommendations to the various member
 agencies as to how efforts can best be unified. Some suggestions which might be
 evaluated by council members include:
 1. Government and business entities might give job preference to persons with
 foreign language skills and academic or experiential understanding of foreign cul-
 tu res.
 2. Universities might limit matriculation to individuals who have studied foreign
 languages, or give them admission preference.
 3. Universities might graduate only those students who have achieved specified
 levels of foreign language competency.
 4. Students who have either demonstrated or possess scholastic evidence of ac-
 quaintance or understanding of foreign cultures might be given additional credit
 toward hiring preference.
 5. Greater emphasis might be placed on participation by U.S. students in interna-
 tional student exchange programs.
 6. National foreign language speaking competition might be conducted (similar to
 the national spelling bee).
 7. U.S. dependents abroad might be encouraged to attend local (second country)
 schools in addition to supplemental training in U.S. subjects at home or in the
 American community.
 8. Americans abroad might be encouraged to use domestic help who have no
 knowledge of English. (One quickly enters the thick of a foreign culture with this
 type of experience!).
 9. Government and business leaders might plan ahead and anticipate foreign
 language needs in 10-20 years and hire accordingly.
 VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
 Since multinational businesses and the U.S. government are experiencing prob-
 lems in the international area, with many representatives abroad who are poorly-
 qualified or not-qualified in foreign languages, and since this adversely affects U.S.
 economic and political interests in the U.S. and abroad, and since this contributes to
 the excessive outflow of U.S. capital, it is essential that steps be taken to counteract
 this trend.
 It is proposed, therefore, that a permanent national council be organized, and that
 it consist of government, business, and university leaders. This council would meet
 frequently to review and evaluate the foreign language problem in the U.S. and
 determine how best the different member agencies could unite their efforts.
 It is proposed that U.S. Government and business interests establish policies
 wherein hiring preference is given to individuals who have facility with foreign
 languages and to those who have lived abroad and are acquainted with other
 cultures. It is further proposed that institutions of higher learning establish policies
 which either require previous foreign language studies prior to matriculation or
 give admission preference to those who have undertaken such studies. It is also
 proposed that additional foreign language skills be required for graduation from
 such institutions.
 This emphasis on foreign languages by government, business, and educational
 institutions would enhance the development of such offerings in the public schools
 throughout the country. Once government, business, and educational institutions
 emphasize language in their various policies and hiring practices, the worth of
 foreign language instruction will become apparent and participation in the program
 enhanced. Many language-related problems will disappear and serendipitous bene-
 fits result.

 Finally, by studying foreign languages we will earn greater respect from our
 foreign associates. Although we may speak a language poorly, a simple effort will
 pay great dividends in our relationships. An awareness of foreign cultures will
 create understanding and lasting friendships. As we Americans show interest in
 another's country, language, and culture, we are sensitive to his basic human need
 to communicate. These actions reflect personal effort on our part to communicate
 rather than to passively place the burden on him. They convey respect.

 STATEMENT OF TRACY C. GRAY, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF LAN-
 GUAGE AND PUBLIC POLICY, CENTER FOR APPLIED LIN-
 GUISTICS
 Mr. GRAY. My name is Tracy Gray, and I am the Director for the
 Office of Language and Public Policy.
 I feel like Henry the VIII's sixth wife. Pretty much everything
 that I had planned to say has already been said, but I will take this
 time to make my comments and make them concise and hopefully
 interesting.
 Mr. SIMON. We will enter your full statement in the record, and
 you know, at any point you want to condense, feel free to do that.
 Mr. GRAY. Thank you.
 I am honored to be here to address the issue of foreign language
 education in our nation's schools. The development of foreign lan-
 guage expertise must be seen as a critical component to the eco-
 nomic, social, and political policies of this country.
 It is encouraging to know that a growing number of Congress-
 men have recognized the importance of developing foreign lan-
 guage skills commensurate with our needs in this interdependent
 world.
 We especially applaud the provisions of such legislation as
 NDEA title VI, which hopefully will survive the night of the long
 knives, which is scheduled to occur this week.
 Congressman Simon has eloquently outlined the difficulties faced
 by our foreign language students and educators during the past
 decades. He has discussed the potential dangers to our national
 security of the continuing decline in interest in foreign language
 education and detailed the strong feelings of hostility and prejudice
 toward the entire concept of foreign language learning.
 As you, Mr. Chairman, have so eloquently noted, business and
 diplomatic dealings are noted for our insistence on letting the
 other party bridge the language gap. No one can deny the position
 of English as one of the most widely used languages in the world (if
 both native and nonnative speakers are included). Nor can one
 ignore its critical link with technology, economic power, and diplo-
 macy.
 However, a myopic insistence on its exclusive use in internation-
 al activities seems both ingnorant and ineffective.
 There are numerous studies which indicate that international
 business dealings could be enhanced if Americans could speak the
 local languages. So why does the business world continue to view
 foreign language capabilities as strictly an ancillary skill?

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 The answer to this question falls in the category of the proverbi-
 al chicken and egg phenomenon. Are there fewer foreign language
 students because there are fewer programs or is the reverse true?
 The research conducted by the Center for Applied Linguistics
 would suggest that our few foreign language students are frus-
 trated by a teaching profession best by the threat of oblivion.
 Attacks continue on the relevance of foreign language learning
 as a preparation for life in the real world. In addition, there is the
 inadequency of, or general dissatisfaction with, the foreign lan-
 guage training provided by schools and universities.
 These factors all contribute to frustrated students, disinterested
 corporations, elimination of language requirements, and abolition
 of programs.
 All this points toward some real problems facing our Nation in
 the area of developing competence in foreign language skills.
 While the ambivalence about studying other language prevails,
 we can see rising interest from various sectors of the United States.
 This was clearly evident when a small paragraph inadvertently
 appeared in Changing times stating that the Foreign Service Insti-
 tute had materials to learn a variety of foreign languages-particu-
 larly the less popular ones.
 Since this notice appeared, FSI has been inundated with requests
 from all over the country for all different languages. Thousands of
 the requests are from individuals who have lost their first language
 or are travelling abroad and want to void the Ugly-American syn-
 drome.
 With this in mind, let us turn to H.R. 3231 which offers an
 opportunity to bring about an important change in foreign lan-
 guage study.
 I would now like to address four provisions in the bill:
 Section 1. The connection between national security and foreign
 language expertise cannot be emphasized too strongly. It may be a
 cliche, but there is much truth in the statement that "the original
 loses in the translation."
 We cannot continue to rely on a handful of translators and
 interpreters, many of whom are not Americans, to filter informa-
 tion during sensitive top-level diplomatic and business negotiations.
 You have eloquently detailed numerous examples of American
 embarrassment and misinformation that has been conveyed during
 diplomatic deals.
 The United States has experienced enough humiliating experi-
 ences in diplomatic and business dealings to convince us that you
 never know when their translators might have a bad day and
 misrepresent the facts.
 It is at our own peril that we have failed to provide incentives
 for students to acquire the necessary skills to serve as translators
 and interpreters. This bill would do precisely that.
 Section 2. Research evidence supports this provision to fund inno-
 vative language programs at the elementary school level. Young
 children have an innate ability to learn different languages and we
 are one of the few countries that does not develop these skills.
 However, a word of caution is necessary. A current study of
 elementary school foreign language programs indicates an alarm-
 ing pattern: Children often begin foreign language study in pri-

 mary school with great success, only to find that the program ends
 abruptly. Why? Because no provision had been made to insure
 continuity throughout the school curriculum [Center for Applied
 Linguistics, 1981].
 Since we already know that language learning is cumulative,
 this bill must insure that students need not keep returning to
 square one in order to learn a language. All of us who have ever
 studied a foreign language understand that wise old adage: "If you
 don't use it you lose it. ' Nothing could be more true than with
 foreign language learning.
 Section 3. We support increased Government assistance for post-
 secondary programs to promote the study of a foreign language
 beyond the second year. The need for higher stipends is due to the
 potential increase in costs of maintaining language programs when
 enrollments may be low.
 The proposed concept that such a cost differential be included in
 the bill recognizes the need for at least 400 contact hours-or 3 to 4
 years to acquire a solid level of proficiency. We should be cautious
 of the instant 2-week crash courses that are only a quick fix and do
 not stick.
 In addition, the financial incentive should apply all the more to
 the uncommonly taught languages, for which we find very few
 highly trained individuals. The fact that there are over a billion
 people today whose languages are studied by fewer than 200
 Americans should give pause for thought [Starr, 1978].
 Section 6. We must emphasize the importance of the bill's provi-
 sions to insure that postsecondary programs which qualify for fund-
 ing are those that meet at least 5 days each week for a minimum
 of 50 minutes. While it is true that very few institutions of higher
 education have programs which would apply under this provision,
 H.R. 3231 is to bring about important changes and improvements
 in foreign language instruction.
 One change, if we as a people are serious about learning other
 languages, is to support and extend the scope of foreign language
 programs. No more interns after the second one.

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT BLACK, PROJECT DIRECTOR, EDUCATION AND THE
 WORLD VIEW, COUNCIL ON LEARNING, NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y.
 I am Robert Black,  Project Director of "Education & the World
 View".   My resume is attached.   I have just completed a major
 national assessment of the state of foreign language and inter-
 national studies in the American undergraduate curriculum.   The
 purpose of this project is to help move campuses across the
 nation to strengthen and enhance foreign language and international
 studies.   The published documents resulting from the project are
 a principal instrument in this endeavor.
 My testimony before the House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Edu-
 cation is to support the principle of federal support for foreign
 language learning by American college students and to suggest
 some alternative wording for particular lines of this bill that
 will strengthen the bill's ability to achieve what it intends.
 There is not any doubt in my mind that the United States' national
 security and its economy will be strengthened by increased num-
 bers of school and college leavers becoming proficient in a second
 or foreign language.   I speak not only from personal experience
 as a former active duty member of the Armed Forces and as a policy
 analyst who gained access to high government officials in other
 countries because of my own language abilities but also from
 having examined over the past three years the state of interna-
 tional education (including language learning) at America's 3,200
 two- and four-year undergraduate institutions.   In addition I
 bring to bear two years of observations gained from in-depth inter-
 views with line managers in numerous transnational firms while I
 was on The Conference Board's project examining multinational
 corporate practices.
 The bottom line is that it is a necessary national objective to
 establish as a national asset  a much greater number o  e ucate
 Americans that can speak, write, read, and understand a second
 or foreign language.   Because this is a national need, it is
 highly fitting that the Congress of the United States fund in
 part formal foreign language study at our schools, colleges,
 and universities.   This is not an improper or obtrusive function
 of the federal government, but one that is sorely needed given
 changed global circumstances that exist today.  With the world
 in such flux, learning a foreign language is a necessary basic
 for large numbers of Americans.   In its conclusions, our Task
 Force on undergraduate international education observed that
 "General competency in a second language" was a "necessary requisite

 H.R.  3231 Testimony (VI-81)                                                ?2
 for the college experience in the 1980s and beyond."
 A bill such as H.R.3231 is thus in many ways a welcome piece
 of legislation.   If the federal government does not assist the
 various educational  agencies in establishing adequate, proficiency-
 based programs in foreign language learning, we will find it very
 difficult to achieve the aims of this bill through private means
 alone.   Additionally, the fact that a federal recognition is given
 by means of such support to this important necessity will help
 trigger wider support from among other private sources that do
 not currently assist in this area.
 What I wish to suggest with regard to the particular wording of
 this draft of the bill is that it may allow for "more of the
 same" with regard to postsecondary language instruction.   That
 is, it will not achieve the intended aims.   Many institutions
 will continue to offer the very same drudgery as language courses
 that contributed to the demise in language learning that we have
 been witnessing over the last decade.   Incentives to reestablish
 traditional course or semester-hour language requirements will
 not create proficient American foreign language users for us.
 Incentives that appear to place more emphasis on one year (or
 the first year) of language study rather than the second, third,
 or fourth will not move us very much closer to the intended goals.
 Furthermore, when highly effective proprietary methods exist in
 such centers as the Michel Thomas Language Centers  (in Southern
 California) or the World Trade Institute's Language School (in
 New York City), it is not very propitious to recommend by way
 of non-discriminating federal support the less effective methods
 that have plagued many of our educational institutions.
 I believe that these problems can be overcome by substituting
 alternative wording at appropriate points in H.R. 3231.   In
 times of extremely tight budgets, we can ill afford to have
 this necessary support sidelined or derailed.   I think that
 this alternative wording will help in the process of surviving
 the gauntlet.
 On page 1 within the descriptive title of H.R. 3231, change the
 ,lines relating to higher education to read:
 ..and for reimbursement of institutions of higher educa-
 tion for part of the costs of providing foreign language
 .instruction."               / new wording underlined -7
 Other changes in alternative wording proffered will move this
 type of funding from being purely "per capita" as was originally
 intended, although a per capita measure may be used to establish
 the level of funding granted.
 On page 2 within Sec.  1, add a new subsection (4) between lines
 16 and 17 to read:

 16a   (4)   the educational institutions should ensure in the
 process of their foreign language instruction that
 students gain an approriate level of general competency
 in a second or foreign language."
 On page 4 in Sec.2 (b), add a subsection (4)  regarding assurances
 about evaluations of competency or proficiency between lines 7
 and 8:
 7    'hpplication; and
 7a    (4) provides assurances that the local education agency
 will provide standard evaluations of pupils' proficiency
 at appropriate points in the program, and provide such
 evaluations to the Secretary."
 On page 4, in Sec.3 (a)(2), change per centum amount on line
 19 to read:
 19    "that fiscal year exceeds 10 per centum of the total number of"
 Many institilions can easily reach the 5% mark.   Making the re-
 ceipt                                                               of federal funds that easy may not move to any real en-
 hancement of or strengthening of foreign language studies at
 the institutions concerned.   To offset this added degree of
 requirement, leave the 5% figure stand on page 6, line 13.
 On page 4, in Sec.3 (a)(2), lines 23 and 24 change to read:
 23    "number of full-time degree candidate students enrolled at
 the institution, and
 24    (B)  the number of part-time degree candidate students en-
 rolled at the
 25    institution..."
 These federal monies should not be allowed to subsidize those
 tuition-generating programs that are not aimed at the degree
 candidates but at the wider public which could possibly choose
 more effective proprietary methods.
 On page 5, in Sec.3 (a)(3), add on line 7 to read:
 7     "which evaluate the progress and proficiency of students
 in such programs."

 traditional methods bound by "language & l terature" contexts
 and that do not produce true proficiency do not contribute to
 the aims of this bill.   Those programs in language and litera-
 ture worthy of federal support should apply through National
 Endowment for the Humanities channels rather than through this
 bill which purports to increase outright language learning.
 On page 5, Sec. 3  (b)(1)(A)(i), line 18, change amount to read:
 18    "(i)  $25, multiplied by"
 And on page 6, Sec.3 (b)(1)(B)(i), line 1, change amount to read:
 1     "(i)  $50, multiplied by"
 Getting beyond the second year is of critical importance in the
 postsecondary setting if language competency is to be maintained.
 Other campus motivations and incentives can be used to assist in
 doing this, but honing the skills already built by continuing
 further study is an important signal to send to the institutions
 of higher education across the country.
 On page 6, Sec.4  (a)(1),.grants for language requirements at
 institutions of higher education will produce far greater re-
 sults if proficiency rather than credits are stressed.  Change
 appropriate lines between 21 and 23 to read:
 21     ...which requires a general competency in a foreign language
 23     achieved by means of postsecondary study for each gradu--
 24                                                           ating student.  ...
 On page 7, Sec.4  (a)(2), lines 10 and 11, change to read:
 9      "...full-
 10                                                           time degree candidate students enrolled at the institution,
 and (B)  the full-time
 11     equivalent of the number of part-time degree candidate
 students enrolled at the
 12     institution,  ...
 Again, it is bestto subsidize only degree candidates matriculated.
 On page 7, Sec.  (4)(a), add subsection (3) on assurances about
 language proficiency between lines 13 and 14 to read:
 13a    "(3) Institutions receiving such grants shall assure the
 Secretary of the levels of proficiency obtained by its
 graduating degree candidates, as determined in accordance

 with know proficiency standards and reported in accordance
 with procedures presribed by the Secretary."
 In this manner, language proficiency rather than classroom time
 is stressed.  We should be subsidizing the former and not the
 latter.
 I would leave to the Subcommittee Staff the determination if the
 amounts in Sec.7 will meet the liability engendered by this alter-
 native wording of substantive sections that I have just offered.
 Their demographic knowledge is probably far more accurate than
 ours with regard to the specific numbers involved.

 Mr. BLACK. I will make a few remarks about the strength of this
 particular statement inasmuch as the statement is more technical
 and relates to the wording of the bill and changes.
 There is no question about the national necessity of the kind of
 support you are proposing in this bill, and it has been confirmed by
 the Educational and the World View project results of the survey,
 one done by the Educational Testing Service of college students,
 and the second one that we did at the Council on learning of
 effective foreign language in international studies programs in the
 United States.
 Some of the testimony we have heard here today addresses-
 excuse me-some of the written testimony I have provided address-
 es very specific suggestions on wording that would enhance reach-
 ing the objectives of your bill.
 I would rather take some of that in question, though, rather than
 to talk about that at the moment.
 I assumed in preparing my statement that you and Members of
 Congress would much prefer operating with the sort of Douglas
 McGreeger theory, with the assumption in mind which build on
 the diversity of an individual's interest rather than trying to inject

 cohesion, using the carrots of you bill by simply rewarding increas-
 ing language learning on campuses in more of the same business-
 as-usual manners.
 I assumed you really wanted to get far beyond that. My state-
 ment does suggest that the committee work more with innovative
 opportunities rather than the old standards of numbers and re-
 quirements.
 Taking a prior witness' implied suggestion about admission pref-
 erence to those who have proficiency or have studied foreign lan-
 guages in secondary school if some how that could be brought into
 the wording of the bill, it would enhance what occurs at primary
 and second school levels or the job-related suggestions we can infer
 such as giving through H.R. 3231 support to institutions that set up
 in their placement programs coordination mechanisms to advance
 graduates who have competent foreign language proficiency.
 Now, it is in this dimension of moving language learning on
 campus ahead in this kind of manner that is so critical in what
 comes from Federal support.
 That is the kind that is being offered in this bill and the kind we
 find that legislation already in place and the kind of thing you
 have been suggestion through your very long efforts in these en-
 deavors.
 The results of our project point very strongly in these very
 directions. The volume written by Humphrey Tonkin and Jane
 Edwards on "The World in the Curriculum," they stress very much
 the necessity of communicating with the world, language instruc-
 tion on campus, and on how this ought to be integrated into the
 mainstream of the college experience.
 Mr. SIMON. If I may interrupt the witness just to say our associ-
 ation, Council on Learning, made a real contribution through that
 'volume.
 I read it on the plane.
 The basis of my remarks that night turned out to be from that
 :book. I thought it was well done.
 Mr. BLACK. They stress that not only do you have to integrate it
 into the curriculum, the basis of language learning ought to be
 from this motivational standpoint that we should understand even
 if you can get along on English in many parts of the world, you can
 do much better on being able to speak the other person's language.
 The volume I was responsible for, the Handbook for Exemplary
 International Programs, the task force on the Council surveyed
 some 200 across the Nation and wrote up 62 as exemplars, and only
 a dozen of those are really strong language learning programs that
 we say ought to be emulated across the country.
 Granted, there are more than a dozen or so out there but we
 'were really talking about plausity of effective programs on campus
 that offer the opportunity of obtaining real foreign language profi-
 ciency during the undergraduate experience, and that is what the
 bill aimed at changing and can in fact help achieve a change in
 that direction.
 Also, our survey of students that was conducted for us by the
 Educational Testing Service which looked at a number of dimen-
 sions of global understanding of some 3,000 college students across
 the Nation confirmed basically what was stated in the report of the
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 President's Commission on Foreign Language International Stud-
 ies, that language learning in the United States is scandalous.
 The finding of this report stated straight out that only about 5 to
 7 percent of the typical American graduate from college can func-
 tion adequately in a foreign language, in a language other than the
 student's mother tongue.
 Referring to some evidence that was given to you by LeGrand
 Eliason in the Joint National Committee on Languages, they
 talked about an apparent language gap between the growth in
 total enrollments and the growth in language enrollments.
 There is a much larger gap between total enrollment and this 7
 percent proficiency. Only 7 percent ever leave college with an
 effective use of a second language.
 Regardless of the facts or evidence that we are considering before
 us, we really need to find some way of getting schools and colleges
 to want to shift to a learning process whereby students gain an
 effective proficiency over the course of instruction.
 We have to move away from this marking time in a classroom, x
 number of credit hours, semester hours, x number of minutes by
 the way in which State legislatures require learning processes to
 occur, because learning processes to occur, because learning proc-
 esses do not occur that way.
 The Council on Learning's inquiry into the higher education
 learning process in many areas show that there are other sorts of
 things that occur that advance the learning process, and the learn-
 ing of foreign languages, students' ability to perceive as a student
 goes along of gaining a real proficiency is one of the critical keys in
 learning a language in such a way that when the student leaves,
 the student will retain the language.
 I think that in that sense, the bill can help if we look towards
 other ways of teaching and learning foreign languages.
 You mentioned some of these in your own book, "The Tongue-
 Tied American." That is some of the proprietary methods, such as
 the "Silent Way" at the World Trade Institute in New York City or
 the Michel Thomas Language Centers in southern California.
 These kinds of methods provide alternatives to which many
 people in this country are turning to in order to learn other lan-
 guages effectively.
 Quality control in these two methods is very high and so that is
 why I use those rather than others.
 Who uses them? For example, Chase Manhattan Bank has done
 a major contract with the Michel Thomas Centers to give their
 executives in their various departments of the bank effective profi-
 ciency in more commonly known modern languages.
 In a relatively short period of time, depending upon the individ-
 ual's own skills, in as few as two weeks, some of these modern
 languages can be learned in a way in which they can be used
 immediately in a foreign setting.
 One vice president who undertook this particular course not too
 long ago studied Spanish for 2 weeks and learned it adequately
 enough, so that he could go to countries in South America, Peru
 and Ecuador, and deal directly with his clients in deliberations.
 It did not give him the ability to speak in the same way that a
 long period language learning would give the person who has to
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 devise contracts and work in such legalistic ways, that type of
 command of the language, but it allows him to meet his clients on
 terms favorable to Chase Manhattan Bank, rather than having to
 rely on interpreters.
 ?     In the business world, many decisions are made based on feeling,
 empathy that occurs between two individuals involved in a negotia-
 tion, and that may happen anywhere, not necessarily in the negoti-
 ating room, but it could happen in a social encounter over lunch or
 something of this nature, and language learning is necessary.
 Corporations are recognizing this. Unfortunately, they don't have
 enough people trained in languages in those positions, so they turn
 to these methods. Others that want to speak well also turn to
 them. If campus learning of languages could shift in such such a
 way to provide real proficiency, then the bill will succeed in reach-
 ing its objectives.
 One suggestion is to, I would think on campuses where you are
 going to find in the future they may turn to these methods in
 introductory courses, so you will find instead of having to take four
 years, they may in using some of your types of methods, one-half of
 the normal semester's course, use that method, give the student a
 feeling of having the proficiency, so the student will want to go on
 his or her own and learn the language much better and, if you can
 get the kind of wording in the bill to help that along, the bill will
 achieve its results.
 One final comment, I worked on the multinational project there
 at the Conference Board, and that is a business research group.
 One of the reasons they brought me into the project, my ability in
 French and ability to read other languages, because they were
 going to be doing research in a number of countries where the
 ability of one member of the team to communicate with others was
 a critical point in that succeeding.
 At some point in the process of that project, we had a meeting
 between on the one hand Don Stokes, dean of the Woodrow Wilson
 School at Princeton; Harvey Picker, dean of the school of interna-
 tional affairs at Columbia University, and with the senior manage-
 ment development people of major corporations such as Exxon, one
 or two others that were three, the Chase Manhattan people.
 The executive D people stated very flat out that they didn't care
 whether or not the people they were bringing in had language
 learning. This conversation took place in 1976.
 They wanted someone that had certain other kinds of functional
 skills, and that they would then rely on such proprietary methods
 as the World Trade Institute or the Michel Thomas Centers, and
 the reason they didn't care about that so much was that they felt
 that the products of the nation's colleges and universities from
 typical undergraduate course work and some graduate course work
 was inadequate, and they didn't want to waste time pointing out
 that with their college recruiters and so forth.
 If that was the attitude taken with such major corporations at
 that time, those attitudes may not have changed very much be-
 cause of what typically comes out of the undergraduate language
 learning experience, and so my stress to you and members of your
 committee is, with this bill, please do not provide something that
 will allow more of the same, because we will never get to a point

 where we can increase the numbers of students that enter the
 workplace that have language skills.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you, and thank you also for your specific
 suggestions on language changes, and I want the staff to give me a
 copy of the bill with those insertions so that I can read them.
 One of the areas you touch on and Ambassador Richardson
 touched on, was the 5 percent where you suggest going to 10
 percent. You understand from my perspective my problems. I don't
 know how we handle it. It is a more different problem than the
 problem faced by Rutgers University or any other school that you
 can mention.
 Mr. BLACK. My suggestion for the change in the number in the
 bill was simply to say, look, if you allow those that are already
 doing it to take money from the Federal trough, in this case they
 are not going to change. They are going to do what they want to do
 with the money rather than what needs to be done with the
 money.
 By offering them an incentive, if you say, look, if you raise the
 number to 10 percent, you can then thereby be eligible to recoup
 the costs, and that is why I didn't change the number in the other
 part of the bill, so they have 5 percent already, and you only
 exclude 5 percent.
 For having taken that extra step, they get an extra five percent
 in terms of the money they can recoup for having taken the extra
 steps to increase the number of enrollments on campus.
 I recognize the problem you are talking about and the problem
 that community colleges have. It seems to me from what our
 project looked at the growth in international studies and foreign
 language courses on campus coming at the community college
 level, given the amount of changes in this area, that wouldn't be as
 harmful to the community college as it sounds, that it might in
 fact help things along, because a president of a community college,
 Maxwell King down at Brevard in Florida can stand up and tell his
 board of trustees, look, we have to put some of our assets into this
 area, and it will benefit us. Here we are in Florida, and we can
 make great use of expanding our courses.
 Ms. GRAY. I think with respect to that question, is it possible
 that the community colleges could be written in at the 5 percent
 level and raise it to 10 percent for other universities and colleges.
 Mr. SIMON. We could do that.
 Ms. GRAY. I appreciate the problem at the community college
 level having spent several years in California and been familiar
 with that whole system, it is very true they would be not able to
 match a 10-percent increase.
 Mr. SIMON. You mention at the elementary level we are one of
 the few countries that does not develop skills.
 The statistics are just overwhelming here.
 While there may be some disagreement by some researchers on
 your statement that young children learn more easily, I think
 there is general agreement on that, and we are one of the-actual-
 ly one of the few countries that does not require foreign languages
 at the elem .ntary level.
 Mr. BLa'A. I can give you a very graphic experience on that
 aspect. My father was in the military, and we were transferred to
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 France. My father decided we would not attend the American
 dependent schools but local schools in the community which we
 lived outside of Paris.
 We were thrown into a French school ranging with kindergarten,
 third grade and I guess I was in sixth grade. My youngest brother
 in kindergarten learned French in about a month, a month and a
 half totally fluent at a kindergarten's level of understanding.
 My middle brother learned it, roughly third grade in the United
 States, he learned it in, oh, say, 2 months at the most, and it took
 me about 3, 31/2 months until I felt at least totally fluent in the
 :language, and granted, it is a total emerging method, but here is
 no question that younger people, they are less inhibited in this
 process, and that if we really want to change things around, we are
 going to have to reach down to offering some form of foreign
 language instruction in primary and secondary schools, primary
 schools especially.
 Mr. SIMON. One of the researchers at San Jose University has
 the theory you learn at that younger level, because you are doing
 things physically, instead of kind of in a sedentary position, and
 that may very well be, but the reality is if you are 25 years old,
 you are not out going to be doing the same thing you are doing in
 first grade or whatever it might be.
 You mentioned one other area that we touch on in the bill.
 That is the need for higher stipends for less commonly taught
 languages. It was interesting to, in visiting the Soviet Union at this
 one language institute we visited in Kiev, they mentioned the
 languages, and they mention the usual French, Spanish and so
 forth, and they added Urdu.
 We probably in the entire United States, even 200 million, we
 probably don't have 20 or 30 students of Urdu in this whole coun-
 try. That is the kind of thing we have to be taking a hard look at.
 Mr. BLACK. As you remember, Mr. Chairman, by the midsixties,
 when we increased our involvement in Southeast Asia the Defense
 Language Institute started implementing a whole range of short
 courses to force-feed servicemen en route to the Far East, and they
 identified these people by having them take at that time the Army
 language aptitude test, and if they scored above approximately a
 50-percent mark on whatever that raw score was, they were then
 assigned to take a short course en route.
 The idea was that these people would then be assigned to billets
 which the language was necessary of one sort of another.
 The fact is when they got there, the assignment patterns were
 totally irrelevant to the fact people had been through that particu-
 lar course. I graduated with honors from DLI in that course; and
 when I got there, they said you are a lifer, you go to a billet where
 you are not going to even have a chance to talk to anybody almost.
 The fact is you can train a lot of people in that, but if you don't
 put them where they are needed, they are not going to want to
 retain the skill and; two, you are going to waste the resource, so
 even if you are looking for ways to put more money into the less
 commonly taught language, and do it effectively, I still think you
 have to consider what is going to happen on the other end.
 Mr. SIMON. Any follow through, Dr. Gray?

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Ms. GRAY. Mr. Chairman, having aspired to the position of the
 Secretary of the Department of Education, I would like to just take
 1 minute to respond to the question that you asked a previous
 panel.
 In terms of the problems with the present foreign language
 programs as we know them, I think that much of the blame does
 reside within the foreign language teaching community.
 We have really oversold our product in many cases, and we have
 promised very quick results in a short period of time.
 Mr. SIMON. To see an ad, "Speak German like a diplomat in 2
 weeks," just is an affront to everyone.
 Ms. GRAY. I think that that is very much the case, and often-
 times students enter these programs thinking if they take French
 for a semester or quarter, then they will be able to use the lan-
 guage, and one of the harsh realities of language learning, particu-
 larly for adults, is that it is a long process. It does not have to be
 tedious, but it does require a lot of study, and one of the compo-
 nents that I think makes this bill so outstanding is the fact that it
 would encourage study after the second year which probably would
 result in students graduating with a higher level of proficiency.
 Mr. SIMON. I thank you both very much.
 I might add to Mr. Black's testimony, I went through his book of
 illustrative good programs, and I noted with chagrin that the State
 of Illinois does not have one, as I recall in there.
 Mr. BLACK. The State of Illinois has an education task force that
 is working on the problem, and think that that speaks very well for
 the State of Illinios. There are many States in the Nation that
 need to do this and they are not doing it and the efforts of the
 National Cuncil of Foreign Language and International Studies
 may help remedy some of that, but even with third party work in
 this area, we still are going to need a great deal of Federal support
 to turn this around.
 I don't know what to suggest other than that. The interest of
 individual States, one would think would be adequate to motivate
 States to do this. South Carolina is probably one of the larger per
 capita concentrations of foreign investments in that State, and it is
 moving in that direction.
 Even a regional campus like South Carolina at Spartanburg, it
 has to insert international dimensions into that commuter college
 campus, and it has to increase the amount of language training it
 provides, because it is going to increase the job opportunities for
 people in that area, but I don't know how many other States are
 taking a more enlightened view. I know of a number. Maybe those
 are the only ones.
 Mr. SIMON. You get the last word.
 Ms. GRAY. You should know according to the modern language
 Association the University of Illinois in Urbana has one of the best
 programs in the country. It has received the Good Housekeeping
 seal of approval.
 Mr. SIMON. Your book which really highlights schools that, like
 Kalamazoo College, I did not know what they were doing until I
 read your book which was very, very helpful.
 Tomorrow the hearing will begin at 9 a.m., and it will be in 2257

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF ADM. BOBBY R. INMAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CENTRAL
 INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, good morning, let me begin by
 thanking you for giving me this opportunity to express my views on the need for
 ?        strong leadership by the federal government for developing our nation's foreign
 language capability. This subject is of great interest to me personally and of particu-
 lar relevance to my position as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. For some
 time now it has been evident to me that our nation's foreign language capability
 has been rapidly deteriorating. One of the most obvious results of this deterioration
 is the adverse impact it is having in the Intelligence Community.
 The importance of adequate foreign language capability in the Intelligence Com-
 munity cannot be overstated. The development of technical intelligence systems in
 recent years has been of enormous value to us, but that has also served to increase
 (91)

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 the need to enhance our foreign language ability and area expertise. Affording our
 youth the opportunity to learn foreign languages is essential, for our future intelli-
 gence officers will come from this cadre.
 Foreign language capability within the Intelligence Community can no longer be
 limited to just the languages of major threat countries. Military and political
 intelligence are no longer the sole interests of the Intelligence Community. Third
 World nations now represent an increasing concern to us. Additionally, the econom-
 ic, technological, and scientific capabilities of other nations, large and small,
 demand our concentrated attention. We must keep abreast of developments in all
 areas. And yet with this increase in demand for our expertise has come a decline in
 our foreign language capability. Now more than ever we must be able to translate
 and assimilate a vast amount of information as fast as possible in order to effective-
 ly and correctly analyze it and provide good input to our country's foreign policy
 makers.
 There are other areas in which the Intelligence Community relies on strong
 language capability. Human source collection, through which we gather some of our
 most significant intelligence information, is critically dependent on foreign language
 ability for developing strong ties with our counterparts in other intelligence services
 and with the agents who report to us. The collection of human intelligence is an art.
 The success of our officers overseas depends to a very large extent on intangible
 psychological and human factors, on feelings of trust and confidence, and on person-
 al rapport. Speaking the other person's language plays a critical role in this chemis-
 try. Minimum level competence in a foreign language is just not good enough. Our
 intelligence officers must be as highly skilled in the language as they are in the
 other facets of their jobs.
 The Intelligence Community relies heavily on foreign language skills in its exploi-
 tation of open source literature. Although the amount of intelligence information
 available to us in our own language is enormous, the quantum of published informa-
 tion in foreign languages which is unexploited or unexploitable is also great. There
 is a vast amount of scientific and technical information published in foreign lan-
 guage journals throughout the world which is of substantial value to our under-
 standing of progress. The same holds true for the array of foreign language newspa-
 pers and media broadcasts. Currently, however, we must often rely on secondary
 rather than primary sources in research. Due to manpower restraints and a short-
 age of qualified linguists, we contract for a great deal of translation work. Experi-
 ence has shown that the value of the intelligence derived from this translation is
 sometimes limited because of the accuracy of the translation and its timeliness.
 We are obviously not able to contract out all the material we have to read and
 assimilate. There is a great deal of information which is so highly classified that we
 must depend on in-house expertise. Even if we could contract it out, our intelligence
 analysts would still need to be fluent in a foreign language in order for the CIA to
 fulfill its mission. It is not sufficient to merely report events. We must understand
 the culture and society in which the event takes place. The more subtle changes in
 a society are often lost to the individual who cannot converse or read in the
 language of the country.
 We are particularly dependent on strong language skills in the economic report-
 ing sphere. For some important intelligence targets statistical data are rarely pub-
 lished in English. In some cases the investment plans of foreign industries are
 published in English, but the financial data necessary to gauge the ability of an
 industry to carry out the plan is published only in the foreign language. Translation
 services, whether federally funded or not, generally cover only highlights of the
 economic news. Only by reading the full range of material available does one
 discover some of the more detailed information on an industry's operations that is
 important to our analysis of a country's economic activities.
 I am sure that throughout these hearings you will be deluged by a mass of
 statistics on the nation's current foreign language capabilities. Unfortunately, I am
 limited in what I can say in open session about the statistical effect declining
 foreign language ability has had on our operations. Suffice it to say that we been
 impacted severely. Although we have a great many analysts and intelligence offi-
 cers who have some foreign ability, many do not have the professional level of
 competence needed to conduct their jobs, and the language capability which they do
 have is not necessarily in their primary area of expertise. In the Operations area,
 we are now losing many of our most experienced people who have had 20 or so
 years of service using a second and third language. Replacement of these people has
 been made difficult by the fact that many universities and colleges no longer have
 foreign language requirements as part of their mandatory curriculum. Moreover, as
 a result of the discontinuation of the military draft, we have had fewer non-career
 military personnel with language training to draw upon. We need to be able to

 recruit and hire people who already possess capability in a foreign language and not
 lose the time required to train them in this skill after they are on board. An
 intelligence officer's duties, whether he or she is destined for analytical or clandes-
 tine tasks, require a multifaceted training program that involves more than just
 language training. Total immersion instruction and in-country training in a lan-
 guage are not always feasible. More often than not, due to operational necessity, the
 officer must be pulled from training and set on assignment. We simply cannot
 afford the burden in terms of time, expense, security, and manpower to continually
 devote the bulk of a person's training period to the development of a language skill.
 We are especially vulnerable when it comes to the more exotic languages such as
 Urdu, Arabic and Farsi. We have seen as steady decline since 1975 in almost all
 languages, including the more common Romance languages. Although for many
 years we have been concerned with more than proficiency in Chinese and Russian,
 our primary intelligence targets are the Communist countries. Now that the prior-
 ities in intelligence work have expanded to include much more than this area, we
 must be prepared linguistically as well as operationally and analytically for any
 development throughout the world, whether, it be political, economic, military,
 technological, or scientific. Consequently, we need strong skills in most world lan-
 guages. Let me hasten to add that proficiency in a language does not necessarily
 mean competence in the myriad of dialects of the language. For example, an
 intelligence officer may be skilled in the Arabic spoken in Syria but almost totally
 deficient in the tribal dialects of the Gulf.
 The Intelligence Community has long recognized the need to improve linguistic
 skills. We have frequently turned to outside sources in the academic world and in
 other Government programs for translation assistance. We have also implemented
 many of our own programs to develop strong language skills in-house. The Intelli-
 gence Community has an Ad Hoc Committee on the Linguists problem which acts as
 a central point of reference for those elements of the Intelligence Community which
 are concerned with the hiring and retention of operational and analytic personnel
 requiring a foreign language in their area of expertise. Each of the principal
 National Foreign Intelligence Board organizations concerned-CIA,  DoD, and
 NSA-have specialized requirements and operate under different personnel man-
 agement and career development systems, and it is thus impossible to devise any
 system which would be applicable to all of the National Foreign Intelligence Board
 members requiring language-qualified personnel. The Committee is effective noneth-
 less in ensuring that solutions to common problems. The Committee is effective
 nonethless in ensuring that solutions to common problems adopted by one organiza-
 tion are made know to others and, where possible, adopted by them as well. Much
 effort has been given to ensuring that the independent programs of the various
 agencies are complementary and not competitive or redundant in nature. Within
 CIA itself, we have in the last few years implemented a Language Incentive Pro-
 gram whereby personnel are rewarded for achieving a particular level of proficiency
 in various foreign languages and rewarded for the maintenance of that skill. In
 addition, efforts have been made to allow analysts to rise to higher GS levels
 without changing their career tracks to management. This latter program gives
 many of our fine language-skilled analyst the opportunity to retain their proficiency
 and to continue serving the Intelligence Community in the area in which they are
 best qualified. We also try to schedule as many language-qualified people as possible
 for overseas travel so that they may have the opportunity to both use their lan-
 guage skills and learn more about the countries in which the language is spoken.
 Aside from our own programs, the Director and I strongly support the recommen-
 dations contained in the report of the President's Commission on Foreign Language
 and International Studies issued in November 1979-The Perkins Commission
 Report. Regardless of the position one takes on the Commission's findings and
 recommendations, the report accurately summarizes the importance foreign lan-
 guages play in our ability to correctly assess world events and provide our nation's
 leaders with timely, well-researched, and well-analyzed information from which
 they can shape our national policy. We also believe that such programs as the
 Department of Education's International Education and Foreign Language Studies-
 Domestic Program and the Translations Program of the National Endowment for
 the Humanities made substantial contributions toward solving our language prob-
 lems. The Humanities Endowment Translations Program provides significant sup-
 port to the Intelligence Community through translations that contribute to an
 understanding of the history and intellectual achievements of other cultures. They
 have or are conducting such useful studies as those dealing with Islamic legal
 practices, Hindu legal text, and the Bakhtiyari Tribal Confederation of Iran.
 Let me close by restating my concern that the foreign language capability of our
 country is poor and is getting worse. This nation suffers from the fact that we are a

 country in which a second language is unnecessary to do business on a daily basis
 except in certain unique areas. We are losing the large talent bank of second-
 generation Americans where another language was spoken at home, and we must
 remember that we are one of the few nations in the world which is not a truly
 bilingual society. Decisive action should be taken on the Federal level to ensure
 improvement in foreign language training in the U.S. so that we can cope with the
 problems we will face in future years as the pace of our involvement with the rest
 of the world becomes ever more important to our own survival and well being.
 STATEMENT OF ADM. BOBBY R. INMAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR,
 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Admiral INMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With your permis-
 sion, I will enter the formal statement for the record and informal-
 ly discuss its contents. I would observe first my appreciation to you
 for the opportunity to testify on my strong concern for the need to
 improve the language training in this country.
 Out of all misfortune some good sometimes comes, and I do not
 think either of us could ever have forecast when we first began
 discussing the need for legislation on this topic that we would enjoy
 such intense media interest in the need for improved foreign lan-
 guage training in this country.
 As you know if you have had a chance to look at my statement,
 my interest in the subject of foreign language training is long
 standing. It was a topic that took up some time in my confirmation
 hearings for my present job, and out of that you and I entered into
 a conversation from our own separate perspectives, each having
 worried for a long period of time about the steadily deteriorating
 language training capabilities in this country.
 As you know, there have been a number of studies over the years
 highlighting this deteriorating condition, probably the latest one of
 some stature being that of the Perkins Commission. I am here to
 testify today as a concerned citizen on this topic, not to present a
 formal administration position pro or con on the legislation. The
 administration has not yet had the time to address in depth the
 extent of the needs or where one ought to go. Whether they will
 ultimately come down in support of your specific bill or other
 measures is still not yet certain to me.
 But what is certain is that the deteriorating language study
 programs of this country are presenting a major hazard to our
 national security, and because national security interests underlie
 it, sooner or later the Government is going to have to provide, the
 Federal Government, is going to have to provide leadership in
 helping to solve this problem.
 I spent the last 4 years as Director of the National Security
 Agency. I was for a year in the job that General Larkin has and,
 before that, 2 years as the Director of Naval Intelligence. Through-
 out all of those assignments, the importance of foreign language
 capabilities has been brought home steadily, first the need for
 foreign language capabilities to exploit open source unclassified
 information available to us. Much is available which we never get
 translated, to sift through the huge volume for its potential use in
 educating this country on political and economic areas of concern
 to us or technical concerns developed in what are currently nonad-
 versarial countries.
 In our human intelligence needs it is not just an ability to
 understand the language that is important, but rather there must

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 be the ability to converse with total fluency, to understand the
 nuances of conversation, and to be able to persuade others in their
 own language why they should give help to the United States in
 understanding events in their own countries or in other areas of
 the world where they can provide us assistance.
 We are particularly dependent on strong language skills in eco-
 nomic reporting. This is an area that has been substantially ne-
 glected over the years. As one drew down the total assets of the
 intelligence community over a decade at a time when we should
 .have been accelerating our coverage of economic intelligence, it
 languished. Much of the information that is of vital concern is
 available in unclassified materials, investment plans of foreign
 industries, financial data of various countries and industries.
 'Translation services, whether federally funded or otherwise, gener-
 ally only cover the highlights of the economy.
 If we are going to assist the industry of this country -that is,
 the Federal Government assist the industry of this country-in
 being competitive in external markets, we are going to have to
 insure that better foreign language capability is available to exploit
 the data which is accessible.
 The concern is not going to get less. It is going to get higher. We
 are privileged at this point to still have in service in the intelli-
 gence community many very competent operators who learned
 their languages in the 1940's and 1950's. They are reaching retire-
 ment age. Some have already gone. Others will be going.
 To replace them we can find high-quality employees with no
 language skills. The Government then has to invest a year or 2
 years to reach minimal stage of capability and, in many cases, up
 to 5 years, for the degree of fluency in the languages which are
 mandatory. Programs that would help accelerate language training
 during secondary and higher education programs will certainly
 shorten that time cycle once we hire people and will ultimately
 reduce the expense to the Government, money which must now be
 spent to provide that language capability after they are hired.
 I have no optimism that programs supporting academic study
 will meet all our needs. I should underline that for you. We will
 clearly still need detailed training programs within the Govern-
 ment. We are not likely to find the exotic languages-Urdu, Farsi,
 or even Arabic-to the degree that we will need it, coming from
 the campuses.
 But surely we can do better in producing in this country fluent
 Spanish and French linguists, German linguists and Japanese lin-
 guists to help us deal with many of the problems that we are going
 to face both as a government and in informing and executing
 foreign policy by an intelligence community in trying to under-
 stand events all over the world.
 But also there are clearly going to be major needs in the indus-
 trial sector for better language capability. Here I speak as a
 layman, not with direct knowledge. But in watching for years, I am
 persuaded that one has a far better prospect of being competitive if
 you can deal in the language of the person with whom you are
 trying to make a sale. We have relied too often in the past in
 letting everybody speak English.

 I would suggest to you that industry has ample cause to join in
 any program that the Government might undertake to add contri-
 butions to better study in the academic world, looking toward a
 larger pool of linguistically qualified personnel for use in our over-
 seas scramble for markets and sales as well as for helping the
 government do its business.
 Thank you very much.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much, Admiral.

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MAJ. GEN. RICHARD X. LARKIN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR,
 DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear as a witness before this
 subcommittee, and to present views concerning the need for foreign language train-
 ing in the defense intelligence community. I plan to discuss briefly some of the
 background affecting the future availability of language-trained personnel for the
 defense intelligence community and the importance of foreign languages to defense
 intelligence.
 Since World War II a number of factors have tended to expand the need for
 foreign language knowledge by the intelligence community, a period when U.S.
 intelligence organizations themselves became established as national institutions.
 During this period, changes have occurred which have enhanced the role languages
 can play in information gathering and analysis in support of U.S. national security
 objectives. Yet, certain recent developments have made language-trained personnel
 more difficult to acquire and their skills more important to maintain.
 Several key developments have affected languages as a vital adjunct of defense
 intelligence:
 A growing number of independent countries, some of which create a need for
 additional languages;
 A vast growth in the quantity of scientific, technical, economic and political
 information and statistics of intelligence value appearing in foreign language
 publications;
 New technologies which vastly increase data gathering capabilities;
 A large postwar immigration to the United States, providing a temporary
 supply of readily-available skills which has sharply diminished;
 A gradual decline of military foreign language and area programs in both
 scope and student population;
 The deemphasis of language and area training in universities in favor of
 physical science, engineering, business and management programs;
 Greater freedeom of international travel, affording new opportunities to learn
 about foreign countries and intercultural differences;
 A need for an increased number of defense attache personnel accompanied by
 a dwindling number of U.S. military deployments and installations abroad;
 Greater opportunities for the international exchange of ideas through activi-
 ties of international organizations and scientific and cultural conferences.
 These factors have affected in one way or another the problem of acquiring
 necessary language knowledge in support of U.S. intelligence objectives and the task
 of maintaining the necessary skills during the professional career of intelligence
 analysts and attaches. Thus, recent trends show that intelligence opportunities
 based upon language skills are increasing rapidly, while the availability of lan-
 guage-trained professionals has been gradually shrinking. This problem is directly
 related to the inability of our educational system to continue to provide the talent
 required for understanding foreign cultures and interpreting their behavior, a task
 which has been entrusted to the national security community.
 Foreign language knowledge provides access to a wide range of intelligence infor-
 mation to include reports, documents and periodicals. The availability of these
 research materials is critical to the analytical needs of DIA. A number of reports
 are regularly translated by the Federal Research Division, Library of Congress
 (FRD) and by such other agencies as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service
 (FBIS) and the Joint Publications Research Service (JPRS).

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 However, in addition to such translations, there is a vital requirement for lan-
 guage knowledge on the part of many DIA analysts. A recent survey of present
 capabilities and future needs in the coming decade indicates that the proportion of
 language-trained analysts would increase from a current figure of about one-third to
 nearly one-half of an expanded analytical staff. As at present, there will continue to
 be a need for personnel in the defense attache system to be trained in the principal
 languages of some 83 countries to which they are assigned.
 We also appreciate the direct relationship between foreign language knowledge
 and the effective pursuit of international studies, as emphasized by provisions of
 House Concurrent Resolution 301. With respect to the utility of foreign language
 knowledge in defense intelligence, many analysts use foreign language as a tool to
 screen publications, scan periodicals, or translate articles related to their work. The
 principal value of language knowledge, however, in the view of intelligence research
 supervisors and analysts, resides in its contribution to understanding other cultures,
 people and their thought processes. This insight enhances the ability of analysts to
 snake judgements, explain situations, describe significant trends in foreign countries
 and more accurately predict future events. In addition, a recent comprehensive
 survey of DIA analytical staff assessed future language and area needs by focusing
 upon trends in countries judges by research supervisors and analysts as most likely
 to have a bearing upon emerging opportunities, problems and threats to U.S.
 security in the coming decade. In general, these trends were identified in countries
 that have traditionally been studied by the intelligence community, although cer-
 tain potential problems indicate the need for skills in a few additional foreign
 languages.
 Our study also concluded that DIA intelligence analysis ought to continue to
 utilize sources in the prevailing Western languages of former colonial regions,
 which comprise most developing countries. This judgement rests upon the fact that
 these languages continue to comprise the principal means of communication in
 governmental, academic, and commercial institutions of the former colonies. In
 addition, it appears that national or, in a few cases, tribal languages will increase in
 importance in some areas, and DIA is carefully studying such potential needs to
 identify the probable payoffs and costs.
 Dia's anticipated needs for language-trained analysts by 1990 reflect increases in
 the number of analysts primarily with knowledge of Arabic, French, German,
 Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. In addition to such well-known
 languages, Dia perceives a need to develop some capabilities in languages of certain
 developing countries to include such languages as Afrikaans, Hindi, Swahili, Urdu,
 ;Pushtu, Malay and Dari. In order to meet most effectively its anticipated needs in
 the coming decade, Dia plans to take the following actions:
 1. Include appropriate language qualifications among selection criteria for new
 analysts and attache personnel.
 2. Maintain language knowledge of analysts and attaches through Dia-sponsored
 refresher courses.
 3. Provide area familiarization and field experience to increase cultural awareness
 of Dia supervisors and analysts.
 4. Support training in certain languages of the developing countries in areas of
 ,potential national security concern to the United States.
 In conclusion, the availability of language-trained personnel for the defense intel-
 ligence community is shrinking while potential information resources around the
 globe have rapidly increased, requiring a significant addition of professionals with
 foreign language skills. Additional language-trained personnel in defense intelli-
 gence will also mean further improvement in the quality of our analysis through
 greater insight into foreign cultures.
 Moreover, I would like to add that there are important advantages inherent in
 expanded language and area capabilities throughout our educational system. I am
 referring to the general benefit likely to accrue to the United States as a result of
 increased public awareness of problems affecting other nations and cultures. In
 addition, such an increase in language and area knowledge would be a significant
 factor in developing public understanding and support for such national security
 concerns as our foreign economic and military assistance objectives.

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much, General. You had two excel-
 lent statements.
 Now, Mr. Wilson, you have to keep up that fine record.
 [The prepared statement of Craig Wilson follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF CRAIG L. WILSON, SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR INTELLIGENCE
 AND C-3 HUMAN RESOURCES, ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
 Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, on behalf of Secretary Weinberger, let
 me express my appreciation for this opportunity to talk about the Department of
 Defense foreign language program, to stress the significance of this program to
 national security and intelligence, and to reflect on Defense needs in the context of
 total national requirements and capabilities.
 Our prevailing need is for foreign language trained personnel to support the
 Defense intelligence mission. This includes linguistic technicians, translators, inter-
 rogators, foreign area analysts, attaches, and a family of specialists working in
 cryptology and signals intelligence. Many of these people also operate high technol-
 ogy equipment of possess unique skills in language related and unrelated disci-
 plines. Our requirements are such that our foreign language student loading will
 increase in excess of 60 percent in the five year period fiscal 1977 through 1982. We
 project continued student load increases at a minimum of five percent each year for
 the next 5 years.
 To meet this need, the Department operates the largest foreign language program
 (or collection of programs) in the Free World. This includes the operation of the
 largest single foreign language schoolhouse-the Defense Language Instiltute For-
 eign Language Center, Monterey, CA-and a comprehensive collection of refresher,

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 maintenance, orientation, and enhancement programs administered in the United
 States and overseas. In 1982, we will send almost 5,000 young military men and
 women to the Defense Language Institute and the State Department's Foreign
 Service Institute for basic, intermediate, and advanced language training. In addi-
 tion, civilian and military personnel attend foreign language programs at the Na-
 tional Security Agency's Cryptologic School, at Defense and State Department insti-
 tutes abroad (such as in Japan, Germany, Taiwan, and Tunisia), and at a myriad of
 colleges, universities, and foreign language schools at home and in other countries.
 Our training efforts are aimed at providing a competent cadre of military and
 civilian personnel to fill the approximate 13,060 Defense positions requiring foreign
 language capability. Of course, the management of such a program includes human
 resource considerations that go far beyond training and education to include man-
 power, personnel administration, basing, and budgeting issues. This requires a com-
 plex integration of ideas, initiatives, and management actions, some of which take
 years to achieve. On the way to continued improvement, we are concentrating on
 five serious problems:
 1. Fill rates (capabilities vs. requirements).
 2. Attrition of trained linguists.
 3. Basic skills training.
 4. Skills maintenance and enhancement.
 5. Program management.
 The Department of Defense has requirements in approximately 52 languages and
 major dialects. As of December 1980 approximately 78-80 percent of those positions
 were filled with trained linguists. For example, our 1980 fill rates for six major
 languages were: Russian-85 percent; Chinese-84 percent; German-76 percent;
 Spanish-58 percent; and Arabic-73 percent. These rates reflect a fairly constant
 staffing capability in these languages for the past four years. This is a quantitative
 assessment; qualitatively, of those positions filled, it is estimated that only 50
 percent of personnel coming into foreign language billets actually possess the neces-
 sary competence level. On-the-job training, work experience, and additional formal
 training may enhance the linguist's capability, but this is admittedly difficult in
 some positions where exposure to the language is not constant (such as in many
 tactical and direct support units). Our fill rate problem may increase as we press on
 in the development of the Rapid Deployment Force. Intelligence units to support the
 RDF will require an estimated additional 874 military linguist positions for six
 major Middle East and African languages and dialects. For these, as well as most all
 languages, there is not a trained, recruitable base within the American population.
 The Department must train its own and make major efforts to retain personnel who
 have been trained. Projected increases in requirements matched against the popula-
 tion available for military service remains a serious concern.
 Attrition of trained linguists has been a problem. About 80 percent of the Depart-
 ment's requirement in foreign languages is for enlisted people; for the past several
 years they have left military service at a rate of 70 percent at the end of their first
 tour, and in excess of 30 percent at the end of the second enlistment. To combat this
 exodus, the Military Departments now offer enlistment bonuses (up to $3,000) and
 reenlistment bonuses (up to $12,500). These incentives, plus recent overall increases
 in base pay and benefits should go a long way to help solve the attrition problem.
 As mentioned before, the Department of Defense operates a substantial foreign
 language training enterprise; the thrust of the effort is for basic skills or initial
 capability. For 1982, we have budgeted in excess of $30 million for the operation of
 the Defense Language Institute and other DLI funded programs. This represents a
 100 percent increase over the last five years. Other major programs funded by the
 Military Departments, NSA, and DIA represent additional resource commitments to
 foreign language training and education. As you know, language is a perishable
 skill, and we have had some difficulty maintaining skill levels in units where
 language is not practiced on a daily basis. This includes tactical combat units and
 reserve forces that are not deployed against an active target until the outbreak of
 hostilities. Recent surveys conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency revealed
 an extremely low percentage of reserve intelligence linguists who had confidence in
 their qualifications for immediate use if mobilized. This condition also exists in
 units stationed within the continental United States and to a lesser degree in units
 abroad. Refresher and maintenance training programs, therefore, have become a
 key initiative for the Department. These include the development and use of self
 study programs, adult continuing education classes, practice on live foreign trans-
 missions, and in-country travel. In 1980, in excess of 116,000 servicemen and women
 were involved in the study of foreign languages beyond the resident programs under
 DLI auspices. Our commitment is to increase these programs to try to make better
 use of the resources at hand and to improve capability at the individual level.

 The management of the Defense Foreign Language program is a cooperative
 effort of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Department of the Army, as
 executive agent for training, and the other Military Departments and Defense
 agencies engaged in intelligence and foreign studies. We also participate with our
 colleagues elsewhere in the Intelligence community to assure an open exchange on
 problems, ideas, and opportunities of mutual interest. At the end of last year we
 established, for the first time, a general officer's steering committee to help guide
 the Department's efforts toward improved education and utilization of foreign lan-
 guage trained personnel.
 In sum, the Department of Defense is moving on several fronts to respond to the
 need for foreign linguists. The American population no longer presents us with a
 large talent bank of bilingual and multi-lingual people on which to draw to meet
 current and future needs, and, therefore, we have been forced to invest heavily in
 our own training and educational programs. The problems, the shortfalls, won't be
 eliminated overnight. We will continue to seek solutions to our own unique prob-
 lems, and to share our experiences as a full and interested partner in all national
 level programs.
 STATEMENT OF CRAIG L. WILSON, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO
 THE DEPUTY UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR COMMU-
 NICATIONS, COMMAND, CONTROL, AND INTELLIGENCE, DE-
 FENSE DEPARTMENT
 Mr. WILSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and other
 members of the committee. On behalf of Secretary Weinberger, I
 too would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to
 talk about the defense foreign language program, the importance
 and significance of that program to national security and intelli-
 gence, and to reflect on the needs of the Department of Defense in
 the context of total national requirements and capabilities.
 Our prevailing need is for foreign-language trained personnel to
 support the defense intelligence mission. This includes linguistic
 technicians, translators, interrogators, foreign area analysts, atta-
 ches, and a family of specialists working in cryptology and signals
 intelligence. Many of these people also operate high-technology
 equipment or posses unique skills in language and unrelated disci-
 plines. Our requirements are such that our foreign-language stu-
 dent loading will increase in excess of 60 percent in the 5-year
 period fiscal 1977 through fiscal 1982. We project continued student
 load increases at a minimum of 5 percent each year for the next 5
 years.
 To meet this need, the Department operates the largest foreign-
 language program, or collection of programs, in the free world.
 This includes the operation of the largest single foreign-language
 schoolhouse, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language
 Center in Monterey-which I know you visited recently-and also
 a comprehensive collection of refresher, maintenance, orientation,
 and enhancement programs administered in the United States and
 overseas. In 1982 we will send almost 5,000 military men and
 women to the Defense Language Institute and the State Depart-
 ment's Foreign Service Institute for basic, intermediate, and ad-
 vanced language training. In addition, civilian and military person-
 nel attend foreign-language programs at the National Security
 Agency's Cryptologic School and at Defense and State Department
 institutes abroad-such as in Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Tunisia,
 and other countries-and at a myriad of other colleges, universi-
 ties, and foreign-language schools at home and in other countries.
 Our training efforts are aimed at providing a competent cadre of
 military and civilian personnel to fill the approximately 13,060
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 defense positions requiring foreign-language capability of varying
 levels. Of course, the management of such a program includes
 human resource considerations that go beyond education and train-
 ing, such as manpower, personnel administration, basing, and
 budgeting issues. This requires a complex integration of ideas, ini-
 tiatives, and management actions, some of which take years to
 achieve.
 On the way to continued improvement, we are concentrating on
 five serious problem areas: First, fill rates; that is, our capabilities
 versus our requirements. Second, the attrition of trained linguists.
 'Third, basic skills training. Fourth, skills maintenance and en-
 hancement. And fifth, program management.
 The Department of Defense has requirements in approximately
 52 languages and major dialects. As of December 1980 approxi-
 mately 78 to 80 percent of those positions were filled with trained
 linguists. For example, our 1980 fill rates for six major languages
 were: Russian, 85 percent; German, 76 percent; Chinese, 84 percent;
 Spanish, 58 percent; and Arabic, 73 percent.
 These rates reflect a fairly constant staffing capability in these
 languages for the past 4 years. This, however, is a quantitative
 assessment. Qualitatively, of those positions filled, it is estimated
 that only 50 percent of the personnel coming into foreign-language
 billets actually possess the necessary level of competence. On-the-
 ,job training, work experience, and additional formal training may
 enhance the linguist's capability, but this is admittedly difficult in
 some positions where exposure to the language is not constant-
 such as in many tactical and direct support units. Our fill-rate
 problem may increase as we press on in the development of the
 Rapid Deployment Force. Intelligence units to support the RDF
 will require an estimated additional 874 military linguist positions
 for 6 major Middle East and African languages and dialects. For
 these, as well as most all languages, there is not a trained recruita-
 ble base within the American population. The Department must
 train its own and make major efforts to retain personnel who have
 been trained. Projected increases in requirements matched against
 the population available for military service remains one of our
 most serious concerns.
 Attrition of trained linguists has always been a problem. About
 80 percent of the Department's requirement in foreign languages is
 for enlisted people. For the past several years these people have
 left military service at a rate of 70 percent at the end of their first
 tour and in excess of 30 percent at the end of their second enlist-
 ment. To combat this exodus, the military departments are now
 offering enlistment bonuses of up to $3,000 and reenlistment bo-
 nuses up to $12,500. These incentives, plus recent overall increases
 in base pay and benefits should go a long way to help solve the
 attrition problem. Admittedly, increased compensation is not the
 only route to retention, but it is probably far in front of whatever
 else there is.
 As mentioned before, the Department of Defense operates a sub-
 stantial foreign language training enterprise. The thrust of this
 effort is for basic skills or initial capability. For 1982 we have
 budgeted in excess of $30 million for the operation of the Defense
 Language Institute and other DLI-funded programs. This repre-

 sents a 100-percent increase over the last 5 years in funding. Other
 major programs funded by the Military Departments, NSA, and
 DIA represent additional resource commitments to foreign-lan-
 guage training and education. As you know, language is a perisha-
 ble skill, and we have had some difficulty maintaining skill levels
 in units where language is not practiced on a daily basis. This
 includes tactical combat units and reserve forces that are not de-
 ployed against an active target until the outbreak of hostilities.
 Recent surveys conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency re-
 vealed an extremely low percentage of reserve intelligence lin-
 guists who had confidence in their own qualifications for immedi-
 ate use if mobilized. This condition also exists in active units
 stationed within the continental United States and, to a lesser
 degree, in units abroad.
 Refresher and maintenance training programs, therefore, have
 become a key initiative for the Department following a heavy
 investment in initial training. These include the development and
 use of self-study programs, continuing education classes, practice
 on live foreign transmissions, and in-country travel. In 1980, in
 excess of 116,000 service men and women were involved in the
 study of foreign languages beyond the resident programs under
 DLI auspices. Our commitment is to increase these programs to try
 to make better use of the resources at hand and to improve capabil-
 ity at the individual level.
 The management of the defense foreign-language program is a
 cooperative effort of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the
 Department of the Army as executive agent for training, and other
 military departments and defense agencies engaged in intelligence
 and foreign studies. We also participate with our colleagues else-
 where in the intelligence community to assure an open exchange
 on problems, ideas, and opportunities of mutual interest. At the
 end of last year we established, for the first time, a general officers'
 steering committee to help guide the Department's efforts toward
 improved education and utilization of foreign language trained per-
 sonnel. And I can report that the efforts of that group have been
 substantial already.
 In sum, the Department of Defense is moving on several fronts to
 respond to the need for foreign linguists. The American population
 no longer presents us with a large talent bank of bilingual and
 multilingual people on which to draw to meet current and future
 needs. Therefore, we have been forced to invest heavily in our own
 training and educational programs. The problems, the shortfalls,
 will not be eliminated overnight. We will continue to seek solutions
 to our own unique problems and to share our experiences as a full
 and interested partner in all national-level programs.
 Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much, Mr. Wilson.
 Just by way of coincidence, today we are again on the Depart-
 ment of Defense authorization bill. We have heard from all three
 of you about our needs. And I have an amendment asking the
 Department of Defense to study whether or not we should not be
 mandating foreign-language study at all the military academies
 and R.O.T.C. and report back to Congress within a year.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 My understanding is that my amendment is noncontroversial,
 though they do not always turn out that way when you start off
 that way.
 All three of you have talked about the immediate security prob-
 lem you face because of the foreign-language issue. It is also safe to
 say that there is a more overriding kind of security interest. I
 should not make this statement; let me pose the question: Is it not
 true that there is a more overriding kind of security interest in
 making sure that we understand one another so that we do not
 precipitate some misunderstanding or miscalculation? This would
 obviously be true in the case of the Soviet Union. I do not know if
 any of you care to comment on that.
 Admiral INMAN. Mr. Chairman, in the 1970's or beginning in the
 late 1960's, we embarked on a long period of time in which the
 prevailing attitude in making decisions on budgets, both in the
 executive branch and in the legislative branch on the whole nation-
 al security account was aimed at what can we do without and, in
 that process, giving up knowledge in any detail about most of the
 countries of the world that did not represent an immediate mili-
 tary threat to our interests. That is, simply dropping activities and
 even dropping requirements to sustain the ability to read, to follow
 events in those countries in their own languages, to really under-
 stand the full significance of activities.
 There is now a much broader recognition as we move into the
 1980's that it is not that benign world, that the interests of this
 country are impacted heavily in political and economic ways as
 well as military ways and are going to be heavily impacted
 throughout the decade by competition for raw materials, for re-
 sources, for markets, by instability all over the Third World.
 The degree to which bright observers with a good strong lan-
 guage ability are present in those countries as part of the Foreign
 Service, as part of the defense attaches, and who are necessary as
 clandestine intelligence with a language ability to understand
 events as they begin to settle long in advance of the time that we
 have the mobs in the streets and the sudden appeals for help, to
 help suppress riots before a friendly government collapses and is
 replaced by anarchy.
 I have a great worry that we have not, as a country or as a
 government, faced up to the need to be looking toward what pres-
 ent, what representation, what observation do we need in every
 country with which we have any potential interest, as opposed to
 what we can do without.
 Mr. SIMON. I thank you.
 Let me, if I may, Admiral, direct another question. And if in any
 of these areas we get into classified information, obviously we are
 not in a position to use that here or receive that here.
 But let me add I have been impressed by your statements. In
 these days where the CIA's headlines are not always the most
 favorable, let the record show that there are many of us who are
 most impressed by the Deputy Director of the CIA and your pres-
 ence here today is an indication of that.
 Mr. Wilson, in your statement, I would like to find out whether
 this is analogous in the CIA. You say-and these are rather star-
 tling statistics-as of December 1980 approximately 78 to 80 per-
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 cent of those positions that you require were filled with trained
 linguists, and you say this is a "quantitative assessment. Qualita-
 tively, if those positions filled, it is estimated that only 50 percent
 of personnel coming into foreign-language billets actually possess
 the necessary competence level."
 Now, would it be fair, Admiral, to say that the CIA faces a
 somewhat similar situation?
 Admiral INMAN. Both CIA and the National Security Agency,
 from my knowledge, face comparable situations, in that there are
 substantial numbers of billets in those agencies-and, as you know,
 the actual numbers are classified-where one must have a high
 order of linguistic skills, not just passive. And it is increasingly
 difficult to find people with any rudimentary training in the lan-
 guages that you need.
 We are still fortunate to be able to find personnel with high
 credentials, high quality, with demonstrated language aptitude on
 tests. We can hire, but then the Government has to spend an
 extended period of time to train them with language capability
 after you get them. And it is particularly time to get them to the
 level of fluency that is necessary that is worrisome to me as we get
 on to dealing with the problems of the decade.
 Mr. SIMON. If I may direct this question to all three of you as a
 final question. Admiral Inman has called our foreign-language defi-
 ciency a major hazard to our national security.
 General Larkin, you did not use quite the same words, but you
 said, basically, we face very serious problems, and, Mr. Wilson, you
 have said the same.
 Would it be correct to say that it would be of service to the
 national security if we could build a base in our elementary
 schools, high schools, and colleges and universities that the mili-
 tary could be recruiting from that would be of substantial assist-
 ance to the national security?
 What I am trying to do is reverse what you suggested, General.
 Is that true?
 General LARKIN. There is no question, sir, it would be of immea-
 surable value to the National Security Agency, in my estimation.
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Wilson?
 Mr. WILSON. It could accelerate the long leadtime, the training
 time required to produce linguists. I mentioned before that 80
 percent or more of our linguists are actually enlisted men. The
 training time for these people, the whole training time, basic train-
 ing time, language training and training in other specialty areas,
 could amount to as much as 2 years before the individual is actual-
 ly ready for his operational tour.
 These people, as I mentioned, leave at a very high rate, and we
 must continue to replace that force. I would contend that any
 available resource that could lower that training time, and that
 could help us increase the number of people against our require-
 ments is an obvious help to answering the national security mis-
 sion.
 Mr. SIMON. Yes, Admiral?
 Admiral INMAN. If I might add something.
 Mr. SIMON. Yes.

 Admiral INMAN. I think we must always include, when we talk
 about our national security concerns, not only the Defense Depart-
 ment but also the Central Intelligence Agency and the Foreign
 Service and the means by which we communicate with the outside
 world.
 I see for all of those needs that a broad-based program for
 language training in elementary schools has to be of major benefit
 to the national security across the board. And there are clearly
 also some benefits for industry that are going to come from that.
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Coleman.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Admiral, I find your testimony quite disturbing. You mentioned
 that currently we have to rely upon secondary sources instead of
 primary sources for much of our interpretation and research work
 because of the limited manpower of qualified linguists in this coun-
 try. We contract out a great deal of this work.
 You further state that experience has shown that the value of
 intelligence derived from translations like this is sometimes limited
 because of the accuracy of the translation and its timeliness.
 You further go on and say that the most subtle changes in a
 society are often lost to the individual who cannot converse or read
 in the language of that country. We are especially vulnerable, you
 say, when it comes to the more exotic languages of Arabic and
 Farsi.
 My question is, Is this lack of training and understanding and
 ability to speak these languages a factor such that our intelligence
 community was not aware as much as it should have been or that
 we, as a country, were more surprised than we should have been in
 the Iranian revolution and the eventual taking of hostages in Iran?
 Admiral INMAN. Mr. Coleman, there are two parts that play on
 the problem. One is the decade-long drawdown in manpower in the
 intelligence community and in representation abroad. Actually, it
 is longer than a decade; it really goes back to 1967, when our
 principal interest was in the balance of payments and we began
 reducing our presence overseas to reduce the outflow of gold. And
 then it got a substantial momentum in the late 1960's, early 1970's,
 first as Vietnamization, then in trading off manpower for technol-
 ogy, then drawdowns for a failure to predict the October war.
 The cumulative effect of all of that-again the actual figures are
 classified; I would be pleased, in a closed session, to give you some
 specific examples-but the cumulative impact was a drawdown
 ranging from a low of about 22 percent of those people dedicated to
 analysis in some agencies to as high as a 38-percent reduction in
 technical collection manpower.
 While that drawdown in manpower was going on, there was a
 comparable loss in language skills as the youngsters flowing out of
 campuses had less and less language training and as we moved as a
 country into the situation where we have less second-generation
 people who had learned to speak a language in their home availa-
 ble to us.
 So there was a compacting: As one drew down that manpower,
 increasingly that which you had left focused on the greatest con-
 cerns, the principal military adversaries; and for the bulk of the
 rest of the world, and particularly for countries which were consid-
 84-188  0-81--8

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 ered to be friends, a minimal presence to observe the activities
 became the rule both in the intelligence community and in some
 cases in the Foreign Service.
 Out of that you ended up not having people with a language skill
 present to follow the conversation in the bazaars or on the campus-
 es, in the universities or in the mosques, to understand what was
 brewing in the way of a revolt which ought to have been available
 for good, bright, linguistically qualified observers to detect long
 before it ever reached the state where it was in the streets.
 My conclusion is that both the shortage of people, the shortage,
 the reductions in people present in countries abroad and the lack
 of language skills all contributed to our failure to detect the activi-
 ty there. I think it impacted on the slowness with recognizing what
 was happening in Central America, where in a great many cases,
 lack of representation, lack of language skills, lack of raw report-
 ing that ought to have been detected, the efforts to ship arms, build
 guerrilla movements, long before it became the problem that it is
 now.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Well, how can we consider our intelligence-gather-
 ing apparatus in this country first class if we do not have this
 capability? Do you consider us second class because of this lack of
 ability?
 Admiral INMAN. In our coverage of our principal adversaries, I
 would describe it as a first-class capability in dealing with military
 threat, in dealing with warning against a Pearl Harbor kind of
 attack. In understanding new weapons systems and understanding
 political developments, even economic developments, there would
 probably be those who would disagree with me, but I would veer
 toward second class in that status, because of reductions in man-
 power and skills assigned to collect and report on the rest of the
 world. My view is that our capability is far short of what it ought
 to be.
 But I began with a basic precept: that this country ought to take
 the approach of what might we need to know, not what can we do
 without, in deciding what representation both from Foreign Service
 and from the intelligence-collection capabilities we put in foreign
 countries.
 Mr. COLEMAN. What you are saying is that of such areas as the
 undeveloped countries, the Third World, where we are dependent
 for many of our resources that we import into this country, that we
 have a second-class language capability; therefore, we have a
 second-class intelligence-gathering informational structure underly-
 ing that.
 And I think that is something that we have to tell this country. I
 think it is something that you ought to get out and push, support
 this type of legislation, and we will certainly work with whatever
 resources we have, because I think it is not an overstatement.
 Your last few words were that it is "important to our own
 survival and well-being." And it is time this message got out to the
 American people.
 Let me ask you how long can we operate in this vacuum or in
 this timeframe? At what point does it start impeding to the degree
 where we cannot even handle what we are doing now as far as our
 lack of capability in language training? What timeframe do you

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 see? Collapse this down. When do we need to get this done? Give us
 a timeframe so that we can go out and tell this to the people and to
 the Congress.
 Admiral INMAN. Mr. Coleman, the rebuilding process for the
 whole intelligence capability is going to take a long time. Just the
 time it takes to train linguists is one of the pacing events.
 I have a rather pessimistic view of what the 1980s are likely to
 be like. I believe we are likely to encounter instability in much of
 the Third World, intense economic competition, strains on our
 alliances, drawing out of the first two. And I see no sign of any
 slackening of the momentum of the Soviets that we have been
 watching now at a very steady pace for some 16 years. The time is
 now when the rebuilding effort needs to get underway. It is not one
 that crash efforts are likely to have a high payoff.
 We can do things like take greater advantage with more external
 assistance, contracts for capabilities in industry to help us in the
 near term in the intelligence community in some of the translation
 skills that we need. But those will not help us in getting represen-
 tation abroad.
 Again, I am treading my way through, since the hearing is in the
 unclassified mode, through some very treacherous area for being
 specific with you, because the actual details on budget size and
 personnel size are classified. There is a very substantial upturn in
 both the investment dollars and in people in the budget that you
 have in front of you, which is a good shot in the arm, to start with.
 But I am more concerned-and really what drew me out in my
 conversations with the chairman to volunteer to come testify
 before this committee today is-that we need more than just short-
 term fixes. We need to embark on a long-term program that we
 will have confidence that will carry us through the latter part of
 the 1980s and through the 1990s with a ready pool of the kinds of
 skills that we need to have, and we are going to need to have, I
 believe, an even substantially larger community.
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Erdahl.
 Mr. ERDARL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
 commend you for your ongoing involvement in this concern over
 better language training for the people in this country, whether
 they are in the military or civilian Foreign Service or whatnot.
 In addition to being on this committee, I serve on the Foreign
 Affairs Committee. I think that in nearly every meeting or recep-
 tion we are reminded with members of the German Bundestag last
 night, they all came in speaking with their eloquent, able English,
 and most of us cannot converse with them in their language. So we
 have a real deficiency with them in our country.
 Mr. Chairman, you may be aware that when I was in the Army
 back in the 1950's as an enlisted man, I acquired an MOS as a
 linguist. Moreover, I found at that time they were interested in
 Korean and Russian and Chinese. But they did not have much use
 for my Norwegian, and I ended up as the company supply clerk
 instead. [Laughter.]
 Mr. ERDAHL. But a couple of questions. You had already men-
 tioned the DOD bill. Also, we have the military pay bill, which I
 think will probably be on the schedule later this week. I am per-

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 suaded that we must not only have linguists, but we must be
 willing to compensate our people in the military better.
 I say this not to flatter you, but I think, Mr. Chairman, you and I
 agree, and maybe some of the others on this panel as well, that
 maybe we could transfer some of those billions from the MX mis-
 sile project into things like language. Maybe that is not so glamor-
 ous. I often think that we as Americans can put men on the Moon,
 and yet we do not train mechanics that can adjust the points on
 our car. And so I think here in this area, some of these basic things
 like understanding other people is so vital.
 A couple of questions. What are other countries doing in this
 area? We have had some reference to our adversaries and other
 countries in the world. But what are other countries doing in a
 comparable way in learning not only English but other languages
 as well? Would anyone wish to respond to that? General?
 General LARKIN. With record to our primary adversary, the
 Soviet Union, Mr. Simon who just visited there, probably found out
 that they have a very intense, widespread, serious, and expensive
 program to train linguists. It takes about 7 years to produce an
 attache, for example, in the Soviet Union. They are selected in
 secondary school. Individuals with talents are then encouraged to
 develop at least two foreign languages.
 When they complete the language training, they are fluent in at
 least two foreign languages other than their native tongue.
 I am not aware of what other countries do.
 Admiral INMAN. Mr. Erdahl, I think the record varies greatly
 over what other countries are doing. Many of the Third World
 countries do not even have an English-language training program
 or at least a minimal one, which puts all the more pressure on us
 to communicate, to be able to speak in the language.
 Of the more advanced countries, and particularly the ones that
 are our friends, our allies, but also our economic competitors, have
 very heavy language training programs. In a tour as an attache in
 Sweden some years ago, my recollection is that by the time a
 youngster finished secondary education, they had been required
 not only in keeping up their Swedish, if they can find all that
 many other people that can converse them, but they have done at
 least 8 years of English and had done, if they were going to go the
 track toward universities, they had done 4 or 5 years in a third
 language.
 And that same general approach occurs in many of the other
 countries. With our British colleauges, I am afraid that we may
 have inherited some of our bad habits from them, with the general
 attitude that we have conveyed for years of "Let them speak Eng-
 lish," as our general attitude toward other countries.
 Mr. SIMON. If my colleague would yield.
 Mr. ERDAHL. I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. Two things. One, in the Soviet Union-and our col-
 league, Tom Coleman, was with us on this trip-you start language
 either in the first grade or fourth grade, depending on where you
 live, and starting in the 1990's everyone starts foreign languages in
 the first grade.
 Second, both General Larkin and Admiral Inman happened to
 mention, or did in the course of their testimony, we visited a

 language academy in Kiev, and they mentioned five languages they
 were emphasizing, most of them the traditional. One of them was
 Urdu, just stood out like that. I would guess-and I stand to be
 corrected- probably in the entire United States we do not have 30
 students of Urdu.
 ?        So other countries are doing things, and if for no other reasons
 than competitive reasons, we ought to be doing it. Thank you.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned, and I think, Admi-
 ral, you mentioned also, about our friendly competitors. Think of
 ?       the Japanese and others who come here selling the various things
 they sell to us, and they do not expect us to furnish an interpreter;
 they speak English. And yet when our businessmen go over there, I
 think we are at a disadvantage because we usually have to ask
 them for their interpreter.
 Another question, and I think you touched on this in the testimo-
 ny, any one of you three gentlemen: Where basically do you get our
 recruit your linguists? Some obviously you train right from scratch
 who have an aptitude for it. Some, I think you mentioned, are
 second-generation people who still have a fluency in the language.
 Some may be coming out of the few colleges and universities that
 teach and emphasize the language.
 Can you touch on that a bit? Do you really have to train most of
 them basically from scratch?
 Admiral INMAN. I will defer to my colleagues on the military
 side. My experience in working with civilian linguists in the last
 two agencies has been that overwhelmingly now there is a pretty
 good supply of romance-language students, except probably not
 enough in Spanish. But there is a pretty substantial supply of
 applicants with French or Italian capability, substantially more
 than we have any need for. But they have already demonstrated
 their skill, and you can train them in a second language.
 Overwhelmingly, we have to take people, most of them academic
 university-level qualifications, a BA degree or higher, we test them
 and they show high aptitude to learn languages, and then we
 spend the time and the money to train them in a language after we
 hire them.
 General LARKIN. We have two problems. First, we are attempting
 to recruit civilian linguists for analytic purposes and military lin-
 guists for attache duties. Our best source still appears to be a
 former military man who, while in military service, has been
 taught the language and then has become a civilian analyst.
 Second, evaluate potential based on high school and college per-
 formance. We select those with a high aptitude for learning a
 foreign language or improving one they have already learned.
 Mr. WILSON. For the large enlisted input in the Department of
 Defense, which this year will number close to 4,000 enlisted people
 to be trained at the basic level in foreign languages, virtually none
 of those people possess any foreign-language skill.
 It is true that the intelligence community is getting the recruits
 that are scoring the highest on the aptitude tests at the time that
 they are screened at the time of initial enlistment. We are getting
 in excess of 80 percent of those who are scoring in the top 80th
 percentile of the ASVAB, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
 Battery. We are getting the best that there is.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 However, we can observe that the level of tested aptitude for
 foreign languages is less than it was a decade ago. We are not
 putting anybody in school that does not have an adequate aptitude.
 We are not going to try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. But
 we have people going into entry level language training who pos-
 sess no other foreign-language skills, and that is the bulk of the
 people that the Department of Defense is training right now.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you very much.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. Let me just note the presence in the audience here of
 Jack Otero. A reference has been made to the Perkins Commission.
 Jack is one of those who is very active in the Commission. We
 appreciate your being here.
 Mr. DeNardis.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Let me apologize to you and members of the committee and our
 guests for being late. I have tried to catch up by perusing the
 testimony. But I hope I do not cover something that has already
 been covered.
 Knowledge of a foreign language is indisputably a need for us
 militarily and otherwise as a nation. Knowledge of foreign lan-
 guage for the purposes that you would present, is it enough? How
 limited is mere technical knowledge of the language? What I am
 driving at, obviously, is knowledge, broader-based knowledge, about
 the Nation, the culture, which may result in nuances of expression
 that are important for the work that you do. And do you look at a
 more broader-based training for your requirements?
 Admiral INMAN. Mr. DeNardis, we do look at that that way, and
 you are exactly on target. We have differing levels of need. There
 are cases where you need simply someone who can mechanically
 translate an unclassified document which is available to you from
 an open source.
 And the difficulty that grows is if it is something that is very
 technical, our much greater worry has been analysts with a fluen-
 cy in a language as well as others who can understand the nu-
 ances, who can understand the culture of the country and can very
 quickly assimilate the real significance, that if you simply read a
 technical translation you may miss :a great deal.
 I think the classic example is the slowness in recognizing the
 threat to our interests of the Islam situation. Much of it was
 simply not understanding the fervor that lay behind a lot of the
 words in a different language.
 General LARKIN. In the defense segment of the intelligence com-
 munity, we have a very dramatic need for the understanding that
 you have just stated. It does us very little good to have technical
 translations without knowing in fact what the man meant when he
 wrote the article. We have to know the idioms, we have to know
 the axioms, the nuances of the expressions. And you cannot get
 that from a mechnical translation. This, in fact, requires the cul-
 tural understanding of the language as it is spoken. We could not
 survive without a deeper than a technical surface knowledge.
 Mr. WILSON. Foreign language training is obviously the first step
 toward the acculturation that Admiral Inman and General Larkin
 are talking about. In addition to that, however, we need to press on
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 in addition to cultural studies with more stress in international
 geophysics, economics, and the understanding of foreign technology
 and science.
 A deliberate effort must be given to these areas at the graduate
 study level, in order to meet some of the analytical needs of the
 Department of Defense.
 Mr. DENARDis. I have always thought that the value of the draft
 and, in particular, the way in which ROTC's flourished during that
 period-and I am a product of that system-was to produce for
 military service, if only in the short run, people who had language
 skills and liberal arts training to be able to support in a skillful
 way that proficiency and that that was useful to the military if
 only for 3, or 4, or 5, years.
 I note that the admiral in his testimony on page 4 makes note of
 that, makes passing reference to it, anyway. If this has already
 been covered, I will look at the record. But I am interested in
 language training and liberal arts training to support that at the
 service academies. What is the curriculum like at the service acad-
 emies?
 Admiral INMAN. I think we are probably not the best witnesses
 to have on that score. But I would encourage you to pursue that,
 even if I end up getting in some hot water with some very distin-
 guished military personnel who over the last two decades worried
 that we were not producing enough technical skills from the serv-
 ice colleges.
 I think the criticism was very valid at the time, but again, in
 looking at what the 1980's and 1990's look like, at least to me,
 'where we are far more likely to have to deal with very complex
 situations and instability all over the Third World, that there is
 increasingly going to be a premium on some liberal arts training
 and certainly language skills in our military.
 Mr. WILSON. We can provide that data for your record, what the
 service academies are doing right now. We have provided it to the
 .President's commission 21/2 years ago, so we can give you an update
 on that for the record, if you wish.
 Mr. SIMON. If my colleague would yield. As of right now, we have
 no requirement in the academies. There is an amendment-I will
 ]lobby him while I am here-I have an amendment today that asks
 the Department of Defense to study the possibility of requiring it
 at the academies.
 I might also mention, Mr. Wilson, that one of the things you
 might want to look at the in the Department of Defense, we have
 no such requirement for ROTC, another obvious source for develop-
 ing linguists.
 I would think, in fact, if you, Mr. Wilson, could take a look at
 that question, and maybe within 60 days get back to us and see if
 maybe we should not modify our policy on ROTC.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Thank you.
 Mr. SIMON. We thank all three witnesses for really excellent
 testimony here this morning. We are grateful to you. It is not
 exactly comforting testimony, but it is testimony we need to hear.
 Thank you very much.

 Admiral INMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are all greatly
 appreciative for all of your interest in this field.
 General LARKIN. We certainly are.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you.
 Our next witness is Mr. Moorhead Kennedy, who was one of our
 hostages in Iran, whose wife became a spokesperson, unofficially
 designated, for the hostages.
 STATEMENT OF MOORHEAD KENNEDY, FOREIGN SERVICE
 OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Kennedy, before you begin your testimony, if you
 can describe-I forget what the precise title is-the work you are
 doing right now in connection with the Cathedral of St. John the
 Divine in New York.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I am, as you know, retiring from the Foreign Service and begin-
 ning to pick up my new function at the Cathedral of St. John the
 Divine, executive director of the Cathedral Peace Institute. This is
 the brandnew foreign policy institute designed to study and make
 clearer to the American people the role of religion in foreign
 affairs.
 Quite obviously, I reached a conclusion about the importance of
 the role of religion, as a captive of a religious revolution. What we
 really hope to do through publications, seminars, public speaking,
 is to raise the level of consciousness of the American people of the
 importance of religion. And by that we include, therefore, foreign
 cultures and, by extension, foreign languages.
 I think that the concerns of this committee are very close to the
 concerns which led us to start this institute, of which I will be the
 executive director.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you. We will let you get that commercial in, a
 good commercial, before you begin your testimony on the subject at
 hand.
 We welcome your statement at this point, and then we will toss
 some questions at you.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I did not prepare a written submission, because I am not here in
 an official capacity. I am sort of halfway between my 21-year
 career as a Foreign Service officer and my new responsibilities, and
 I hope it is understood that I am speaking for myself, my own
 observations as a career Foreign Service officer, and the impor-
 tance of language training.
 Mr. SIMON. That is correct.
 Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to begin by pointing out I am very
 personally keen on foreign languages. I came into the Foreign
 Service with French and Arabic. I subsequently picked up, in an
 assignment at Athens, quite a bit of Greek. The Foreign Service
 Institute trained me in Spanish very well before my assignment as
 economic counselor in Chile. And my wife, Louisa Kennedy, has
 taken the French course and has spoken French most of her life.
 So to us, foreign languages were very much a part of our lives, part
 of our dedication to the Foreign Service.
 And in addition to all the very important defense considerations,
 technical considerations so ably described by the previous witnesses
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 and to which I think any Foreign Service officer would certainly
 subscribe, part of the role of the Foreign Service is to get into the
 life of a foreign country, to get under the skin, as it were, of its
 society, to get to know people, not just across a desk, not in a
 contact or interviewing situation, not just in the analysis of docu-
 ments, but to know them, to have friends with whom you can
 converse, because only in that way can you get a real feel for how
 that country is reacting to the United States, how it is reacting to
 ?      other forces.
 The difference between people who know a country on that basis
 and those who know it only, shall we say, impersonally through
 documentation, even if they can read the language, is absolutely
 fundamental. My personal belief is that the Foreign Service, within
 its budgetary limitations, does a pretty good job of training in
 foreign languages. Certainly, the Foreign Service Institute is a
 superb language training institute.
 I went through language review in Arabic. I learned my Greek 2
 hours a day after hours, again with the Foreign Service system. I
 took the entire course in Spanish, and my wife took the entire
 course in French, and it is excellent. I think it is a model. It is as
 good probably as any in the world.
 But having said that, there are some problems that it encounters
 and that the Foreign Service necessarily encounters and which, I
 think, your bill very clearly addresses. Both my wife and I noticed,
 in taking the Spanish and the French courses, which were basic
 courses, that the language aptitude of many of the incoming re-
 cruits to the Foreign Service was very low indeed. I noticed that
 one of the witnesses mentioned a falling rate of achievement on
 the aptitude tests administered within the military establishment.
 And this was certainly my own impression for the younger men
 and women coming into the Foreign Service.
 I think, in part, their English training in their own language was
 very deficient. I think we all know, all of us who are parents-I
 think that is probably a large part of the committee-that there is
 a declining feel and grasp of our own native language. We are not
 an articulate language. We do not communicate as well with each
 other as we should.
 The youngsters these days, when you listen to them speak, you
 wonder how any idea is passing from one brain to the other. I do
 not think I am exaggerating; I think we all have that feeling.
 But I think, in part, it is because we do not emphasize foreign
 languages. I noticed that when I went through a language training
 program, be it Spanish or Arabic-and I did, I might add, Arabic
 under the British, who do have a very good Arabic training pro-
 gram, or did, in their school near Beirut-but all of us found that
 our English was improving because we were thinking communica-
 tively. We were thinking with much greater precision. And this,
 quite apart from or in addition to the use of language when you
 are dealing with foreigners, is a very important cultural adjunct.
 So I think the lack of language skills or aptitude possessed by
 these younger officers coming in-and this was not, of course, all of
 them, but too many, let us say-was because they had not been
 exposed to foreign languages at an early enough age.

 There is another problem, too, that was again touched on by the
 witnesses. Language training is only part of it. You must practice
 it once you get in the field. In the military mode they were talking
 about units that were in, shall we say, ready units, but ones which
 did not have, for obvious reasons, exposure to the areas where they
 were trained to operate in. But in the Foreign Service we often see
 the phenomenon repeated in the American business community,
 repeated in the American media abroad, our international lawyers
 stationed abroad, of Americans who really have very little curiosity
 about the countries to which they are assigned, not enough knowl-
 edge to get to know the people, even if they have been technically
 trained in the language.
 They make their friends among the American community. They
 sort of draw their linguistic wagons in a circle and within that and
 within the comfort of people who speak only English and a few
 token foreigners who want to climb over the wagon and come into
 the American campground. They lead very, very American lives.
 And I think, in part, this is because too many of our countrymen-
 I would say increasingly-inarticulate, are also not sufficiently
 attuned to foreign cultures via the foreign language route when
 they were very young.
 You notice our Dutch colleagues, Dutch diplomats, Dutch busi-
 nessmen, Italian, German, particularly, are much more prepared to
 become part of the furniture, to use a compliment that was paid to
 us by a Chilean friend, part of the life of the country, simply
 because they have been learning foreign languages all their lives
 and because they do not have what Admiral Inman referred to, the
 kind of arrogance that others should be expected to know English.
 I think, in response also to a question raised about whether our
 misfortunes in Tehran had to do with a lack of capacity to under-
 stand what was going to happen to us, many of the Embassy in
 Tehran spoke very good Farsi on the Foreign Service side. John
 Limbert, Mike Metrincko, Ann Swift, among others, and Victor
 Thomson, the political counselor, had varying degrees of proficien-
 cy. Barry Rosen, on the cultural and press side. Some, almost
 bilingual. One had an Iranian wife.
 I think for an Embassy that was rather hard to staff, for obvious
 reasons, I think we were doing pretty well. Two in the military,
 one better than the other, had some foreign language, had Farsi.
 And we had foreign language technicians. There was nobody from
 the CIA who had any Farsi. I think this was a problem for us, a
 very definite problem.
 I think, however, that the basic thought I would like to leave
 from my own personal experience with this committee is that we
 need to be more communicative, we need to be less provincial. And
 the best way to do that is, besides increasing the funding of the
 FSI, the Foreign Service Institute, besides increasing foreign-lan-
 guage training at West Point and at Colorado Springs, I think it
 should go right down to the primary school level, because that is
 where we are going to get naturally.
 That is when you do it best. That is when you grow up with a far
 more open view of other societies. And I think that is something
 we desperately need.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 That concludes my testimony. I would be very happy to answer
 questions.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you very much, Mr. Kennedy.
 First, in relation to the situation in Iran, I have been told-and
 ?       you seemed to indicate that this was not accurate-that 3 of the 52
 hostages were fully fluent in Farsi. Is that not correct?
 Mr. KENNEDY. That is not correct. Let me be very precise for the
 record. John Limbert, whose wife, Parvani, is Iranian, spoke beau-
 tiful Farsi, learned originally, I believe, in the Peace Corps and
 kept up through academic study.
 He was also a very good Arabist, and two of his students in
 Arabic, Barry Rosen of the Information Agency, again bilingual,
 Victor Thomseth, whose basic language was Thai, had been consul
 general in Isfahan and spoke very good Farsi.
 Ann Swift-that is, Elizabeth Ann Swift, to give her full name-
 was a newcomer; she had just been through training but spoke it
 very well.
 On the military side, Colonel Charles Scott, who was with the
 Defense Liaison Office, spoke pretty good Farsi, quite good. And
 Colonel Shafer, who was the defense attache, spoke enough to be
 able to do his job.
 Now, all the Foreign Service officers I mentioned were on the
 political side, or present culture. On the economic side, we had a
 very bad deficiency. I was only there temporarily, for a 3-month
 assignment, although Arabic was one of my languages.
 Mr. SIMON. That was a rather long temporary assignment.
 Mr. KENNEDY. It was a very interesting temporary assignment.
 [Laughter.]
 But it is perfectly true, as the admiral points out, that we need
 better economic intelligence. You can function on the economic
 side a little more easily without the language because you are
 dealing with bankers and others who themselves have to learn
 English to function in this world.
 On the political side, you have to deal with a much wider swath
 in the society. You have to get down to a more grassroots level.
 Let me only add as an addition to this, the American people did
 not learn about Iran through the Foreign Service, but they learned
 about it through the media and particularly the electronic media.
 And nobody among the media who were interpreting Iran to the
 American public and, therefore, whose judgments had an impor-
 tant view, an important impact on how our Nation was reacting,
 none of them had any language facility.
 Mr. SIMON. So if I follow your statistics correctly, if I am calcu-
 lating correctly, 6 of the 52 hostages spoke Farsi, and none of the
 media and none of the CIA?
 Mr. KENNEDY. Right.
 Mr. SIMON. You mentioned the Foreign Service, to use your
 words, "does a pretty good job." We had testimony yesterday from
 Mr. Higgenbotham, who now heads the cultural attache program
 at the Department of Commerce. He was in the Foreign Service 25
 years. He said at no point was he encouraged at all to study a
 foreign language.
 Mr. KENNEDY. I am very glad you raised that question, sir. I
 have known him for years. I have a high respect for him. And since
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9

 he has said it, I can say it even more. It is perfectly true, the lack
 of incentives in Foreign Service to learn a language is not nearly
 good enough. Let me be very specific. If you look at the Foreign
 Service efficiency report form, which is what determines your pro-
 motion-and may have been changed, but I am not sure it has
 been changed in this respect-you will see a very small space given
 to communicative abilities. A very small space given to how much
 you are getting out and getting to know the people in the country.
 In that one document alone you have usually one or two sen-
 tences saying, "His ever-improving Spanish" or something. It is
 usually pretty flattering, because everybody pats each other on the
 back when it comes to something that is not given the highest
 importance.
 There are no effective financial remunerations given for lan-
 guage training. And this is not only for learning it, because taking
 a year and a half as a language student, particularly in Tunisia,
 which is our Arabic center, can be almost an academic sabbatical.
 People volunteer for language training as junior officers.
 But it is in keeping it up and it is in being reprocessed. And that
 is where we have a real problem. Everybody has to come back to
 Washington. It is obviously a very important part of the Foreign
 Service officer's career. There is some 6:30-in-the-morning training
 at the Foreign Service in the more basic languages, but not, as far
 as I can see, in the more difficult ones which are much harder to
 retain because their thought processes are very different from the
 thought processes that go into the European languages.
 So anybody can keep up his French. You only have to read
 LeMonde from time to time. But to keep up Arabic is really very
 much harder. And there ought to be an obligatory requirement for
 officers to pass an examination on a yearly basis, particularly those
 in whom 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 dollars-you can get the figures
 from FSI-have been spent learning the hard languages. There
 ought to be at the same time a financial remuneration for those
 who can keep up their languages.
 Let me give you one thing that is very disturbing. I came back
 from Chile and had a temporary job in Beirut and had some
 language refresher. I was told that officers with some seniority who
 had enough Arabic to fill the senior jobs were scarce as hen's
 teeth-I am quoting a personnel officer. I asked why, when we had
 all these numbers of officers who had gotten the 33 professional,
 basic professional level.
 The answer was that they were simply declining to go back to
 refresher. They had reached middle life. They did not want to be
 students again. They did not have any career incentive to do it.
 They thought they had made it, that language learning was a part
 of the time when they were younger and hungrier, in career terms,
 and when they had reached a certain point they did not want to
 bother with it.
 Now, this, I think, is very bad because it is a loss of an invest-
 ment. And so the Foreign Service is full of people who will tell you
 with a sheepish grin, "Oh, yes, I used to be a good Arabist," and
 yet they go out to the Middle East again because it is on their
 record, and you discover you get them into a meeting or something,
 and it is just gone. They might as well not have had it.

 So I think that an incentive system, both the carrot and the
 stick, of the kind I mentioned would be extremely useful to keep up
 this kind of language capability.
 Mr. SIMON. What I sense you are saying, even the evaluation
 sheet that automatically has a place where you check off, is he
 keeping or is she keeping up his or her Arabic or whatever the
 language skills, some, as you say, both a carrot and a stick ought to
 be used.
 Mr. Coleman.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Kennedy for
 coming. He had no prepared remarks, but they were some of the
 most articulate testimony that I have heard in many days. I agree
 with everything you say.
 And I have no questions, but a statement: That on behalf of all
 the people that I represent, my first opportunity to tell you how
 proud we were of how you conducted yourself, and your wife and
 how she conducted herself, through the ordeal that you went
 through.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Coleman.
 Mr. SIMON. Mr. Erdahl.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I would echo those same observations that Mr. Coleman just
 made.
 One question or observation. You cited several times-I do not
 know if you used the word "necessity," I will use it-to train
 people in languages at an early age, the primary school level. Can
 you elaborate a little bit more on that, because I sensed that is one
 of the deficiencies, because if we had trained people at the elemen-
 tary and secondary school level, obviously some of them would be
 going into the Foreign Service, CIA, military, business, and all
 these things. How can we do a better job?
 Mr. KENNEDY. I think that children are natural linguists, and
 the proof is my son Duncan at age 16 has borrowed an Arabic
 textbook to master on his own, because he is conscious of the fact
 that up to the age of 4 he spoke Arabic much better than he spoke
 English. And this is part of his view of himself.
 I am sure it will come back to him. I am sure that way in the
 :[BM recesses of his mind there is a capacity there and that this
 will come out again.
 Now, I think at that age when you are teaching children a
 foreign language, you are teaching them to be articulate. You are
 teaching them to speak. It does not matter what the language is. I
 think our tendency has been the other way. There was an empha-
 sis to teach Spanish language to children of Hispanic origin in
 Spanish, to make it easier for them. I think that is entirely the
 wrong approach.
 I think children are challenged by a foreign language. You see
 this in bilingual families. My brother has an Italian wife, and my
 nephew and niece speak Italian with their mother and English
 with their father, and they are perfectly comfortable with the
 situation. They like playing the parents off against each other.
 [Laughter.]
 But I think you could add greatly to the challenge of primary
 school education. I think it is as good a program as any. In part,

 because you are developing the base which many years later will
 be the intelligence clerks and Foreign Service officers and, let us
 say, oil company executives, but also because you are making chil-
 dren more communicative. You are making them better-educated
 people. You are making better Americans. This should be the basis
 for it.
 Mr. ERDAHL. I think that is a very perceptive observation that
 we need to hear. I have thought that, too. How do people learn
 very difficult languages: Arabic, Finnish, Chinese? Obviously, there
 are millions of people who do it from childhood.
 In our own family we have a little girl who is now 4 years old.
 And when we moved here a couple of years ago, we had a Vietnam-
 ese family across the street. Their little girl could speak no Eng-
 lish, and it was obvious in a period of months she learned to speak
 English from our little girl, never getting the languages confused,
 always talking in Vietnamese to her mother and talking English to
 us. And yet, in this whole process, our little daughter never
 learned one word of Vietnamese. It was kind of a one-way street.
 Mr. KENNEDY. There is the incentive question. Your daughter did
 not need to know Vietnamese, but it is very clear to little Moi that
 she needed to have English.
 Mr. ERDAHL. We tried to get her to say some words, "What is
 this?" A chair or something, in Vietnamese. But she would never
 respond.
 Mr. KENNEDY. This was her secret.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Maybe so. Thank you very much.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. SIMON. We thank you again. I would really again echo Tom
 Coleman's sentiments. We are proud of you and your colleagues
 and your wife, and we extend to them our greetings.
 Mr. KENNEDY. I will certainly extend her your greetings. It has
 been a great honor to be here.
 I wish you all success with the bill. I think it is terribly impor-
 tant.
 Mr. SIMON. Thank you for adding to it here.
 Our next witnesses will be a panel: Dr. Dale Lange, of the
 University of Minnesota, director of graduate studies; Dr. David
 Edwards, from the Joint National Committee for Languages; and
 Dr. Eugene Timpe, who happens to be from Southern Illinois Uni-
 versity.
 It is a pleasure to welcome you here. And we thank all three of
 you for your interests and you leadership.
 We will call upon the past president of the American Council on
 the Teaching of Foreign Languages, first of all. And Dr. Edwards is
 representing Dr. Alatis, who cannot be here. But all three of you
 have been extremely helpful along the way. It is not simply your
 testimony here today. Let me express my appreciation for that.

 opportunity to thank you for inviting testimony on H.R. 3231 from the American
 especially proud, Languages Chairman, to know tat I two R pre

 sentatives from my home state of Minnesota, Mr. Erdahl and Mr. Oberstar, have co-
 sponsored the bill with you.
 The testimony that I intend to offer is organized around four points: (1) Experi-
 ence with our language failures, (2) The strategic and economic importance of
 having citizens well-versed in languages, (3) Reactions to the bill with some sugges-
 tions, and (4) The impact of the bill on the language situation.
 EXPERIENCE WITH LANGUAGE FAILURES
 Having been in Germany as a student and in France as a director of a University
 of Minnesota program for teachers of French as well as an exchange professor at a
 French university, I have seen a wide spectrum of Americans function very poorly
 ?       in a language other than English:
 (1) A U.S. Consul at the Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, who spoke little or no
 German, who had to have a German-speaking bilingual secretary translate German
 documents in order that he would be able to understand them. In such a case, a
 Consul can lose control over communication with the host country.
 (2) Hundreds of examples of U.S. Military in Germany who made no effort to
 learn German, but who lived and mixed with Germans. Such lack of language
 capability in these situations has caused innumerable misunderstandings of a cul-
 tural nature between German and American service personnel and their families.
 Without a language capability, the misunderstandings continue, having no means
 for resolution. While my experience cannot speak for communication in military
 operations in the NATO countries, I assume that problems in that case could be
 quite serious since most service personnel cannot communicate in everyday situa-
 tions. That this situation should exist after thirty-five years is astounding!
 (3) The many tourists, who cannot negotiate their way in a post office, hotel, or
 restaurant, who shout at the person behind the counter, thinking that a loud voice
 in English will help the situation. The arrogant assumption in these situations is
 that, no matter where one goes outside the U.S.A., everybody speaks English;
 therefore we, as Americans, do not need to know languages other than English.
 (4) Some of the teachers of French and German I have known who, in spite of
 degrees in language, cannot communicate. Many of these people teach on the basis
 of a college minor and have never been outside the U.S.; many have been embar-
 rassed even to try to communicate in the language they teach because they lack
 sufficient proficiency.
 (5) And finally my own failure-the embarrassment of not knowing Spanish when
 i1 arrived in Spain. Speaking two languages other than English, neither of them
 Spanish, I realized the psychological and cultural disadvantage I was at in trying to
 deal with Spanish people. I had no tools to deal with the situation; it was as though
 l: were naked.
 THE STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CITIZENS WELL-VERSED IN
 LANGUAGES
 Mr. Chairman, it is not within my expertise to comment extensively on the
 strategic and economic implications of the capacity of American citizens to use
 languages other than English. Other witnesses have direct competence in those
 areas and have already testified in that regard. However, as a citizen who is
 concerned about our image abroad, I feel that I have the right to continue to ask
 about the capacity of U.S. government officials to use languages other than English.
 Without quoting facts and figures, it is now clear that the failure of U.S. govern-
 ment policy in Southeast Asia was partially a result of being ill-prepared to under-
 stand either the languages or the people and the cultures of the Indo-Chinese
 peninsula. It also appears that our problems in Iran can be traced, again in part, to
 lack of capacity in Farsi. In recent months I have written to several Congressmen as
 well as to the President about the ability of American officials who are dealing with
 our escalating commitment in El Salvador. I have directly asked what Foreign
 Service Institute Oral Interview Proficiency ratings the Ambassador and his Depu-
 ties have. The responses I have received from Congressmen indicate that I have
 posed a good question; the President's office ignored the question in a recent
 response. We cannot afford to place Foreign Service Officers or Staff who do not
 know the language of the people with whom they are dealing on line in either
 sensitive or non-sensitive areas of the world.
 In business, it would be interesting to sort out the effects on the balance of
 payments of those U.S. firms in international business which sell their products in
 the language of the buyer against those who sell their products to the buyer in
 English. If this sorting could be done and my assumptions are correct, the results
 may be similar to the current Japanese and American economic situations. Lan-

 guage is an important tool in selling goods and services; we have learned that lesson
 in selling in English in the U.S.; why can we not transfer this knowledge to foreign
 trade?
 The importance of communication in a language other than English in the devel-
 opment of our strategic, diplomatic, and economic interest is self-evident to most of
 us. Yet we continue to force others to speak to us in English. As with our new
 national economic, policy, we need to take the hard way out, forcing us to use the
 languages of others. Can we not risk the gamble?
 REACTIONS TO THE BILL AND SOME SUGGESTIONS
 Mr. Chairman, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages is
 proud to have contributed its ideas to H.R. 3231, especially in Section 2. We are
 enthusiastic to see model programs and a variety of alternative approaches for
 children from five through seventeen in the language of the bill. We would recom-
 mend that specific language be added to Section 2, article a) which recognizes grants
 for model programs in school districts which currently do not have language pro-
 grams. Line 21 of page 2 of the bill speaks to the "improvement and expansion" of
 foreign language study but does not mention the commencement of model programs
 where they do not now exist. I mention this need because many smaller school
 districts in this country do not have foreign language programs. An innovative
 approach for the teaching of German using an itinerant teacher and electronic
 media, closed-circuit TV, is being experimented with by a consortium of seven
 schools without any language program in rural Minnesota. Model programs for
 these schools need to be developed and tested for possible use and adaptation in
 other rural contexts in this country. It is this kind of start-up model and others not
 yet developed which need support because they show that quality education, which
 includes the study of languages other than English, is possible in small and rural
 American public schools.
 ACTFL is also supportive of Sections 3 and 4 of this bill, Mr. Chairman, in that
 they give support for foreign language study in higher education. But we are
 concerned about several features:
 (1) The concept of model programs is not carried through in higher education.
 There is no less need to deal with model programs at this level than in the
 elementary and secondary schools. IHEs are experimenting with different forms of
 intensive language instruction from a two hour a day, five days a week program
 during the academic year to three to six hours a day, five days a week, five to ten
 week programs during the summer. Beginning courses at this level may also concen-
 trate on one or a combination of language activities, such as the development of
 listening and reading comprehension (minimizing speaking and writing), the devel-
 opment of oral communication, and/or the development of written communication.
 These aproaches to success in different contexts. language    1 nguage of this hportion iof the bill could be evaluation
 as specific as that of the elementary and secondary portion in relation to the
 development and testing of model programs.
 (2) In these two sections. OHEs are not specifically required to guarantee suffi-
 cient funds to ensure that the program be carried out as in the application as
 elementary and secondary schools in Section 3.(b)(3). Such a requirement for IHEs
 would suggests that the costs of an application are in part borne by the IHE and the
 Federal Government in consort and not solely by the Federal Government. This
 statement is in full recognition of the language of Section 3.(a)(1), lines 9 and 10,
 to reimburse such institutions for part of the costs of providing foreign lan-
 guage instruction    " We are suggesting that while it is possible to make it clear
 in regulations to administer this bill when finally passed that the monies to be
 appropriated under this act are to be used for foreign language instruction only in
 IHEs, we would be much more comfortable if the language of the bill were much
 more specific in that regard.
 (3) None of the provisions of the IHE portion of the bill deals with a most
 important aspect of the foreign language classroom, the preparation of teachers. In
 order that the models be tested and that their evaluation be disseminated, we
 recommend that a portion of the funds appropriated be set aside for college/
 university language department, schools of education, state education agencies and
 LEAs to work together for the preparation of inservice teachers. This cooperation
 could also take place as part of the state education agency application of Section
 2.(a). Specifically, we would recommended an appropriation of 1 percent of the total
 cost for the bill for the preparation of teachers in public elementary and secondary
 schools who would become familiar with different teaching/ learning models while at
 the same time they are given an opportunity to improve their use of language. A

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 similar amount (1 percent of the total cost of the bill) should also be made availabe
 for the preparation of college and university teachers.
 (4) We are especially concerned, Mr. Chairman, about the ratio of funding for
 elementary/secondary to that of higher education which this bill provides. We think
 it is severely lopsided. The population of language students in public elementary
 and secondary schools is at least equal to that of the colleges and universities, we
 would suggest at 50/50 split in appropriations with formulas changed to reflect this
 equality. There is no question in our mind, Mr. Chairman, that as much importance
 be given language instruction in elementary and secondary schools as in the col-
 leges. In addition, research in language learning indicates that there may be less
 efficiency in learning with young adults than with young children and adolescents.
 In this regard, the funding of the proposed legislation does not reflect the reality of
 the classroom. We know that the author and the supporters of this legislation will
 wish to correct this inequity.
 (5) The effect of the funding level recommended for Section 4 would give strong
 encouragement to two year language requirements in secondary schools. While that
 encouragement may be necessary and even appropriate, it is hoped that it not force
 college and university "standards" for amounts learned onto the secondary schools
 where such standards do not wholly fit. There needs to be an understanding at both
 the secondary and college/ university levels of what students can learn of another
 language in the amount of time available for learning.
 What is needed to resolve this problem is the examination of the kind of language
 proficiency that can be obtained from the various model programs. From that
 examination, reasonable minimal expectations of proficiency in oral and written
 communication would be established for each alternative. Colleges and universities
 would then know what to expect from the different types of programs and could
 then plan to place students where they most appropriately belong.
 It is my assumption that statements establishing minimal proficiencies and proce-
 dures used by the Foreign Sevice Institute and other government agency language
 schools. It would appear that the oral interview procedure, though useful within the
 government, needs modification for use outside the government to help develop
 standards as well as the means to evalute those standards. Assistance is needed to
 produce the statements and studies to evaluate the oral interview procedure against
 a revised set of proficiency statements as they are used at different points in the
 learning system: at the end of secondary schools, after both one and two years of
 college language learning, for teachers prior to certification or hiring as teaching
 assistants, and to evaluate language proficiency at the graduate school level. The
 definition of minimal proficiencies will help the profession ensure that efficient
 language learning is taking place. This act could help not only in developing an
 awareness of the different language learning models, but also how they relate to
 proficiency standards if monies were devoted to such development.
 THE IMPACT OF THE BILL
 Mr. Chairman, these recommendations are made with the hope that they will
 only refine the effort that you have and continue to make on behal-f of foreign
 language education in the United States. It is you effort and this bill which give
 support and encouragement to the resolution of our seeming incapacity as a nation
 to deal with languages other than English. Although we are a polyglot country, a
 tradition of ignoring the fact that languages other than English are used both
 within and without our borders. This legislation should begin the long road to
 recovery by preparing a wide range of Americans to communicate with others in
 their languages.

 H.R. 3231 from the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
 Languages, which I represent as immediate past president for 1981.
 I am especially proud, Mr. Chairman, to note that two Repre-
 sentatives from my home State of Minnesota, Mr. Erdahl and Mr.
 Oberstar, have cosponsored the bill with you.
 Mr. Chairman, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
 Languages is proud to have contributed its ideas to H.R. 3231,
 especially within section 2 of the bill. We are enthusiastic to see
 model programs and a variety of alternative approaches for chil-
 dren from ages 5 through 17 in the language of the bill.
 We would recommend that specific languages be added to section
 2, article (a), which recognizes grants for model programs--
 Mr. SIMON. If I may interrupt you, where are you in your state-
 ment?
 Mr. LANGE. I am on page 4 and 5.
 We would recommend that specific language be added to section
 2, article (a), which recognizes grants for model programs in school
 districts which currently do not have language programs. Line 21
 of page 2 of the bill speaks to the "improvement and expansion" of
 foreign language study but does not mention the commencement of
 model programs where they do not now exist.
 I mention this need because many smaller school districts in this
 country do not have foreign language programs. An innovative
 approach for the teaching of German using an itinerant teacher
 and electronic media, closed-circuit television, is being experiment-
 ed with by a consortium of seven schools without any language
 program in rural Minnesota.
 Model programs for these schools need to be developed and
 tested for possible use and adaptation in other rural contexts in
 this country. It is this kind of startup model and others not yet
 developed which need support because they show that quality edu-
 cation which includes the study of languages other than English is
 possible in small and rural American public schools.
 ACTFL is also supportive of sections 3 and 4 of this bill, Mr.

 higher education. But we are concerned about several other fea-
 tures:
 One, the concept of model programs is not carried through in
 higher education. There is no less need to deal with model pro-
 grams at this level than in the elementary and secondary schools.
 IHE's are experimenting with different forms of intensive language
 instruction from the 2-hour-a-day, 5-day-a-week program during the
 academic year to 3 to 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 5 to 10 weeks

 Beginning courses at this level may also concentrate on one or a
 combination of language activities, such as the developing of listen-
 ing and reading comprehension, minimizing speaking and writing,
 the development of oral communication, and/or the development of
 written communication.
 These approaches to language learning need both planning for
 and evaluation of success in different contexts. The language of
 this portion of the bill could be made as specific as that of the
 elementary and secondary portion in relation to the development
 and testing of model programs.

 Two, in these two sections, IHE's are not specifically required to
 guarantee sufficient funds to insure that the program be carried
 out as in the application as elementary and secondary schools in
 section 3(b)(3) of the bill. Such a requirement for IHE's would
 suggest that the costs of an application are, in part, borne by the
 IHE and the Federal Government in consort and not soley by the
 Federal Government.
 This statement is in full recognition of the language of section 3,
 lines 9 and 10 of part (a)(1): "to reimburse such institutions for part
 of the costs of providing foreign language instruction."
 We are suggesting that while it is possible to make it clear in
 regulations to administer this bill when finally passed, that the
 moneys appropriated under this act are to be used for foreign
 language instruction only in IHE's, we would be much more com-
 fortable if the language of the bill were much more specific in that
 regard.
 Three, none of the provisions of the IHE portion of the bill deals
 with the most important aspect of the foreign language classroom,
 the preparation of teachers. In order that the models be tested and
 that their evaluation be disseminated, we recommend that a por-
 tion of the funds appropriated be set aside for college/ university
 language department, schools of education, State education agen-
 cies, and LEA's to work together for the preparation of in-service
 teachers.
 This cooperation could also take place as part of the application
 of section 2(a). Specifically, we would recommend an appropriation
 of 1 percent of the total cost of the bill for the preparation of
 teachers in public elementary and secondary schools who would
 become familiar with different teaching/learning models while at
 the same time they are given an opportunity to improve and con-
 tinue their improvement of the use of language.
 A similar amount, 1 percent of the total cost of the bill, should
 also be made available for the preparation of college and university
 teachers.
 Four, we are especially concerned, Mr. Chairman, about the ratio
 of funding for elementary/secondary to that of higher education,
 which this bill provides. We think it is severely lopsided. Since the
 population of language students in public elementary and second-
 ary schools is at least equal to that of the colleges and universities,
 we would suggest a 50-50 split in appropriations, with formulas
 changed to reflect this equality.
 There is no question in our minds, Mr. Chairman, that as much
 importance be given language instruction in elementary and sec-
 ondary schools as in the colleges.
 In addition, research in language learning indicates that there
 may be less efficiency in learning with young adults than with
 young children and adolescents. In this regard, the funding of the
 proposed legislation does not reflect the reality of the classroom.
 We know that the authors and the supporters of this legislation
 will wish to correct this inequity.

 would give strong encouragement to 2-year language requirements
 in secondary schools. While that encouragement may be necessary
 and even appropriate, it is hoped that it will not force college and

 university standards for amounts learned onto the secondary

 versities would then know what to expect from the different types
 of programs and could then plan to place students where they most
 appropriately belong.
 It is my assumption that statements establishing minimal profi-
 ciencies and procedures used by the Foreign Service Institute and
 other Government agency language schools. It would appear that
 the oral interview procedure, though useful within the Govern-
 ment, needs modification for use outside the Government to help
 develop standards as well as the means to evaluate those stand-
 ards.
 Assistance is needed to produce the statements and studies to
 evaluate the oral interview procedure against a revised set of profi-
 ciency statements as they are used at the different points in the
 learning system: at the end of the secondary school; after both 1
 and 2 years of college language learning; for teachers prior to

 guage proficiency at the graduate school level.
 The definition of minimal proficiencies will help the profession
 insure that efficient language learning is taking place. This act
 could help not only in developing an awareness of the different
 language learning models, but also how they relate to proficiency
 standards, if moneys were devoted to such development.

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, for this opportuni-

 comments on and endorsement of H.R. 3231 enhancing the role of foreign languages
 in our national security and economic growth. The Joint National Committee for

 Languages is an organization that represents twelve of the major language associ-
 ations with a combined membership of 65,000 to 70,000 language professionals with
 expertise in all areas of the foreign language field, as well as English as a second
 language and bilingual education. The JNCL wishes to take this opportunity to
 express our sincere concern that legislation of this type is necessary and to state
 again our fundamental belief in foreign language study as essential to the political,
 econcomic and intellectual security of our nation. We feel H.R. 3231 is vital and
 important legislation and would urge its passage for the following reasons:
 (1) It will encourage foreign language study at the elementary and secondary
 levels by rewarding innovative programs and creative teaching.
 (2) It will enhance both the number and quality of students at postsecondary
 institutions, from whose numbers will necessarily come those leaders and experts
 with the vision and skill to reverse our nation's worrisome slide toward ineptness in
 international statecraft and disadvantage in foreign trade.
 (3) It will provide encouragement for students and educational institutions to
 develop the expertise and skills needed for the American business community to
 increase exports and continue to be competitive in the international marketplace.
 (4) It will assist our national security by making available to the military, intelli-
 gence and diplomatic communities a pool of individuals from which they can draw
 by adding substantially to the dangerously scarce numbers of graduates with the
 necessary comprehension of other cultures.
 The legislation addresses squarely a pressing issue which continues to occupy a
 central place in JNCL's concerns, namely, the declining enrollments in foreign
 language classes at all educational levels, and the disappearance of foreign language
 requirements for graduation in post-secondary institutions. At present only fifteen
 percent of all United States high school students are enrolled in the study of a
 foreign language. That figure itself is probably misleadingly optimistic, since only
 three percent of these students pursue a foreign language beyond the second year of
 study. Only eight percent of the colleges of this country require a foreign language
 for admission.
 There are, however, some very positive trends in public policy toward language
 education. Section 2 of H.R. 3231 in particular would complement and support these
 countervailing indications of a revival of foreign language study. This revival, slight
 and fragile though it may be, is partially the result of the fine work done by the
 Perkins Commission, with its clear definition of the major problems which beset
 foreign language and international studies in the U.S., together with an initial
 appraisal of possible solutions to those problems. The revival is also partially the
 result of major changes made in curriculum by leading language educators, who are
 using new teaching techniques, developing a new clientele and reaching out to other
 disciplines. The "model programs" approach of the proposed legislation is a badly
 needed public endorsement of continuing innovation and creativity of this type.
 One additional positive trend is that a clear majority of people in this country
 advocate and recognize the value of greater foreign language study even in the face
 of declining enrollments. A recent national survey, conducted by the University of
 Michigan's Institute for Survey Research and the Center for Applied Linguistics,
 discovered that attitudes of Americans are surprisingly positive toward the study of
 foreign languages. Seventy-five percent of the respondents indicated that they feel
 foreign language should be offered in the elementary schools of this country. More
 than ninety-three percent of the survey respondents felt that foreign language
 should be offered in the junior and senior high schools of the United States. In
 response to the question, "Are you encouraging your children to study a foreign
 language in school?" eighty-four percent of the parents with children age sixteen or
 younger indicated that they are doing or have done so. Of this same group, seventy-
 three percent indicate that they expect their children someday to have the opportu-
 nity to use a foreign language outside the classroom. This would certainly indicate
 that there is considerable popular support for increased foreign language study and
 tacit recognition that the world is becoming more interdependent.
 With the Perkins Commission Report and legislation such as House Concurrent
 Resolution 301, JNCL member organizations have noted a growing awareness
 among Americans of the importance of foreign language and international educa-
 tion. H.R. 3231 is a logical extension of the concern expressed by Congress and a
 thoughtful approach to rectifying the "scandalous" situation in foreign language
 study that recently has been brought forcefully to the national attention. By
 making grants available to states for model programs at the local level, H.R. 3231
 locates responsibility for these programs in those agencies with the best chance to
 develop programs which are truly effective. In addition, awareness of the need for
 foreign language study is heightened at the levels which are crucial to the develop-
 ment of broad-based support. In Sections 3 and 4 of this legislation, institutions of

 higher education are encouraged to address and remedy a major deficiency in our
 national knowledge, and to train the language professionals necessary to sustain our
 national security and economic growth. Since only about nine percent of the stu-
 dents in institutions of higher education enroll in foreign language study each year,
 the JNCL regards the five percent "trigger mechanism" in Section 3 as valuable in
 indicating some institutional commitment to foreign languages. We concur in the
 Perkins Commission Report that "schools, colleges and universities should reinstate
 foreign language requirements," and we are pleased that Section 4 encourages such
 requirements. It is a noteworthy trend that in recent years a number of leading
 postsecondry institutions, such as Georgetown, Harvard, Berkley and Stanford, have
 reinstituted language requirements. On the other hand, JNCL is aware that require-
 ments may be a two-edged sword the many colleges and universities are hesitant to
 adopt. Ideally, students should come to the study of foreign languages with an
 interest and a desire for the subject. The best way to develop this is through
 meaningful foreign language experiences at the elementary and secondary level and
 relevant courses at the postsecondary level. In this regard, perhaps a more equitable
 distribution of funds among Sections 2, 3 and 4 would promote interest ant demon-
 strate value while stil encouraging requirements.
 The JNCL endorses warmly the provisions for additional funding in the less
 commonly taught languages, and would suggest, moreover, that such a provision
 should also include those languages determined by the Secretary of Education to be
 vital to our national security.
 Concerning the per capita figures this bill provides, one large university estimates
 that it cost $125 per student per quarter to expand their language programs to
 implement language requirements. This would be, of course, much higher for small
 colleges and the less commonly taught languages, in light of this, the grants pro-
 vided here could be by no means excessive and in fact, they would be barely
 adequate to encourage increased foreign language study and to somewhat defer the
 costs of new language programs. Perhaps as important as the necessary economic
 incentive these grants offer, they also provide evidence of a commitment to over-
 coming a national embarrassment which threatens our security and economic com-
 petitiveness.
 By improving language and cultural understanding, H.R. 3231 is an important
 step toward strengthening our security in this multilingual world. In a politically,
 economically, and socially interdependent world, the United States can ill-afford the
 luxury of cultural parochialism and linguistic imperialism. We are closely linked in
 many ways-through trade and business, communication systems transportation,
 international organizations, monetary systems, and new technology that greatly
 accelerates the need to communicate effectively with other nations. According to the
 Secretary of Education, Dr. Terrell Bell, "Never in the history of the world has
 there been one nation with such a variety of ethnic and language backgrounds as
 the United States." But despite this, Secretary Bell contends, we have countenanced
 the development of a huge gap in our foreign language training, which leaves us in
 "linguistic famine." It is essential to our national security and our economic well-
 being that we understand the cultures and actions of our international allies and
 competitors; such an understanding is most improbable if we cannot communicate
 with them nor appreciate their respective languages and cultures.
 In recent years, the United States' share of the world export market has declined
 from fifteen to twelve percent. Perhaps more than any other sector, business must
 be cognizant and sensitive to the realities of economic interdependence and transna-
 tional interaction. The inability to communicate in other languages and to under-
 stand other cultures has already cost, and unless rectified, will continue to cost, a
 great deal of money in missed investment opportunities, poor marketing strategies,
 inappropriate advertising and needless mistakes in economic planning and forecast-
 ing. A very specific example was cited by Japan's Minister for External Economic
 Affairs, Saburo Okita, during his recent visit to the United States. He suggested
 that American businesses were excluded from consideration for a $90 million dollar
 contract from Nippon Telephone and Telegraphy because they were unwilling or
 unable to provide documentation in Japanese. He went on to say that it would have
 been a relatively simple chore to translate the necessary documents from English to
 Japanese were American business willing to pay for it. I would submit that even if
 they were willing to employ such expertise and even if they recognized the need for
 it, with only one-tenth of one percent of our college students studying Japanese, it is
 indeed a limited resource.
 Some recognition of the problem has begun to surface within the American
 business community. For example, in a 1974-75 survey conducted by the Olympus
 Research Corporation, 1,380 import/export firms responding listed more than 60,000
 jobs for which they either desired or required language skills. According to Senator

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 Adlai E. Stevenson III, "American businessmen, especially small businessmen, are
 unfamiliar with foreign customs and languages, unaware of foreign market opportu-
 nities, and ill-equipped to deal with the bureaucratic requirements of licensing,
 insurance, financing and shipping arrangements." It is apparent that if America is
 to compete with other nations for world markets, among the requirements its
 business leaders will have to meet is the ability to communicate with foreign
 counterparts. As the ability to speak the languages of our customers and clients
 becomes a necessity for survival in a competitive global economy, our schools must
 be training individuals with the language skills prerequisite to success in interna-
 tional markets.
 In national defense, the U.S. also suffers the consequences of a language gap. The
 contributions of foreign language competence to the nation's military capability-in
 command, intelligence, operations, logistics, survival skills, and community rela-
 tions are vital to our nation's security. The acquisition and processing of tactical
 intelligence depends on the language skill of our intelligence personnel dealing with
 indigenous populations. Without language facility, intelligence specialists are se-
 verely limited in the short term and are incapable of developing accurate longer-
 term analysis based on an understanding of the culture which the language con-
 veys. Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iran, as well as numerous other lesser crises, are
 all obvious examples of how the foreign policy of the United States suffered severe
 setbacks due in significant part to this inability to acquire and interpret raw
 intelligence.
 H.R. 3231 is crucial in achieving an awareness of the need for foreign language
 study. National leadership in the last decades of this century must encourage an
 educational policy which acknowledges these international needs, and elects to deal
 with them as national priorities. Foreign language training and the study of inter-
 national affairs, although long considered basic educational priorities, have not
 received adequate financial support or recognition as an essential component of
 school curricula. In many respects, we now pay the price politically and economical-
 ly. Our nation must possess the skills to speak foreign languages and understand
 foreign cultures. Only with these skills can we hope to conduct effective foreign
 policy, expand international trade and ensure the integrity of our national defense.
 Finally, with specific reference to the present structure of H.R. 3231, the JNCL
 would offer a few friendly and, we hope, constructive suggestions regarding ways in
 which this legislation might be strengthened.
 First, it might be useful to have the Secretary of Education identify those lan-
 guages that are necessary to our national security, as well as, the less commonly
 taught languages for additional funding under Section 3.
 Second, H.R. 3231 should include a provision either in Section 1 or Section 5,
 which would prohibit institutions from channeling funds, which are not allotted to
 foreign language studies, away from these programs as a result of funding acquired
 under the provisions of this bill.
 Third, in order to promote interest in foreign language study early and to demon-
 strate the value and utility of such study, a larger proportion of the funds author-
 ized in this legislation should be allocated to Sections 2 and 3, perhaps on the order
 of (1) $15,000,000, (2) $25,000,000 and (3) $40,000,000.
 Finally, the JNCL recognizes and is concerned about the need for proficiency
 requirements. However, we recognize that the definition of these requirements is
 not and should not be within the scope of federal legislation, but rather might
 better be left to the profession and the institutions themselves.
 Thank you for this opportunity to offer our comments on this much needed and
 vitally important legislation. I would be pleased to try to answer any questions you
 might have.

 STATEMENT OF J. DAVID EDWARDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,
 JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR LANGUAGES, GEORGE-
 TOWN UNIVERSITY
 Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I would just
 like to summarize our statement.
 Mr. SIMON. Your statement will be entered in the record, and we
 would appreciate your summary of it.
 Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to
 appear before you on behalf of the Joint National Committee for
 Languages to offer our comments and an endorsement of H.R.
 3231, the National Security and Economic Growth and Foreign
 Language Improvement Act.
 The Joint National Committee for Languages is an organization
 that represents 12 of the major language associations, with a com-
 bined membership of 65,000 to 70,000 language professionals with
 expertise in all areas of the foreign language field, as well as
 English as the second language of bilingual education.
 The JNCL wishes to take this opportunity to express our sincere
 concern that legislation of this type is necessary and to state again
 our fundamental belief in foreign language study as essential to
 the political, economic, and intellectual security of our nation.
 We have attached to our statement a number of figures and
 tables which illustrate the exact extent to which language enroll-
 ments have dwindled in the past two decades and the degree to
 which we have allowed a foreign-language training gap to develop
 in this country. The second page illustrates that somewhat. These
 areas reflect a-and I quote-scandalous situation.
 There are some indications, however, that while the numbers
 remain dismally low, there recently has been a very fragile revival
 of interest in foreign language study. And I would stress how
 fragile that revival is. This revival has been, in part, the result of
 national attention for which you, Mr. Chairman, deserve much
 credit; and it has been, in part, the result of changes by the
 language profession in using new teaching techniques, developing
 new clientele, and reaching out to other disciplines.
 It is also heartening that many of the leading postsecondary
 institutions have reinstituted foreign language requirements. JNCL
 views this legislation as necessary to bolster the apparent tenuous
 and slight revival of foreign language study through rewarding
 innovation and creativity, in section 2, through noting the impor-
 tance of the less commonly taught languages in section 3, and by
 recognizing the need to reinstate foreign language requirements in
 section 4.
 We are also convinced that without national support and legisla-
 tion of this type, the fragile revival will simply not materialize. In
 addition the need for increased activity by the educational commu-
 nity, as we heard in testimony yesterday, business must be cogni-
 zant and sensitive to the realities of economic interdependence in
 transnational interaction.
 In recent years, the United States share of the world export
 market has suffered a 20-percent decrease. The inability to commu-
 nicate in other languages and to understand other cultures has
 already cost--

 Mr. SIMON. May I interrupt you for just a moment? My apolo-
 gies, but I have just gotten a note. I am going to have to rush over
 to the floor in the cause we believe in here. I am going to turn the
 chair over to my colleague from Minnesota. And for these wit-
 nesses and the others, let me assure you, I am going to be reading
 over all of this testimony carefully.
 I did jot down some notes, some questions that I would like to
 direct, as well as comments. So that what we will do is to keep the
 record open. I will be sending-we can follow through on this,
 Nick-I will be sending some questions to all of you. And if you can
 get responses back fairly promptly so that we can get those in the
 record, that would be appreciated.
 My apologies for ducking out on you. And I thank you for being
 here on this really vital area.
 Mr. Erdahl.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you.
 Mr. Chairman, while you were still here, I was going to mention,
 because I think it is such a good text for all these people concerned
 about language to be aware of, there is a book entitled "The
 Tongue-Tied American," available at the bookstore. [Laughter.]
 Mr. Simon has authored a very fine book, I think, that touches
 on this. Is that mentioned anyplace?
 Mr. SIMON. No, it is not. But I thank you.
 Let me just make a couple of comments, briefly, Dale, on your
 comments, because this may be touched upon by some others, and
 some of the suggestions-and I have asked the staff to incorporate,
 to list the specific recommendations that all of them make. Some of
 the suggestions I purposely did not make, because we decided we
 had to target, and how do you target minimal funds to maximum
 benefit?
 For example, I agree I would just love to take a heck of a lot of
 money and put it into our elementary schools. By targeting the
 higher education area primarily, we thought we would hit, in fact,
 both secondary and colleges. And I hope that we can come back
 another year or two with another bill that is going to move on to
 that next step.
 I purposely left the money that could be used in whatever way
 they want to. If they want to build a new dormitory with the
 money, a college or university can do that. It is an incentive. It
 seems to me a little more of an incentive than if they have to use
 the money only for foreign languages.
 Both of you touch on this whole proficiency area, and that is one
 we have not come to grips with in the bill. Any ideas on how we
 can effectively come to grips with that, I would appreciate it.
 I am sorry, but I am going to have to go.
 Mr. ERDAHL [presiding]. Why do you not just proceed, then, sir?
 You may proceed, please.
 Mr. EDWARDS. I believe I was saying the inability to communi-
 cate in other languages and understand other cultures has already
 cost us-and unless rectified, will continue to cost us-a great deal
 of money in missed investment opportunities for marketing strate-
 gies, inappropriate advertising, and needless mistakes in economic
 planning and forecasting.

 One very recent example was cited by Japan's minister for exter-
 nal economic affairs when he was recently in this country. He had
 suggested that American businesses were excluded from considera-
 tion for a $90 million contract let by Nippon Telephone and Tele-
 graph, the first time they had let such a contract, because they
 were unwilling or unable to provide documentation in Japanese.
 He went on to say it would have been a relatively simple chore
 to translate the necessary documents from English to Japanese
 were American business willing to pay for it.
 I would submit that even if they did recognize the need for such
 expertise, or rather particularly, if they recognized the need for
 this expertise and were willing to pay for it, with only one-tenth of
 1 percent of our college students studying Japanese, it is one of our
 most precious resources.
 It is apparent that if America is to compete with other nations in
 world markets, among the requirements its business leaders will
 have to meet is the ability to communicate with foreign counter-
 parts. We have already heard, I think very tellingly, this morning
 in the testimony our needs in national defense. And the United
 States also suffers the consequences of gaps in this area, and I will
 not retread that ground.
 In a politically, economically, and socially interdependent world,
 the United States can ill afford the luxury of cultural parochialism
 and linguistic imperialism. H.R. 3231 is crucial in achieving an
 awareness of the need for foreign language study and in rectifying
 a dangerous national deficiency. Only with these skills can we hope
 to conduct effective foreign policy and expand international trade
 and insure the integrity of our national defense.
 Finally, I would just note a few of the specific recommendations
 we would make with regard to this, two in particular: One is that
 we would agree with Dr. Lange that perhaps more money should
 be distributed in sections 2 and 3 to encourage innovative programs
 and so on. The other is that the bill should include a provision
 either in section 1 or in section 5 which would prohibit institutions
 from channeling funds which are now allotted to foreign language
 studies away from these programs as a result of funding acquired
 in the provisions of this bill, the supplement rather than supplant
 provision.
 I thank you very much for this opportunity to offer our com-
 ments on this important and vitally needed legislation. Thank you.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you very much.
 You heard, as I did, that the bells were ringing, which means we
 have a vote on the floor. I am going to go over there and make that
 vote quickly and come back. So we will just take a brief recess.
 Then we will get on to Dr. Timpe's presentation at that time.
 I regret that this happens, but I will hurry back. Maybe if one of
 my colleagues comes back before, they can resume the meeting.
 Thank you very much.
 [Brief recess.]
 Mr. ERDAHL. I think we were just ready to hear from Dr. Timpe.
 We are glad to have you with us. And, again, you may summa-
 rize your statement as you wish, or proceed in any way which is
 most comfortable with you.

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF EUGENE F. TIMPE, CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN
 LANGUAGES & LITERATURES, SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY, CARBONDALE, ILL.
 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity
 to speak. As chairman of a department of foreign languages and literatures at a
 fairly large public university in the midwest, I believe it appropriate that I make an
 attempt to speak for at least part of the foreign language teaching profession, and I
 am gratified to learn that opinions such as mine and those whom I represent can be
 taken into account in your decision on H.R. 3231.
 The first subject I am to address is that of our failures in language. "Proof" of
 such failures is usually based on anecdotes and examples, and these give rise to
 impressions. Actual statistics are, to the best of my knowledge, non-existent. From
 one point of view, the notion of language failures applies to American travellers
 who, after remaining within the protective network of foreign travel industry pro-
 fessionals and some highly-educated natives, return home with the curious notion
 that English is spoken everywhere. I submit that anyone who makes such a
 statement is a living example of language failure. It applies, also, to the American
 military, sequestered on its bases abroad, and to monolingual Foreign Service per-
 sonnel. I can well imagine educational and agricultural missions which do not
 "connect," guest professors whose lectures do not reach any students except those
 who understand English, and American students who cling together when abroad
 because the need to communicate cannot otherwise be met. Occasionally the gap
 can be bridged by the use of an acquired language which is both foreign and
 common to both parties-like the time an American friend visiting me in Vienna
 was able to talk to some Viennese people in French. While that wasn't a great
 triumph, it was at least a small victory. And, to be sure, almost any foreign
 language is a great deal better than none. Well, God help us and our oft-cited
 national interests if our military can't communicate precisely with our own allies,
 and our diplomats are reduced to dealing with everyone, even would-be Russian
 defectors in Pakistan in the English language.
 The situation in business is just as serious, if not so very dramatic, and it works
 in both directions. America is becoming a travel bargain for people from other
 affluent countries. Such tourism needs to be encouraged. This means that travel and
 recreational industries will have to have some multilingual personnel. The necessry
 training for personnel in this and other international industries cannot be immedi-
 ately accomplished upon demand. Acquisition of a foreign language is an extended
 process, during which acquired knowledge is gradually converted into a skill which
 is slow and uncertain, and from that, through long practice, to an immediately
 accessible and reliable skill. The analogy to learning to play the piano is useful to a
 certain extent. Between that point when everything must be laboriously learned
 and that point where the hands and fingers play without constant and painfully
 conscious instructions from the brain there is a separation of considerable distance
 in time and effort. In learning the piano, the process is usually more successful if
 begun in childhood, and after having studied piano for a few years, one can learn to
 play another instrument more quickly. The analogy holds for foreign language
 learning. The language learned early greatly accelerates the acquisition of the
 language learned later. If, in other words, we decide it is in the best interests of
 American industry or military or diplomacy to upgrade foreign language training, it
 is long-range planning which encompasses public education from childhood through
 the university, and not a quick fix, that will do the trick.
 The selling and servicing of American equipment abroad is an area of economic
 importance, the development of which is largely dependent upon our ability to deal
 in the language of the customer. Top management in American business is begin-
 ning to recognize this. During this past year my department has had a number of
 inquiries from regional business firms which would like to hire graduates who have
 competency in Japanese and who seek careers in business. The need is there, not
 only in Japanese, but in other languages. The question used to be, "Does anyone in
 the world of business realize that they need foreign languages?" but now it is
 changing to, "What can we do to help business meet this newly-recognized need?"
 There is much to be done, indeed, but it will require long-range planning if the
 international needs of America, its business needs included, are to be met.
 This is why the bill under consideration is particularly efficacious. It does not
 limit itself to just adult learners. It begins at that point which is most crucial.
 Certainly, a successful early experience in foreign language establishes learning
 skills which not only make subsequent language acquisition easier, but also creates
 a positive emotional attitude towards such study. But there are side benefits also.
 From studies that have been made during the past decade, it appears that early
 study of a foreign language expands cognitive skills, enhances conceptualization,
 and improves verbal fluency in the native language of the learner. Some studies

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 also show that divergent or creative thinking is strengthened. It is during the
 students' formative years that our decisive battles will be fought, for students who
 initiate foreign languages before or during adolescence are the ones who study them
 during their college years. Precious few of those who come to college without any
 previous foreign language study ever voluntarily begin such study at that level.
 For high school students the additional, readily apparent benefits of foreign
 language study are quite specific: simply, foreign language students get higher
 scores on achievement tests and college entrance examinations. It has for some time
 been suspected that one of the reasons for the recent decline in SAT and ACT scores
 has been that foreign languages have been studied a great deal less over the past
 decade than heretofore. Hypothesizing that the decline in foreign language study in
 high schools could be one of the causes for steadily dropping college entrance exam
 scores, I did a study with the help of the computer at my own university. Basically,
 what I did was to use the ACT test scores to see how students who had studied
 foreign languages scored in comparison to those who had not. At the beginning of
 the ACT test there is a "Student Profile Section" wherein students answer a
 number of questions. One set of questions asked them the number of half years they
 had studied Spanish, French, German, and "other." A total of 7,460 students were
 in this category. As would be expected, their ACT scores were high, and the more
 foreign language they had studied, the higher the scores got.
 But, that wasn't the end of the trail. A very important question was left unan-
 swered. Were these high scores the result of foreign language study or were they
 the result of the fact that this was a brighter group of students than the normal? It
 is generally agreed that superior students are more likely to take foreign languages.
 I was able to separate the students, however, into two groups-the obviously
 brighter students and those who were not. This separation was done with the help
 of three questions from the profile section. One asked for their class standing,
 another for their grade point average, and the third for a description of the level of
 their program of studies-vocational, college preparatory, or whatever. Assuming
 that those who were in a college preparatory program, who were in the top quarter
 of their class, and who had an A or B grade point average were the brighter
 students, I was able to identify a group of 1,726. Those at the other end of the
 spectrum constituted a group of 1,538. The next step was to look at the ACT test
 scores for each of these groups. As expected, scores in English were benefited by
 foreign language study in both cases, and as anticipated, the more study undertak-
 en, the more benefit. But there was one very big surprise, one which I think is
 significant. It was that the students from the lower group received the greater
 benefits. While the top group improved its English and Composite scores by 2.2 and
 1.2 respectively, from four years of foreign language study, the bottom group im-
 proved its English and Composite scores by 4.6 and 3.5 under the same conditions.
 In other words, the lower group gained more than twice as much from foreign
 language study as the upper group. To me, this says that reinculcation of foreign
 language study can help to upgrade our whole educational system, and that such
 upgrading works not only for the chosen few, as it always has, but even more so for
 the great majority that is not especially talented.
 The situation at the college level is somewhat different. Languages are not stud-
 ied so much because they help students to cross mental frontiers, nor because they
 enhance their academic potential, nor because they pave the way for subsequent
 languages, nor because they improve admittance test scores. They are regarded
 principally as a career or profession-supporting tool, but only for a very few disci-
 plines. For the most part, they are shunned. Previous foreign language study is
 rarely an entrance requirement for a college, and study while at college is seldom
 imposed as an overall graduation requirement for all students. Usually, it is the
 separate departments or colleges within a university, e.g., a College of Science,
 which makes foreign language study a graduation requirement. For the majority of
 American students in Higher Education, however, a foreign language is required
 neither for admission nor for graduation.
 This is one of the problems which H.R. 3231 addresses. While at the same time it
 encourages new programs for students from five to seventeen, it also provides
 specific encouragement to colleges and universities. The proposal described in Sec-
 tion 2 is of great importance because it primes the pump. I would like to see the
 proposed funding for this section increased. Sections 3 and 4 will both send a clear
 message to colleges and universities that the federal government is supportive of
 foreign languages, and also give tangible assistance to those institutions which do
 not let foreign languages wither away during these times when there is such
 intense competition for funds.
 I might venture some expectations regarding the effects of the bill in its present
 form. First of all, institutions of higher education would be most likely to take

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 advantage of such legislation if they already had five-unit foreign language courses,
 or had close to 5% of their students enrolled in such courses, or offered less-
 commonly taught languages, or already had a two-year graduation requirement.
 Those which do not have one or more of such vantage points might be slow to
 change. Adding courses in uncommonly-taught languages offers relatively few obsta-
 cles, but promoting the usual three- or four-unit courses to five-unit courses, or
 installing a two-year graduation requirement are other matters. These mean either
 increasing the number of hours required for graduation, reducing elective courses,
 or reducing other university, college, or department graduation requirements. Prog-
 ress in this direction is likely to be slow, especially since it must be made by
 establishing rights-of-way through territories which are jealously guarded by other
 units. I can imagine, also, that since the bill does not specifically require five hours
 of classroom instruction each week, some attempts will be made to count language
 laboratory time as part of the total. I wonder, too, how "individualized instruction"
 (Teacher-Assisted, Mastery-Based, Self-Paced) could qualify. Possibly the work "in-
 struction" under 6(B) will need definition so that it can include or exclude directed
 conversational practice, help-sessions, language laboratory work, testing, and com-
 puter-directed practice. Possibly, also, the minimum required total number of hours
 or weeks of instruction should be mentioned.
 To summarize, I see Section 2 as being extremely important; Section 3 should
 work out well, especially for large institutions; and Section 4 is likely to be most
 helpful to institutions which dedicate themselves to the traditional letters, arts, and
 sciences, institutions in which a uniform foreign language graduation requirement
 would find ready acceptance.
 It is an excellent package as it stands, but I believe that our purposes would be
 even better served if funding for Section 2 were to be increased. College and
 universities would still benefit, if less directly, through the training and retraining
 of elementary and secondary school teachers, which would lead to increased univer-
 sity foreign langage enrollments. In any event, the end result of the entire enter-
 prise would be an extensive array of positive results, some of which are apparent
 and others of which are not. I can imagine no other government-sponsored under-
 taking in which so much could be accomplished at so little cost.
 STATEMENT OF EUGENE TIMPE, CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF
 FOREIGN LANGUAGES, SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY
 Mr. TIMPE. Thank you.
 Mr. ERDAHL. It will all be included in the record.
 Mr. TIMPE. I think I will just give parts of the statement now, in
 the interest of moving this thing along. It is quite possible there
 will be another vote, I understand.

 I will not stay on the subject of national defense, but I would like
 to skip on to business. And that is a matter that is just as serious,
 if not so dramatic, as the matter of national defense.
 The business issue works in both directions. America is becoming
 a travel bargain for people from other affluent countries. Such
 tourism needs to be encouraged. This means that travel and recre-

 ational industries will have to have some multilingual personnel,
 the necessary training for personnel, and this and other interna-
 tional industries cannot be immediately accomplished upon
 demand. Acquisition of a foreign language is an extended process
 during which acquired knowledge is gradually converted into a
 skill which is slow and uncertain at first, and then through long
 practice becomes immediately accessible and more reliable.
 The analogy to learning to play the piano is useful to a certain

 learned and that point when the hands and fingers play without
 constant and painfully conscious instructions from the brain, there
 is a separation of considerable distance in time and effort. In
 learning the piano, the process is usually more successful if begun

 can learn to play another instrument more quickly.
 The analogy holds for foreign language learning. The language

 of American industry or military or diplomacy to upgrade foreign
 language training, it is long-range planning which encompasses
 public education from childhood through the university and not a
 quick fix that will do the trick.
 The selling and servicing of American equipment abroad is an
 area of economic importance, the development of which is largely
 dependent upon our ability to deal in the language of the customer.
 Top management in American business is beginning to recognize
 this.
 During this past year, my department has had a number of
 inquiries from regional business firms which would like to hire
 graduates who have competency in Japanese and who seek careers
 in business. The need is there, not only in Japanese but in other
 languages.
 The question used to be, "Does anyone in the world of business
 realize that they need foreign languages?" But now it is changing
 to, "What can we do to help business meet this newly recognized
 need?"
 There is much to be done, indeed, but it will require, as Admiral
 Inman said, long-range planning if the international needs of
 America, its business needs included, are to be met. This is why the
 bill under consideration is particularly efficacious. It does not limit
 itself to just adult learners. It begins at that point which is most
 crucial. Certainly, a successful early experience in foreign language
 establishes learning skills that not only make subsequent language
 acquisition easier, but also creates a positive emotional attitude
 toward such study.
 I wish to emphasize the creation of the positive emotional atti-
 tude. Studies have been done which show that the chief factor in
 foreign-language acquisition is motivation, or incentive. This moti-
 vation or incentive can be engendered most effectively at an early
 age. However, there are side benefits. Other studies that I have
 consulted, those which have been made during the past decade,
 show that early study of foreign language expands cognitive skills

 Some studies also show the divergent or creative thinking is
 strengthened. It is during the students' formative years that our
 decisive battles will be fought for students who initiate foreign
 languages before or during adolescence are the ones who study
 them during their college years. Precious few of those who come to
 college without any previous foreign-language study ever voluntar-
 ily begin their study at the college level.
 For high school students, the additional readily apparent benefits
 of foreign-language study are quite specific: Simply, foreign-lan-
 guage students get higher scores on achievement tests and college
 entrance examinations. It has for some time been suspected that
 one of the reasons for the recent decline in SAT and ACT scores
 has been that foreign languages have been studied a great deal less
 over the past decade than heretofore. Hypothesizing that the de-
 cline in foreign-language study in high schools could be one of the
 causes for steadily dropping college entrance exam scores, I did a
 study with the help of the computer at my own university.
 Basically, what I did was to use the ACT test scores to see how
 students who had studied foreign languages scored in comparison
 to those who had not. At the beginning of the ACT test there is a
 student-profile section wherein students answer a number of ques-
 tions. One set of questions asks them the number of half-years they
 had studied Spanish, French, German, and other. A total of 7,460
 students were in this category; that is, they answered affirmatively
 that they had studied a foreign language. As was expected, their
 ACT scores were high, and the more foreign language they studied,
 the higher their scores got.
 There is a good deal more to say about this, though. At first,
 observers were inclined to say, "Yes, but you are talking only
 about the smarter students, the brighter students who typically
 study foreign languages." So I broke the 7,460 students down into
 two categories: those who were obviously the brighter students, and
 those who were obviously not. I was able to do this by additional
 questions in the profile section which asked such things as, "Are
 you in the top or bottom half of your class? Would you say your
 grade average is A, B, C, or D? Do you have an intention of going
 on to the university or trade school or terminating your education
 after high school?"
 Taking those who said, "Yes, I am going on to the university. I
 am an A student, and I am in the top half or third of my class," I
 am calling them the top category and then taking the others at the
 far end of the spectrum and calling them the bottom category. I
 reran all the data, and I discovered to my amazement that those in
 the bottom part of the category who had studied foreign languages
 profited even more from them than those in the top category.
 The situation at the college level is somewhat different. Lan-
 guages are not studied so much because they help students to cross
 mental frontiers as they do in elementary school nor because they
 enhance their academic potential nor because they pave the way
 for subsequent languages nor because they improve admittance
 score tests or test scores.
 They are regarded principally as a career or profession-support-
 ing tool, but only for a very few disciplines. For the most part, they
 are shunned. Previous foreign-language study is rarely an entrance

 requirement for a college, and study while at college is seldom
 imposed as an overall graduation requirement for all students.
 Usually, it is the separate departments or colleges within a univer-
 sity-for example, a college of science-which makes foreign-lan-
 guage study a graduation requirement. For the majority of Ameri-
 can students in higher education, however, a foreign language is
 required neither for admission nor for graduation.
 I might venture some expectations regarding the effects of H.R.
 3231 in its present form. First of all, institutions of higher educa-
 tion will be most likely to take advantage of such legislation if they
 already had five-unit foreign language courses or had close to 5
 percent of their students enrolled in such courses or offered less
 commonly taught languages or already had a 2-year graduation
 requirement.
 Those which do not have one or more of such vantage points
 might be slow to change. Adding courses in uncommonly taught
 languages offers relatively few obstacles, but promoting the usual
 three- or four-unit courses to five-unit courses or installing a 2-year
 graduation requirement are other matters. These mean either in-
 creasing the number of hours required for graduation, reducing
 elective courses, or reducing other university, college, or depart-
 ment graduation requirements.
 Progress in this direction is likely to be slow, especially since it
 must be made by establishing rights-of-way through territories
 which are jealously guarded by other units. I can imagine also that
 since the bill does not specifically require 5 hours of classroom
 instruction each week, such attempts will be made to count lan-
 guage laboratory time as part of the total.
 I wonder, too, how individualized instruction could qualify. Possi-
 bly, the word "instruction" under 6(b) will need definition so that it
 can include or exclude directed conversational practice, help ses-
 sions, language laboratory work, testing, and computer-directed
 practice. Possibly, also, the minimum required total number of
 hours or weeks of instruction should be mentioned, too.
 To summarize, I see section 2 as being extremely important. I
 agree with my colleagues on this completely. Section 3 should work
 out well, especially for large institutions. And section 4 is likely to
 be most helpful to institutions which dedicate themselves to the
 traditional letters, arts, and sciences, institutions in which a uni-
 form foreign-language requirement would easily find acceptance.
 It is an excellent package as it stands, but I believe that our
 purpose would be even better served if funding for section 2 were
 to be increased. Colleges and universities would still benefit, if less
 directly, through the training and retraining of elementary and
 secondary teachers, which would lead to increased university for-
 eign-language enrollments.
 This is, I believe, an important point. The problem at the univer-
 sity level, from a very narrow point of view, is that the cycle has
 been broken, that university requirements for foreign languages
 have been dropped. This means that the high schools are not
 training students in foreign languages so that they can be admitted
 to the universities. This means that the high schools do not need
 high school teachers of foreign languages, which means, in turn,
 that the universities do not need to train any more teachers.

 That is a cycle that has been interrupted. It has been broken,
 and it could be, in a sense, reestablished, not by directly demand-
 ing entrance requirements so much for the university but demand-
 ing foreign-language teaching at the elementary level. This would
 provide more training and retraining of elementary and secondary
 school teacher requirements for the university itself.
 In any event, the end result of the entire enterprise, I think, as it
 presently stands, H.R. 3231 should be an impressive array of posi-
 tive results, some of which are immediately apparent and some of      ?
 which are not.
 I can imagine no other Government-sponsored undertaking in
 which so much could be accomplished for a mere $80 million.
 Thank you very much for your attention. And thank you for this
 opportunity to say my piece.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you very much for presenting your testimo-
 ny to me and, obviously, for the record, for my colleagues.
 A couple of things stand out as I listened to your testimony here.
 It seems like what you said, all three of you, complement what we
 heard from the military people, the CIA people, a need for early
 training, a need for education and languages in business and mili-
 tary and government seems to be a coordinated possibility.
 Also, I appreciate the specificity of your comments as they relate
 to the bill before us. I think that has been most helpful. As we
 consider things, maybe we should reinforce things. Maybe we
 should modify things a bit we might need to defend on the floor,
 because even though, as you said, $80 million in a budget of $640
 billion is a very small percentage, it is still a lot of money in
 Illinois and Minnesota, places where we come from. So we are
 trying to get the best value for what we spend of the taxpayer's
 money, and take priorities.
 Do any of you have comments you would like to share with us
 now that might have arisen from what your colleagues on the
 panel said? I am just asking, Dr. Lange, or any of you who have
 listened to each other, if you have any observations or comments
 you would like to leave with me on the record.
 Mr. EDWARD. If I may, I would just like to underscore what was
 said about the requirements section, which is section 4 of the bill.
 It is a two-edged sword. That is not to say we do not need the
 requirements.
 But I would very much concur with what my colleagues just said
 of the need to do creative, innovative programs coming from the
 lower levels up. I think we really need to excite people about
 language learning, and in that regard I see section 2 in many
 respects the strongest part of the act.
 Mr. ERDAHL. All right. I want to thank each and every one of
 you for your well-thought-out and excellent testimony.
 And we will move to-I do not know if it is the next panel or
 next group. I think we will have you come up as a panel. And I
 certainly want to thank all of you for being with us today.
 We can go off the record a bit.

 chairman gave me: Bernie Freitag, vice president of the National

 I wish to formally welcome all of you here. And even though it

 We will go down the list as Mr. Simon gave it to me and ask,
 first of all, for Mr. Bernie Freitag. And again, as was mentioned to
 the other participants in our hearing today, your testimony will be

 most comfortable, summarize it or proceed as you wish.

 [The prepared statement of Bernie Freitag follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF BERNIE FREITAG, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL EDUCATION
 ASSOCIATION
 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am Bernie Freitag, Vice
 President of the National Education Association, the largest professional organiza-
 tion of education employees in the United States. NEA is very pleased to be here
 today to testify in general support of H.R. 3231, with the exception of one part
 which we will discuss more fully later. We commend the sponsors for their commit-
 ment to increasing the study and learning of foreign languages in the nation's
 schools and colleges.
 Subcommittee Members might be interested in knowing that I am, by training,
 experience, and regular employment, a teacher of foregin language. I teach second-
 ary school German at Council Rock High School in Newtown, Pennsylvania, where I
 have also served as coordinator of the foreign language department for about fifteen
 years. Prior to that, I taught for three years in private Catholic high schools in
 Maryland and Pennsylvaina. I myself received much of my professional training as
 a teacher of language through such federally sponsored programs as the National
 Defense Education Act (NDEA) and received a Fulbright-Hays teaching grant. As
 you might imagine, I have some strong feelings about the subject under discussion
 today.
 Certain facts that I have learned through experience underlie my testimony.
 The important point is to start students on a foreign language-any language-at
 as early an age as is possible. Much of the work in acquiring a first foreign language
 has to do with the process of foreign language learning. Once the process is learned,
 the skills are transferrable to other languages.
 As we've moved toward more choices in our public high schools, foreign language
 and mathematics are the only subjects remaining which require sequential learn-
 ing-language and math depend not only on the learning of a lesson but also its
 retention as a student progresses through three or four years of the subject.
 In learning a foreign language many students become aware for the first time of
 the importance of their own language and grammar and of its richness. This is
 especially true when they confront concepts which cannot be translated and idioms
 which are meaningless when transliterated.
 NEA's ploicy statements on foreign language study occur in two items adopted by
 the Representative Assembly, the organization's highest decision-making body. Reso-
 lution B-4, Foreign Language Education, reads in part: "The Association supports
 the maintenance of current programs and the encouragement and development of
 foreign language instruction and international studies programs."
 In additions, NEA's tripartite definition of national security includes as one
 component ". . . the education ... of all citizens." Copies of the full text of both of
 these statements are attached to this testimony.
 In preparing this testimony, we have concentrated on several areas which
 demand foreign language proficiency: the national defense and foreign policy, inter-
 national trade and business needs, and the shrinking and interdependent world we
 face as we approach the 21st century. We have also reviewed carefully, in addition
 to the professional literature, "Strength Through Wisdom: A Critique of U.S. Capa-
 bility,"' "More Competence in Foreign Languages Needed by Federal Personnel
 ' President's Commission on Foreign Language and Area Studies; "Strength Through Wisdom:
 A Critique of U.S. Capability" (Washington, D.C.: U.S Government Printing Office, Stock No.

 Working Overseas," 2 and Representative Simon's "The Tongue-Tied American: Con-
 fronting the Foreign Language Crisis." 3 All of these books are alarming in their
 indictment of our national neglect of foreign language study, and in their entirety
 warrant your careful consideration as you also consider H.R. 3231.
 LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: THEIR FUNCTION AND IMPORTANCE
 To set the tone of this testimony, I'd like to quote one of your distinguished
 colleagues in the other body, Senator Hayakawa: "(W)hen we concern ourselves
 with how people talk, we are not worrying about the elegance of their pronunciation
 or the correctness of their grammar. Basica1l7 we are concerned with the adequacy
 of their language as a `map' of the `territory of experience being talked about ...
 Words . . . are more than descriptions of the territory of human experience; they
 are evaluations. How we think and evaluate is inextricably bound up with how we
 talk." 4
 Thus language is not just words; language is words with meaning in a mutually
 understood context, or culture. Another eminent linguist, Nelson Brooks, has said:
 "Language is the most typical, the most representative, and the most central
 element in any culture. Language and culture are not separable; it is better to see
 the special characteristics of a language as cultural entities and to recognize that
 language enters into the learning and use of nearly all other cultural elements. The
 detailed facts of culture cannot properly be evaluated in isolation but must be seen
 as integrated parts of the total way of life in which they appear." [Emphasis
 added.) 5
 Americans' failure to realize that language and culture are a single, total entity
 accounts for most if not all of our unfortunately deserved reputation as "ugly
 Americans" who believe the solution is to "let 'em learn English."
 An illustration of the need for cultural understanding-or at the very least
 tolerance-is provided by our television sets in the perennially popular program
 M*A*S*H. An ongoing subtle message is the need to view with some sympathy the
 culture of the LIP's-the local indigenous personnel, in Army-ese-with whom the
 characters come into contact. The sympathetic characters have a sense of this need
 and an openness to learn more about that culture: Hawkeye at one point falls in
 love with a Korean noblewoman and participates with her in a traditional funeral;
 BJ "adopts" a local family and runs into their resistance to regular ingestion of
 sulfa during a pneumonia threat; Radar learns to speak some Korean; Col. Potter
 gives up his beloved horse to a former colonel of the Korean cavalry so that the old
 man may die with dignity in full military regalia; the medical staff permits a witch
 doctor to "exorcise" the evil spirits which an old Korean believes are impeding his
 recovery. The more insular characters, on the other hand-first Frank Burns, then
 Charles Emerson Winchester as ugly Americans-regularly denigrate the ways and
 language of the Koreans.
 As the President's Commission sees it:
 "Americans' incompetence in foreign languages is nothing short of scandalous,
 and it is becoming worse. Historically, to be sure, America's continental position
 between vast oceans was a basis for linguistic as well as political isolation, but
 rocketry as well as communications satellites render such a moat mentality obsolete
 *  *  *
 "Our vital interests are impaired by the fatuous notion that our competence in
 other languages is irrelevant. Indeed, it is precisely because of this nation's respon-
 sibilities and opportunities as a major power and as a symbol of ideals to which
 many of the world's people aspire that foreign languages, as a key to unlock the
 mysteries of other customs and cultures, can no longer be viewed as an educational
 or civil luxury."6
 That this blindness on our part to the critical need for dealing with others who
 share our planet but not our way of life cripples us in the conduct of our defense/
 foreign policy and of our business is not well enough understood by those who make
 and implement education policy. It is not surprising, therefore, that our attention to

 foreign language study had declined seriously since the peak attained following the
 launching of Sputnik in 1957.
 NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY
 The federal government is the largest single U.S. employer of language-skilled
 personnel. In fiscal year 1979 the federal language-skilled work force, both overseas
 and U.S.-based, totalled something more than 30,000.7
 The defense and foreign policy communities require broad education in foreign
 languages. Some examples are:
 Military personnel stationed abroad interacting with, getting to know, the local
 residents who represent the culture-and, in the process, enlightening them on
 American thoughts and ways;
 Diplomats at all levels stationed abroad and charged with maintaining lines of
 communication with people who are more or less, depending on geopolitical factors,
 amicable toward the United States government; and
 Citizens abroad who are viewed not as military or diplimatic but are working in
 various ways to help the people of the host country on a more individual level, such
 as the Peace Corps, the Agency for International Development (AID), the Foreign
 Agricultural Services (FAS), and the International Communications Agency (ICA).
 These Americans are truly the front line in national security/ foreign policy,
 because they are the people who are demonstrating on a one-on-one basis that
 Americans are not evil, are not inherently bellicose, and are genuine contributors to
 the global community. Generally, however, these ambassadors of the American way
 of life have limited, if any, proficiency in foreign languages. The President's Com-
 mission pronounced itself "alarmed" at the ". . . serious deterioration in this coun-
 try's language and research capacity, at a time when an increasingly hazardous
 international military, political and economic environment is making unprecedent
 demands on America's resources, intellectual capacity and public sensitivity . .
 (T)he United States requires far more reliable capacities to communicate with its
 allies, analyze the behavior of potential adversaries, and earn the trust and the
 sympathies of the uncommitted.' 8
 Yet AID procedures, for example, designate a far greater percentage of positions
 as requiring language proficiency in the so-called "world" languages-i.e., Spanish,
 French-than in the "hard" (or more rare) languages such as Arabic and Persian.
 Worldwide, 92 percent of all AID positions requiring language require Spanish,
 French, or Portuguese; the other eight percent are spread among Indonesian, Thai,
 Eastern Arabic, Persian, Nepali, Swahili, and Urdu.9
 As Representative Simon points out: ". . . (O)nly twenty-six federal positions are
 now designated as requiring Mandarin Chinese. For the most powerful nation on
 earth virtually to ignore the language spoken by more people on the face of the
 earth than any other, simply defies belief. spoken
 Federal policy for requiring language skills of its employees who will be serving
 abroad seems to depend more on the likelihood that the recruit has already mas-
 tered-or at least been exposed to-a foreign language upon entering government
 service than on any consideration of the language needs that an individual will
 encounter when placed in a host country. Moreover, since no federal agency is
 required by law or policy "to designate any staff position . . . as requiring language
 proficiency," " virtually no support positions are so designated.
 The President's Commission estimates that one of every eight American manufac-
 turing jobs, and one of every three farm acres, are somehow involved in internation-
 al trade, and that 20,000 American firms are in the export business. 12 According to a
 1974-75survey of the 6,000 businesses operating overseas, the 23 percent, or roughly
 1,500, which responded cited 60,000 jobs which required competency in a language
 in addition to English. "Assuming that the remaining 77 percent of the firms would
 at least double that number, at least 120,000 jobs among major U.S. business firms
 require a foreign language. Most estimates place that figure substantially higher." "
 The President's Commission further estimates American overseas investment at
 $300 billion and foreign investment here at $245 billion, with nearly 50 percent of

 the earnings of the thirteen largest banks in America coming from overseas. The
 Commission concludes: "(E)ach $1 billion of exported manufactured goods creates at
 least 30,000 jobs in the U.S. (thus proving) our growing economic interdependence
 with the rest of the world." 14
 Those numbers are big business and big dollars by anyone's standards.
 And where are those nongovernmental Americans who live and work overseas?
 Surely they are not all in the world capitals-Tokyo, Paris, London, Bonn, Rome-
 where an exclusively English-speaking American can get by because of the host
 natives' tolerance and skill in English. Many are in the oil fields of the Middle East
 or Venezuela; others are searching for mineral resources in African and other
 developing nations; some are medically and/or spiritually servicing remote tribes in
 Asia or South America; still others are scattered around the globe in places I
 probably never heard of and contending with languages the names of which may be
 new to us. Clearly, these Americans have need of substantial cultural understand-
 ing and tolerance, some basic grounding in linguistics, and probably a lot of luck.
 I am not suggesting that the American public education system should make
 course offerings which would meet the needs of anyone who might someday be
 working among native speakers of some of the more exotic of the world's languages.
 As a learner and a teacher of foreign language, though, I believe that the strength-
 ening and expansion of foreign language programs in our elementary and secondary
 schools and our postsecondary institutions require immediate and urgent atten-
 tion-from all levels of government and from the private sector-if we are to be
 competitive as a nation in the world of the 21st century.
 FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY: THE STATE OF THE ART
 Attached for the Subcommittee's information is an article, "The Akron Story,"
 describing an elementary school foreign language program that's working.
 Particularly valuable in researching this section of the testimony were Repre-
 sentative Simon's Chapters 5 and 6. "The Bad News from Our Elementary and High
 Schools" and "Colleges and Universities-A Mixed Picture."
 The study of modern foreign language was immensely spurred by the climate of
 fear of technological and linguistic insufficiency that followed the Soviet move into
 space in 1957. As so often happens in the political give and take of our democracy, it
 is only after some external stimulus forces itself into our collective consciousness
 that we as a nation respond by doing precisely what the "experts" had been
 recommending for years. Thus it was that Sputnik led directly to Congressional
 enactment of NDEA, which encouraged study in, among other subjects, foreign
 languages.
 The 1960's were boom years for foreign language. Teacher training for foreign
 languages was federally subsidized to a great degree; foreign language enrollment in
 the secondary schools and postsecondary institutions was high. In the mid-60's, for
 example, 24 percent of secondary students studied foreign language; 34 percent of
 postsecondary institutions had admission standards requiring foreign language.
 These figures today are drastically reduced: 15 percent and eight percent respective-
 ly. 1s
 Public secondary school enrollments in foreign languages declined by 15 percent
 from 1968 to 1974. In 1968, 27.1 percent of the total public secondary school enrol-
 ment were studying foreign language; by 1974, only 19.2 percent were enrolled in
 foreign language.16
 NEA estimates that for school year 1980-81 some 3.5 percent of, or 77,000 public
 elementary and secondary teachers spent the major part of the school day teaching
 foreign language.17 Cumulative estimates show that, beginning with 1960 at three
 percent, the percentage of foreign language teachers rose, gradually but steadily,
 peaking in 1969 at 5.6 percent; since then a decline has set in and continues.18
 Thus there are currently fewer than one foreign language teacher for each 500
 students enrolled in the public schools. Obviously, we are not concentrating much
 on the systematic encouragement of the study of foreign language and, by defini-
 tion, different cultures.
 Nor are we emphasizing foreign language at the postsecondary level. "(F)ewer
 than 10 percent of all college students are required to have a record of having

 studied a language or having a competence in one in order to get into a college, and
 fewer than one-fifth of all college students . . . ever receive any foreign language
 instruction." 19
 Between 1968 and 1977, the percentage of higher education enrollments in the
 five most taught foreign languages (French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish)
 declined by 21.2 percent; the percent of college students enrolled in these language
 programs dropped from 15 percent in 1968 to 8.2 percent in 1977. Worse yet, despite
 national security needs, higher education students enrolled in Russian fell 20.1
 percent between 1968 and 1974, and declined another 14.6 percent between 1974 and
 1977.20
 And scope of foreign language study is not the whole problem. While very few
 0        postsecondary students are receiving any instruction in foreign language, most of
 those who do are concentrating in Spanish, French, or German, to the virtual
 exclusion of Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and the more exotic languages.21 More-
 over, too many of the foreign language courses offered in postsecondary institutions
 are taugth for only three hours per week, when most experts agree that such
 instruction should have a minimum of five hours per week. We are hardly prepar-
 ing students for the world they will face.
 H.R. 3231
 H.R. 3231 is one of the first serious efforts in years to deal comprehensively with
 the problem of our national language ignorance. It is a simple, straightforward,
 relatively inexpensive bill. Perhaps one of its most attractive features is that, by
 making funds avilable to state education agencies for foreign language programs
 designed and implemented at the local level and directly to postsecondary institu-
 tions, it automatically refutes the charge that foreign language instruction is a
 "frill" that can and should be sacrificed during times of fiscal austerity.
 In general, NEA supports H.R. 3231. We do, however, have one major objection:
 Sec. 2(b)(2) requires that programs at the local level to made available to all
 children in a school district whether or not they are enrolled in public school in
 that district. In a political climate that is engendering controversy over forms of aid
 to nonpublic school students and that is generating substantial Congressional and
 public support for tuition tax credits, such a provision is unacceptable to NEA.
 Our only other substantive comment on H.R. 3231 relates to Sec. 3, which we feel
 may reflect an unintentional oversight. By consistently using the term "institution
 of higher education," which generally is interpreted to mean four-year colleges and
 universities, we wonder if the bill is not precluding from receiving its benefits the
 various two-year postsecondary institutions. Since Representative Simon devotes
 considerable attention in his book to the potential of community and junior col-
 leges,22 we doubt seriously that it was the sponsors' intent to exclude these vital
 postsecondary educational institutions. We respectfully suggest that perfecting lan-
 guage may be in order.
 Once again, we commend the sponsors and this Subcommittee for your attention
 to the pressing need for foreign language education, and we stand ready to help
 assure enactment of this important legislation. Thank you.
 B-4. FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION
 The National Education Association believes that foreign language instruction is
 an important part of the total educational process and an integral part of interna-
 tional studies.
 The Association supports the maintenance of current programs and the encour-
 agement and development of foreign language instruction and international studies
 programs.
 The Association recognizes the need for teacher training programs for foreign
 language teachers, and supports teacher exchange programs.
 National security.-The security of our nation is enhanced by the pursuit of peace
 through multilateral strategic arms limitation; by an adequate defense built on
 military strength; and by the education, strength, and health of all citizens. The
 three factors in national security should be adequately reflected in the national
 budget.

 (By Eileen Silva Kindig, Free-Lance Writer, Medina, Ohio)
 For more than 20 years, the Akron, Ohio, school district has required that every
 child in its elementary schools be exposed to French, Spanish, or German. All sixth
 grade students therefore receive foreign language instruction for 20 minutes a day.
 Akron's elementary language program is designed more to prepare students for
 systematic study than to provide that study. Its aim is to get children to accept
 another means of verbal communication and to want to find out more. Its success is
 solid. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages cited the Akron
 program as one of 50 outstanding language programs in the nation.
 The Council had several reasons for its choice, says Sandra Hammond, Project
 Coordinator of the Survey of Successful Secondary School Foreign Language Pro-
 grams. Two criteria of success were high enrollment and extensive course offerings.
 In addition, Ms. Hammond explains, "Akron's compulsory sixth grade program was
 one of the main reasons for its selection. During the late 60's and early 70's, there
 were many elementary foreign language programs throughout the country, but with
 the budget cuts of the last five years, most of them have been eliminated. Akron is
 unique in that it emphasizes language as a necessity rather than a frill."
 The coordination of the Akron program is important, Ms. Hammond points out.
 "In areas which show a high rate of attrition, you often find that a program lacks
 sequential coordination."
 National recognition is gratifying, but the consensus among Akron's language
 teachers seems to be that the real proof of their program's success lies in the junior
 high foreign language enrollment figures. While elective language classes across the
 country are losing students, Akron's secondary level classes are attracting more
 than ever. Roughly two-thirds of all Akron seventh graders choose to continue
 studying a foreign language.
 Former French and Spanish teacher John Durden directs Akron's foreign lan-
 guage program. He considers that although compulsory early exposure is vitally
 important, it isn't enough ' to inspire children to want to learn more. School guid-
 ance counselors can help by encouraging students to pursue language study. And
 basic to success are motivated teachers and a program that allows each child to
 experience success at his or her own level of competence.
 Akron has both. Language teachers stay open to new ideas by listening to guest
 speakers-such foreign language experts as Lorraine Strasheim of Indiana Universi-
 ty, Edward Allen of Ohio State University, and Fred Jenks of Florida State Univer-
 sitry.
 "The underlying theme of every speaker," Durden reports, "has been the impor-
 tance of individualization. In the past, languages have had the reputation of appeal-
 ing only to the elite. Today we're trying to reach inner city kids too, and to do this
 we can t afford to have classes that are too rigidly structured."
 Speakers have emphasized another trend in language teaching also. In the early
 sixties, the curriculum was based primarily on understanding and speaking. Now
 teachers stress writing and reading as well in order to give students a tangible hold
 on the language. Classes commonly cover less material than before but do it using
 all four phases of learning.
 Akron's dozen elementary foreign language teachers work hard to maintain the
 level of the program. French teacher Frank Dworkin has been part of the elemen-
 tary language program since its adoption by the school board in 1961. Like the other
 teachers in the program, she travels each day to three or four schools throughout
 the city to meet with her classes.
 "I tell my children this is the way it is in France. The teacher comes to the class
 rather than the class coming to the teacher," she says cheerfully.
 Mrs. Dworkin believes that language classes should be an enjoyable cultural
 experience. "My purpose isn't to be an entertainer, of course, but it's really advanta-
 geous for the children to see how people live and talk in another country. Besides,
 when I use puppets and songs with students, they get involved with the subject.
 "When I can, I also like to integrate what we do in French class with what's
 happening in the students' other classes. Once for language arts they dressed up as
 storybook characters, and I had them introduce their characters in French during
 my class."
 Mrs. Dworkin has made consistent use of the Student Letter Exchange in Waseca,
 Minnesota, to provide her students in French during my class."
 Mrs. Dworkin has made consistent use of the Student Letter Exchange in Waseca,
 Minnesota, to provide her students with French pen pals. Because of the high cost
 of postage and the acquisition price of 50 cents per name, however, she's recently
 been forced to limit participation. Rather than give everyone a name, she requires

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 each student in her nine classes to write a sample letter. One the basis of these
 samples, she selects one boy and one girl from each class to write to a pen pal in
 France. Every letter that is shared opens cultural doors.
 The Amity Program at Akron's Buchtel University High School is a resource that
 Akron's language teachers value highly. This magnet program attracts academic
 achievers from all over the city. Buchtel students spend three periods a day in study
 of world cultures, languages, and literatures.
 Exchange students from abroad attend classes at Buchtel. The school's students
 have access to a computer-based introductory and remedial language program, as
 well as to facilities on the University of Akron campus.
 The Amity Program benefits all of Akron's foreign language teachers in two
 ways: It attracts attention to some of the special advantages Akron offers secondary
 language students, and it provides foreign guests who can add immensely to elemen-
 tary language classes.
 Given so much dedication and activity, does the elementary language program
 give its students anything beyond the interest and motivation that are its avowed
 aims? "I think that good pronunciation is one 'extra,'" Fran Dworkin says. "When
 you get kids before they go into junior high, they're less inhibited than they are
 later."
 Program director John Durden couldn't agree more. "One of the biggest advan-
 tages to starting children out early with a second language is that their pronuncia-
 tion is so much better," he says. "As a matter of fact, psychologists at McGill
 University in Canada have observed that adults learn foreign languages faster than
 children because they bring with them all their past learning experiences, but
 children have better pronunciation and always will."
 Learning a foreign language on the elementary level also seems to make children
 more aware of language in general and perhaps even help them improve their skills
 in English. According to Robert J. Di Pietro of the University of Delaware, the
 study of foreign languages does indeed help children learn to read better in English.
 Studying foreign language programs in Virginia Di Pietro found that the reading of
 children in grades one through six at Key Elementary School in Arlington improved
 markedly after the children took a 14-week experimental language program. Using
 lesson plans which dovetailed with the course work being taught in regular math
 and social studies classes, instructors taught their classes in Spanish, Korean, or
 Vietnamese. They also gave students a look at the culture, history, and art of the
 specific country they happened to be studying.
 Yet another "extra" evident in the Akron elementary program is the positive
 attitude toward learning that language teachers like Mabel Brown can inspire. Ms.
 Brown, a Spanish teacher with considerable elementary experience, spends half of
 her day instructing inner-city children. Observers of Ms. Brown's classes typically
 note the sense of harmony between teacher and class and the obvious enjoyment of
 both: When the class period ends, groans of dismay fill the room.
 "I don't think learning a language should be drudgery," Ms. Brown says. "I'm
 enthusiastic, and the students pick up on it. Even with my last class of the day I
 don't let down-it's the first time those kids have seen me all day. I praise the
 children a lot, too, and they really respond to that. When they make mistakes, I
 don't dwell on it. I just correct them and go on."
 Language learning in Akron is in fact far from being all work. Teachers use
 games, puppets, songs, foreign foods, flash cards, and any other aspects of foreign
 culture available to them to stimulate interest. Students who might otherwise reject
 language study are enjoying it instead-and looking forward to more.
 Enthusiastic parents are a bonus in any educational program, and Akron seems
 to have plenty of them.
 "The parents like what we're doing a whole lot," says Fran Dworkin. "Those who
 move into our school system from other areas are delighted that their children have
 such an opportunity."
 "One of the main reasons Akron has been able to keep an elementary program
 going is parental support," John Durden agrees. "The parents got the whole thing
 started 21 years ago. The PTA hired a French teacher, and the parents paid the
 entire cost.
 "School levies always pass in Akron, and as a result our schools are debt-free and
 we have the funds to keep on with this. Also, we try to listen to input from parents
 because we've found that it pays off in student interest. For example, in one school
 where we were teaching German, the parents came and requested that we switch to
 Spanish. When we did, enrollment on the secondary level increased."
 Research indicates that parents' response nationwide is just as positive as that
 which Akron educators have experienced firsthand. A survey conducted at the
 University of Michigan for the President's Commission on Foreign Language and

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 International Studies revealed that of the respondents who were parents, an over-
 whelming number wanted their chidren to study a foreign language. More than
 three-fourths felt strongly that elementary schools should offer such study.
 Akron is one school system that has responded to parents' demand for foreign
 language teaching. Akron students, in turn, have responded to their parents' and
 teachers' enthusiasm. When parents, teachers, and students agree that foreign
 language learning is basic, they can make it so.
 STATEMENT OF BERNIE FREITAG, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL
 EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
 Mr.  FREITAG.  Sehr geehrter Herr Vorsitzender and verehrte
 Mitglieder dieses Ausschusses, ich heisse Bernie Freitag, bin vize-
 praesident der NEA (National Education Association), die groesste
 Organisation von professoren, Erziehern and Schularbeitern inden
 Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika.
 Wir freuen uns, dass wir die Einladung bekommen haben, unsere
 allgemeine Unterstuetzung von H.R. 3231 heute zum Ausdruck zu
 bringen. Es gibt zwar eine Bestimmung von H.R. 3231, womit wir
 Schwierigkeiten haetten, aber dazu werden wir etwas spaeter Stel-
 lung nehmen.
 Zunaechst moechten wir die Foerderer von H.R. 3231 fuer ihren
 Beistand zu diesem Vorschlag loben, weil sie sich dafuer eisetzen,
 dass in den Schulen and Universitaeten der USA, die Gelegenheit
 eine Fremdsprache zu studieren and zu beherrschen, immer mehr
 die Regel wird.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you. [Laughter.]
 Very good. Go ahead.
 Mr. FREITAG. Members of the committee might be interested in
 knowing that I am, by training, experience, and regular employ-
 ment, a teacher of foreign language. I teach secondary school
 German at Council Rock High School in Newtown, Pa., where I
 have also served as coordinator of the foreign language department
 for about 15 years. Prior to that, I taught for 3 years in private
 Catholic high schools in Maryland and Pennsylvania.
 I myself received much of my professional training as a teacher
 of language through such federally sponsored programs as the
 National Defense Education Act, and received the Fulbright-Hayes
 teaching grant.
 I would like to add, parenthetically, that I am a cofounder and
 the national vice president of the United German American Com-
 mittee of the United States and also have been on the national
 board of directors of Schwaben International. Both of those organi-
 zations are nonprofit organizations that strongly support language
 learning, foreign language newspapers and radio, and also people-
 to-people contact on a nonprofit basis.
 As you might imagine, as one educated in a liberal arts program,
 I have some strong feelings about the subject under discussion
 today. Certain facts I have learned through experience underly my
 testimony.
 First of all, the important point is to start students on a foreign
 language, any language, at as early an age as possible. Much of the
 work in acquiring a first foreign language has to do with the
 process of foreign language learning. Once the process is learned,
 the skills are transferable to other languages.
 Second, as we have moved toward more choices in our public
 high schools, foreign language and mathematics are the only sub-
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 jects remaining which require sequential learning. Language and
 math depend not only on the learning of a lesson but also on its
 retention as a student progresses through 3 or 4 years of the
 subject.
 In learning a foreign language, many students become aware for
 the first time of the importance of their own language and gram-
 mar and of its richness. This is especially true when they confront
 concepts which cannot be translated in idioms which are meaning-
 less when transliterated.
 NEA's policy statements on foreign language occur in two items
 adopted by the representative assembly, the organization's highest
 decisionmaking body. Resolution B-4, foreign language education,
 reads, in part.
 The association supports the maintenance of current programs and the encourage-
 ment and development of foreign language instruction and international studies
 programs.
 In addition, NEA's tripartite definition of "national security"
 includes as one component "the education of all citizens."
 Copies of the full text of both of these statements are attached to
 this testimony. And, Mr. Erdahl, I would like to skip over to page 9
 of my testimony just to highlight that portion but, of course, know
 that all of the testimony will be in the record.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Surely.
 Mr. FREITAG. Concerning the state of the art, we have attached
 for the subcommittee's information an article, "The Akron Story,"
 describing an elementary school foreign language program that is
 working, particularly valuable in researching this section of the
 testimony were Representative Simon's chapters 5 and 6, "The Bad
 News from our Elementary and High Schools" and "Colleges and
 Universities: A Mixed Picture."
 A study of modern foreign language was immensely spurred by
 the climate of fear of technological and linguistic insufficiency that
 followed the Soviet move into space in 1957. As so often happens in
 the political give-and-take of our democracy, it is only after some
 external stimulus forces itself into our collective consciousness that
 we as a nation respond by doing precisely what the experts had
 been recommending for years.
 Thus it was that Sputnik led directly to congressional enactment
 of NDEA, which encouraged study in, among other things, foreign
 languages. The 1960's were boom years for foreign languages.
 Teacher training for foreign languages was federally subsidized to
 a great degree. Foreign language enrollment in the secondary
 schools and postsecondary institutions was high. In the mid-1960's,
 for example, 24 percent of secondary students studied foreign lan-
 guage; 34 percent of postsecondary institutions had admission
 standards requiring foreign language. These figures today are dras-
 tically reduced: 15 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
 Public secondary school enrollments in foreign languages de-
 clined by 15 percent from 1968 to 1974. In 1968, 27.1 percent of the
 total public secondary school enrollment were studying foreign
 language. By 1974, only 19.2 percent were enrolled in foreign lan-
 guage.
 NEA estimates that for school year 1980-81, some 3.5 percent of,
 or 77,000, public elementary and secondary teachers spent the
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 major part of the schoolday teaching foreign language. Cumulative
 estimates show that beginning with 1960, at 3 percent, the percent-
 age of foreign language teachers rose gradually but steadily, peak-
 ing in 1969 at 5.6 percent.
 Since then, a decline has set in, and continues. Thus, there are
 currently fewer than one foreign-language teacher for each 500
 students enrolled in the public schools. Obviously, we are not con-
 centrating much on the systematic encouragement of the study of
 foreign language and, by definition, different cultures, nor are we
 emphasizing foreign language at the postsecondary level: "Fewer
 than 10 percent of all college students are required to have a
 record of having studied a language or having a competence in one
 in order to get into a college, and fewer than one-fifth of all college
 students ever receive any foreign-language instruction."
 Between 1968 and 1977 the percentage of higher education en-
 rollments in the five most-taught foreign languages, which are
 French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish, declined by 21.2
 percent. The percent of college students enrolled in these language
 programs dropped from 15 percent in 1968 to 8.2 percent in 1977.
 Worse yet, despite national security needs, higher education stu-
 dents enrolled in Russian fell 20.1 percent between 1968 and 1974,
 and declined another 14.6 percent between 1974 and 1977.
 And scope of foreign language studies not the whole problem.
 While very few postsecondary students are receiving any instruc-
 tion in foreign language, most of those who do are concentrating in
 Spanish, French, or German, to the virtual exclusion of Russian,
 Japanese, Chinese, and the more exotic languages.
 Moreover, too many of the foreign language courses offered in
 postsecondary institutions are taught for only 3 hours per week,
 when most experts agree that such instruction should have a mini-
 mum of 5 hours per week. We are hardly preparing students for
 the world they will face.
 H.R. 3231 is one of the first serious efforts in years to deal
 comprehensively with the problem of our national language igno-
 rance. It is a simple, straightforward, relatively inexpensive bill.
 Perhaps one of its most attractive features is that by making funds
 available to State educational agencies for foreign-language pro-
 grams designed and implemented at the local level and directly to
 postsecondary institutions, it automatically refutes the charge that
 foreign-language instruction is a frill that can and should be sacri-
 ficed during times of fiscal austerity.
 In general, NEA supports H.R. 3231. We do, however, have one
 major objection: Section 2(b)(2) requires that programs at the local
 level be made available to all children in a school district whether
 or not they are enrolled in public school in that district. In a
 political climate, that is engendering controversy over forms of aid
 to nonpublic school students, and that is generating substantial
 congressional and public support for tuition tax credits. Such a
 provision is unacceptable to NEA.
 Our only other substantive comment on H.R. 3231 relates to
 section 3, which we feel may reflect an unintentional oversight. By
 consistently using the term "institutions of higher education,"
 which generally is interpreted to mean 4-year colleges and univer-

 sities, we wonder if the bill is not precluding from receiving its
 benefits the various 2-year postsecondary institutions.
 Since Representative Simon devotes considerable attention in his
 book to the potential of community and junior colleges, we doubt
 seriously that it was the sponsor's intent to exclude these vital
 postsecondary educational institutions. We respectfully suggest
 that perfecting language may be in order.
 Once again, we commend the sponsors and this subcommittee for
 your attention to the pressing need for foreign-language education.
 And we stand ready to help assure enactment of this important
 legislation. Thank you.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you very much.
 Again, I am going to have to run over for a vote. And if it is OK
 with the other participants, if you are willing to wait and maybe
 forego lunch, at least at this time, I will try to get back as soon as
 possible. Could you do that?
 Thank you very much.
 [Brief recess.]
 Mr. ERDAHL. I apologize for the interruption.
 The next on our list is Dorothy Shields, director of education for
 [?AFT -CIO.
 Mrs. Shields, thank you. And please proceed.
 [The prepared statement of Dorothy Shields follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DOROTHY  SHIELDS,  DIRECTOR,  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCA-
 TION,  AMERICAN  FEDERATION  OF  LABOR  &                                  CONGRESS  OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZA-
 TIONS
 I am pleased to testify today on behalf of the AFL-CIO in support of H.R. 3231.
 The bill provides grants for foreign language programs to improve foreign language
 study for elementary and secondary school programs and provides per capita grants
 to reimburse institutions of higher learning for part of the costs of providing foreign
 language instruction. The AFL-CIO is on record in support of increasing federal
 assistance for foreign language study.
 In December 1979, the AFL-CIO at its convention, approved a resolution fully
 supporting the recommendations of the President's Commission on Foreign Lan-
 guages and International Studies. A copy of the resolution is attached to our
 testimony. The AFL-CIO supports H.R. 3231 as a means of implementing many of
 t:he recommendations of the Commission's report.
 We have also been active on the national level, through participation in the
 President's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies, in the
 development of recommendations to improve foreign language study programs, and
 the National Council on Foreign Language and International Studies which grew
 out of the Commission report.
 The American labor movement has been active in international labor and labor-
 political organizations for a century. The labor movement is intrinsically bound up
 in common interests shared with workers and unions the world over. The aspira-
 tions of workers everywhere enjoy a common denominator, freedom to collectively
 better their lives. Communication at the international level has, therefore, always
 been important to the American labor movement. In the 1960's the AFL-CIO began
 an extensive program of international assistance to fledgling democratic labor move-
 ments in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Given the unique characteristics of our
 society, recruitment from the American rank-and-file of persons with considerable
 trade union experience who also spoke a second language owing to familiar back-
 ground, was sometimes possible. In other cases, American trade unionists were
 trained in second languages in order to carry out their roles as instructors abroad.
 In the eighth decade of the twentieth century, the concept of a global village has
 become reality. Modern systems of communication via satellite, have made all of the
 world's inhabitants intimate neighbors. Language has become even more important
 to all of us as a result of the revolution in communications and travel. The sad fact
 remains that language training in the public school system of our country lags far
 behind that of all the other industrialized market economies of our world. Usually,
 Americans, whether in diplomatic service or industry abroad, continue to be the

 worst examples of monocultural representatives who speak English, a woefully
 inadequate tool in today's mulit-cultural world.
 The old prevailing argument of fortress America, with monolithic culture, self-
 sustaining economy and the "highest standard of living in the world," has long been
 a myth. Today's world, characterized at the highest level by the Common Market
 and a plethora of international institutions that run the gamut from the United
 Nations and its specialized agencies to the OECD, requires the participation of
 world citizens, who can communicate clearly with one another. The baisc factor of
 that communication is language training. We should start at the elementary level
 and equip those of our society who will be called upon to perform at the internation-
 al level with language expertise far greater than is provided by today's relatively
 ineffective crash courses in language training. The U.S. education system cannot
 afford to trail behind the rest of the industrialized world in this vital concept.
 In April 1978, President Jimmy Carter established, through Executive Order No.
 12054, the President's Commission on Foreign Languages and International Studies.
 The Commission was empowered to recommend means for directing public attention
 to the importance of foreign language and international studies for the improve-
 ment of communications and understanding with other nations in an increasingly
 interdependent world. It also was asked to assess the need in the United States for
 foreign language and area specialists, ways in which foreign language and interna-
 tional studies contribute to meeting these needs, and the job market for individuals
 with these skills.
 In addition, the Commission made recommendations concerning desirable levels
 and kinds of support for foreign language area studies that should be provided by
 the public and private sectors as well as to review existing legislation and suggest
 needed changes to carry out the Commission's recommendations.
 Jack F. Otero, Executive-Vice Chairman, represented the AFL-CIO on the Presi-
 dent's Commission and several other labor representatives contributed to the work
 of the Commission, its findings and recommendations.
 The Commission noted in its report a significant decline in the study of foreign
 languages and international issues in the nation's schools and colleges and it recom-
 mended that greater emphasis should be placed on the study of these subjects. The
 report indicated that the Commission members were "profoundly alarmed" by the
 serious deterioration in this country's language and research capacity, at a time
 when an increasingly hazardous international military, political and economic envi-
 ronment is making unprecendented demands on America's resources, intellectual
 capacity and public sensitivity.
 "The problem extends from our elementary schools, where instruction in foreign
 languages and cultures has virtually disappeared, to the threatened imminent loss
 of some of the world's leading centers for advanced training and research on foreign
 areas. Such specific educational neglect, moreover, is reflected in public uncertainty
 about the relationship between American interests and goals and those of other
 peoples and other cultures. Nothing less is at issue than the nation's security."
 ("Strength Through Wisdom: A Critique of U.S. Capability," Report To The Presi-
 dent From the President's Commission On Foreign Language and International
 Studies-November 1979)
 America's incompetence in foreign languages, the report declared, is nothing
 short of scandalous and it is becoming worse. The members of the Commission
 believed that our lack of foreign language competence diminished our capabilities in
 diplomacy, in foreign trade and in citizen comprehension of the world in which we
 live and compete.
 It is disturbing to read that, as of 1979:
 Only 15 percent of American high school students studied foreign language-
 down from 24 percent in 1965.
 Only one out of 20 public high school students studied French, German or Russian
 beyond the second year. (Four years is considered a minimum prerequisite for
 useable language competence.)
 Only 8 percent of American colleges and universities required a foreign language
 for admission, compared with 34 percent in 1966.
 It was estimated that there were 10,000 English-speaking Japanese business rep-
 resentatives on assignment in the United States. There were fewer than 900 Ameri-
 can counterparts in Japan-and only a handful of those had a working knowledge
 of Japanese.
 The foreign affairs agencies of the U.S. government were deeply concerned that
 declining foreign language enrollments in our schools and colleges would lower the
 quality of new recruits for their services and increase language training costs,
 already at a level of $100 million in 1978.

 In order to remedy some of these national deficiencies, the Commission recom-
 mended that the Department of Education should provide incentive funding to
 schools and post-secondary institutions for foreign language teaching. It also urged
 schools, colleges and universities to reinstate foreign language requirements. New
 Department of Education funded programs were recommended to encourage foreign
 language studies in the schools.
 H.R. 3231 would effect principal recommendations of the Commission by establish-
 ing a system of competitive grants to states for funding model foreign language
 programs in local school districts. In addition, grants would be given to colleges and
 universities that require foreign language study for graduation as well as grants to
 institutions for higher education based on their foreign language class enrollments.
 In a world of increasing interdependence and an ever present need for greater
 international cooperation, this measure represents an important step toward ex-
 panding communication among people.
 We urge legislative enactment of H.R. 3231.
 FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
 Whereas, In April 1978, through Executive Order No. 12054, President Jimmy
 Carter established the President's Commission on Foreign Language and Interna-
 tional Studies, and
 Whereas, Such Commission was empowered to:
 (1) Recommend means for directing public attention to the importance of foreign
 language and international studies for the improvement of communications and
 understanding with other nations in an increasingly interdependent world;
 (2) Assess the need in the United States for foreign language and area specialists
 ways, in which foreign language and international studies contribute to meeting
 these needs, and the job market for individuals with these skills.
 (3) Recommend what foreign language area studies programs are appropriate at
 all academic levels and recommend desirable levels and kinds of support for each
 that should be provided by the public and private sectors.
 (4) Review existing legislative authorities and make recommendations for changes
 needed to carry out most effectively the commission's recommendations.
 Whereas, A representative of organized labor named as a member of the commis-
 sion and several other distinguished labor leaders contributed greatly to the work of
 this commission, its findings and recommendations, and
 Whereas, Such recommendations, if implemented by the executive and legislative
 branches would place the United States in full compliance with the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation (better known as the Helsinki Agreement,
 which commits the participating countries to "encourage the study of foreign lan-
 guages and civilizations as an important means of expanding communication among
 peoples-for the strengthening of international cooperation,' and
 Whereas, Such recommendations are in the national interest given increasing
 world interdependence and the concomitant need for greater international coopera-
 tion. Therefore, be it
 Resolved, That the AFL-CIO goes on record supporting the findings and recom-
 mendations of the Presidential Commission on Foreign Language and International
 Studies, and be it further
 Resolved, That the AFL-CIO calls on the President and Congress to exert leader-
 ship in the legislative enactment of such finding and recommendations, and be it
 further
 Resolved, That the AFL-CIO pledges full cooperation and support in actively
 promoting the passage of such legislation.
 STATEMENT OF DOROTHY SHIELDS, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT
 OF EDUCATION, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR & CON-
 GRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Ms. SHIELDS. I am pleased to testify today on behalf of the AFL-
 CIO in support of H.R. 3231. The AFL-CIO is on record in support
 of increasing Federal assistance for foreign language study. In
 December 1979 the AFL-CIO at its convention approved a resolu-
 tion fully supporting the recommendations of the President's Com-
 mission on Foreign Languages and International Studies. A copy of
 the resolution is attached to our testimony.

 The AFL-CIO supports H.R. 3231 as a means of implementing
 many of the recommendations of the Commission's report. We have
 also been active on the national level, through participation in the
 President's Commission on Foreign Languages and International
 Studies, in the development of recommendations to improve foreign
 language study programs, and the National Council on Foreign
 Language and International Studies, which grew out of the Com-
 mission report.
 The American labor movement has been active in the interna-
 tional labor and labor political organizations for a century. The
 labor movement is intrinsically bound up in common interests
 shared with workers and unions the world over. The aspirations of
 workers everywhere enjoy a common denominator: freedom to col-
 lectively better their lives. Communication at the international
 level has, therefore, always been important to the American labor
 movement.
 In the 1960's the AFL-CIO began an intensive program of inter-
 national assistance to fledgling democratic labor movements in
 Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Given the unique characteristics
 of our society, recruitment from the American rank and file of
 persons with considerable trade union experience who also spoke a
 second language, owing to familiar background, was sometimes
 possible. In other cases, American trade unionists were trained in
 second language in order to carry out their role as instructors
 abroad.
 In the eighth decade of the 20th century the concept of a global
 village has become reality. Modern systems of communication via
 satellite have made all of the world's inhabitants intimate neigh-
 bors. Language has become even more important to all of us as a
 result of the revolution in communications and travel. The sad fact
 remains that language training in the public school system of our
 country lags far behind that of all the other industrialized market
 economies of the world. Usually, Americans, whether in diplomatic
 service or industry abroad, continue to be the worst examples of
 monocultural representatives who speak English, a woefully inad-
 equate tool in today's multicultural world.
 The old, prevailing argument of fortress America with monolith-
 ic culuture, self-sustaining economy, and the "highest standard of
 living in the world," has long been a myth. Today's world, charac-
 terized at the highest level by the Common Market and a plethora
 of international institutions that run the gamut from the United
 Nations and its specialized agencies to the OECD, requires the
 participation of world citizens who can communicate clearly with
 one another.
 The basic factor of that communication is language training. We
 should start early at the elementary level and equip those of our
 society who will be called upon to perform at the international
 level with language expertise far greater than is provided by
 today's relatively ineffective crash courses in language training.
 The U.S. education system cannot afford to trail behind the rest of
 the industrialized world in this vital concept.
 In April 1978 President Jimmy Carter established, through Ex-
 ecutive Order No. 12054, the President's Commission on Foreign
 Languages and International Studies. Jack F. Otero, executive vice

 chairman, represented the AFL-CIO on the President's Commis-
 sion, and several other labor representatives contributed to the
 work of the Commission, its findings and recommendations.
 The Commission noted in its report a significant decline in the
 study of foreign languages and international issues in the Nation's
 schools and colleges and recommended that greater emphasis
 should be placed on the study of these subjects. I quote from the
 Commission report:
 The problem extends from our elementary schools, where instruction in foreign
 languages and cultures has virtually disappeared to the threatened imminent loss of
 some of the world's leading centers for advanced training and research on foreign
 areas. Such specific educational neglect, moreover, is reflected in public uncertainty
 about the relationship between American interests and goals and those of other
 peoples and cultures. Nothing less is at issue than the nation's security.
 America's incompetence in foreign language, the report declared,
 is nothing short of scandalous and is becoming worse. The mem-
 bers of the Commission believed that our lack of foreign language
 competence diminished our capabilities in diplomacy in foreign
 trade, and in citizen comprehension of the world in which we live
 and compete.
 It is disturbing to read that as of 1979 only 15 percent of Ameri-
 can high school students studied foreign language, down from 24
 percent in 1965. Only 1 out of 20 public high school students
 studied French, German, or Russian beyond the second year. Only
 8 percent of American colleges and universities required a foreign
 language for admission, compared with 34 percent in 1966.
 It was estimated that there were 10,000 English-speaking Japa-
 nese business representatives on assignment in the United States.
 There were fewer than 900 American counterparts in Japan, and
 only a handful of those had a working knowledge of Japanese.
 The foreign affairs agencies of the U.S. Government were deeply
 concerned that declining foreign language enrollments in our
 schools and colleges would lower the quality of new recruits for
 their services and increase language training costs, already at a
 level of $100 million in 1978.
 H.R. 3231 would effect principal recommendations of the Com-
 mission by establishing a system of competitive grants for funding
 model foreign language programs in local school districts.
 In addition, grants would be given to colleges and universities
 that require foreign language study for graduation, as well as
 grants to institutions for higher education based on their foreign
 language class enrollments.
 In a world of increasing interdependence and an ever-present
 need for greater international cooperation, the AFL-CIO believes
 this measure represents an important step toward expanding com-
 munication among people. We urge enactment.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you very much.
 I understand, Mr. Neff, that you are feeling a bit under the
 weather, and it has been an ordeal waiting for this moment. So,
 again, you can just summarize briefly, if you wish, and your state-
 ment will be entered in the record.
 I note with approval that you are from the Associated Colleges of

 [The prepared testimony of Charles Neff follows:]
 PREPARED TESTIMONY OF CHARLES B. NEFF, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATED COLLEGES OF
 THE MIDWEST, AND ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT LAKES COLLEGES ASSOCIATION
 Mr. Simon and other committee members, I am happy to be here with you today
 to testify on the hearings relating to H.R. 3231, 97th Congress, First Session. I am
 Charles Neff, President of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, a consortium of
 thirteen liberal arts colleges located primarily in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minne-
 sota and Wisconsin, with an additional college in Colorado. With the permission of
 its leadership, I am also speaking on behalf of the Great Lakes Colleges Association,
 a similar consortium of twelve liberal arts colleges located in the states of Ohio,
 Michigan and Indiana. Collectively these twenty-five liberal arts colleges have a
 student enrollment of approximatley 40,000 and a teaching staff of about 3,000
 faculty. A list of the member institutions is attached to this testimony.
 What perhaps makes our colleges different from others which may testify before
 you today is that during a period when many institutions were deemphasizing
 foreign language or allowing foreign language requirements to lapse, most of our
 institutions have continued to maintain strong foreign language programs. For
 instance, out of the twenty-five institutions, twelve already have a foreign language
 graduation requirement consisting either of courses or of attainment of a designated
 level of competence as demonstrated by testing. You, Mr. Chairman, have stated
 that only eight percent of the institutions in the United States require foreign
 language for graduation. The figure in our two associations is 48 percent, perhaps
 not high enough but nevertheless considerably above the national average. Further-
 more, we estimate that about 60 percent of all students complete at least two years
 of a foreign language, an estimate which probably is conservative.
 I cite these figures initially to inform you that in the Associated Colleges of the
 Midwest and the Great Lakes Colleges Association, we already have an atmosphere
 quite favorable to the teaching of foreign languages. Furthermore, foreign language
 instruction is bolstered by very strong overseas programs. Jointly, the Associated
 Colleges of the Midwest and the Great Lakes Colleges Association operate programs
 in Hong Kong, Japan, India, Costa Rica, Colombia, England, Italy, Yugoslavia and
 Africa. Additionally, our member colleges offer their own study abroad programs at
 107 different sites. Consequently, the student at one of the Associated Colleges or
 Great Lakes Colleges campuses has the double opportunity of being able to study a
 foreign language and also to employ the use of that language in overseas study
 during the course of his or her undergraduate years.
 With that much by way of background, let me say that the twenty-five colleges on
 whose behalf I speak recognize the sorry state of language instruction nationally, as
 cited by you, Mr. Chairman, in "the Tongue-Tied American" and by the President's
 Commission of Foreign Language and International Studies. We enthusiastically
 endorse the spirit of your proposed legislation. We fully believe in the importance of
 foreign language instruction both as an integral part of a liberalizing education and
 as a valuable asset for our nation's security and economy. We believe that the
 federal government has in the past made significant contributions to foreign lan-
 guage instruction, most particularly through the National Defense Education Act
 and through the Department of Education's support for foreign area and language
 programs. We recognize, however, along with others, that support for these pro-
 grams has gradually eroded as funding has not kept pace with inflation. We believe
 that those programs should be well supported, particularly for such instruction in
 undergraduate education, but additionally we are concerned that there be support
 for language instruction in the elementary and secondary schools.
 I will not comment further on the portion of the bill which deals with elementary
 and secondary education except to say that we welcome its intent and that we know
 full well that our instruction at the undergraduate level is immeasurably more
 effective when students enter college with good foreign language preparation.
 My prinicpal comments will be limited to those sections which deal with foreign
 language instruction at the undergraduate level. In principle we think that the dual
 approach of providing subsidization for colleges which have achieved more than a
 five percent enrollment in foreign languages and for those that have adopted a
 foreign language requirement for graduation, is a good first step. We do have a few
 suggestions, however, which we think would eventually strengthen both the intent
 and the effect of the proposed legislation.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 One, we find that there is an inherent difficulty in counting students enrolled in
 foreign language programs. For most institutions, I believe it would be difficult to
 follow individual student enrollments. Furthermore, many students, particularly
 those enrolled in foreign language majors, tend to take more than one language
 course at a time. Would it not be better to base the legislation on course enrollment,
 a figure which is much more readily available to most institutions? Thus, any
 institution with student enrollments in foreign language courses which exceeded
 five percent of total course enrollments would be eligible for the support outlined
 under the bill.
 Two, there also is a general issue of quantity versus quality in foreign language
 enrollments. For the most part, students completing the second year of a foreign
 language are not yet fully proficient in that language. One of the unintended
 consequences of H.R. 3231 may be to encourage colleges and universities to increase
 enrollments in the first and second year in order to obtain additional federal
 support. Course enrollments at that level could be increased without in any way
 strengthening third and fourth year enrollments. In my opinion, the more students
 who complete the third and fourth year, the more likely it is that there will be a
 larger population within the United States capable of controlling foreign languages.
 Because it is the ability of people to effectively use languages that is the desired
 outcome of the legislation, I would suggest that in calculating the five percent
 enrollment in foreign languages, enrollments in the third and fourth year be count-
 ed as one and a half times that of the first and second year. Thus, although foreign
 language enrollments might not total five percent in a given institution, the addi-
 tional value given to the third and fourth year programs could bring it up to that
 five percent level. We submit that a wise policy would reward institutions more for
 providing the third and fouth year instruction.
 Three, on the whole the legislation will reward those institutions which are
 already offering foreign language instruction, but it will not do very much (except
 by encouraging a two-year foreign language requirement) to attract students into
 foreign languages. The proposed rewards are more institutionally than student
 directed. Consequently, I think that over the long run additional steps will be
 necessary if foreign language enrollments are to be encouraged. One such step
 would be a modest student scholarship program which would encourage students to
 take less-commonly taught languages. A second step would be a program of direct
 institutional support at the undergraduate level for initiating programs in less-
 commonly taught languages. And a third, one which I would particularly support,
 would be a program of regional language centers jointly staffed by a consortium or
 an association of institutions. In the case of our colleges it is likely, given their size,
 that each college individually can support at most one less-commonly taught lan-
 guage and for smaller colleges, even that would be difficult. If, however, the colleges
 could band together to offer summer and mid-year intensive instruction at the
 undergraduate level in particular languages, with the students then continuing
 throughout the academic year with some kind of a self-instructional maintenance
 program, I think that we could attract more students into the less-commonly taught
 languages. We could also then provide study abroad programs for students to
 reinforce their formal instruction with experience in a host language culture.
 I recognize that these final points go well beyond the initial steps which your bill
 would take in encouraging foreign language instruction. Our associations do not
 think it is necessary to add these additional programs immediately. We do want to
 go on record as saying that a full national effort to increase foreign enrollments
 should probably include them.
 May I therefore return to my original comments: We are in full support of the
 proposed legislation. We stand ready to assist you and members of the congress in
 achieving the goals it so ably sets forth.
 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present this testimony.

 STATEMENT OF CHARLES B. NEFF, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATED
 COLLEGES OF THE MIDWEST
 Mr. NEFF. Thank you. I will try to abbreviate my testimony. I
 hope I do not have to abbreviate it more than I intend to.
 I am glad to be here representing the Associated Colleges of the
 Midwest, which, as you have noted, is a consortium of 13 liberal
 arts colleges located primarily in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Min-
 nesota, and Wisconsin, with an additional college in Colorado.
 With the permission of its leadership, I am also speaking on
 behalf of the Great Lakes Colleges Administration, a similar con-
 sortium of 12 liberal arts colleges located in the States of Ohio,
 Michigan, and Indiana.
 Collectively, these 25 liberal arts colleges have a student enroll-
 ment of approximately 40,000 and a teaching staff of about 3,000
 faculty. They range in size from about 600 to 3,000.
 What makes our colleges perhaps a little different from some of
 the others that have testified is that at times when foreign lan-
 guages and international studies have declined and they have been
 decreasing, we have managed to hold the line pretty well. I do not
 think our record is by any means perfect.
 But if the figure previously quoted by the chairman, Mr. Simon,
 is correct, that only 8 percent of the colleges and universities in the
 United States require a foreign language for graduation, we have
 12 out of 25, or about 48 percent we calculate, doing some rather
 crude calculations, what we think conservatively, that about 60
 percent of all of our students will graduate with 2 years of foreign
 language or something like its equivalent.
 We also note-and I think this is a very encouraging thing-that
 the number of double majors, people who are majoring in econom-
 ics and language or political science and language, is very definite-
 ly on the increase. I cite some of these things partly because I
 think we have, the colleges like ours-we are not, of course,
 unique; there are many more like them around the United States-
 but maybe it is a source that is not being tapped enough by defense
 and intelligence establishments, because at least a lot of people are
 coming out with training in a lot of exotic languages, like Marati,
 we have 20 students every year who spend half a year in Puna,
 India, but prior to that time will have studied 3 months of Marati,
 probably one of the few places in the country where undergrad-
 uates can study such a language.
 We also have quite extensive foreign-study programs, 15 pro-
 grams are operated just in the associated colleges for the associ-
 ation. We also have, in conjunction with the Great Lakes Colleges
 Association, programs in Hong Kong, Japan, India, Costa Rica,
 Colombia, England, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Africa. The member in-
 stitutions operate foreign-study programs in about 107 different
 sites.
 We do think that we are contributing to the national pool of
 resources. But we realize we have a long way to go, and we very
 much support the intention in the provisions of the bill, because we
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 think it will not only help institutions of our kind, but will very
 definitely contribute to the national need.
 I will not comment on the part of the bill that deals with elemen-
 tary and secondary education, except to say the obvious: that to the
 extent that students reach us with adequate training, it makes our
 job of teaching them at the undergraduate level that much better.
 I will make a couple of comments on the nature of the bill itself.
 First of all, we think there is some difficulty, at least as the bill is
 currently phrased, in that counting students enrolled in the for-
 eign-language programs, it may have been an intent, of course, to
 talk of course enrollments. That is a way to keep those statistics.
 Furthermore, if you counted students, you run into the problem
 that many students, especially those majoring in foreign languages,
 are both registered in more than one foreign-language course in
 the same semester, so they should be given credit for all of the
 foreign languages that they are taking.
 Second, we find that there is the general issue of quantity versus
 quality. For the most part, students completing the second year of
 foreign language are not fully proficient in that language. One of
 the unintended consequences of H.R. 3231 may be to encourage
 colleges and universities to increase enrollments in the first and
 second year in order to obtain the additional support. Course en-
 rollments at that level could be increased without in any way
 strengthening third- and fourth-year enrollments.
 We think perhaps that one way of dealing with this would be in
 calculating the 5 percent of student enrollments of foreign lan-
 guages to count enrollments in the third and fourth year as 11/2
 times that of the first and second years, so that although an
 institution might not have reached 5 percent, by giving extra credit
 to the third and fourth year, you are also providing an institutional
 incentive to teach at that level.
 On the whole-and someone else said this earlier-we think the
 legislation will tend to reward those institutions which are already
 offering foreign-language instruction, but it will not do very much
 to attract the students.
 That is, it is one thing to say to an institution, "Here is $10 more
 because you are teaching a student at a present level or because
 you are teaching an exotic language," but that is not going to get
 students in the courses. Students are likely to come either because
 of interest in the language or there is some other kind of incentive.
 So although we think this is a good start, we just want to
 06 mention some other things that we think, in time, should be added
 to the legislation in order to round out the whole picture.
 One such step would be a modest student scholarship program
 which would encourage students to take less-commonly taught lan-
 guages. A second step would be a program of direct institutional
 support at the undergraduate level for initiating programs in less-
 commonly taught languages.
 And the third, which we would particularly support, would be a
 program of regional language centers jointly staffed by a consor-
 tium or an association of institutions. For instance, in the case of
 our colleges, it is likely, given their size, that each college individ-
 ually can support at most one less-commonly taught language, and
 for smaller colleges that would be difficult.

 If, however, the colleges could band together to offer summer
 and mid-year intensive instruction at the undergraduate level in
 particular languages, with the students then continuing through
 the academic year with some kind of self-instructional mainte-
 nance program, I think we could attract more students into the
 less-commonly-taught languages. We could also then combine that
 with an increase in our study-abroad programs for students to
 reinforce their formal instructional experience in a host language
 culture.
 I realize these final points go well beyond the initial steps which
 your bill would take in encouraging foreign language instruction.
 Our associations do not think that is necessary to add these addi-
 tional programs immediately, but we do want to go on record to
 say that a full effort to increase foreign language enrollments
 should be improved.
 May I go back to my original comments. We are in full support
 of the proposed legislation. We stand ready to assist you and Mem-
 bers of the Congress in achieving the goals that it so ably sets
 forth.
 Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak.
 Mr. ERDAHL. Thank you, Dr. Neff.
 Thanks to all of you for some very specific suggestions.
 I have made notes of these; for example, the one about whether
 higher education includes junior and community college. My as-
 sumption is it certainly does, and I would assume that is Mr.
 Simon's intent as well.
 Your suggestion about student scholarships, I think, Mr. Freitag,
 you raised the question about should this apply to nonpublic
 schools and some of the controversy that boils around that issue.
 We appreciate that.
 We also appreciate the very important support of groups like the
 NEA and the AFL-CIO and the Midwest Colleges Association. I
 think those things are significant.
 As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, sometime ago I
 met one of our-I think this was not very typical; I trust it was
 not-the foreign people who had been in one of the-I will not
 mention the country; maybe somebody could track down who it
 was-but had been in our country for 3 years.
 I talked to him about the language. And I remember his com-
 ment was that he had not learned the language, because, "The
 people with whom I deal speak English," which really kind of came
 across to me as very arrogant. I wonder how that comes across to
 the nationals of those very countries, if we have the attitude of the
 people that we deal with, they are expected to speak English. I
 would trust that many people that he should have dealt with did
 not speak English.
 I want to thank you so much again for being with us, and
 especially all of you for your patience, and those in the audience
 and some people working with the media who have survived the
 several interruptions.
 In looking at my schedule, I see that I am 30 minutes late for

 somebody who knows how to say "I am sorry" in Ukrainian can

 PREPARED TESTIMONY OF AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS, AFL-CIO
 H.R. 3231 is an appropriate and significant step in the direction of re-establishing
 U.S. support for programs of foreign language study at all educational levels. It is
 an effort to strengthen and to improve the U.S. position in the world vis-a-vis
 business, foreign trade and academic excellence, and to further the national security
 interests of our democratic government and its institutions. The American Feder-
 ation of Teachers wishes to express its support for this proposed legislation and to
 reassert its commitment to foreign language study as a vital part of a total school
 curriculum.
 Since the late 1960s, the nature of the political, social and economic interdepend-
 ence of nations has changed drastically. As a result, the role and impact of interna-
 tional events on most, if not all nations of the world, have received increasing
 attention, particularly within the Western democracies. In the United States, for
 example, the Congress itself has become even more involved in decisions relating to
 International issues, since the early 1970s.
 Greater international interdependence has significantly changed world power
 relationships, and the need for the U.S. to take an active and directing role in these
 changes has become apparent, if we are to maintain our own economic and political
 well-being, as well as the security of our democratic system.
 Unfortunately, at a time when the urgency of greater U.S. participation is foster-
 ing international understanding, cooperation and maintenance of world peace is
 evident, our efforts to augment our functional knowledge and our comprehension of
 other cultures and languages have remained at a "static low." Public opinion on
 foreign policy at times demonstrates a lack of multi-cultural awareness on the part
 of the American people. Foreign language study provides an opportunity for a better
 understanding of world cultures. The public perception of the declining status of the
 U.S. as a world leader should and could be changed by a demonstration of federal
 backing for relevant and substantive model foreign language programs at all aca-
 demic levels.
 During the course of other testimony, you will be made aware of important and
 current statistics which highlight our present deplorable situation with respect to
 foreign language study in our schools. This data and testimony will serve to recon-
 firm the observations and conclusions of the Report of the President's Commission
 on Foreign Language and International Studies, released in November 1979. As a
 matter of fact, organized labor and the education communities at-large, and the
 language teaching community in particular have recognized and have spoken up
 about these deficiencies for several years now. H.R. 3231 gives the Congress the
 opportunity to officially recognize the problem, to present and promote a plan of
 action and to provide the necessary funds to ameliorate the situation.
 Of course, it is true that there is tremendous concern both in Congress and in the
 White House about increased federal spending. But there are ways that with limited
 government spending and a concentration on the most effective method of allocating
 that spending, significant results can be achieved at a low per-pupil cost. H.R. 3231,
 by providing financial grants at all levels of instruction, will reach a large number
 of students, will promote improved and expanded foreign language training and will
 do so at a relatively low cost.
 While registering our support for passage of H.R. 3231, we would also point out
 our concern in one particular area.
 In the language of the bill itself, the purpose of Section 2 is to provide funds for
 the "improvement and expansion of foreign language study for students residing
 within their school districts." However, if improvement and expansion are to occur,
 it is imperative that monies ultimately granted to the local education agencies be
 used not to supplant funds already being allocated to foreign language instruction,
 but to supplement existing funds so that programs will get better and so that
 enrollment will increase. We would be glad to provide the Committee with the
 language that we feel would address that concern. It could best be included either in
 Section 1 or in Section 5.
 Finally, we would like the Committee to consider the following brief points as
 relevant to the effective implementation of H.R. 3231.
 While support of higher education programs is needed, it is the K-12 students
 who represent a true cross-section of the population and it is to this larger, signifi-
 cant cross-section that funds should be directed. We feel that a larger portion of the
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 allocation of H.R. 3231 should be dedicated to secondary programs in Section 2 of
 this legislation.
 In order to motivate and to create respect for the study of language, it would
 seem that a larger proportion of the entire teaching population should be consid-
 ered. It would be useful and appropriate to offer language training services for
 teachers for personal or professional use, in conjunction with ongoing teacher train-
 ing programs, international exchange and professional exchange programs. This
 would encourage teacher interest that would ultimately transfer to student interest.
 For the benefit of greater effective program continuity, articulation between
 secondary and higher education institutions should be encouraged. This would
 ensure that federal funds spent would have a longer term effect on the development
 of foreign language proficiency.
 For the purpose of clarity, there should be some suggestions as to what factors
 might be considered as elements of "model" programs, so that state and local
 education agencies would have some idea of federal intent.
 We are also submitting to the subcommittee a copy of the AFT's resolution on
 "Foreign Languages and International Studies."
 Thank you for the opportunity to present our ideas and suggestions in regard to
 this proposed legislation. We would be pleased to answer any further questions that
 you may have.
 FOREIGN LANGUAGES AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
 Whereas, recent events on the domestic and international scene have dramatized
 the increasing number of problems Americans face in coping with international
 developments and the impact of these events on domestic issues, and
 Whereas, the report of the President's Commission on Foreign Languages and
 international studies, significantly entitled Strength Through Wisdom: a critique of
 U.S. capability, refers to America's incompetence in foreign languages as "nothing
 short of scandalous". and further states that "nothing less is at issue than the
 nation's security," and
 Whereas, there has been a dramatic decline in the study of foreign languages in
 this country and a disproportionate reduction in the number of foreign language
 teachers as compared to other disciplines during the past ten years, and
 Whereas, the overwhelming majority of the world's population neither under-
 stands nor speaks English, and
 Whereas, the United States must develop a first class apparatus to cope with this
 fact in business, industry, trade, politics, scientific research and general communica-
 tion, and
 Whereas, the loss of jobs requiring foreign language skills to non-citizens has been
 significant because leaders in politics, industry and commerce have found it increas-
 ingly difficult to recruit qualified American citizens, and
 Whereas, present and future generations of Americans should be given the oppor-
 tunity to develop to the fullest extent possible their intellectual and communica-
 tions capacities in all areas of knowledge pertaining to other countries, languages,
 peoples and cultures, and to reinforce basic communications skills of listening,
 speaking, reading, and writing, and
 Whereas, a concentration on language and international studies can help to
 improve the quality of our school's curricula by addressing the public's demand for
 rigor and competency and by exposing young people and future citizens to our basic
 values of democracy and human rights;
 Resolved, that the AFT support legislation that would:
 1. Offer federal assistance to school systems to help build and maintain language
 instruction and international studies programs.
 2. Support the expansion of teacher exchange programs that would allow both
 language teachers and other teachers to study and teach abroad.
 3. Provide specific support for the education of American workers in world affairs.

 MENT
 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1981
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 SUBCOMMITTEE ON POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION,
 COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR,
 New Haven, Conn.
 The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, in Lyman Auditorium
 of Southern Connecticut State College, at 10 a.m., Hon. Paul Simon
 (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
 Members present: Representatives Simon, Coleman, and DeNar-
 dis.
 Staff present: Marilyn McAdam, staff assistant; and Jennifer
 Vance, minority senior legislative associate.
 Mr. SIMON. The Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education will
 come to order.
 The Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education is delighted to be
 in New Haven, Conn., today for this hearing.
 [Opening statement of Congressman Paul Simon follows:]
 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL SIMON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE
 STATE OF ILLINOIS
 Today we will be discussing a little known but very real threat to our national
 security and our economic health. It is a nationwide-wide shortage that hasn't
 received as much publicity as our energy situation but, similarly, it hurts our
 economy and affects our ability to function in today's world.
 The shortage I am talking about is our national deficiency in foreign language
 skills. Fewer than 4 percent of our public high school graduates have more than two
 years of foreign language study, and I might add this has declined. We are the only
 country where someone can graduate from college, even get a Ph. D., without
 having a single year of instruction in a foreign language.
 As a result of this language shortage, we are losing potential markets and poten-
 tial diplomatic friends at a time when we need them most. We compete with the
 Soviet Union for influence with developing nations; and we compete with Japan,
 Germany and the major exporting nations for markets all over the globe. But
 because of our language deficiencies we are going to bat against these countries
 with one hand tied behind our back.
 During the subcommittee's recent trip to the Soviet Union and West Germany,
 ?         our delegation relied almost exclusively on the translation and interpretations of
 the Soviets to conduct high level policy discussions. We rarely enjoyed the services
 of a U.S. interpreter.
 The Department of Defense has more than 488,000 active duty military personnel
 stationed overseas, but only 314 persons, less than one-tenth on one percent, were
 classified by the military as linguists last year.
 Admiral Bobby Inman, Deputy Director of the C.I.A., told our subcommittee in
 July that deteriorating U.S. language capabilities "are presenting a major hazard to
 our national security".

 Our schools are not turning out graduates proficient in the languages of develop-
 ing nations, and the Federal Government is not doing enough to encourage schools
 to offer comprehensive language programs.
 The bill that is the focus of these hearings, H.R. 3231, would help elementary and
 secondary school districts to establish model foreign language programs and would
 provide foreign language grants to colleges and universities.
 Today, and on October 5, in Raleigh, North Carolina, we will be hearing from
 representatives of the academic community and international business experts on
 this vital topic. It is my hope that their testimony will awaken Americans to our
 real security needs.
 Mr. SIMON. We now will go to the second portion of our testimo-
 ny here today and that is on the foreign language area. Today we
 will be discussing a little known but very real threat to our nation-

 William Derrick, who is associated with St. John's School in Platts-
 burgh, N.Y., but who is a national figure in the foreign language
 field who has been pioneering in the field of immersion, which is
 much more on the scene in Canada and some other countries than
 it is in the United States, but through Mr. Derrick's leadership
 may become much more a part of the scene here.
 We will enter your full statement in the record and if you can
 summarize your statement here today that would be appreciated.
 STATEMENT OF WILLIAM DERRICK, EARLY LANGUAGE
 IMMERSION TEACHER, ST. JOHN'S SCHOOL, PLATTSBURGH, N.Y.
 Mr. DERRICK. First I would like to express the customary appre-
 ciation for the opportunity to be here and my statement does carry
 the message that I wish to put across to your committee.
 As much as possible, rather than talk about language immersion,
 I had in mind today, if I can get enough of you over there to play a
 game with me, to demonstrate it to you, I would like to do that. Do
 any of you speak German on that side of the table?
 Mr. SIMON. I speak a little.
 Mr. DERRICK. Then that might make you an unfair contestant in
 my little game.
 I have to come across the table, and since there are not many
 people here to listen to me, I have not spoken German for about 18
 years but I would like to do this because it does demonstrate the
 efficacy of the whole concept, if that is agreeable with you.
 Mr. SIMON. This is agreeable and I do not know how we are
 going to work this out with the record. We will have to adjust the
 record.
 Mr. DERRICK. If you can imagine that I am a lovely young
 woman teaching kindergarten and you are kindergarten students,
 and since I use the familiar form of German better than I do this
 formal form, I will treat you as kindergarten students and speak to
 you in the informal fashion, if that is agreeable.
 Mr. SIMON. Our colleagues are returning shortly but we will tell
 them about this.
 [Mr. Derrick then gave a demonstration of the applicability of
 certain German words to objects which he held in his hand.]
 Mr. DERRICK. That is a demonstration. That is having the teach-
 ers come into the classroom each day, introducing one little vari-
 ation or a larger or different variation on the theme, and every day
 the kids pick it up and sooner or later they are understanding all
 of the things that they say.
 The teacher is not teaching the language, the teacher is teaching
 about yellow round forms, triangles, and squares and she is teach-
 ing the subject matter, which happens to be speaking a different
 language. That is the only difference. You are learning in the
 language about things, about letters, and about history and about
 numbers, and you are not learning the language.
 That is the essential, key part of early language immersion.
 I would like to read one paragraph and this is on page 5 of my
 statement.
 Since ELI is both subtle and sophisticated, it is difficult for even
 the most imaginative to grasp. Seeing is believing, as Chairman
 Simon can attest after visiting ELI classes in Silver Spring, Md.,
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Four Corners Elementary School. Therefore, I will depart from the
 usual format to make an ELI demonstration as the main part of
 my 5-minute presentation.
 I think the most revealing testimony comes from the kids, from
 those who received the instruction in this way.
 In Silver Spring a young person was asked what she liked best
 about French immersion and she seemed unmindful of French, and
 her answer was, "math and science," and no reference to learning
 a language.
 I would be happy to receive questions if you have them and I am
 sorry that I introduced myself as a good-looking kindergarten
 teacher and that you have to remember, too, teacher is smiling and
 having a good time and the language she used becomes unimpor-
 tant.
 [The prepared statement of William M. Derrick follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM M. DERRICK, TEACHER AND CONSULTANT ON
 EARLY LANGUAGE IMMERSION
 First, Mr. Chairman and other members of the subcommittee, I wish to express
 thanks on behalf of all practitioners of elementary language instruction for this
 opportunity to present information on the nationally neglected sphere of elemen-
 tary language learning. As an informal spokesperson for my colleagues, I wish also
 to express appreciation to you, Mr. Simon, as chairman, and to your other insightful
 Congressional colleagues, for the leadership exerted via the Presidential Commis-
 sion, the fine statement of our national linguistic inadequacy in "The Tongue Tied
 American," and the sponsorship of H.R. 3231.
 The deterioratiated state of American language learning and its negative impact
 on our business, diplomatic, military and academic affairs has already been well
 documented before this subcommittee and elsewhere. I wish to present the strongest
 possible thrust for American foreign language competence and leave you with a
 sense of renewed optimism. My comments will be directed to elementary school
 language learning programs with specific emphasis on Early Language Immersion
 (ELI).
 I am an elementary teacher who went to Germany in 1954 to teach American
 military children in English. As a monolingual Nebraskan, living abroad was a
 mind boggling experience which broadened cultural perspectives and provided an
 opportunity to learn, with great difficulty, a first foreign language. Upon returning
 to the USA for graduate work in 1963, I entered university administration where
 possibilities to support existing international study programs and to initiate new
 ones existed. At the State University of New York at Albany (SUNYA) I organized
 and conducted an innovative nine (9) week program of intensive summer language
 learning for entering freshmen. In 1969, the program total cost was $750 for France,
 Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, while the Canadian (Quebec) and Puerto Rican
 components were $500 per student-quite a contrast to costs today! In 1976 at
 SUNY/Plattsburgh, I started the French Language Immersion Program for pupils
 in the campus laboratory school. This experience brought me into contact with the
 several other U.S. immersion programs as well as the extensive practice and re-
 search of ELI in Canada, only 25 miles from Plattsburgh. In the last four years, I
 have acted as a coordinator of U.S. ELI practitioners. It is as a spokesperson for our
 small group of ELI "converts" that I make this statement today.
 In keeping with format suggested by you, Mr. Chairman, my first remarks focus
 on language learning shortfall in a theoretically ideal setting. For nine years in the
 dependent schools, I observed in my elementary classroom well trained teachers
 enthusiastically teaching their mother tongue 30 minutes per day for five days each
 week. The instruction was a typical Foreign Language in elementary School (FLES)
 format commonly practiced in the U.S. at that time. In spite of the efforts of gifted
 native speakers, FLES programs were not making bilinguals of our children. The
 only students who learned more German in school were those who lived outside the
 American housing area (ghetto) and played with non-English speaking children.
 It should be noted that as dependent schools faced budget constraints, policy
 decisions were made to reduce operational costs by eliminating or reducing elemen-
 tary language instruction. This decision making was based on pragmatic and cultur-
 al values, i.e., the FLES programs did not produce adequate results and foreign
 language study was one of the unnecessary frills.

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 The shortfall of American high school and college language teaching is already
 well documented and needs no further illustration here. My specific concern is to
 follow-up the frequent recommendations of Presidential Commission members, such
 as Hechinger, Rassias and Reischauer, who urged that language learning begin as
 early as possible in elementary schools.
 Second, the national interest in strategic and economic benefits of able bilinguals
 in abundance in our society is inestimable. We have the ability to prepare in public
 as well as private schools large numbers of graduates of various abilities ready to
 function fully in two languages. The strategic and economic impact of having many
 such students entering our academic, diplomatic, military, and business communi-
 ties is awesome to contemplate. In testimony before this Subcommittee last July 15
 and 16, it was stated that a 44 week government language course costs $10,000.
 Rough calculations for salary and additional living or moving expenses make the
 real cost more like $30,000 to our government. My confident contention today is
 that we can prepare functionally bilingual high school graduates at no added cost
 and with great enhancement of our public school system. This can and is being done
 on a miniscule scale in language immersion classrooms in several elementary
 schools of various social characteristics across our country. In these schools they are
 practicing what was recommended during the Presidential Commission delibera-
 tions. The general agreement that it is easier to acquire language at an early age is
 patently ignored in our national priorities and practice. I see this state of affairs as
 a tragic miscalibration between the successful scientific experience (research) and
 the impression that Americans are poor learners of other languages. Further, it is a
 sad commentary on our ability as a society to put into practice what we can
 demonstrate as beneficial and "do-able" at little or no additional cost.
 The legislation under consideration here today would provide support through
 state departments of education to pilot school programs. Such fiscal support would
 negate the most common reason for not sponsoring new programs. It would make
 possible the initiation of ELI and other elementary programs across our country.
 Such elementary program development and demonstration is needed to regain
 linguistic confidence and to begin the real business of educating young Americans to
 accent-free foreign language competence.
 Since ELI is both subtle and sophisticated, it is difficult for even the most
 imaginative to grasp. Seeing is believing as Chairman Simon can attest after visit-
 ing ELI classes in Silver Spring, Maryland, Four Corners Elementary School. There-
 fore, I will depart from the usual format to make an ELI demonstration as the main
 part of my five minute presentation.
 [Demonstration.]
 The novel concept of ELI presents startling contrasts and reliable outcomes which
 force us to rethink our customary approaches to language learning or teaching.
 First, in ELI programs, the second (new) language becomes the MEDIUM of instruc-
 tion and is not the OBJECT of instruction. French, Polish, or whatever language of
 interest or value in the local community becomes the language of instruction for the
 first three years (K-2). In order for a new kindergarten pupil to have fun with the
 other kids or with the friendly lady or man (teacher) who presents all the interest-
 ing games, stories, and fingerpaint, it becomes necessary to listen more carefully
 and to catch on to what is said in place of "red ball," "make a circle," "it's time for
 our snacks," or "who wants to change the calendar?" This method confirms the
 feelings of many adults who know they never achieved effective use of another
 language until or unless their job or travel made it a useful and essential means of
 communication.
 This practice may seem more than novel or innovative. It may seem radical and
 revolutionary. A privileged few in America have always had their chances of board-
 ing schools abroad, junior years abroad, etc. The originators of the immersion
 methods in Canada are actually U.S. citizens, Lambert and Tucker, who happened
 to be professors and researchers in a Canadian setting where language competence
 is a salient feature of daily life. They see immersion as a new development in
 American education.
 The immersion is widely practiced across Canada. The English population has
 institutionalized second language learning in locally relevant languages, e.g.,
 German and Ukranian in Alberta Province or French and Hebrew in sections of
 Montreal.
 The extensive research conducted over a 15 year period in Canada reveals that
 children educated for the first three years exclusively in some other language, who
 are then given formal English (i.e., their only home language) instruction on an
 increasing scale (80 percent French/20 percent English at grade three; 60 percent/
 40 percent grades four and five; and 50 percent/50 percent in sixth grade) develop
 firm competencies in both English and French). They may be tested in either

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 language on math, science, or social studies with results that are always as good if
 not better then matched groups of students whose training was conducted exclusive-
 ly in English. Psychometric testing further exclusively finds that the ELI bilingual
 students achieve higher levels of linguistic flexibility and ideational fluency. This
 means that they use words in each of their languages with greater ease and skill
 than the monolingually educated children do. The U.S. results, although not as
 mature since we started later, are equally reassuring from across our country about
 achievement in the early school years. For instance, in Milwaukee where 40 percent
 of the enrollment must be inner-city "disadvantaged" children, their standardized
 testing is most convincing. It shows that children in the Multi Language School
 (now offering ELI in French, German, and Spanish) score reassuringly higher. (See
 Mr. Grittner's letter to Wallace Lambert, Appendix I.)
 ELI has great potential. It is no longer experimental, costs no more than regular
 classrooms, enhances English achievement, puts in place for life a second language
 capability and adds a whole new dimension of personal growth and power for our
 young people. It offers students a new linguistic skill which can have direct applica-
 tion in further study or work and provides the basis for easier acquisition of a third
 language when required by vocational needs. The concept is effective but not well
 known. It needs the pilot program exposure that HR 3231 would provide.
 In conclusion, a comment from "Education, USA", December 1, 1980, about Four
 Corners' program makes the best illustration of ELI's efficacy and practicality.
 When a student was asked what she liked best about the French program, she
 seemed unmindful of French. "Math and science," she replied.

 PLATrSBURGH, N.Y., September 23, 1981.
 To Whom It May Concern:
 Our two children are presently enrolled in an innovative language program called
 FLIP-the French Language Immersion Program-which was developed here at
 State University College at Plattsburgh's Campus School. My nine year old daugh-
 ter, Mandy, began the program at age 5 and my son, Brian, began at the nursery
 level (age 4) last year. From the first day of involvement, all communication and
 instruction are done as in any American classroom except French, rather than
 English, is used with the children throughout the school day.
 The program itself is so fantastic-people are repeatedly amazed and intimidated
 by the talents demonstrated by these children enrolled in the program. Without
 question these children are bilingual. People who have studied French as a lan-
 guage for several years are perplexed to see a six or seven year old child have a
 command of the language that they as yet have been unable to achieve.
 Most of the experiences I have had as a parent have been with Mandy. Platts-
 burgh's geographic location has provided an interesting setting for many experi-
 ences-it started with her eavesdropping in shopping centers on conversations be-
 tween Montreal/Quebecois shoppers. One day I came home from work to find
 Mandy at a new neighbor's house-when I went to retrieve her for supper I found
 this lady was originally from Paris-she was delighted to find someone, even a
 child, to speak with. I had a hard time explaining that Mandy had never been in
 France. Many delightful conversations have since taken place to the satisfaction to
 both.
 My brother-in-law and sister-in-law have a marina on Lake Champlain and many
 of their customers are from the Montreal area. On several occasions my children
 have spent afternoons on the beach happily playing and swimming with Quebecois

 children unable to speak a word of English. Different times her Uncle George has
 scooped Mandy up into conversations with Canadian customers to help translate
 what his limited vocabulary could not.
 The interesting aspect of these experiences is that the Canadian French is a
 dialect or a version of the language learned by these children. Our children in
 speaking with Canadian children must in turn adapt their knowledge of Parisian
 French to the Canadian vocabulary and pronunciation.
 Mandy, as a 3rd grade student last year, for the first time received instruction via
 English, for approximately one hour each day. At the end of the school year she
 took the Metropolitan Achievement Test and scored well above her grade level:
 Reading, grade equivalent-7.4, 90th percentile, 8th stanine; Math, grade equiva-
 lent-5.5, 84th percentile, 7th stanine; Language, grade equivalent-5.1, 71st percen-
 tile, 6th stanine. Her basic battery was-grade equivalent 6.0, 86th percentile, 7th
 stanine.
 In February last year she and her classmates participated in an exchange pro-
 gram with the Notre Dame de Pitie in Quebec City. The children went for a week
 and stayed with individual host families and participated in their daily school
 program and went on several field trips with their hosting children. They in turn
 came to Plattsburgh for a week and stayed with us. Our children found that the
 families they stayed with spoke absolutely no English so therefore everything said
 was said in French/Quebecois. It was hilarious to find my daughter upon returning
 speaking to me in French about events that took place and not remembering which
 language she was speaking in-she knows I speak narry a word of French. I was one
 of the parents that drove to Montreal to meet the kids at the train station and
 believe me all the kids were doing just this same thing.
 When our turn came to host a child, I soon learned what it was like to care for a
 child and not be able to communicate with her. Mandy was constantly on call for
 that entire week because our guest really did not speak a word of English. Our son
 Brian, who then was only in the program about six months decided that he could
 use his French too-and proceeded to count to oblivion with her whenever a free
 moment occurred during the day. It was a beautiful experience and much growing
 took place during that exchange and we are looking to doing it again this spring.
 Unfortunately for us, our program here at Plattsburgh is ending with this school
 year. Budget cuts in New York State are affecting all of us and the entire campus
 school program will close in June 1982.
 The opportunities and talents developed within these children have been given to
 these children and will stay with them-this gift of language cannot be taken away.
 I am envious of and in awe of the implications and choices available to them as
 adults. The education system in this country and all its short-cominfs has been
 under fire for the past three decades. Parents feel that their children s needs are
 not being met and when graduating from high school are not ready for the commer-
 cial/professional/collegiate world. The ease with which this program was developed
 and implemented and its all too obvious results (without even allowing for any long-
 term implications) are astounding. This is the way to educate. There is no question
 of its validity.

 GARY W. CROSS.

 To Whom It May Concern:
 I am a firm advocate of early foreign language immersion exemplified by the
 Campus School model (FLIP, Margaret M. Sibley School of Educational Research
 and Development, SUNY at Plattsburgh) as the most efficient and natural way to
 achieve second language proficiency. As a graduate of Georgetown University's
 School of Languages and Linguistics with a degree in Applied Linguistics and
 graduate work in Theoretical Linguistics, I have more than a passing interest in
 language acquisition. I suppose I can be accused of using my children as "native
 informants" in my field work, but the results have been positive and are worth
 reviewing.
 My nine year-old began his schooling in the French Language Immersion Pro-
 gram at five years old, and my seven and five year-olds began at four. The older two
 are functionally bilingual, that is, they could survive handily in a French-speaking
 environment making themselves understood and understanding others. They read
 French and English; they initiate conversations in French and respond in that
 language spontaneously. The youngest has only had one year of half-days and

 cannot converse in French, although she has a large working vocabulary including
 numbers, letters, and the names for the trappings of her daily life.
 I would estimate that the rate of second language acquisition mirrors that of my
 children's primary language acquisition, but that their level is three years behind
 that of their French peers.
 The argument is sometimes proferred that foreign language immersion is not
 suitable for all children and no doubt there are statistics to support this. I would
 guess that few children fail to learn their native language and those few generally
 have diagnosable disabilities. I suggest that most children can easily acquire a
 second language in this natural way. My two bilingual children are as different in
 temperament, docility and personality as hand-picked laboratory test animals. Yet
 both are phonetically and grammatically at home with a language that will always
 be foreign to me-and I have studied it for years, in high school and college, in the
 United States, France and Switzerland.
 Not one of my children, or the others who have commuted forty miles each way
 with us, has shown any resistance to the introduction of arithmetic, reading, science
 or dodge ball in another language. An individual's range of acceptance is a lot
 broader at four than at fourteen. Comprehension dawns incredibly early in the first
 year and is clearly observable in the classroom.
 I cannot attest to the durability of this early learning as my native informants
 are still so closely allied with it. But I have had the satisfaction of watching my
 oldest child continue to read and speak French although he has not been in the
 program for a year. My own conclusion is that just as you don't lose your first
 language as long as it continues to represent an effective means of communication,
 so you will not lose any other in which you are comfortable.

 To Whom It May Concern:
 Our seven-year-old son, Aaron, is now in second grade at the Campus School in
 Plattsburgh. During the summer while on a phone conversation with his grandpar-
 ents, he began answering their questions in French. Not long ago, when I went to
 check on him in the night, he began talking in his sleep-in French. Having
 completed two years of the FLIP (French Language Immersion Program) at Campus
 School, Aaron and his classmates can carry on intelligent conversations in their
 second language. Their accents are very good and they speak and understand
 French easily.
 When compared with traditional methods of language instruction which allot an
 isolated 45 minutes to an hour of each day to "teaching a foreign language", the
 FLIP method has all the advantages. Children hear only French while in class-all
 day, five days each week. They learn their second language as they learned their
 first, by imitation and repetition, by seeing the objects referred to, by watching
 explanatory gestures, and by songs and games. Instead of learning a list of vocabu-
 lary words, they learn phrases and soon sentences-by hearing the language. They
 learn correct pronunciation and grammatical structures by imitating and repeating
 what they hear. The children learn to read first in their second language and
 reading skills for many children transfer easily back to English. Aaron has not had
 any classroom instruction in reading English but reads easily on the same level
 with or better than his contemporaries in English-speaking schools.
 As parents, we are delighted with the FLIP experience and are hopeful that
 Aaron s younger sister will also have the opportunity to participate in FLIP when
 she begins school next year.
 Sincerely,                                             CAROL AND ROBERT HARSH.

 As you are aware, my personal enthusiasm for ELI began with that initial visit to
 the Campus School at Plattsburgh in 1977 and grew as I observed the Four Corners
 Elementary School (Md), Milwaukee City Schools, San Diego and Halliston (Mass).
 Then I was an Associate in the Bureau of Foreign Languages Education in the New
 York State Education Department. Today, I am Supervisor of the Resource Alloca-
 tion Plan, a priority program established by the Board of Regents to coordinate the
 delivery of Department services and resources leading to the improvement of pupil
 performance in the basic skills. ELI is an excellent example of how a school can
 reallocate its shrinking resources and double its dollar at the same time; the
 efficient use of learning time in offering content and skills in another language.
 Research has shown that children who have learned a second language do demon-
 strate added competence in English or native language communication skills.
 As a language educator and Chairman of the 1981 Northeast Conference on the
 Teaching of Foreign Languages, I heartily endorse the passage of H.R. 3231 and
 especially any provision thereof which supports the early language immersion ap-
 proach.
 My best wishes to you in your testimony at the Hartford hearings on the Simon

 [Extract selected from Mr. McGillivray's report: "In 1981-82 this board (school
 district) has over 6,000 pupils in French Immersion from kindergarten to grade 11.
 Since 1978, approximately 40% of kindergarten children have been enrolled in the
 immersion program. * * * Parents are interested when they understand the bene-
 fits for their children, both vocational and educational. In fact, in Canada, parents,
 not educators, started immersion and have forced its expansion. ' * * As one who
 has watched the development of ELI and seen its phenomenal success, I must admit
 to being completely convinced that it is the best way, in a school setting, to teach
 and learn a second language. The immersion principle, that learning in a second
 language is more effective than simply learning a second language, is supported by
 so much evidence, that it is unassailable. * * * Perhaps because we Canadians have
 always turned to Americans for our models in so many educational innovations, I
 offer, in return, the experience and expertise of Canadian educators to advise and
 assist in the establishment of immersion if it becomes a widely used appraoch to
 foreign language teaching."]

 DEAR BILL: I enclose, for your information, a copy of a statement which Tracy
 Gray and I prepared for the transition team leading to the formation of the then-
 new Department of Education concerning language education issues. In it, we stress
 the importance of encouraging a variety of approaches to innovative language
 education for all children so that each youngster attending school in the United
 States will have the opportunity to become bilingual. In some cases, this would take
 the form of adding a second language to English the mother tongue; while in other
 cases, this would take the form of sustaining or nurturing the mother tongue and
 adding a solid foundation in English as well.

 DEAR BILL: As you know, Jan and I have been very interested in having our
 children enjoy the opportunity of an early language immersion program. You are,
 indeed, to be commended for the program which you established at the Campus
 School at the State University College of Plattsburgh.
 This program has provided an excellent alternative for students in our area.
 Everyone I talk with including parents, professionals, students, who have come in
 contract with the program have praised your work and the results of the program.
 Looking at the program from an economic standpoint, must also be considered. In
 areas like Upstate New York, anyone who can speak, for instance, French has a leg
 up as far as employment opportunities are concerned. When we have citizens who
 can speak this language,  it  improves our image and makes people from other
 countries want to shop and contribute to our economy.
 Also, of course, as we have discussed, it does not cost more to have an early-grade
 program in another language. In that way, the young student learns a language
 and, when he is older, is fluent in that particular discipline. Then, we are not
 having the increased cost of another language being taught at the secondary level
 or, as a matter of fact, at the post high school level, which is very expensive.
 I am, of course, just writing as a citizen who would like to see these programs
 continued and increased. We in America should be very proud of our country, and I
 know you and I are. However, I always feel very ignorant when I am in another
 country or another continent and only speak English-I can't be more frank than
 that. As a matter of fact, on September 20, 1981, 1 will be appearing as one of the
 five delegates from Lake Placid before the International Olympic Congress. My only
 language is English, and it is just so unfortunate that many of us did not learn
 French, Spanish or some other language when we were in our early years.
 Frankly, I think this is also very good for world understanding and appreciation.
 As you know, this is one of my main priorities, and I've so stated it publicly and to
 all of those who will listen.
 You may rest assured of my continued, utmost support and cooperation in any
 way to make sure that we are able to provide these opportunities to the youth of
 our state and nation.

 updated information. Since I have had to postpone my trip to Milwaukee, I will send
 you the information as I now have it. These scores reflect children who were taught
 only in the foreign language for three years. It is an immersion program aimed at
 producing desegregation. Therefore, 40 percent of the students are black. Very few
 of the students are German ethnics. When I have some better data, I will send you
 an update.
 Hope all is going well. Hope to see you again soon.

 DEAR PROFESSOR DERRICK: Please accept my belated but sincere thanks for the off-
 prints you forwarded to me in response to my article in The Chronicle. The reaction
 to my essay has been, for the most part, very gratifying. Your total immersion
 program, based in part on the Canadian model, would be the ideal solution to
 monolingualism-but, as you also point out, local school boards are very reluctant
 to support continuous language instruction in the elementary schools. In Alabama,
 languages are now being dropped from high-school curricula under the guise of
 financial pragmatism. It defies even the most cost-conscious imagination. One of the
 reasons why I wrote the article!
 In spite of it all, I remain (relatively) optimistic and will continue to man the
 barricades against parochialism in linguistic matters.

 DEAR MR. DERRICK: I am most grateful for your thoughtful letter on immersion
 language learning. It is incomprehensible to me that an approach of the sort that
 you describe has not been universally accepted here, although I suspect we will
 eventually be forced to recognize its value. I have written an essay on a related
 theme that will appear in the Georgetown University volume on language studies
 that James Alatis is editing. My main thesis in that essay is that we might do well
 to establish a few special International High Schools within large city school sys-
 tems, where the most intensive teaching would be provided to high school students,
 to be coordinated with similar programs at the grade school level. I only hope that
 our mutual efforts are not rejected as naive and utopian!
 With all best wishes,
 Your sincerely,

 When we introduced the bill that is now before the subcommittee
 2 years ago, I specifically encouraged immersion but there were a
 great many people in the foreign language community who simply
 said that we ought to be encouraging innovation and not strictly
 one form and not so much immersion.
 The bill is tentatively drafted and my colleagues here are cospon-
 sors of that bill. Incidentally, I received some encouragement and I
 have not had a chance to tell either of them, but I received some
 encouragement on that bill yesterday from the Secretary of De-
 fense. But we simply have some money in there for the States for
 innovation. Should we be more precise than that in the language of
 the bill?
 Mr. DERRICK. My opinion is that innovation is set up so that we
 may explore new and different techniques, and in this particular
 case as to what is successful. We do not have to go a long ways to
 find what does work. When do innovative programs finally become
 convincing and then we put them into place as a practice in the
 State or in the district or wherever?
 If you could please look at Mr. McGillivray's letter in the appen-
 dices, he very kindly comments on Canada's debt to America on
 education. This is appendix E, about the fifth line from the bottom,
 beginning with the word perhaps."
 Perhaps because we Canadians have always turned to Americans for our models
 in so many educational innovations, I offer in return the experience and expertise of
 Canadian educators to advise and assist in the establishment of immersion if it
 becomes a widely-used approach to foreign language teaching.
 I am not a member of the language teaching profession or com-
 munity. I am an elementary and classroom teacher and university
 administrator, and it seems that Much of the help is coming
 through the foreign language departments from people outside,
 such as Gabriel Jacobs of Silver Spring, Md.
 Some of us are just kind of cutting through some of the impedi-
 ments that get in the way of what seems effective.
 I would appreciate it if you would look at Mr. Grittner's letter to
 Mr. Wallace Lambert. That is enclosure I and if you would look at
 the results which he shows in Milwaukee, the second page there of
 appendix I. The Milwaukee schools started a language center
 school as a matter to bring about de facto integration, certainly a
 step that I highly approve, and 3 years ago they began teaching
 inner city children and 40 percent had to be underprivileged and
 many of them black children, before they could have Federal funds
 to be given the program.
 Here you see three categories compared. The first is the U.S.
 average on metropolitan achievement test scores, the high, the
 average, and the low, and then Milwaukee across-the-city, and
 those children in the 68th Street school who have had 3 years of
 their instruction in German.
 Understand now their first 3 years of instruction were in a
 foreign language. Notice how they test in English after 3 years.
 They have none in the low category, whereas Milwaukee and the
 United States had 30 and 23 percent. In the average they showed
 62 percent, whereas Milwaukee and United States showed 55 and
 54 percent. The total there is that they have 100 and the average is
 above the level. On mathematics you see a similar reflection.

 Mr. SIMON. I have lost you somehow in the statistics. I have the
 page of the statistics but I do not see where you get the figures of
 Milwaukee.
 Mr. DERRICK. Of the 68 schoolchildren, he did not send this in for
 publication, you see, and we have three groups compared. The
 United States is across the line there.
 Mr. SIMON. And the 68, is that the school where that was tried?
 Mr. DERRICK. It is called the foreign language center. That is the
 German immersion school and I typed below that, it appears, 68th
 Street school.
 Mr. SIMON. Now the question arises, does this school appeal to
 the young people who would automatically, if they were taking
 English, fall into that category?
 Mr. DERRICK. Well, they are kindergarten children, so appeal or
 no appeal, that is maybe not a good question and you should ask if
 it appealed to their parents.
 The parents in this town were offered the opportunity to enroll
 their children in this school and in this case it was a language
 magnet school. Forty percent was necessary to have the funding
 from the inner city school and that was enrolled immediately, the
 40 percent. Then the rest of the community could apply after that,
 so that the answer is yes, it did appeal to the parents and it was
 quickly enrolled.
 Now with that kind of results, you know, it is going to be more
 and more effective and popular as this community becomes ac-
 quainted with it. They now offer German, Spanish, and French,
 and they may choose to have their children start the education.
 Mr. SIMON. I am convinced and I don't know what language we
 will use in the report language to accompany the bill. We can
 encourage American schools to move in this area much more.
 Mr. DENARDIS. I am still trying to absorb the testimony here. I
 would yield to my colleague, Mr. Coleman.
 Mr. COLEMAN. I am not familiar personally with total immersion
 and I understand it is the total second language for 3 years, start-
 ing with kindergarten. Is this mainly for special programs, in
 school districts, and certainly it is not widespread. How do you
 create the emphasis or impetus to start one up?
 How costly are these?
 Mr. DERRICK. The word has to be spread and that is the reason I
 appreciate being here. Occasionally an innovative administrator
 goes to a meeting and hears about it, as in Holliston, Mass. The
 superintendent went to a professional hearing and heard about this
 and he went back to his district and began to make things move
 and did research. I happened to be their first consultant and they
 started the program 2 years ago.
 It moves very slowly because it is very difficult for Americans to
 comprehend just how we can educate our children in another lan-
 guage and have them come out effective in English. The net result
 is that they come out better in English and they have a second
 language too.
 It does not cost more. In another article that I prepared I used
 the name of the teacher, Miss Sullivan, in Holliston, Mass., and
 they taught kindergarten French in the morning and kindergarten

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 English in the afternoon, and the kindergarten teachers there do
 teach 2 sections, 26 in the morning and 26 in the afternoon.
 The next year those same children went into the first grade and
 they had a full-time all-day-long French language instructor. It
 costs more to hire a teacher qualified to teach French or German
 or whatever language than it does to have one in English. So the
 essential costs are minimal, if any greater.
 On the first example here pertained just to the subject we were
 discussing. The school had truly two languages throughout the
 sixth grade and you would have some additional expenses there in
 the library with two languages, so that those people could go to the
 library and select Robinson Crusoe in another language.
 Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield, there are some minor
 additional expenses in that textbooks may have to be purchased
 from Canada or France or Germany or somewhere. There is some
 additional administrative work in the experience like in Tacoma
 Park, Md. About one-third of the parents in that school district
 volunteered to have their kids in the school, so you don't have
 simple geographical borders for assigning children to the school.
 There is some additional administrative work, but it is not expen-
 sive.
 Mr. DERRICK. Well, compared to educating those children inad-
 equately and partially, that we do in our high school programs 6
 years later, where you assign a teacher specifically to teach a
 language, if we really costed those two programs against one an-
 other and also in relation to effectiveness, then this would come
 out far ahead.
 As children leave the sixth grade you ask which language, and if
 I may respond to that, my feeling is that you choose whatever
 language is locally important in a community. Fall River, Mass.,
 might have much to relate to having their kids educated in Portu-
 guese, since it is a heavily Portuguese area, and the west side of
 Chicago would probably be Polish, and they are doing that in
 Canada.
 In Alberta, Canada, the Lithuanian kids can't speak to their
 grandparents. They started immersing in Ukrainian and now the
 grandchildren speak with their grandparents.
 Mr. COLEMAN. How often do you find a person certified to teach
 who can speak a foreign language like, I assume, you have to and
 have knowledge of it all day long, even for the kindergarten chil-
 dren and the second graders, and don't we really have a shortage
 of these potential people?
 Mr. DERRICK. Well, if next year we said we were going to open
 150 classrooms, you would have a shortage. If we opened 15 class-
 rooms you would not have a shortage. As this becomes a vocational
 area you are going to find some schools smart enough to start up a
 program with a master's degree in immersion language teaching. I
 have a curriculum waiting and waiting for the school to come
 along and pick it up.
 Mr. COLEMAN. If you have studies, and I don't know if this was a
 study you were telling us about, about the two control groups in
 kindergarten and so forth, but would you supply those to me, to my
 office, and I would appreciate that, or any other studies that you
 would have that have been made with some hard data.

 Mr. DERRICK. It is richly available out of both the American
 scene and the Canadian scene, and this was from Mr. Grittner. His
 measurements in the children in the language school in Milwaukee
 is strong support of this whole concept.
 Mr. COLEMAN. It is exciting.
 Mr. SIMON. It is really exciting, -there's no question about it.
 Mr. DENARDIS. I must say I am very much impressed. I do not
 have a question on immersion language teaching, but I want to
 take advantage of your presence here to ask you a question in the
 general field, if I may.
 Mr. DERRICK. Yes, sir.
 Mr. DENARDIS. One of our interests-it is an interest cited in the
 bill and developed in the course of the hearings to be a matter of
 interest to us-that is to say, the less commonly taught languages.
 Do you have any ideas because of the real need in this area which
 we have been documenting in commerce, defense, and intelligence
 and various other studies?
 Mr. DERRICK. I heard your testimony from last fall that you
 presented.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Do you have any ideas that you could advance to
 us how we can focus more resources and attention and spur the
 development of teaching of what is commonly taught in languages?
 Mr. DERRICK. Yes. I would first of all bring forward the idea to
 the child, educating the child in the system of early language
 immersion, so that he leaves sixth grade knowing French or
 German and whatever language is locally important, and we go on
 to junior high school. And we should have offered during junior
 high school one or two courses a day in that language so that that
 language continues to grow.
 We make a large mistake in our country of letting all of our
 Spanish-speaking kids put Spanish back on the shelf of their grand-
 mother instead of helping them to get that language growing. That
 is a whole discussion. But if we sustain that language as a literal
 language, one that they wrote and read in school, we would go
 bilingual.
 If we continue French, which is a commonly used language in
 our country in these programs, they would have it through junior
 high school, and they may start a third language, whatever their
 high school offers, possibly French and possibly German and,
 maybe, Russian.
 When those children, knowing one other language and possibly
 two other languages, when they leave our high school and come to
 the university and approach the defense community or have that
 in mind as a possible vocation, they will be much better prepared
 and less apprehensive of learning even a less commonly taught
 language and they will have experience already in having acquired
 more than one language and they will learn that third language
 with greater ease. That would be one approach.
 As to how to develop more interest in that, I will not try to
 venture a solution to that because I don't really have it. It is a
 difficult problem.
 Here is one way to bring to our society, children who are compe-
 tent in two languages, and lots of them, and that is the point.

 Mr. SIMON. If I could add one other comment here for my col-
 leagues, which will not surprise Bill Derrick, I visited Takoma
 Park, Md., where these young people come in and walk into a
 second grade class, and to see these kids doing their fractions in
 French is an exciting thing.
 It is the same thing to go to Cincinnati, Ohio, where they had an
 integration problem, where they finaly decided they were going to
 establish magnet schools and establish a French school and
 German and Spanish emphasis schools. I visited all three and you
 walk into their rundown area of Cincinnati, and their beatup old
 school buildings, with all due respect to Cincinnati, in this fourth
 grade class, half black and half white, and they are getting their
 biology lesson in German.
 Mr. DERRICK. It is mind-boggling. Just in passing, I remember
 the testimony on the floor, one of your colleagues from Illinois
 made the comment on the floor that he wished he knew someone
 who would have the determination to provide his children with
 another language. And he did not know of anyone like that. In one
 letter I wrote to you I said to be sure and tell him about me.
 My son was admitted to West Point and we turned down an
 appointment to West Point to let him spend a year in France, in a
 school, attending school and living with a family and going with a
 senior group of kids, which was in their last year before they took
 their law examination, and he came back with a much broader
 cultural point of view and thorough use of the language. I won't
 say command of the language.
 And when he was reappointed this summer he went down there
 and tested out on that language and he is free now to learn a
 second language while he is there. Therefore, they will graduate a
 young man who will now be able to use two languages and one of
 them may be one of the rare ones like Arabic, because I think that
 would give him a fine edge on a vocational career.
 There are things that we can do. We should not be contained by
 the old problems we have had. This bill does help us find ways to
 practice innovative programs and my hope is that many of those
 innovations that they will try will be related to immersion.
 There is a world of research and reassurance ready for us to pick
 up and use as a candidate if we can bring ourselves to take some
 wisdom from another country.
 Mr. SIMON. We thank you very much for your testimony here
 today and for your leadership.
 Unfortunately I am going to have to leave. I want to introduce
 the next witness, however, and mention one other witness who is
 going to be here and then I will turn the chair over to my col-
 league from Connecticut.
 Dr. Vaisnys was a member of the President's Commission on
 Foreign Languages and not only a member, but she has more zip
 and enthusiasm than all of the other members of the Commission
 put together. She is vice president of the Association for the Ad-
 vancement of Baltic Studies, but that title is an inadequate descrip-
 tion.
 Let me add one other person that I wish I could be here to greet
 and he is a little bit like Elona in being a dynamo also, and that is
 Dr. John Rassias from Dartmouth College, who has been a teacher

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 on national televisions shows, and on "Sixty Minutes" at one time.
 He is really unusual as a teacher and I wish I could be here for his
 testimony.
 I hope you will forgive me, but they tell me I am supposed to
 speak in Minneapolis tonight, of all places, and so I am going to
 have to leave your good company. I will turn you over to my
 colleague from Connecticut. I know they will treat you well and I
 know you will treat them well.
 STATEMENT OF ELONA VAISNYS, VICE PRESIDENT,
 ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF BALTIC STUDIES
 Ms. VAISNYS. You know, of course, we have your presence in
 every town in Connecticut because every one of our 200-plus librar-
 ies has your book.
 Mr. SIMON. I am sure that Elona Vaisnys is responsible for that.
 Mr. DENARDIS. And they want you back here on Saturday night
 to autograph every one of them.
 Mr. SIMON. I have not been to New Haven for many years and
 ironically I am here today and I will be back to speak at a dinner
 meeting in New Haven tomorrow night.
 MS. VAISNYS. My best regards to you. In Minneapolis we had a
 good conference there last year on foreign languages and I hope
 you are going to be speaking on foreign languages.
 Mr. SIMON. I always work at it no matter what my speech is
 about.
 Mr. DENARDIS. One of Elona's parting comments to me as I left
 for Washington after the election was to be sure and immediately
 look you up. She had already prepared me well on your credentials
 in this area and she and I talked about you many times. So it is
 nice that all three of us are in the same room, at least for a few
 minutes.
 Mr. SIMON. Perhaps you influenced him to get on the subcommit-
 tee.
 Mr. DENARDIS. I want to make sure that Congressman Simon is
 properly dispatched to whatever station he is going to.
 Ms. VAISNYS. Thank you for the honor of having this opportunity
 to speak in behalf of the House bill H.R. 3231. I know the honor is
 a very short one because we have to speak fast and to the point
 and I will do that.
 In Connecticut about 213,000 jobs are related to exports in some
 way. On a per capita basis Connecticut is third in the country in
 exports and it leads all of the States in the percentage of jobs
 stemming from manufacturing exports. Economic development,
 which is working to increase our exports even more, has come out
 very strongly in favor of foreign languages as being something
 which would help increase our exports, the percentage of exports,
 even more and they know we really have to cut down the time we
 use.
 I am going to ask that this statement of Commissioner Stockton
 to be included as a part of my testimony.
 Mr. DENARDIS [presiding]. The statement will be included in the
 record at this point, without of ection.

 INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ELONA VAISNYS,  MOUNT CARMEL,  CONN.
 The Connecticut Commissioner of Economic Development, quoted in the New
 Haven Register, March 27, 1980:
 "In my opinion, as Connecticut continues to more fully move into the internation-
 al economy, the needs for increased attention to foreign languages will accelerate.
 The ability to communicate in languages other than English is vitally important
 and many of us involved in international economics are handicapped by a lack of a
 working knowledge of other languages.
 "This is unfortunate. However, I think that state government, the business com-
 munity, and all of our educational institutions must quickly focus their attention on
 this pressing problem. Looking to the future, I am horrified to find that the number
 of students in Connecticut's public secondary schools who are taking courses in
 foreign languages has been dropping dramatically.
 "To directly meet future needs, we must get down to the hard business of
 reversing this undesirable trend by assessing the reasons for the current situation
 and correcting them as quickly as possible.
 "The Connecticut Department of Economic Development would be eager to work
 with a group of concerned Connecticut officials to undertake the educational task
 that must be directed at the general public as well as students and education
 officials. It is obviously necessary that Connecticut take bold and effective action to
 make the citizens of this state more Eonversant in several foreign langauges, includ-
 inF Japanese and Chinese.
 `This is educationally significant and economically sound."
 Ms. VAISNYS. I would like to say that we see the very large
 importance of foreign languages. We need people in various jobs
 with foreign languages. They have come out with editorials to that
 effect.
 Yet Connecticut is losing business because of our inability to
 have people who know languages. For example, when I was a
 member of the President's Commission I had a chance to speak to
 very many people in many walks of life. I became aware of several
 things.
 For example, secretaries of businesses would tell me, and they
 confided in me, that a lot of sales get lost due to the lack of
 knowledge of languages. If a letter comes in the office and nobody
 in the management can read it, they toss it in the wastebasket
 where possibly that is some export that is not going to be exported
 out of Connecticut. Yet every $50,000 of exports equals one job for
 an American here.
 When buyers come from other countries to Connecticut, and
 since we export a lot we get buyers from other countries coming to
 Connecticut, and the presentation is done in fluent and slick Eng-
 lish, again I was made aware of this by a secretary, an executive
 secretary who used to be assigned because she knew some Spanish.
 She used to be assigned to go with the buyers and sort of make life
 more pleasant for them while they were visiting the company.
 She realized that as these buyers, these men, would be listening
 to the sales presentation, and their English was not up to the level
 of what was being presented, in fact they were not getting what
 was being told to them. The salesman was not reaching them
 because of the language gap and she said that there were times
 when she in fact stepped in and said, "May I please translate?" and
 she would be sometimes allowed to translate. But she mentioned
 one instance where because the content was technical and she did
 not quite know the product well enough she asked the person to
 explain what she wanted to say.
 The president of the company who was there, because it was a
 big contract being discussed, said, "Please never mind about under-
 standing, just translate."

 That is a case of not understanding what the language is, of
 course, and how it works.
 As a member of the President's Commission I talked to a number
 of businessmen and I also was alerted to something that was hap-
 pening. For example, one instance comes to mind where there was
 the possibility of a huge investment in an African country, which
 was a French-speaking country. Just before signing the contract
 the economist of one of the American firms, and there were a
 number of them interested in investing, asked to see the contract
 in the original. The contract was in the original and everybody was
 given a copy in English, but by reading the contract in the original
 he realized that those transactions were literal and correct, but
 there were implications in French which did not or were not trans-
 lated.
 This economist counseled his company against the investment
 and they did not invest, but they lived to be very happy about it
 because other firms lost a lot of money on that deal.
 These are just several examples. These examples are probably
 multiplied very many times in many companies across the country,
 and very many secretaries would probably say the same thing as
 the secretaries in Connecticut, that is, about losing jobs in this
 way.
 Of course, when children are going to school we don't know what
 they will end up as being, whether they will end up being econo-
 mists or secretaries and maybe they will end up working in the
 Defense Department. Now speaking of our national security, I have
 become very insecure about our defense ever since I found out that
 of the 1,500 people who work in the office of the Secretary of
 Defense, not one has a competence in any foreign language.
 That influences the 90 people in the European section and not
 one is listed as having competence even in German or French. Now
 that is quite something to think about.
 A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense has said that
 the results of military action which are based on inadequate knowl-
 edge of the region and its people are unpredictable and may be
 disasterous. When none of our people in the Defense Department
 have any reading ability of the different languages, that is a very
 sad state of affairs.
 All of these people, when they go on fact-finding missions are not
 able to understand the language and they do not in fact go and
 find the facts and they rely on somebody to translate something
 into English and then they question who is doing the translating.
 As far as translating and interpreting is concerned, whoever
 needs to talk in English and does not use English himself, has to
 bring his own interpreter to the United States.
 The same goes for Members of Congress who go on factfinding
 missions. Most of them don't have any languages and most of their
 staffs don't know any languages, and they go out into the streets of
 Cairo and they have no idea what the people are speaking about.
 They did not in Iran. They could not read the local press, and how
 many facts do you find when you are really deaf and illiterate?
 There are jobs which we have not developed because of the
 shortage of our language skills. For example, in tourism, about a
 year or so ago I think our tourists were up to 20 million people
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 coming over or streaming our way. I heard that some hotel chains
 now teach their cashiers how to exchange foreign currency, but
 just think of the jobs which could be created if we learned from the
 Europeans and others who are able to cater to Americans in
 American English, and have them supplementing their national
 economy nicely for years. We have not developed that kind of
 service to incoming tourists.
 I do not have time to speak of sections 3 and 4 of the bill, which
 have to do with postsecondary education, except to say that college
 students should be studying foreign languages as well as other
 cultures and global problems. Having colleges require languages
 and helping them to provide languages will help enormously and it
 will snap into place programs in high schools also.
 I would like to confine the rest of my remarks to the 15 or 17-
 year-olds which are mentioned in section 2 and for which this bill
 asks a modest $7 million. When I think Congress is thinking of
 allotting $139 million to bilingual education, which would really
 impact a fraction of these same 15-year-olds, many of whom will be
 learning English anyway because they will be immersed in English
 about them, I think there is a disproportion there. But maybe
 Congress does not see it that way yet.
 I want to speak of immersion again. I was delighted to hear what
 Mr. Derrick had to say and I am going to read what he has to say
 with great attention.
 Mr. DeNardis, since you are the chairman now, I think I know
 personally hundreds of children who have learned foreign lan-
 guages by immersion. If everybody and all of the other people
 spoke of their personal experiences, I can also trot out two children
 who learned English by immersion because we wanted them to
 have a second language, and the language we could give them at
 home was Lithuanian. And I thought they could not pick it up, so
 we insisted on speaking nothing but Lithuanian to the children,
 knowing very well they would pick up English by immersion.
 The kids are in college now, and doing very well and doing very
 well in math, as Mr. Derrick mentioned, because they are bilin-
 gual. They do have two languages and it helps.
 I also know hundreds, literally hundreds, of children who have
 learned languages by immersion and who again happen to be very
 good at other subject matters, and I could give you names and so
 on of very many of them who have learned several languages that
 way.
 I do not know how to get this across to people in Congress. There
 are certain crops which need to be planted in the spring. If you
 plant them later they will grow but the fruits will never amount to
 very much of anything. One of these crops is the language. If you
 plant it early it is easy, and the kids, as Mr. Derrick said, they
 don't realize that they are learning another language because they
 are learning math or geology or something else. Kids are able to
 pick up languages in that way.
 Now we must really go into this and maybe the language of this
 bill should be drafted in such a way that the immersion will be the
 preferred treatment, as was said before in the testimony, and it has
 proven to work. We do not need innovation. We need to go with
 something that really works. Canada, of course, has been doing it
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 for 15 years and we have been doing it in very many ways here in
 other aspects, but we are just starting it.
 We do have the proof and the figures are there. There is another
 reason why we really must go immersion, because otherwise we are
 disenfranchising children from lower socioeconomic levels, from
 minority groups.
 If we get these kids to learn a language starting in kindergarten
 they will be able to learn a third language later on. They will be
 able to use the language that they learned if they are secretaries or
 economists or working in the Defense Department or become Mem-
 bers of Congress or work in middle-sized businesses in Connecticut
 and want to do export work.
 But the thing is this: if we wait until the kids are at an age when
 they will be taught the language by the usual method, which is
 through grammar, we will be losing the kids from the lower socio-
 economic levels and from the minority groups also. That is because
 the grammar itself is difficult and to learn a language through the
 grammar method is much tougher than to pick it up by the immer-
 sion effort.
 Also, those kids are traditionally not in a position to have family
 traditions to back them up and give them motivation. Those fami-
 lies are from the lower socioeconomic levels, and they do not see
 the applicability of foreign languages for their children and they
 would not be encouraging it. So if we really want to open up the
 possibility which foreign languages will give and which we will
 need more and more of to a wider segment, a broad base of peace
 of all of our children, and I can't think of quite the name, we must
 do it by immersion and we must do it early, and otherwise they
 will not be taking the languages.
 I have one last thought. People sometimes say, "Oh, yes. I took
 language in school. I took 2 years of it and I don't know a thing. I
 can't talk it any more." That is true. There is one reason. Maybe
 they did not start early enough and maybe they did not take it
 long enough, but if they did take it long enough it is true also that
 they will lose the ability to speak it. However, they will retain the
 ability to read and also the ability to understand.
 There are very many important things in my kind of factfinding
 situations where you can learn by not talking but by listening. You
 can do it in the street in a foreign country, at cocktail parties, in
 corridors, and in factfinding missions when you keep your mouth
 closed but both ears on and receiving.
 Thank you very much.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you very much.
 Elona was a long-time friend and neighbor and I have had the
 benefit of exchanging views with her many times.
 Mr. COLEMAN. Do you speak Iranian yet?
 Mr. DENARDIS. No, but as you can see she is a very vivacious
 person. Rather than questioning her, because I have the benefit of
 her counsels often, I would defer to you.
 Mr. COLEMAN. I think she is just an exciting person as a neigh-
 bor, and your comments about Members of Congress is very accu-
 rate. We had a hearing in Washington with the head of the For-
 eign Languages Institute who in turn trains our State Department
 and other employees of the Federal Government. And I asked if

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 they would be interested in helping Members of Congress become
 proficient in a foreign languge. And they said that they were.
 As a result of that, the final day I extended to my colleagues in
 the House the invitation to have foreign language classes on the
 Hill at our convenience, and as a result of that 10 percent of all of
 the Members of the House signed up, some 45 when I last checked
 yesterday, and your Congressman, Larry DeNardis, is going to be
 fluent in Italian shortly and I will continue my French.
 But this to me is a beginning or an indication that there is an
 ?      interest out there. The Members realize that we need to have this,
 and there are foreign officials who usually speak very good English
 and we can't even come back with the slightest "How do you do?"
 and "How are you?" in their language. It shows something and it
 shows a lack of concern, I believe, and that is what it conveys to
 other people, and this was pointed out recently on a trip to Moscow
 when I asked this question at the Foreign Language Institute and I
 said, "How do you interpret Americans' lack of a foreign lan-
 guage?" And the fellow said, "Maybe it shows you are not interest-
 ed in the people of the world."
 This, I hope, will generate support for an understanding of the
 languages and if we can get these Congressmen in these classes
 they can see how hard it is to do it in the winter and autumn
 months of the year, and why their children in the spring are
 having trouble and why they should work with this bill and other
 efforts to try to do something about it.
 It can be a national scandal that we can't turn out people for
 basic defense and intelligence that we need in this country.
 I would hope that you will continue, as I am sure you will, your
 crusade and anywhere that you can to emphasize this. I think that
 your testimony was outstanding and that makes me all excited
 again.
 Mr. DENARnis. If we have not had Elona in Washington I think
 that we should bring Elona down. Thank you very much, Elona.
 Is Professor Rassias here?
 I understand that Dr. Donald Kagan is here. Dr. Kagan is the
 professor of classics at Yale University and we are very glad to
 have you here. I notice that you were to have appeared in a panel
 with your colleagues, and I do not think that they are here at this
 point in time.
 Would you prefer to wait or would you like to go ahead?
 Mr. KAGAN. Whatever you think should be done.
 Mr. DENARDIS. I think we would like to have you go ahead.
 STATEMENT OF DONALD KAGAN, PROFESSOR OF CLASSICS,
 YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONN.
 Mr. KAGAN. It is a pleasure to be here. I had no idea that any
 such plan was going forward and first I was delighted that any
 such plan was going forward, and after I read the law, or the bill, I
 should say, I was more than delighted because it is such an intelli-
 gently phrased bill, which strikes me as having the greatest possi-
 bility of achieving important goals that you have in mind.
 I really don't have very much to say except to compliment you
 on your efforts and your undertakings and to say that I will
 support them in any way I can.

 Let me say my own field is really history. I teach and my title is
 history, but the reason I make the point is that I am not an
 instructor in languages. I am a consumer. My students are stu-
 dents in history and in order for them to do the kind of work that
 they need to do at the level that is best, they need to be able to
 read foreign languages.
 I am not speaking only about Greek, let us say, in which their
 sources would be found, but in the important body of secondary
 literature which is the key to understanding my subject, as it is to
 understanding most subjects. And what I discovered was this: when
 I began teaching in the late 1950's the Sputnik boom had hit
 education, higher education as well as others. The effects were
 immediately noticeable.
 The quality and quantity of instruction available in secondary
 schools and colleges in mathematics and sciences, but not in for-
 eign languages, had increased strikingly. I took it for granted when
 I began teaching that I could ask my advanced students to read
 works in French or German or Spanish with confidence that each
 one of them could read in at least one of those languages, and so I
 assigned it regularly. Let me assure you that that would be folly
 today if I attempted to do that at Yale University, which is alleged
 to be one of the better universities of the country.
 Yet the preparation of our students is such that it is not practi-
 cable to assign work in foreign languages. That is the contact that
 I have had with this problem that is most direct, and I thought I
 would share it with you because I think it is not often mentioned.
 May I point out also that a decline in the study and the instruc-
 tion of foreign languages dates pretty much to the late 1960's and
 thereafter, for reasons I need not go into now which I think you
 know. The much-complained-about decline in the quality of SAT
 scores coincides almost perfectly with that development. I think
 that is just not an accident.
 The truth of the matter is that as the study of foreign languages
 has always been a key way in which Americans learn the English
 language, even when I was a student in school, very little time or
 attention was given to the language or to the grammar and struc-
 ture of the English language. We picked up usages as best we could
 and we did not understand languages very much.
 We first became aware of these other issues when we studied the
 foreign language and, as a matter of fact, the American quality in
 the area of language in general has always rested very heavily on
 the study of foreign language.
 We universities deserve a considerable amount of blame for the
 sad state of affairs today because in the 1960's we just joined in the
 race to get rid of all of these necessary requirements. When a
 university or college, particularly the prestigious ones, drops these
 requirements it is inevitable that the secondary schools will judge
 that these are frills and not necessary and do the same. So it is a
 vicious circle. I think we bear more responsibility than most.
 I would predict that if many of us restored emphasis upon the
 instruction of foreign languages you would see within a few years a
 considerable increase in the quality and quantity offered at second-
 ary schools as well. So it strikes me that the points in your bill
 that are so attractive to me are the ones that reward programs

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 that in fact lead to more students studying foreign languages. That
 is a very important point.
 I would simply want to emphasize one element in your bill which
 is good, one which I would like to see interpreted very strongly
 should you have the good fortune to put the bill across and make it
 law and put it into effect. This is the one which speaks about
 regular reporting on the part of the institutions benefitting from
 the program.
 What I think is very important is that we teachers should be
 held accountable for what we teach and, more importantly, for
 what our students learn. I would want to see-it doesn't need to be
 written into the bill but it would need to be carefully monitored
 once it is in effect- I would want to see regular reports, say every
 3 years, of any program benefited and included in that report
 should be a statement of how the students fared in examinations
 that were standard in some form.
 I would not want to recommend specific examination, but the
 fact is whoever monitors this thing should be confident it is getting
 something for its money. The purpose of these programs, after all,
 is to see to it that we get the people literate in foreign languages,
 and we should insist that they do that, that they not really take
 courses but that there are results.
 Now speaking as I have the right to do toward the world of our
 education, my view is that we do not deserve anything as good as
 what you are proposing. We have not done anything to merit it.
 But you are right in singling out this area as one which very
 badly needs attention, not from our point of view but from the
 point of view of the national interest and we need to be led to do
 the right thing.
 That, incidentally, is another very fine feature of you bill in that
 it does not impose regulations, and it does not order people about,
 and it centers on doing things well. It seems to me that human
 institutions respond best to those circumstances and it strikes me
 that this is a marvelous thing. I scratch my head and wonder as I
 read the newspaper, can you possibly get away with this?
 But the truth is, let me just -recapitulate, because if you are
 talking to someone who was not sympathetic, the question would
 be, why should the Government spend this money to do such a
 thing? I think of myself as being very much in tune with the
 current mood in Washington and I think Adam Smith would have
 approved it because he understood that there were some areas in
 the life of a nation for which the market simply was not an
 answer, and yet the Nation required it.
 I would argue that anybody who thinks for 10 seconds would
 realize this is such an area. Your bill and the explanation with it
 have made the point extremely well, as a nation engaged in inter-
 national relations, first of all, the level of diplomacy and strategy
 and so forth, and second, but not in any necessarily important way
 as a nation engaged in commerce and financial arrangements with
 other nations, is consistently in the position where we must have
 people who are extremely competent, to provide foreign languages
 to hold up our ends.
 Now our competition beats our brains out. The Western Europe-
 ans and the Japanese are extremely well versed in these languages

 196
 and they simply have an enormous edge. That, as a national devel-
 opment, is unacceptable, so if you ask what market is there to
 remedy this, I find none. For that reason, it strikes me that your
 approach is correct and that the only modest suggestion I would
 have is please do insist upon the quality control at the end of the
 thing. Don't trust us, and we are not to be trusted.
 [The prepared statement of Donald Kagan follows:]
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD KAGAN, RICHARD M. COLGATE PROFESSOR OF
 HISTORY AND CLASSICS, YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONN.
 ON THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE INSTRUCTION IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN
 AMERICA
 In the twenty-five years I have been teaching at different colleges and universities
 I have seen a terrible decline in the amount of instruction offered and received by
 college students. In the late 1950s, spurred on by Sputnick and the resulting chal-
 lenge to the quality of American education, our schools and colleges made consider-
 able and effective efforts in improving the quality and quantity of education in
 science, mathematics, and foreign languages. The results were soon apparent; it was
 possible to ask students to read works in foreign languages in courses in history and
 classics. The level of education rose accordingly. All this changed in the late 1960's.
 For various reasons language requirements were weakened or abandoned. Once
 again the results were soon apparent, this time on a far greater scale. As universi-
 ties abandoned language requirements schools reduced and abandoned language
 instruction. By the mid 1970 s it was impossible to ask students to read works in
 foreign language, to the great detriment of their learning. It is, moreover, no
 accident, that the decline in the level of students' verbal skills as shown in standard
 tests coincides almost perfectly with the collapse of language instruction in the
 schools and colleges. Language is the bed-rock of all learning. A failure to gain a
 good command of language seriously harms the ability to reason and to learn.
 Learning a foreign language is particularly valuable, for we tend to learn our own
 language automatically, whereas the process of learning a foreign language neces-
 sarily involves system, analysis and a comprehension of the way language works.
 Students who don't learn foreign languages are handicapped in using and under-
 standing their own language, as well. Thus, the decline of foreign language instruc-
 tion in the last two decades has had a pervasively damaging effect on the entire
 educational system. We see it in the quality of the students writing, the narrowness
 of their interests and perspective, their inability to command great bodies of schol-
 arship and literature needed to do their work at a high level, and, of course, in their
 inability to enter fields that require foreign language skills so essential to our
 national interests.
 I will have to leave to others the subject of how important it to our country to
 have people capable of engaging in commercial and diplomatic intercourse with
 people of other nations. I will merely say that other countries have a vast advantage
 over us in having almost all their graduates multi-lingual and thus having a wide
 choice in selecting people for important international work. America's involvement
 with the world grows greater each year, and that trend will not be reversed. It is
 recklessly improvident to allow this disadvantage to continue and even to increase.
 The bill before us seems well-designed to help bring about an improvement, by
 rewarding enrollment in foreign language courses and the institution or mainte-
 nance of language requirements it provides an incentive for colleges to take lan-
 guage instruction seriously, to devise better ways of teaching, and to make it a
 central part of the curriculum. To make the plan even more effective I should like
 to see subsection (3) under Section 3(a) interpreted strongly. Programs undertaken
 by grantees should be carefully evaluated every three years or so. Criteria for
 continued funding should include the achievement of a satisfactory level of compe-
 tence in the foreign language as measured by some appropriate, objective standard.
 Achieving the goals of this bill is of great importance to our entire educational
 system as well as to many specific economic and strategic needs of our country. If it
 becomes law it is certain to have profoundly good effects on the problems it address-
 es. It is particularly attractive because it provides incentives to virtue rather than
 imposing unwelcome regulations. By requiring serious and timely evaluations it can
 measure results and allow flexible response, thereby permitting the most effective
 use of federal money and encouraging successful educational innovation. It deserves
 support.

 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you very much. I find your testimony very
 refreshing.
 You asked how we could pass such language, given the budgetary
 climate in Washington, and it is a longshot, to be sure, but a lot of
 things are being rationalized under the national security and na-
 tional interest, and some good and some bad, and this is obviously
 in the former category, and maybe we can get it under that rubric.
 Mr. COLEMAN. How do you suggest we change the attitude of
 colleges and universities on it, the admissions requirements or
 requirements of foreign languages? You seem to be frustrated and
 do you suggest to the trustees what your admissions ought to be
 and what you ought to teach?
 Mr. KAGAN. The fault in my institution, and I think my institu-
 tion is not too different, the fault lies with the faculty. We really
 do have control of the curriculum. Administrative people say they
 don't have the power and it is always the faculty. For the most
 part that is nonsense, but it is true when we come to the question
 of curriculum.
 We did what was wrong and we have the power to do what is
 right. I can tell you that even my institution, which has been
 shameful in this respect, I cannot predict success at this point, but
 I believe this year there will be a proposal before our faculty
 restoring the language requirement.
 I think that is a belated response to a general sense of what was
 happening and I think there is a movement in that direction but if
 you ask me what other thing than appealing to people's sense of
 community and common national purpose will do the trick, I don't
 know.
 May I point out there is one funny thing about the way this all
 happened and perhaps it might be useful to you to know what
 happened. I was astonished to learn these language requirements
 went out-and let me speak about my institution again, which I
 know best-that among those who were in favor of abolishing the
 language requirement were people teaching foreign literatures.
 Now that sounds terribly strange but it has to do with the kind
 of sense that there is a distinction in a level and quality of work
 between instructing someone in the elements of a language and
 teaching him the literature in the language. This is a kind of
 pecking problem that professors have some feelings about, I discov-
 ered. So that in some sense it is beneath them to teach people how
 to begin to read German or French or whatever. It is unacceptable
 and it will sound like self-serving, but we don't feel that way.
 That needs to be broken down and there needs to be a sense in
 which that, too, is understood to be a part of a mature function of a
 person in this category. But here is another thing.
 I guess this is all a case of where the professor comes before the
 politicians, but if you look at the changes that have occurred in
 colleges between 1968 and 1975, during the dark years of every-
 thing falling apart, whatever else was the consequence of the
 change in almost every case it has made the life of a professor
 easier. I think that is just one of the nasty things that we have to
 face, that professors have shed various responsibilities that they
 did not like in the name of this, that, or that noble cause and it is
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 time to face that fact that we have responsibilities and we have to
 take them on whether we like it or not.
 For instance, here is a point. Nobody wants to have in his class
 somebody who does not want to be there. That is just as unpleasant
 a situation on the teacher as it is on the student, but the fact of the      s
 matter is that you cannot get the horse to drink if you don't lead it
 to water.
 There is no guarantee that if you take a foreign language that he
 will learn that foreign language, but I will guarantee if he never          ,
 takes it he will never learn it.
 Mr. COLEMAN. What about admission requirements?
 Mr. KAGAN. That would be an excellent procedure because that
 takes care of the problem. If we had admission requirements which
 say you must have the rudiments of a language and you must take
 several years at an advanced level, that would be the perfect
 situation. The difficulty is competition. You are always afraid if
 you set your admission standards too high in this way, then your
 competitors won't, and the students will elect to go to the other
 institution.
 Mr. COLEMAN. That seems to me to be rather totally inconsistent
 with the reputation of Yale University.
 Mr. KAGAN. Everybody is looking over your shoulder. Yale is
 always looking over its shoulder at Harvard and worrying about
 what percentage of the students go to them and go to us.
 I have thought it must be absolutely terrifying to work at Har-
 vard because at least at Yale if someone gets too high if you are so
 smart, how come you don't go to Harvard.
 Mr. COLEMAN. I hope you continue your efforts and you get your
 faculty to accept what your basic tenets are.
 Mr. KAGAN. We have some chance.
 Mr. DENARDIS. In the matter of your curriculum reform, is that
 a movement toward a core curriculum?
 Mr. KAGAN. There is no talk of that at all. We do have an
 interesting program which has a core for freshmen, three courses
 which they take, which is aiming at that idea. It is a special
 program. It is likely to lead to one which I helped to put together
 and it is a roaring success. It has been expanded this year to
 include more students than it did before but it is still only a
 fraction of the whole student body.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Speaking of Harvard as you did, I am reminded of
 the fact that they recently adopted a core curriculum. Do you
 happen to know if language is part of that core?
 Mr. KAGAN. I believe it is not. If I may say so, I think it is a very
 deceptive thing as they do it, a core curriculum. I do not think it is
 what you and I would think of. You and I, if I read you rightly,
 would think of a certain course and certain subjects that need to be
 the common property of everybody and that is the core. That is not
 what Harvard said.
 Harvard says that there are certain skills which need to be
 learned by everybody but we don't care what subject you take to
 achieve those skills.
 It strikes me as being something for good or ill, quite different
 from what we normally think of as a core.

 By the way, may I say what you are up to here has very impor-
 tant educational virtues that have been lost over the years. The
 notion of all students doing something in common is very, very
 important. I can assure you of that from the study that we have
 made at Yale. We do not have nearly enough of that. There is not
 enough sharing of intellectual material.
 In fact, our culture, it seems to me, is in trouble in large part
 because even the educated branch of it does not have anything in
 common. We cannot assume we have read the same books because
 there is not any longer a center to which everybody refers. The
 thing that you are suggesting helps us move perhaps a little bit in
 that direction, and that is good in itself.
 Mr. DENARDIS. So, that notion of a community of scholars is in
 jeopardy?
 Mr. KAGAN. Absolutely. It seems to me everybody who graduates
 from a liberal arts college ought to be able to meet everybody else
 and have a certain number of topics, confidentially.
 There was a time we could talk about the Bible and Shakespeare
 and perhaps Homer and be certain that every other educated
 person knew what you were talking about. That day is gone and I
 think that is a loss. You know that there is a special communica-
 tion problem that is not addressed, having something to talk about.
 Mr. DENARDIS. You have raised some very interesting points, and
 I must say they have not really been raised in our hearings,
 although we are just at the beginning stage of hearings on this
 matter. But you have raised some very interesting points.
 We thank you for your testimony.
 Mr. KAGAN. Thank you.
 Mr. DENARDIS. We will take a 5-minute recess and after the
 conclusion of that we might have to declare an adjournment.
 [A brief recess was taken.]
 Mr. DENARDIS. We will come back to order.
 Let me formally resume the hearing that we have been conduct-
 ing today. This session has been devoted to the Foreign Language
 Assistance Act and we now invite Dr. John Williams, chairman of
 the Department of Classics at Trinity College, to give his
 testimony.
 Dr. Moskalew is also here and I will ask him to join us here. Dr.
 Moskalew is assistant professor of classics at Vassar College and
 the two of you may proceed in tandem.
 Let me first say to both of you that two of my colleagues, the
 chairman of this subcommittee, Congressman Paul Simon, and the
 ranking minority member, Congressman Tom Coleman, have both
 been here for the day in New Haven, and both left just recently.
 Congressman Simon has to fly to Minneapolis, and Congressman
 Coleman is on the way back to Washington now. But they were
 both here and they asked me to say to you that they were sorry
 that they had to leave, but it was necessary for them to make
 connections.
 They will have a chance to review this testimony. They are very
 diligent members of the committee and they will review your testi-
 mony and we want to thank you for that.

 STATEMENT OF JOHN C. WILLIAMS, CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT
 OF CLASSICS, TRINITY COLLEGE, HARTFORD, CONN.
 Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you very much. I should like to thank you
 for this opportunity to speak in behalf of H.R. 3231. I address you
 as a representative of the Classical Association of New England
 and as an individual professor of Latin and Greek.
 The Classical Association of New England is a regional society
 composed of secondary school teachers and college professors dedi-
 cated to the promotion of quality teaching and research in Latin
 and Greek. Although I am speaking from the perspective of the
 classical languages, most of what I shall say is applicable to the
 modern languages as well.
 Our failure over the past years to provide early and continuing
 training in foreign languages has brought us, in the present, to a
 frightening reality, namely, that the young people in college at this
 time are for all practical purposes functionally illiterate and cul-
 turally ignorant, myopic in vision, and parochial in opinion and
 experience. Since so much of their education has been focused on
 the present and on technology, these young people have no sense of
 their place in the continuum of history and culture.
 The art of writing and the art of speaking are almost foreign to
 them because their education has been concerned with the acquisi-
 tion of skills other than those of verbal and written communica-
 tion. Because they have had little experience with foreign lan-
 guages, ancient or modern, they have little sense about English.
 They have never experienced trying to project themselves into
 another culture, another time, another place, another way of think-
 ing. Without knowing it they are locked in a prison of ignorance;
 the walls of the prison are made of the stuff of technology and
 electronics and the "now."
 World understanding, yes, even world peace, can be achieved
 only by a thorough understanding and knowledge of the peoples on
 earth. The best way to achieve this understanding is through a
 thorough grounding and training in the humanities. And within
 the humanities the study of the language and literature of a people
 is the most effective way. The way a people think, the way they
 express themselves, their hopes, their fears, their aspirations, their
 past, their heritage, their art-these are the means to mutual
 understanding and respect.
 Sociological evaluations can give only an inhuman assessment of
 things as they are. Such evaluations do not and cannot promote
 understanding and true sympathy. Technological training can only
 focus on things.
 In contrast, the study of ancient and modern languages and
 literatures plunges us into the heart and the soul of a people. The
 present can be understood only in the light of the past. If knowl-
 edge of the past is removed, imperceptively oxygen is restricted to
 us in the present. We then function only with difficulty. Our her-
 itage, our roots, provide us with the grist for the present. A study
 of the past very quickly makes us aware that we are not -the
 cultural and linguistic center of the universe.
 Our present predicament is not just the fault of the students
 themselves. It is also with some of the younger teachers, professors,
 counselors, advisers, and administrators, who themselves went

 through an education that had no emphasis on foreign language
 and literature study, no emphasis on the value of the past. These
 teachers and others can only see the importance of the pragmatic
 and the technical. And so the "crime" is perpetuated, and the
 myopia and parochialism are now epidemic in scope.
 Your bill, Mr. Chairman, therefore will give a greatly needed
 boost to the study of foreign languages, ancient and modern. The
 passing of your bill would be a most important signal to the gener-
 al public and to schools and colleges that foreign language study is
 essential for the survival of mankind spiritually and culturally,
 strategically and economically.
 What greater goal could be achieved by the passage of this bill
 than to create an intelligence, sensitive, perceptive population, ca-
 pable of understanding and communicating with other peoples.
 This bill is important for the very survival of the spirit and soul of
 humanity.
 Thank you for granting me this opportunity to address you.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you very much, even though you have
 given us a rather startling analysis of the scene. I suspect that all
 of us who are cosponsoring Congressman Simon's bill have much
 the same perception. You have made a very eloquent presentation,
 although frightening.
 As someone who comes from the world of higher education, as
 you do, I thoroughly understand what you mean about young
 people in college at this time and what capabilities they possess
 and what they do not possess. You are painting a rather bleak
 picture of the combination of the worst of the technical society and
 the worst of 1984.
 I wish that my colleagues were here to hear you. They will at
 least read your statement.
 Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you.
 Mr. DENARDIS. I think we should now like to hear from you, Dr.
 Moskalew.
 Mr. MOSKALEW. Would you like me to read my statement?
 Mr. DENARDIS. Since there are just a few of us, if you would
 submit your statement it will, of course, be incorporated in the
 record and perhaps you would like to just highlight a few major
 points. I will not deprive you of the opportunity to present the
 whole statement if you would like to.

 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, the Joint Na-
 tional Committee on Languages in its testimony before this sub-
 committee last July 15 has presented ample documentation of the
 decline of language study throughout our country. My own experi-
 ence is more limited, as are the statistics on which I draw, but both
 bear further witness to this alarming trend.
 In the New York State public schools the percentage of students
 studying a foreign language in grade K through 12 has declined
 from 21 percent in 1968 to 18 percent in 1980, a loss of about 85,000
 students. These figures err on the high side because the data did
 not discriminate between students taking one language and those
 taking two, so that the latter were invariably counted twice.
 The decline in enrollments did not affect all languages equally.
 Between 1968 and 1980 Spanish fell only 8 percent, while Italian
 rose a staggering 88 percent. More serious losses were sustained by
 German, 49 percent, French, 53 percent, Latin, 62 percent, and
 Russian, 81 percent. Thus not only has the overall enrollment in
 the languages declined but there has been a major shift to Spanish
 and Italian at the expense of the others, a shift that suggests
 avoidance of what students have traditionally regarded as the more
 difficult languages.
 The cause of all this is well known, for the decline came soon
 after large numbers of colleges and universities had dropped their
 language requirements, and it came more precipitously in the col-
 leges themselves. When the language requirement was abolished at
 Vassar College for 1969-70 enrollments in the languages immedi-
 ately fell from 84 to 59 percent, and this trend has continued, so
 that in 1979 only 42 percent of the students were enrolled in the
 language departments.
 These figures also must be adjusted downward, for if literature
 courses taught in translation are excluded those actually studying
 foreign languages probably comprise no more than 35 percent of all
 students in a given year. And those attaining proficiency in a
 language form an even smaller minority, about 40 to 50 students or
 6 to 7 percent. Of the class that was graduated in 1978, 33 percent
 never took a language course in their 4 years at Vassar.
 I am sure that in this Vasser is not unique among colleges. In
 fact, it has probably fared better than others. But if the study of
 languages could so seriously have been neglected at an institution
 such as Vasser with its strong humanistic tradition, its commit-
 ment to educational excellence, and its relatively sound financial
 position, we are indeed in a sorry state.
 The effects of such neglect on international trade, on diplomacy,
 on defense are not for me to document, although they can be easily
 imagined. One cannot effectively conduct business or make a viable
 treaty or gather reliable intelligence data through an interpreter.
 At best it is a handicap, at worst a disaster.
 The inability to converse in languages other than our own hurts
 in other respects as well, for it places us at a cultural disadvantage
 with foreign partners who are multilingual and who are apt to
 view the clinging to our mother's tongue as a sign of arrogance,
 ignorance, or arrested development. Thus linguistic chauvinism
 stands in the way of open and candid communication, for it breeds
 misunderstanding and mistrust.

 The bill now before the subcommittee, H.R. 3231, speaks to the
 very heart of the matter, the language requirement, the dropping
 of which had originally precipitated a vicious cycle. The lack of a
 requirement in colleges translated itself to lower demand in high
 schools, which in turn led to fewer majors in college, hence fewer
 prospective teachers, and so, ultimately, a teacher shortage, for
 example, in Latin, resulting in further reduction of programs.
 Inflation and budget cuts have also had their effect. This cycle
 has to be reversed now or it will be too late. And the impetus must,
 as it did before, come from the colleges. Stimulating the high
 school language programs directly would probably create an acute
 teacher shortage. Yet the colleges are not very likely to take the
 lead in this without prodding.
 The reinstitution of a language requirement means ultimately a
 redistribution of faculty resources, which means that what the
 languages would gain other departments would lose. At a time
 when already at a number of colleges departments have been cut
 back or eliminated such redistribution would be staunchly resisted.
 Furthermore, in the face of declining high school enrollments,
 the competition among colleges for applicants has become very
 intense, while at the same time it has become somewhat easier
 than before for students to get into college. Colleges have, there-
 fore, become sensitive to the possibility of alienating prospective
 students by seeming to be too rigidly structured or to have too
 many requirements, of which the language requirement is among
 the less palatable.
 Should this bill pass, however, the incentive is attractive enough
 so that it would soon create a snowball effect that would carry with
 it many of the leading colleges and universities, and thus establish
 the language requirement as something both educationally sound
 and prestigious.
 We welcome the fact that H.R. 3231 aims at supporting all
 languages and not merely those that may at the moment be strate-
 gically significant. We are always better at responding to present
 needs than at anticipating future ones. We will do the latter best if
 we encourage variety-Western as well as non-Western, modern as
 well as ancient languages.
 A practical benefit accrues no matter what language is studied,
 for since it is the primary vehicle of thought and hence of culture
 such study confronts one with other ways of thinking, of perceiving
 and structuring reality. It teaches greater awareness of cultural
 differences, and thus encourages international understanding. It
 also provides a linguistic framework that facilitates the acquisition
 of additional languages. - The more languages we know the more
 easily do we acquire new ones.
 Such transfer of linguistic skills is particularly in evidence with
 Latin. There are three reasons for studying it. One, an understand-
 ing of its complex morphological and syntactical structure provides
 an excellent basis for the study of modern European langages
 while it also develops certain analytical skills and a linguistic
 sophistication that help one in grasping more quickly other linguis-
 tic structures.
 Two, it deepens our understanding of English, both by enriching
 vocabulary and by forcing us to examine how it functions, how we

 arrange our thoughts, and how we express subtle differences in
 meaning. This leads to greater precision of thought and clarity of
 expression, both of which further effective communication.
 Three, lastly, through Latin and Greek we come in direct contact
 with the roots of our culture. They give us the historical perspec-
 tive that allows us to break out of the provinciality of our own
 time.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Thank you very much.
 I think you have made some very important points here, not the
 least of which is the point which you make with great clarity on
 page 3 concerning the reinstitution of the language requirement
 and the redistribution of faculty resources. You have given us a
 good insight into the politics of economics of the college scene.
 Mr. MOSKALEW. I just came out of that scene because we have
 instituted in Vassar a language requirement that falls short of
 what is envisioned in the bill, and some of the arguments that I
 have included here. That is the feeling of the faculty members,
 that we might make the colleges less attractive to better students
 and fears and the degree of paranoia about losing faculty positions.
 That is a reality that we have to face.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Certainly that is the environment of decline in
 high school graduate numbers of 22 percent nationwide by the mid-
 1990's and particularly heavier numbers here in the Northeast. I
 think it is 40 to 45 percent, and that is another pressure point
 involved in all of this.
 I thank both of you very, very much and I will share the salient
 points that you have made with my colleagues.
 I believe that Dr. John A. Rassias, a distinguished foreign lan-
 guage professor from Dartmouth is with us. I must make an apol-
 ogy to you. Congressman Paul Simon was here to preside until just
 a short time ago when he had to catch a plane for a speaking
 engagement in Minneapolis, and Congressman Tom Coleman was
 here until a few minutes ago, and he had to leave to make a
 connection.
 I am here left to greet you and welcome you and to invite you to
 make whatever observations you would at this point.
 STATEMENT OF JOHN A. RASSIAS, FOREIGN LANGUAGE
 PROFESSOR, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE
 Mr. RASSIAS. Thank you and members of the Subcommittee. I
 spoke with Paul's office and actually I do not have anything specif-
 ic to present. I was going to give some kind of a report on the
 matters which I had observed. But as I was driving and trying to
 collect my thoughts, the one thing that struck me--
 Mr. DENARDIS. May I interrupt for a moment and ask if you
 have any written testimony because I would insert that in the
 record.
 Mr. RASSIAS. These are just random thoughts and Paul asked me
 to come here.
 Mr. DENARDIS. We are delighted to have your random thoughts.
 Mr. RASSIAS. I was impressed about something that happened.
 This happened about the latter part of March, in the Committee
 for Stanford University at that time and there was a debate raging
 on campus as to whether the language requirements ought to be
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 reinstated. I was fortunate enough to participate in some of those
 discussions and I also had the opportunity to speak with some of
 the academic administration of the university.
 One of the observations made, and this is something that I think
 ought to be brought to the attention of the subcommittee, and
 somehow illusions were made to the fact that whenever something
 occurs that really occurs, there is a wallop. It is going to have some
 effect, I think.
 We speculated as to what would happen if Stanford and other
 universities, the best in the country, if they were to reinstate the
 language requirement and what effect that would have. One of the
 theories, of course, was that all of the kids would apply from
 various high schools and they would make sure that they would
 have Latin. During the debate someone pointed out that this would
 really not be too influential, that students, mostly those who went
 to Stanford, some 90 percent of those already have the requirement
 or at least they have taken languages to satisfy it.
 I think that is something that I would like to mention. In truth,
 any attempt to make what is already a practice a principle and the
 kids do take languages to apply to Stanford, if they really knew
 that they had to get it there will be some kind of reaction and
 there will be some kind of fallout. This was definitely something
 that can be measured.
 One of the hopes is, and the reaction I share with some of the
 members of that department, having been there a month or so, is
 that again indeed the effects that would be felt. For another thing,
 one of the ideas was that suppose Stanford does take on this
 recommendation and the requirement, would it have national
 effect on the media?
 On the 25th of June, the Wall Street Journal carried it on the
 front page. I use that as an example and the work of the Commis-
 sion, I am pleased to say, was one of the huge wedges to break
 through some of the negative arguments. That is a very positive
 effect, and a very definite one.
 At the same time I am pleased to report that other schools that I
 visited myself and most recently I came from Oberlin, where the
 faculty there is making a real solid drive to make languages
 number one, and I don't know that they are going to succeed.
 Now, Mr. Chairman, as .1 say, these are random thoughts and I
 wanted to be able to give a kind of demonstration of them and
 would you like to see the demonstration?
 Mr. DENAxnrs. Indeed, would you proceed?
 Could I ask you about the state of Dartmouth College?
 Mr. RASSIAS. It is booming and I have my good friend here,
 Walter, and he will be pleased to know that the classics depart-
 ment is booming. There is nothing better than to walk into a class
 where you can hear Latin dramatized by some student apprentice
 teacher and see everyone participate, not knowing that they only
 speak this at the Vatican, if there. These kids are speaking Latin,
 which is a wonderful thing.
 One of things that I wanted to say before we begin this kind of a
 presentation is actually a thought that I would like to continue just
 two steps further. One of the recommendations made by the Com-
 mission was that we ought to have more workshops throughout the
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 country and we ought to have them in various types, and we ought
 to have them for a year long or a week long or a month long and
 send people to various countries where the languages are spoken in
 house service and so on and so forth.
 Again, in the spirit of that recommendation I had the good luck
 to go to various schools and did some work with colleges, both at
 the college level and at the high school level and also invited many
 of them to Dartmouth for these weekend-long workshops. We had
 them from colleges as well as secondary schools, and this gives us
 an opportunity to share ideas, to work in a kind of methodology
 that is exciting, and something that we hoped will touch students
 and motivate them.
 One of the observations was, we came across in the Commission
 year, was that if the students are asked "Will you drop languages
 and why are you concerned with languages," the single answer
 they gave us was that languages were boring.
 In order to work against that these workshops have been going
 on and we are certainly going to continue them and in fact in-
 crease them this year.
 What happens during such a workshop is that a demonstration is
 given, and the demonstration is like this: I will explain the philos-
 ophy of this system and talk about the fact that teaching, one of
 the oldest of professions, if not the oldest, has not really looked to
 other fields and other disciplines to do something about vitalizing
 itself. I maintain that much is to be learned from the acting
 profession. It is in the acting profession, for instance, that people
 are specifically trained to get the attention of the audience.
 We as teachers are not often trained to do that. Often our
 courses in education center around how to write on the blackboard,
 whereas the actor or the actress has to be totally in command of
 the subject and get the people's attention. So we go through five
 steps that are rather important and the first of which is self-
 knowledge, and everyone is asked to scour over his or her past to
 detect negative experiences one has had and to reject those as soon
 as possible.
 Then we try to find a positive characteristic, those we enjoy in
 our own teachers, and I dare say that they were in No. 3, the first
 of which is the enthusiasm of the person, the second the respect
 that he or she had for us in the classroom by hard work and we
 appreciated that respect, and, third, that that person had kind of
 an identity.
 How do you make a class more than just a teaching vocabulary,
 because that is what it is. We ought to pack everything into it and
 stay all English. It can't be drilling words, but it has to be with a
 cultural bias.
 How does the French person shake hands? He shakes them in
 one quick pump and then when he sees a woman coming he kisses
 her on both cheeks, and all of these things are brought into the
 classroom or something is lost. We try to show this to the teachers
 first, and then tell them when they get in the class, if it is Spanish,
 the same thing. I understand in Latin classics they will kiss right
 on the mouth.
 These things have to be spoken to the students and there has to
 be a cultural awakening that languages are just not words, and
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 then we go through the questions, whether the questions that are
 used will zap up the class and make the class more exciting and
 give the students more involvement and have them, go home at
 night and say, "I discovered something."
 These are cues which bring out two essential ingredients, one of
 which is magic, that everything has a magic quality which we have
 to somehow get to and explain to students in different ways, and
 new ways that is an exciting way, and then drama, which, of
 course, means participation in the action.
 Then, finally, there is stage presence, and we do not need the
 stage presence as a teacher but we mean most specifically the
 student and how that student feels. Does the student feel good to
 be in the classroom? And the next is the creative state. I would like
 to do this in about 3 minutes.
 Mr. DENARDIS. Let me say for the record that on the conclusion
 of your demonstration the hearing is adjourned, just in case the
 presiding officer has to leave, because he does in fact have to go to
 a ground breaking ceremony at 3.
 Mr. RASSIAS. Then I will drop the first part of this and give you
 the last part. I will give you the creative state.
 We feel for them to communicate with everyone or anyone they
 have to be sensitive to that person's background. I cannot just walk
 up to you and suddenly start to talk, because I do not know
 whether you are of that sort or whether he needs it, or what it is.
 It will take days to study that and so I will plunge directly into a
 definition of sensitivity, which is best defined first by the French
 philosophy by the name of Didrotrot. He was a philosopher and I
 will do the whole thing in Italian and French and I do not know if
 any of you know French, but it does not matter if it is clear, and
 you should be able to do it.
 We said before if there is magic in teaching and there is drama
 in teaching our students should be able to"tune in, if we did not
 have lengthy explanations in English, and they should be able to
 sense it in the mimicking of the words.
 We speak of sensitivity which in French is "la sensible." This is a
 definition and, by the way, the whole purpose of this definition
 which I use in these workshops and in class, it is obvious overkill,
 no one is expected to go into class and do anything approximating
 what we will do in this demonstration.
 The point of this is to show the students that we are not all
 strengths nor are we all weaknesses, but we are a mixture of the
 two and this is what they have to appreciate.
 [Dr. Rassias then gave a demonstration of a professor teaching in
 a French classroom.]
 Mr. DENARDIS. I am absolutely enthralled. This has been the
 most unusual public hearing I have ever been a party to. I do not
 want to go, but I promised some people that I would be present at
 this ground breaking.
 We appreciate very much the contributions which all of the
 witnesses have made to this hearing and we stand adjourned at
 this time.
 [Whereupon, at 3 o'clock p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION ON FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND
 INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, SALEM, OREG.
 I am a Foreign Service Officer, working under the Pearson program, as Executive
 Director of the Oregon Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies.
 This Commission, the first in the United States created for this purpose, was
 established in 1980, with members from business, labor, civic groups, the legislature,
 and educational leadership, all unpaid volunteers. Its task is to develop a statewide
 program aimed at enhancing the awareness and competence of all the people of
 Oregon in regard to the international community.
 My own foreign service experience of 23 years includes no dramatic encounters
 with language failure (or success). The Foreign Service is an undramatic profes-
 sion-Dean Rusk once said our whole purpose is to make the world boring. More-
 over, I think the U.S. Foreign Service does better than its counterparts from other
 countries in mastering difficult languages. But our national disregard for foreign
 language study, which ironically has become more evident as our interdependence
 with the rest of the world has intensified, has had severe costs.
 Our linguistic apathy has meant, for example, that the State Department and
 other agencies have had to spend considerable time and money teaching languages
 to people who, in earlier years or in other nations, would probably have learned
 them, at least to some relevant level of competence, before entering the service. It
 has meant excluding people in the service from consideration for otherwise suitable
 assignments, for lack of the necessary language or time to teach it. Probably
 greater, but harder to measure, is the cost in terms or irritation, inefficiency, and
 lost opportunity, that American officials and businessmen have incurred because
 foreign language has not been part of a standard American education.
 Still more significant, however, is the myopia that this attitude toward language
 represents. As a people we have often enjoyed looking at other nations through the
 wrong end of the telescope. Many of us have regarded international studies of all
 types-linguistic, political, economic, cultural-as something remote and not really
 important in daily life. As the world becomes smaller and more competitive this
 attitude becomes increasingly expensive and even dangerous.
 Regarding H.R. 3231, the Commission welcomes the effort to strengthen language
 studies nationwide, as part of a continuing pursuit of excellence in education gener-
 ally. It particularly welcomes provisions for establishing performance standards and
 external incentives for study. Model programs by themselves have tended to
 strengthen schools that are already strong and to disappear when funds dry up.
 What has been lacking is the sense that international studies, linguistic or other-
 wise, are worthwhile for their content and as prerequisites for other important
 goals-that they are in themselves valuable educational investments comparable
 with English, history, and mathematics.
 In Oregon, we are stressing the importance of persuading all citizens-teachers,
 students, parents, employers, and taxpayers-that greater knowledge of the outside
 d       world, of foreign languages and foreign societies and how to cope with them, is
 essential for the average person's well-being. In immediate terms, for example, such
 knowledge will be crucially important in enabling the state and the nation to
 participate in the increasingly competitive international marketplace. For the
 longer term, greater cultural contact, and understanding of the international com-
 munity, will be major factors in determining the security, economic, social, and
 political character of the world in which we or our grandchildren will live.
 We are seeking ways to instill this appraoch throughout the state, and to institu-
 tionalize it for the long term. We believe that a basic attitudinal development along
 these lines is the indispensable basis for progress in expanding awareness of the
 outside world, and for strengthening the teaching of foreign languages and interna-
 tional studies. We would therefore like to suggest that funding for model programs
 include support for activities designed not only to further language training but to
 maintain pressure for a more internationally conscious approach in the education

 process, at all levels and in the broadest sense of that term. The Commission also
 suggests that the Committee may wish to consider measures for further strengthen-
 ing language incentives connected with Federal Employment, not only for the
 Foreign Service but for all aspects of employment for which language may be
 relevant.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARVIN S. SCHINDLER, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF DE-
 PARTMENTS OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES; CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF ROMANCE AND
 GERMANIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, AND DI-
 RECTOR, JUNIOR YEAR IN GERMANY PROGRAM
 Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to
 speak to you in support of H.R. 3231, certainly the most timely and significant
 legislation on behalf of foreign language learning in this country in recent years. I
 am representing today both Wayne State University, one of the largest urban
 institutions of higher education in the country, and the Association of Departments
 of Foreign Languages, a subsidiary of the Modern Language Association of America,
 whose membership comprises some 1,000 college and university departments of
 foreign languages in the United States.
 Although I am professionally involved in higher education, I wish to address
 briefly all sections of the bill. For not only does this legislation have the foresight to
 speak to the need for and encourage the study of foreign languages at every level
 from elementary school through the university, but those who will teach the stu-
 dents affected by the bill's provisions must maintain an ongoing dialogue and
 develop methods of articulation among the various levels if the legislation is to have
 the results desired. In short, the learning of foreign languages is presented quite
 correctly in the bill as a continuum extending from our children's earliest education
 through the completion of their formal education. No part of it can be disregarded
 or considered less essential than another, least of all by those who teach foreign
 languages.
 H.R. 3231 seeks to implement ways of helping to solve a problem which has
 enormous implications for the vitality of our nation's continued participation in
 world affairs in the future. A solution to this problem is nothing less than essential
 to the political, economic, and cultural stability and well-being of the United States.
 The problem well described in the 1979 "report of the President's Commission on
 Foreign Languages and International Studies" and admirably highlighted in your
 Chairs recent book, "The Tongue-Tied American," is that of American monolingual-
 ism, an affliction which strikes young and old alike and which is perhaps most
 conspicuously virulent in the most unlikely segment of our population, those who
 have completed the highest levels of higher education and who go on to hold the
 most sensitive positions in government and in the business world. Moreover, incom-
 prehensibly in our world today, the disease is spreading, its consequences felt more
 each day. Our previous band-aid approaches at selective remedy for a few cases once
 the fever was well underway are absolutely insufficient when most of the rest of the
 world with which we deal regularly have undergone massive immunization at the
 earliest age. What is needed in the United States now is nothing less then a
 nationwide innoculation program. If the language seems extreme in its rhetoric, I
 submit that it is no more so than the reality of our situation, which is reflected
 realistically by such facts as that the number of students of English in the Soviet
 Union outnumber American students of Russian by nearly ten million to 28,000.
 Such a one-way conversation with the Soviet Union as would seem to be mandated
 by these figures must be unacceptable to this country.
 But this committee has already heard, I am sure, a wealth of documentation and
 statistics pointing out the fact that the absolute number of students enrolled in the
 study of a foreign language and, perhaps even more significant, the number of such
 students as a percentage of all enrolled students at all levels of our educational
 system, has been declining steadily during the past decade, and I see no real need to
 repeat most of these figures to you today. But such basic facts as that only fifteen
 percent of all United States high school students are today studying a foreign
 language, with only three percent of them continuing beyond the second year; that
 only eight percent of the nation's colleges and universities require a foreign lan-
 guage for admission; and that enrollments in the aptly termed, and often critically
 needed, "uncommonly taught languages" are virtually non-existent, do bear repeat-
 ing, because they are shocking. For a complex of historical, geographical, cultural,
 and economic reasons the study of modern foreign languages has never been an
 organic part of the curriculum at any level of our educational system. America's
 often-cited insularity, certainly insofar as it has been reflected in an unwillingness
 to learn foreign languages, was for the better part of three centuries a historically,
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 geographically, and economically imposed insularity. Human beings, as human
 beings, have never been eager to spend the time and energy needed for other
 essential tasks to work at things which seemed unnecessary. While the peoples of
 nations throughout most of the rest of the world, in close proximity to countries
 whose people spoke other languages than their own, could not escape from the
 earliest times the absolute necessity of learning foreign languages in order to
 function economically, politically, and even socially, no such pressure was felt by
 the people of the United States, for most of whom, until very recent times, the miles
 across an ocean might just as well have been light years. Thus foreign languages,
 like many other desirable but "unessential" parts of the curriculum, remained at
 the periphery of American education, a luxury too often considered as appropriate
 for an educationally and culturally elite, at the very worst a "frill" to be eliminated
 from curricula at the drop of a hat-or a millage. Indeed, in view of these very
 public hearings and the renewed intensity of interest in the teaching and learning
 of foreign languages in this country, it is sad and disheartening, though not unex-
 pected, to note that with the failure of a millage proposal this past summer a large
 school district just northeast of Detroit acted predictably by eliminating at one
 stroke all foreign language programs in the junior high schools.
 But the entire constellation of world affairs has changed, and what did not grow
 as a natural part of our educational programs must now be grafted onto them with
 outside assistance. And because of our past history regarding learning foreign
 languages, we must all work a bit harder at getting foreign languages to be an
 ongoing and accepted part of our curricula.
 Yet there are signs of a new awareness of the increasing need for persons in or
 society with foreign language skills-sadly, perhaps tragically, at a time when the
 available pool of such persons is shrinking. Thus an article last year in Business
 Week cites the Business Council for International Understanding Institute, which
 specializes in cross-cultural indoctrination for families slated for overseas posts, as
 indicating an increase in corporate requests processed for intensive language train-
 ing of families of from 4 percent to 24 percent in two years. More and more United
 States corporations, the article goes on to say, are stressing language skills in the
 people they transfer abroad. Indeed, the same article reports that Citibank corpora-
 tion will no longer allow foreign-bound executives to leave the country for their
 assignments abroad unless they are at least "socially conversant" with the host
 language, according to Hoyle C. Jones, a vice-president in charge of personnel for
 Western Europe. The information and data already available to the Committee
 make the reasons for this new emphasis abundantly clear-economic self-sufficiency
 is no longer a realistic goal for our or any country. It is rapidly being replace by the
 reality of economic interdependence. And the language of a sale abroad is indeed
 the language of the buyer. The importance of a knowledge of the foreign language
 involved goes far beyond question of accurate understanding of technical matters
 and the basic ability to communicate. In his testimony before this committee in
 July, Admiral Bobby R. Inman, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, testifying to
 the vital importance of adequate foreign language capability in the intelligence
 community, makes a statement which applies equally well to any hope of success we
 many have in international trade:
 `The success of our officers overseas depends to a very large extent on intangible
 psychological and human factors, on feelings of trust and confidence, and on person-
 al rapport. Speaking the other person's language plays a critical role in this chemis-
 try."
 Admiral Inman's further testimony can leave no doubt the importance of thor-
 ough foreign language training for the defense and security of our country. Calling
 for "decisive action' by the government to help reverse the trend of the foreign
 language capability of our country, which he calls "poor and growing worse,"
 Admiral Inman goes on to say that he is limited in what he can disclose "about the
 statistical effect declining foreign language ability has had on our operations. Suf-
 fice to say that we have been impacted severely." He testified further that the
 problem has been aggravated by the failure of colleges and universities to mandate
 foreign language requirements.
 Given our interdependent world, it is appropriate that we see today nationally
 and at every level of education a strong movement to broaden our citizens' knowl-
 edge of and sensitivity to that world, in which they must clearly play and increasing
 and increasingly direct role in the future. Clark Kerr, in his introduction to Barbara
 Burns' recently published "Expanding the International Dimenisions of Higher
 Education," puzzles over the problem he sees:
 "It is hard to understand why Americans seem to know or care so little about the
 international dimensions of their lives, when it is so obvious that we share our
 world with men and women of different countries and cultures. Young people are

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 likely to know more about prospects for life on other planets than they do about the
 problems of human survival faced by people in the less developed countries on
 earth."
 Curricular revision towards the goal of developing "global perspectives" in our
 youth, which has been emerging in the past few years, is one positive sign of
 movement in that direction. But one of the problems of international and area
 studies programs in the past has been that too many of them did not contain foreign
 languages as a required component, and I cannot believe that anything approaching
 "global perspectives" can be achieved if the students involved are not studying a
 foreign language, the one uniquely suited vehicle for opening the way to under-
 standing a foreign culture in the broadest and most applicable sense of the term. A
 more general, but not less important indication of the need for foreign language
 study can be seen from the results of a recent study by Eugene Timpe, Chairman of
 the Foreign Language Department at Southern Illinois University, which seems to
 indicate clearly a correlation between foreign language study and high achievement
 on ACT verbal scores, with the most benefit from the study of a foreign language
 apparently accruing to those students who were not in a high school college pre-
 paratory program, who were not in the top quarter of their high school classes, and
 who did not have the highest grade point averages, facts which argue strongly for
 the significant role foreign language study could play in improving the educational
 achievement of all our students, not just an intellectual elite. Finally, while it is
 always difficult to gauge public sentiment in such matters-and because of the
 complexities of our system of education, especially where funding is involved, that
 sentiment is not, I believe, always accurately reflected in existing curricula-it
 would seem that there has perhaps never been more clear recognition of the need
 for and value of increased foreign language study on the part of the people of this
 country. The results of a recent national survey conducted by the University of
 Michigan's Institute for Survey Research and the Center for Applied Linguistics
 show that an overwhelming majority of Americans support the offering of foreign
 languages in elementary schools and junior and senior high schools and are encour-
 aging their children to study a language.
 Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, H.R. 3231 will take a major step
 towards making it possible for our schools and colleges to answer the demands, the
 needs, and the desire for expanded foreign language study I have referred to above,
 for it will encourage foreign language study at all levels, reward innovative and
 imaginative teaching, and provide what must be considered seed money, needed
 desperately in these times of frightening retrenchment in funding for education, to
 create ultimately an atmosphere conducive to the cultivation and growth of foreign
 language programs which, I have no doubt, will then flourish in relative independ-
 ence of federal support monies. It will create also the structure for needed correla-
 tion of programs and cooperation among programs at all levels of education. It is a
 fitting and timely response to the needs reflected in the report of the President's
 Commission, to those needs and expectations expressed in House Concurrent Resolu-
 tion 301, approved by the House and the Senate last November and December as a
 sense of the Congress, and to what appear now to be the wishes of a very large
 segment of our population.
 I would like to offer some comments on specific sections of the bill:
 Section 2. All of our experience and research indicates that foreign language
 learning is easiest, most enjoyable, and most successful when begun with children of
 pre-school through primary school age and reinforced thereafter by continued regu-
 lar study. One of the problems of the FLES (Foreign Language in Elementary
 School) programs, begun auspiciously in the 1960's but now all but extinct, was the
 frustration often caused by lack of continuity in the later school years. This section
 of the bill provides encouragement for the necessary early start in foreign language
 learning and offers incentives for the equally important aspect of reinforcement of
 learned skills through program continuity throughout the high school years. The
 model programs segment is important for the incentive it will lend to the develop-
 ment of creative and imaginative techniques and approaches to foreign language
 teaching.
 Sections 3 and 4. These sections recognize and encourage the role which colleges
 and universities must play in reversing the present deficiencies in our foreign
 language capability as a nation and at the same time require a clear, realistic, and
 welcome institutional commitment to that role at the outset by requiring a reason-
 able percentage of the institutions' total enrollment to be already registered in
 foreign language coursework before funding will be made available. This is as it
 should be, for the institutions themselves should demonstrate their own sense of
 priorities in this respect as well as their own sensitivity to an urgent national need
 before being considered eligible for federal funds.

 In encouraging foreign language requirements by colleges and universities, the
 bill responds appropriately to the Perkins Committee Report opinion that these
 requirements should be reinstated in school, colleges, and universities throughout
 the country. I am aware that there are those in our profession who are not as
 enthusiastic about the reinstatement of such requirements, citing lack of motivation
 and even outright hostility to the learning process in many students who are forced
 against their will into language study. Indeed, we should like nothing more than
 larger numbers of students who come to us fully committed to the study of foreign
 languages and highly motivated to undertake it. And that day may well come,
 especially if contact with and experience of a foreign language is begun regularly in
 the earliest years as a result of such incentives as H.R. 3231 will provide. As with so
 many things, accepted curricula and ideas of adequate education result from accept-
 ed patterns which develop firmly over time, although they never become inflexibly
 unresponsive to a felt need for change. Historically, there has been no real pattern,
 no established tradition of comprehensive foreign language study in our schools on
 which we can rely. If the plant does not grow on its own, then the seeds must be
 resown and cultivated carefully until foreign language is accepted as a normal and
 essential part of education in this country. And if, as I suspect, one of the effects of
 requirements at the college and university levels is to move students to begin their
 study of a language in the lower schools long before they reach college, so much the
 better, for a good early experience will determine their later attitude towards
 foreign languages and make college and university programs more meaningful,
 substantive, efficient, and enjoyable for all.
 Finally, the support provided by the bill for study beyond the second year is
 absolutely essential. Whether we in the profession promised too much under what
 used to be a more or less traditional two-year foreign language requirement, or
 whether our clientele simply expected too much, the discontent of many who stud-
 ied a language for four semesters and then complained that they were unable to
 function adequately in that language is understandable, but, I believe, partly dis-
 torted the degree of effectiveness of the coursework. Most specialists agree that a
 minimum of three to four years of study at the college level in our educational
 system, where students spend perhaps an hour a day in an artificially constructed
 foreign language milieu, only to leave it again almost completely for the remaining
 twenty-three hours, are ngcessary for any degree of proficiency. At the third and
 fourth-year Levels, where enrollments are small and budgets lean, such support as
 this bill provides is indispensable.
 I want to thank you
 for              once again, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommit-
 his important and sorely needed
 tee,    this opportunity to express opinion , on t     p
 legislation. On behalf of Wayne State University and the Association of Depart-
 ments of Foreign Languages, I offer enthusiastic endorsement and support of H.R.
 3231.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. WILLIAM GREENE, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL/INTER-
 CULTURAL EDUCATION, BROWARD COMMUNITY COLLEGE, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA.
 Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, I am William Greene, Director of
 International Education at Broward Community College. Broward Community Col-
 lege is a large, multicampus institution serving the metropolitan Fort Lauderdale,
 Hollywood, and Pompano Beach areas of Southeast Florida. I also serve as the
 Executive Committee Chairman of the Florida Collegiate Consortium for Interna-
 tional/Intercultural Education. This Consortium, comprised of 12 colleges and uni-
 versities in Florida, was created in 1977 for the purpose of encouraging and coordi-
 nating international education efforts among institutions of higher learning in
 Florida.
 Perhaps as much as any state, Florida can serve as an excellent example of why
 an increased emphasis on foreign language and international studies is of critical
 importance to the United States. Several facts can be cited as evidence of the
 increasing international character of Florida:
 More than 40 nations maintain consulates in Florida.
 Florida has established international trade bureaus in Frankfort and Tokyo.
 13 international ports have been established in Florida by the United States
 Customs Bureau.
 Hundreds of international flights operate daily from Florida airports.
 More than 1/2 million non-U.S. citizens currently reside in Florida.
 Direct foreign investment in Florida exceeds 1 billion dollars.
 In 1980, exports from Florida ports exceeded 10 billion dollars while approximate-
 ly $6 billion in imports entered the United States through Florida. This represented
 a 40% increase over 1979.

 In 1980, over 2 million international visitors came to Florida.
 Almost 15,000 foreign students are enrolled in Florida colleges and universities.
 It must also be noted, however, that the rapid internationalization of Florida has
 occurred concurrently with the development of problems unique to the state. The
 recent influx of refugees from the Caribbean into South Florida has created enor-
 mous economic and social problems and has contributed to a backlash against
 anything "foreign." This has served to hamper efforts to promote international
 understanding. At a time when Florida's future is largely tied to international
 developments, growing numbers of Floridians have become resentful of the multi-
 cultural nature of our population.
 It is clear that an increased emphasis on foreign language education and interna-
 tional studies is in the national interest. It is not necessary for me to add to the vast
 and growing body of evidence that supports this premise. Mr. Simon has provided us
 with a powerful statement in his excellent publication, "The Tongue-Tied Ameri-
 can." Our national security, both military and economic, is indeed at stake. It is
 vitally important that schools, colleges, and universities in the United States ac-
 knowledge their responsibility to educate future generations of students to live and
 function effectively in an increasingly interdependent world. The foundation of our
 democratic society requires no less because, for us to survive as a democracy, we
 must have an educated citizenry.
 In view of the current situation, H.R. 3231 can be an important step in helping to
 reverse the serious decline in this nation's foreign language capabilities. Moreover,
 it is entirely appropriate as it addresses the federal responsibility to encourage
 programs and efforts that are in the national interest.
 While the economic incentives provided by H.R. 3231 will undoubtedly encourage
 foreign language study at all levels of education, I think it is important to repeat
 the well-known cliche that "money alone is not enough." Foreign language study
 desperately needs strong support and encouragement from all segments of educa-
 tion. School and college administrators, faculty members, and guidance counselors
 must provide leadership if we are going to reverse the downward trend in foreign
 language enrollments. Academic programs for all majors should be re-examined to
 leave room in the curriculum for foreign languages and international studies. We
 must overcome ignorance and indifference if we are to succeed-but this has always
 been the challenge for education.
 There have been some encouraging developments that can be cited as evidence
 that we may be on the verge of a resurgence of interest in foreign languages.
 Growing numbers of colleges and universities are reinstituting foreign language
 requirements for graduation, and several have adopted or are considering foreign
 language requirements for admission. Many national organizations and associations
 are providing leadership by focusing attention on the seriousness of the problem.
 Regional and national consortia have been formed to promote international studies,
 foreign languages, and study-abroad programs. Community colleges have assumed a
 major role in advocating and developing international education programs. H.R.
 3231 is appropriate in its timeliness as it will complement and encourage these
 efforts.
 H.R. 3231 represents an ambitious beginning. It is important, however, that we
 not lose sight of the overall objective-that of advancing our knowledge of other
 peoples and cultures. Foreign languages are an important tool for increasing global
 awareness, but they should not be viewed as an end product. A recent study
 conducted by the Council on Learning revealed little correlation between language
 proficiency and world knowledge. The study concluded that, among U.S. college
 students, no relationship exists between the level of global understanding and
 proficiency in a modern foreign language.
 This study presents us with a serious dilemma. It documents the lack of interest
 in foreign language study by U.S. college students. But it also reports that while
 large numbers of students have studied a foreign language at some time (most often
 in the ninth and tenth grades), only seven percent of those students surveyed
 possess adequate conversational skills in a foreign language. This unfortunate reali-
 ty raises serious questions about the effectiveness of foreign language instruction in
 our schools and colleges. Many prominent educators and national leaders, as well as
 the President's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies, have
 urged that conversational skills be emphasized in foreign language courses. It is also
 apparent that some integration of foreign language instruction with cultural and
 international studies is desirable. We must do more than just expose increasing
 numbers of students to foreign language courses: We must explore alternative
 approaches to instruction.
 While I am in complete support of the intent of H.R. 3231, I do have some specific
 concerns about the impact it might have on foreign language instruction, especially
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83MOO914ROO2100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 as it relates to community colleges. These institutions are of great importance as
 over half of all entering freshmen in the United States enroll in community col-
 leges.
 (1) H.R. 3231 would certainly lead to increased enrollments in foreign language
 courses, and would provide incentives to train increased numbers of foreign lan-
 guage specialists that are so vital to this nation's future security. At the postsecond-
 ary level, however, the greatest impact would occur at 4-year colleges and universi-
 ties. The 5 percent minimum enrollment figure referred to in Section 3 would
 effectively exclude many community colleges from deriving benefits from the bill.
 (2) The additional incentive for students enrolled in foreign language courses
 beyond the second year does not benefit community colleges.
 (3) While alternative approaches to foreign language instruction are encouraged
 at the elementary and secondary levels, the requirement that a foreign language
 course meet for at least 250 minutes per week might discourage innovative and
 nontraditional instructional approaches at the postsecondary level.
 I would like to offer the following suggestions for expanding the beneficial impact
 of H.R. 3231:
 (1) Community colleges should be treated separately from other postsecondary
 institutions, perhaps by encouraging model programs similar to those being sought
 at the elementary and secondary level.
 (2) The 5 percent enrollment base should be replaced with a formula that rewards
 actual or percentage increases in foreign language enrollments.
 (3) That part of the bill which provides increased assistance for the costs of
 foreign language instruction above the second year should be rewritten so as to
 permit two-year institutions to benefit when offering advanced language courses.
 (4) An additional bonus should be included for students receiving foreign language
 instruction while enrolled in a study-abroad program. This would help institutions
 offset the additional costs of overseas study programs and would lead to increased
 student participation.
 Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation for having been
 given the opportunity of appearing before this subcommittee today. The prospect of
 renewed federal initiatives in the area of international studies and foreign lan-
 guages is exciting. I am optimistic that the schools, colleges, and universities of this
 nation can be enlisted in the effort to improve our global awareness.
 For many years, educators and psychologists have referred to the term IQ as an
 index of intelligence. Perhaps it is time for us to consider a new term that will have
 special relevance for all levels of education, as well as for this nation's prosperty
 and security in the coming decades. We can call this new term IIQ-"International
 Intelligence Quotient." The IIQ of Americans is not very high. We must reverse this
 situation if America is to meet its international responsibilities, if American busi-
 ness is to survive in an increasingly competitive world, and if American citizens are
 to exercise responsibly their rights in a democratic society.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MANUEL A. MENCIA, INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE,
 OFFICE FOR LATIN AMERICAN TRADE, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
 In my capacity as an international representative for the State of Florida Depart-
 ment of Commerce, I have had an opportunity to observe first-hand the detrimental
 effects that the inability of most Americans to communicate effectively in foreign
 languages has had on our balance of trade and our international prestige.
 The overwhelming technical superiority that the United States enjoyed following
 World War II no longer exists, as even the quality of American products, long
 unchallenged, becomes more and more suspect in the eyes of our foreign clients. Yet
 the misconception that "English is the language of business", and thus that lan-
 guage skills and knowledge of foreign cultures are only a secondary consideration in
 the decision-making process of choosing international representatives, remains.
 I believe this cultural myopia has created a self-enacted trade barrier more
 effective than any protective tariff ever established. While our competitors continue
 to succeed in penetrating even our most traditional markets due to their ability to
 adapt their product conditions to the cultural patterns of their target country,
 Americans continue to trasact business, as well as diplomacy, through interpreters.
 Consequently, it is no surprise that we are constantly outmaneuvered by our com-
 petitors in business deals where delicate, on-the-spot negotiations are necessary.
 My area of specialty is Latin America and the Caribbean, and when we talk about
 competition in this area, I am referring not only to our traditional Japanese and
 Western European competitors, but also of Koreans, Brazilians, Taiwanese, etc., who
 are aggressively and successfully penetrating Latin American markets once consid-
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 ered our own backyard. Almost uniformly these competitors outstrip their Ameri-
 can counterparts in the essential language skill resource.
 The feeling in our business community too often has been that language skills
 and cultural awareness can be purchased as needed. In Latin America, where
 personal relationships play such a key role in the conduct of business, I have seen
 many monolingual Americans learn the sad lesson through lost opportunities and
 contracts, that the most important language for business is really the language
 spoken in the country of your potential client.
 That English may be the most frequently spoken language in the business world
 is little consolation to a salesman trying to sell to a potential client in Venezuela
 who speaks only Spanish or to a Brazilian who knows only Portuguese, because
 while you can pass on price information and product specifications through an
 interpreter or printed literature, it is impossible to create the personal rapport so
 necessary to build a proper client-supplier relationship through a third party.
 If you are familiar with the style normally used at the negotiating table, involv-
 ing signals, proposal and counter-proposals, etc., it is easier to conceptualize the
 disadvantage under which an American must compete when relying on an inter-
 preter for accuracy against foreigners who are usually capable of communicating
 quickly with one another.
 The saga of South Florida's international development supports my contention
 that the development of foreign language skills is a hidden asset waiting to be
 tapped by our country and that language promotion is as beneficial to the American
 business community, and in turn to our economy, as is international business
 education or export promotion.
 In 1980, as America continued to lose its position as the principal force in world
 trade, and while our national balance of trade picture was further clouded by a
 $32.3 billion deficit, the State of Florida was generating a $3.8 billion trade surplus
 and increasing the CIF value of its exports to a record $10.34 billion.
 Approximately 70 percent to 75 percent of the total exports of Florida moved
 south to Latin America and the Caribbean. As a matter of fact, the role of Florida,
 and particularly the Miami area, in interamerican trade, has become so prominent
 that in 1980 approximately 30 percent of the total exports of the United States to
 Latin America (except Mexico) proceeded from Miami's Custom District 52.
 There are many valid reasons why South Florida has developed from an area
 generally perceived as tourist-oriented and hostile to industry just a decade ago, into
 a principal center of Latin American trade and finance. No doubt our privileged
 geographic location and port facilities are among the foremost; but there can also be
 no denial that the internationalization that the area experienced in the past two
 decades as a result of a massive Latin American influx, created the conditions for a
 socio-economic milieu conducive to ever-increasing economic exchange with foreign
 countries.
 I believe that the ever-growing, multi-cultural atmosphere that so changed the
 face of Miami, was also instrumental in generating our trade pattern with Latin
 America. Miami's multilingual capability created an ambience which permitted
 visiting Latin entrepreneurs to take full advantage of America's highly efficient
 service industries, of our banks and superior systems of communication and trans-
 portation without the necessity of having to function in an alien language. By
 parlaying a mere language skill, the ability of thousands of South Floridians to
 function both in Spanish and English, the Miami area has been able to attract Latin
 American business in such quantities that today foreign trade is not only our fastest
 growing industry, but also will soon be our largest.
 A different phenomenon that has been occurring in the same Miami area can also
 serve as a microcosm to highlight the difficulties that Americans are facing in alien
 lands. I am referring to the ever-increasing difficulty that English-only speakers are
 having finding jobs in an area where foreign language skills are placed at a
 premium. (Today, one out of every four jobs in the Miami area depends on interna-
 tional trade and tourism.) Often, native Floridians have been forced to relocate to
 other areas due to their inability to compete for jobs where the ability to speak a
 foreign language is a distinct advantage. This is a sad state of affairs, and a poor
 reflection on our educational system, which has done little or nothing to address the
 problem, even in the face of evidence that proves that the study of language and
 international relations is essential due to the ever-growing interdependence of our
 world.
 That is why I consider the passage of Bill H.R. 3231 of the highest importance.
 The bill provides the funding mechanism to help the local school systems and
 universities address this deficiency in our education system.
 If America is to recover its way on the world market, we must develop a new
 generation of American Businessmen who can compete in equality of conditions

 with their counterparts throughout the world. There is no better place to start
 working towards this worthy goal than the school rooms.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM R. FOLKS, JR., PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 My name is William R. Folks, Jr., and I am Program Director of International
 Business at the University of South Carolina. I am most appreciative of the opportu-
 nity to provide testimony regarding House Resolution 3231. In the first part of my
 remarks I would like to provide my general views regarding the importance of
 foreign language education as it relates to business and business education. In my
 view American companies engaged in international business suffer from a crucial
 deficiency: a general inability to communicate in the language and cultural frame of
 reference of foreign customers and clients. Abler individuals than I, including the
 Chairman of this Subcommittee, have so clearly documented this deficiency that it
 would be redundant of me to address this issue today. Rather, I would like to report on
 of an approach to removing this deficiency which would benefit greatly from the
 support engendered by this legislation.
 There are three essential elements in the education of a culturally aware, commu-
 nicating cadre of international business leaders:
 (1) The provision of basic communication skills in at least one foreign language;
 (2) The development of an in-depth understanding of the geographical, cultural,
 political, and economic structure of a country or region;
 (3) The provision of first-rate undergraduate or graduate education in business
 administration, with a particular orientation toward the problems and opportunities
 of the international environment.
 I cannot overemphasize the necessity of linking the three areas of education
 together in order to develop international managers. In particular, foreign language
 training in isolation can only have a limited impact on American international
 economic performance.
 The University of South Carolina has been a leader in the development of entry
 level managers with the requisite international business, language, and cultural
 skills. With 193 students, our Masters in International Business Studies (MIBS)
 degree program is the largest program in international business accredited by the
 American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, and the only accredited
 program to require that each U.S. national demonstrate or acquire capability in a
 language other than English. We currently offer programs in French, German,
 Portuguese, and Spanish, and are introducing new programs in Arabic and Japa-
 nese in June 1982.
 In addition to our language requirement, we also arrange for our students to
 participate in a compensated six month internship program in a country and
 culture which utilizes the language which each has learned. I have attached a list of
 the progressive companies which support our operations to my written testimony.
 In a day where the ultimate test of the viability of a particular mode of education
 is its performance in the marketplace, I can report that the business/cultural/
 language capability combination of our graduates has been well received. Graduates
 of our most recent Class of 1981 report a median starting salary of $25,000, with
 $30,000 as a maximum; parenthetically, only a small number of our graduates had
 any meaningful business experience prior to entering the program.
 The evidence thus suggests that American businesses are indeed interested in the
 development of entry level personnel with language skills. Why, then, is it neces-
 sary to seek governmental support for foreign language education, and, if the case
 for support is made, what form would that support take?
 I believe that the answers to these questions lie first in the present and future
 technology of foreign language education. Currently, instruction in foreign language
 is labor intensive, requiring low ratios of faculty to students to be effective. Further,
 to the extent that there exists a payoff to the addition of capital, in the form of
 laboratory equipment, or computer assisted instruction, an environment of stable or
 declining enrollments creates administrative reluctance to acquire the necessary
 resources. Such reluctance is particularly apparent in the less commonly studied
 languages, and has materially impeded our efforts to develop business and language
 programs in Japanese and Arabic. Enrollment based funding as envisioned in House
 Resolution 3231 would increase significantly the resource base for exploring and
 implementing new creative approaches to language education.
 A second major benefit of enrollment based funding, particularly if coupled with
 funding for universities requiring language instruction for all students, develops
 from the patterns of exposure to the initial foreign language learning experience
 observed in our students. Very few students in our graduate MIBS program obtain

 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 their initial language instruction during our program. Most have some prior back-
 ground in language. We have had great difficulty convincing business undergrad-
 uates who have never studied language to do so for the first time. In my view, an
 earlier exposure to language is vital if we are to overcome this reluctance.
 I of course strongly endorse the approach taken in House Resolution 3231, and
 would only make one or two minor comments on the mechanics of the bill itself. In
 my view it would be more appropriate to provide higher levels of support for the
 skill building language courses (the basic courses and advanced conversation and
 grammar courses) rather than support for the traditionial literature courses normal-
 ly taught at the upper level. The national need addressed by the legislation is the
 lack of trained businessmen and diplomats, a deficiency remedied by building up
 general skills rather than literary ones. Further, I would certainly prefer a realloca-
 tion of rewards to schools concentrating in the less commonly taught languages,
 which would guarantee that funds provided under the legislation would be more
 readily channelled to areas where we are woefully inadequate.
 However, even without these changes, I believe the legislation is worthy of your
 support. Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views, and I would be
 happy to respond to any questions which you might have.

 American businessmen are becoming less dominant in international and multina-
 tional business.
 This is particularly true for lower and middle level managerial positions. Ameri-
 cans have the technical skills and the ability, but are lacking in language skills and
 cultural understanding. Executives from many other countries with equal ability
 and technical skills have a much better understanding of international culture and
 foreign languages which serves them well in business. The conclusion in obvious.
 These positions are increasingly being filled by others.
 American corporations put a good face on this situation "we hire local nationals,
 wherever possible." Their experience is that American executives and their families
 who go abroad are usually not very productive and are expensive. It is a situation
 which can be changed, but only through action.
 The long run implications are also clear. The next generation of top level busi-
 nessmen will be non-American. It is not a particularly encouraging prediction.
 Further, unless actions are taken to encourage the study of language and culture
 such as H.R. 3231, these conditions will continue, and continue to grow to our
 comparative international disadvantage.
 We need a revived effort in the study of foreign language-not only for an
 understanding of language and literature but for international business and our
 important role in it.
 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. CRAIG PHILLIPS, NORTH CAROLINA STATE
 SUPERINTENDENT
 It is ironic that, as our society's need for improved foreign language skills has
 increased, our attention to and emphasis on this matter in our schools has de-
 creased. Our students must be afforded the opportunities to become global citizens
 through foreign language education; ours is a world in which individuals and groups
 are affected by international activity, thinking and communication. Foreign lan-
 guage education is not just preferable, it is essential to the preparation of citizens
 who can function and contribute in the world community.
 Let me share with you some statistics, which, when juxtaposed, provide shocking
 contrasts:
 80 percent of the world's population speaks Chinese, Japanese and Arabic;
 Conversely, only 1 percent of our public school students are enrolled in these
 language courses nationwide;
 One out of six American citizens owes his job to foreign trade; but sadly;
 Americans lose out on one hundred thousands jobs a year because they do not
 know a second language.
 Foreign language study in our schools can no longer be considered a frill. We can
 no longer rationalize our neglect in this area by saying, "English is the number one
 language," or "Foreign languages are not required for college anyway." Our stu-

 dents simply must be equipped to communicate with other people of varying nation-
 alities to understand the problems which the citizens of the world community share.
 Research on foreign language education indicates that:
 Students learn their own and foreign languages best before age 10 (Renfield,
 1971);
 Students enrolled in foreign language courses tend to become more verbal;
 Students who are more verbal score higher on general achievement tests
 (ERIC studies);
 Language proficiency accounts for 50 to 80 percent of the variance on tests of
 all types: IQ, personality, achievement, math and aptitude (Oler et al., 1978).
 Foreign language proficiency means more than higher test scores. Foreign lan-
 guage proficiency means jobs. In North Carolina alone, 1600 businesses operate on
 an international level. Four hundred forty-five of these deal in importing and
 exporting, and 109 foreign companies have established their businesses on North
 Carolina soil. Not only our public school systems, but also our business communities
 must join in the effort to recognize the need for and promote the hiring of employ-
 ees with foreign language proficiency. Business-related jobs, couples with ever in-
 creasing tourism dictate that foreign language education be reaffirmed and reem-
 phasized in our schools. From 1972 to 1981 the number of foreign tourists on
 American soil grew from 13.1 million to 24 million, with an influx of 11.4 million
 from our neighbors in Canada, 3.2 million from Mexico, 1.1 million from Japan, half
 a million from Venezuela, one third million from France, and almost 6 million from
 other nations. The necessity to communicate with people from other nations has
 come to us. It is here; we do not even have to leave North Carolina to feel its
 impact.
 What can we do to prepare our students to live in the world community? There
 are several steps which must be taken:
 First, we must learn from our neighbors in the world community. They take
 foreign language education much more seriously then we do and the results are
 obvious in math, science and industry.
 Second, our secondary schools and institutions of higher learning must adopt a
 more rigorous academic approach which includes increasing the-number of foreign
 language offerings and the number of years thay may be taken. (Did you know that
 only 8 percent of American colleges and universities now require a foreign language
 for admission?)
 Third, more foreign language teachers must be trained.
 Fourth, foreign language education must begin earlier than high school. Our
 elementary school children are eager and receptive.
 National legislation has helped science, math and vocational studies, and it has
 addressed the needs of our "special" exceptional children. House Bill 3231 offers the
 chance to improve foreign language education through the combined use of federal,
 state and local funds. Together, these monies, the concerned educators who adminis-
 ter them, and foreign language teachers will be able to help North Carolina's
 elementary and secondary level students as well as students at the post secondary
 level.
 Foreign language study is no longer the isolated intellectual pursuit of our very
 best students. Foreign language competency is an ever growing essential in our
 daily lives. Together, this bill and North Carolina educators can increase the prepa-
 ration needed for our students to participate in the business, culture, industry and
 knowledge of the world community.
 PREPARED  STATEMENT  OF  PHILIP  STEWART,  CHAIRMAN,  DEPARTMENT OF  ROMANCE
 LANGUAGES, DUKE UNIVERSITY, AND VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF
 TEACHERS OF FRENCH
 Mr. Chairman, Honorable Congressmen, and guests: As H.R. 3231 recognizes,
 nothing less than a national program targeting all age groups is likely to give the
 needed impetus to language learning and move us toward a public attitude that
 naturally assumes and promotes its value, as is the case in many European coun-
 tries. It is well known that children are better language learners than adults, and it
 is to them that language teaching is least available in today's educational picture.
 I would like to direct my remarks, however, to the particular importance of the
 role played by language requirements in the colleges, for its effect is far greater
 than is sometimes realized. Rather than cite statistics on this subject, which have
 already been compiled by the Presidential Commission and other professional and
 governmental agencies, let me devote my brief remarks here to the broad implica-
 tions, as I see them, of this particular issue. As you know, by the late 1960's many of
 the colleges which previously required languages for graduation had weakened or
 eliminated that requirement; and while that trend seems to have halted a few years
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 Approved For Release 2007/11/21 : CIA-RDP83M00914R002100150035-9
 ago, and even reversed, it has not brought the level of language enrollments back to
 where it was: re-instituted requirements are usually not as demanding as were their
 former versions. The consequence has been an unfortunate weakening of language
 offerings in the secondary schools.
 This is, of course, perfectly understandable from the point of view of secondary
 school administration. High school budgets are strained, and their priorities are
 going to be determined, at least in those schools which prepare substantial numbers
 of their students for college, by what the colleges themselves demand by way of
 adequate preparation. If the message seems to be that language training is unessen-
 tial to a college education, then secondary language programs are vulnerable to
 trimming. That is what has happened, not only in terms of total student hours in
 language classes but in terms also of variety of instruction. Relatively few schools
 now offer any Russian or German at all, for instance; and frequently French and
 Spanish offerings are reduced to just two years instead of four or five, or worse yet
 to just one language. By the same token, high school students are not urged by their
 counselors, even those who personally would favor language training, to make sure
 they at least get started in a language or satisfy their language requirement in
 advance of college matriculation.
 In short, the question of college language requirements is a major influence on
 secondary school language offerings and course enrollments. The bill under consid-
 eration quite rightly places great emphasis on the college question, and for reasons
 that thus go well beyond the statistics relating to college-level study alone. There
 are probably very few colleges and universities which now require the two years of
 post-secondary credits which the bill would promote under Sec. 4. (a)(1); a significant
 inducement of this kind should be tried. The provisions of Sec. 3. would even more
 generally encourage colleges to fill their language classrooms, not only by scaling
 the federal support to the enrollment levels, but by augmenting it in function of the
 attainment level of those enrollments.
 The less commonly taught languages are almost exclusively limited to universi-
 ties. Although no one doubts their importance to the national interest, the universi-
 ties, also for financial reasons, have difficulty staffing such courses with their
 predictably low enrollments. In my opinion, the subsidy increment proposed in Sec.
 3(b)(2) would go a long way toward offsetting that burden, and therefore toward
 multiplication of the courses available in such designated languages.
 That is the perspective of a teacher in a college language department. I am
 pleased to be accompanied here today by two colleagues in other schools of my
 university, who can speak to their concerns in domains of their own professional
 competence.
 BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,
 Brooklyn, N. Y., October 5, 1981.
 Hon.  PAUL SIMON,
 U.S. House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR CONGRESSMAN SIMON: I write to express my support for H.R. 3231, the
 Foreign Language Improvement Act, as well as my appreciation for your long-
 standing efforts to increase the study of foreign languages by Americans.
 I am personally aware of the sense of heritage and tradition which the study of
 languages can provide. As the chief administrator of the public school system in the
 world capital of New York City, I am especially cognizant and supportive of the
 need to provide students with the foreign language skills necessary to interact in
 the world community. The New York City Board of Education, at my request,
 recently approved a one-year foreign language study requirement for the high
 school diploma, and curriculum is being developed with which to implement it.
 Although I strongly support the intent of the Foreign Language Improvement
 Act, I must urge that elementary and secondary schools receive a fairer share of the
 Federal funds. The proposed appropriation inordinately favors higher education and
 fails to recognize that programs at both levels are critical in addressing the prob-
 lems which you have identified, offer equally important approaches, and therefore
 deserve equivalent appropriations.
 Foreign language skills are best learned in the critical early years of a child's life.
 But there is much to be done in the classroom if elementary and secondary schools
 are to rebuild once strong foreign language programs. The New York City Public
 Schools might use new program money to create teacher training centers, develop
 coordinators for elementary school programs, and introduce programs in the rarer
 languages in secondary schools.

 FRANK J. MACCHIAROLA, Chancellor.
 Hon. PAUL SIMON,
 Chairman, Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, U.S. House of Representatives,
 Cannon House Office Building, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR CONGRESSMAN SIMON: I would appreciate the following statement being
 entered as testimony in support of H.R. 3231. I had planned to present it during
 your field hearing in San Francisco on September 28th, but the cancellation of that
 meeting has prompted my writing to you.
 My opinions are from the perspective of an educator and a parent: my doctorate is
 in French (I have headed the French program at Cabrillo College in Aptos, Califor-
 nia for nine years) and I am a parent of five children and active in local school and
 city politics.
 As a Community College language instructor, the needs for enhanced language
 ability in our county are apparent. You are well aware of the low percentage of
 high school and college students enrolled in foreign language courses nationwide. In
 Santa Cruz County, there exists a large Spanish-speaking population. We are also a
 County in which tourism plays a great role. And finally a sizeable number of
 Indochinese refugees have settled here recently. How much more humane it would
 be, and how much better for the local economy if social service workers, public
 safety officers, and those in key guest-contact positions in hotels, motels, restau-
 rants, and tourist attractions had received training in the foreign languages and
 cultures of those whom they serve. Legislation such as 3231 might help fund new K-
 12 programs in the foreign languages and cultures, and if such a provision were
 made, might help public Community Colleges such as Cabrillo develop intensive
 workshops for those already in the field but lacking foreign language skills. Cur-
 rently, enrollment growth is not well-funded in the California Community College
 system, and we are in the position of turning away students each semester rather
 than expanding to meet community needs.
 From the perspective of a parent, I would also urge passage of this bill. Public
 School systems, specifically in California but I would assume nationwide, are in a
 very poor financial position. I have worked during the last year and a half on the
 Long Range Planning Committee of the Palo Alto Unified School District in devis-
 ing plans for the coming decades. Even with my experience and strong convictions,
 and in an excellent school district, I have seen little support for even considering
 the inclusion of foreign language classes in elementary schools. Indeed, the trend
 has been one of cutting back on lesser taught languages (such as Latin, German,
 and Japanese) in grades 7-12. The possibility of funding for such curriculum addi-
 tion, might be the one hope here. Three years ago, I arranged for French classes to
 be offered in the elementary school my children attended, before school and with
 parents paying for the program. There was such great parent interest that now
 essentially all fourteen elementary schools in Palo Alto offer one or more for
 languages. But this is still before or after school, and the parents are paying for the
 classes. What a shame that school administrators can't see a way to add foreign
 language to the elementary school curriculum. Even when considering a new middle
 school structure that would add grade 6 to the grade 7 and 8 school now existing,
 administrators appear more concerned with articulation with high school classes,
 than with the possibility of enriching the program for 6th graders. It is in part this
 type of limited approach which has caused us to place our children in private
 schools this year, where foreign languages are part of the daily curriculum from
 kindergarten on. Clearly a need exists for legislation such as yours if the majority of
 our children are to receive foriegn language instruction.
 A third set of comments I would like to make concern teacher training. I would
 hope some provision in your legislation might provide for Workshops to update the
 skills of foreign language teachers. I have been trained by John Rassias at Dart-
 mouth and have assisted in teacher training workshops. I would like to think that
 teachers in new programs which might receive monies from 3231 would have in
 their repertoire some teaching methods which have been proven successful. With
 declining enrollment, the pinch of inflation, and, in California, the effects of Propo-
 sition 13, in-service workshops for teachers are becoming ever more rare. Such a
 provision could help insure more successful implementation of new programs.

 FORD MOTOR CO.,
 FORD INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE OPERATIONS,
 Dearborn, Mich., October 7, 1981.
 Hon. PAUL SIMON,
 House of Representatives, Committee on Education and Labor, Cannon House Office
 Building, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SIMON: Mr. D. E. Petersen has asked me to reply to your letter of
 September 4, 1981, regarding foreign language study in the United States.
 I personally share your concern about the national decline in the study of foreign
 languages and cultures.
 At Ford Motor Company, our basic operating philosophy is to fill management
 positions in our foreign subsidiaries with as many local national employees as
 possible. We assign U.S. and third-country national employees overseas only when
 qualified local nationals cannot be hired or when it is judged to be in the best
 interest of the company. English is the "LINGUA franca' of Ford, but if an
 individual best qualified for a specific foreign assignment does not speak the lan-
 guage of that country, the company arranges for appropriate language training.
 In some countries where Ford does not maintain operating affiliates, the language
 and culture problems cannot be dealt with so easily. This is particularly true of the
 so-called "hard" language areas in Asia, the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. As
 a multinational corporation, Ford employs a number of management-level personnel
 who are native speakers of these "hard" languages and also fluent in English.
 Rarely have we found native-born Americans who possess fluency in these lan-
 guages and who also have management abilities or expertise in some aspect of the
 automative industry. It is precisely this combination of foreign language ability and
 business expertise (as opposed to language fluency alone) that is now needed and
 will be required even more in the future by U.S. companies if they are to compete
 successfully in these markets.
 Incentives for foreign language study seem likely to increase the pool of available
 talent in this country, to the benefit of both U.S.-based corporations and the U.S.
 Government. H.R. 3231, by offering such incentives, must be counted as a major
 step forward toward this goal.
 Thank you for permitting us to comment on the proposed legislation. I hope that
 the Ford experiences and practices in this area will be useful information for you.
 Sincerely,
 JOHN McDOUGALL,
 Executive Vice President.

 Hon. PAUL SIMON,

 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for writing in connection with H.R. 3231, the
 National Security and Economic Growth Through Foreign Language Improvement
 Act.
 Standard Oil Company (Indiana) shares your concern about the quality of foreign
 language education in this country. Our company is involved worldwide in well over
 forty countries and depends greatly on the goodwill of those countries. Much of that
 goodwill derives from our ability to communicate effectively with the host govern-
 ments and nationals of these countries. Needless to say, language plays a major role
 in that process.
 In talking with our people I find that they feel most strongly about part 3 of your
 bill (on page 2) which states that foreign language is a key tool in understanding the
 "history and culture which influence the perspectives, values, and attitudes of the
 people of other countries." We find this to be particularly true in the Arab world
 where expectations run high and sensitivities are deep. While we have no illusions
 that many of our employees will actually learn Arabic, we do think that exposure to
 the language goes a long way toward familiarizing them with the Islamic heritage

 and civilization. That counts for a great deal and is very important to our business.
 The same holds true for other non-Western parts of the world.
 Closer to home and of particular relevance, Latin American and its generally
 Spanish heritage need concentrated attention. Very special efforts should be made
 in this area, not only for our relations with Central and South America, but for the
 obvious domestic reason that Hispanics will become an increasingly important force
 here at home.
 For all of these reasons, the United States can no longer afford to remain a
 monolinguistic nation, expecting the rest of the world's peoples to adjust to our
 ways. Thus the need for Americans to learn foreign languages is more urgent than
 ever. Toward this end, you will be interested to know that some of our people are
 working with the Illinois Foreign Language Teachers Association in furtherance of
 mutual goals, and that one of our foreign affairs specialists is the keynote speaker
 at the association's October 2 meeting here in Chicago.
 We appreciate your efforts in behalf of a renewed dedication to foreign language
 studies at the elementary and secondary school levels.

 New York, N.Y., September 22, 1981.
 Congressman PAUL SIMON,
 House of Representatives, Committee on Education and Labor, Cannon House Office
 Building, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR CONGRESSMAN SIMON: This is in response to your letter to Mr. Ney dated
 September 4 concerning H.R. 3231. We certainly support this bill and its purposes.
 In our International operation we have often come across the shortcoming that your
 bill is attempting to correct: the inability of citizens of the United States to speak
 foreign languages.
 The only addition to your excellent bill that we would suggest is for continuing
 education. We do believe in the purpose of your bill which, as we understand it, is to
 increase the teaching of foreign languages in secondary schools and colleges.
 However, there are a vast number of Americans who have graduated from college
 and cannot speak foreign languages. Many of them are in business. Many of them
 would benefit from language training, even though they have completed their
 formal education. We realize this would change your bill somewhat but we do think
 it's important not to write off that large number of U.S. citizens now in business
 who have completed their formal education and who would benefit from such a
 program. We think obviously that the country itself would be the ultimate benefici-
 ary.
 We thank you for asking our judgments and wish you great good luck with the
 bill.

 DEAR CONGRESSMAN  SIMON: I applaud your attempt to reverse the decline in
 language studies in the United States.
 The ineptitude of Americans (including me) in foreign languages is an embarrass-
 ment for our country. It contributes to our image of arrogance.
 Ogilvy & Mather has offices in 34 countries, most of which are non-English
 speaking. Many of our people express wishes to work in other lands, little realizing
 that fluency in the local language is a requirement-an example of arrogance.
 Actually, our shortcomings in language ability have not affected our operations
 all that much, since we think it wise to have our offices largely staffed by nationals.
 But that it neither here nor there. As a country, we must become more proficient in
 foreign languages.

 Congressman PAUL SIMON,

 DEAR CONGRESSMAN SIMON: Thank you very much for your letter of September 4
 addressed to Mr. Clifford Goldsmith. You have hit upon an issue close to our hearts.
 The lack of language training of Americans is a broad social issue, but one whose
 impact is dramatic in the international business sector.
 Our international operating company is our nation's largest consumer goods
 exporter. There are several factors which inhibit us from using as many Americans
 abroad as we would like. Among these are tax disincentives and the cultural and
 language deficiencies of Americans. Certainly, your point that language training
 deficiencies have severe security implications for the nation is well taken. From our
 perspective, it has at least equally severe economic ramifications.
 Language trained, culturally attuned to the rest of the world Americans is a most
 scare resource. It need not be that way; it should not be that way.
 Please be assured you have our wholehearted endorsement of the premise of your
 bill, and do not hesitate to let us know what we can do to be of assistance to you in
 this area.
 Sincerely yours,
 ANDREW WHIST,
 Vice President, Corporate Affairs.

 Hon. PAUL SIMON,
 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education and Labor, Subcommittee on
 Postsecondary Education, Cannon House Office Building, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SIMON: Mr. Bernbach has asked me, as International Creative Director
 of Doyle Dane Bernbach, to respond to your letter.
 I agree completely that Americans doing buisness abroad are significantly disad-
 vantaged by poor and insufficient training in foreign languages. There is always a
 subtle, but distinct, loss of the "upper hand" when one cannot make oneself under-
 stood.
 My personal feeling is that the quality of foreign language instruction is even
 more important than the quantity. While your bill is extremely worthwhile in its
 purpose, I feel that it could be enhanced dramatically by building in a number of
 quality guarantees.
 For example, the bill could require:
 1. Native instructors in the foreign language.
 2. Classes conducted strictly in the foreign language.
 3. Some required period of time in the foreign country.
 4. A comprehensive final examination leading to a special degree (Bachelor of
 Language, Master of Language).
 5. An exchange program with leading universities in other countries.
 6. Grants to major professional organizations (American Bar Association, Ameri-
 can Medical Association, The Association of American Advertising Agencies, etc.) to
 provide special, professional foreign language training.
 7. Similar inducements to Diplomatic and military personnel, If they do not
 already exist.
 8. Foreign language programs that model themselves after the most successful
 commercial programs.
 9. Cable TV channels to provide foreign language instruction.
 Finally, I think we have to understand that the reason most Americans have not
 mastered a foreign language is that it has not been necessary or even useful for us
 do so. Worse, we consider it a flaw if others don't speak our language. ("What's the
 matter with you? Don't you speak English?")

 DEAR MR. SIMON: This is in response to your letter of 4 September 1981 to S.N.
 McDonnell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of McDonnell Douglas Corpora-
 tion, requesting comments on H.R. 3231. Mr. McDonnell appreciates your referring
 this matter to him, and he has asked me to respond in my capacity as Corporate
 Vice President-Personnel.
 We agree that a significant increase in foreign language instruction within the
 educational institution would benefit both the public and private sectors of our
 nation.
 It is our recommendation that H.R. 3231 be modified to stress the features which
 will increase the number of individuals studying a foreign language rather than the
 funding for the development of new model programs. With this thought in mind, it
 is recommended that the changes noted on the attached copy of H.R. 3231 be
 incorporated.
 We congratulate you on your investigation of this serious national problem.
 Please let me know if we can be of further assistance in review of this bill or in any
 other way.

 Please rest assured you do have our company's complete support. As an interna-

 language training in our U.S. educational system. In fact, we believe this is one of
 the several reasons why the U.S. is falling behind other countries in international
 trade.
 Our only suggestion to you would be to increase the appropriation, if at all
 possible, particuarly at the secondary school level. Eighty million dollars strikes us
 as being a case of too little, too late.
 Good luck. Please continue the fight.
