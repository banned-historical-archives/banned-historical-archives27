 CARRY OUT THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
 Announcement No. 27 of the Provisional Central Government of the Soviet
 Republic of China
 1 September 1933
 [Text]  In order to eliminate the remnant feudal forces, the Central Govern-
 ment promulgated the Land Investigation Directive and called a mass meeting
 in June, appealing to the masses to rise up and firmly launch the land in-
 vestigation movement in all rural areas.   In the past several years, great
 achievements have been made.  Nevertheless, many areas have not launched
 the movement.  In some areas, people either protect the landlords and rich
 peasants, encroach upon the middle peasants, fail to hold mass meetings or
 make propaganda, confiscate without the approval of the masses, fail to
 distribute the confiscated articles to the masses, or fail to be firm in
 suppressing the counterrevolution.   These are grave errors.   In order to
 eliminate the feudal remnants promptly and enable the middle and poor peasants
 and the worker masses to receive all the benefits of the land revolution, the
 Central Government now makes this announcement to the governments of all
 areas and the broad worker-peasant masses, asking all of them to rise up and
 support the order of the Central Government and, under the following methods,
 pursue a firm class struggle and strive for the complete success of the land
 investigation movement.
 (1)   The governments and land investigation committees of all areas must
 closely tackle the leadership of the land investigation and activate the
 labor unions, poor peasants' leagues and all mass organizations to soundly
 prosecute the land investigation movement.   They must first make extensive
 propaganda to the masses, so that everyone understands the significance of
 the movement and personally takes part in the land and class investigations.
 (2)   Land investigation is not land division.  And class investigation is not
 an investigation of the middle peasants, poor peasants and farm laborers.
 Therefore, it must not be carried out household by household, farm by farm,
 or by staking, but by activating all the revolutionary masses and concen-
 trating on investigating the landlords and rich peasants.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (3)   Because the poor peasants' league is the central force of the land in-
 vestigation movement, it must be vigorously developed.  Any and every poor
 peasant may join the league without requirement of sponsorship.  All rural
 workers should join it so that they will lead the land investigation strug-
 gle.   The middle peasants may attend the meetings of the poor peasants'
 league as observers.
 (4)   The interests of the middle peasants absolutely must not be encroached
 upon.   The middle peasants must not be mistaken for rich peasants.   In re-
 gard to some well-to-do middle peasant elements, although they might have
 been guilty of some slight exploitation in the past, they must not be re-
 garded as rich peasants.  All the middle peasant masses must rally around
 the poor peasants and together attack the landlords and rich peasants.
 (5)   The rich peasants rely on their own labor and exploitation for their
 livelihood.   Therefore, they can only be allocated inferior land, and they
 must not be regarded as middle peasants.  Nor must they be regarded as
 landlords.   Confiscation of all their assets is wrong.
 (6)   The landlords perform either no, or only incidental, labor.  They be-
 long to the feudal exploiting class, and all their land and assets must be
 confiscated.   The able-bodied among them must be organized into a labor
 team, given training and made to take part in state or local labor work.
 (7)   After confiscation, the assets of the landlord class, except cash, must
 be promptly distributed to the impoverished masses of the particular village.
 Besides reserving the public enterprise field, the confiscated land must be
 promptly divided among the masses.
 (8)   In regard to the landlord and rich peasant elements and those guilty
 of corruption and decadence, negative slowdown, commandism and coercion and
 sheltering the landlord and rich peasants who have infiltrated the soviet,
 the worker-peasant masses must, under the leadership of the worker-peasant
 procurators' department, struggle against them, rectifying those committing
 minor mistakes. and purging those guilty of grave errors, in order to con-
 solidate the soviet political power.
 (9)  All those participating in counterrevolutionary activities must receive
 severe suppression and those guilty of major crimes must be executed by
 shooting.   The worker-peasant masses must successfully coordinate with the
 security bureau and judicial department of the soviet and thoroughly elimi-
 nate the counterrevolution.
 (10)   The work of the land investigation movement should be concretely co-
 ordinated with the expansion of the Red Army, reinforcement of the Red Guard
 and Young Pioneers, sale of economic construction bonds, development of the
 cooperative, promotion of agriculture and industry, development of import
 and export trade, total enforcement of the labor law, development of the
 Lenin school and literacy movement, repair of bridges and roads and launch-
 ing of the Soviet election movement.   All the broad worker-peasant masses

 must, under the leadership of the local soviet and with one mind and a
 unanimous effort, perform all necessary tasks, in order to smash promptly
 the fifth "encirclement and suppression" of the imperialist Kuomintang and
 strive for the victory of the revolution throughout the whole of China.

 THIS YEAR'S ELECTION
 Report at the Election Movement Meeting of the 18 Southern Counties
 6 September 1933
 [Text] Comrades, the election meeting of the 18 northern counties has been
 held.   Today, we hold the election meeting of the 18.southern counties.
 Comrades, we hold elections every year.   Is there any difference between
 the election this year and that of the last?  Yes, there is a great differ-
 ence.                      The election this year will result in a more consolidated Soviet--
 the most important class weapon.  We will use this weapon to further improve
 the welfare of the masses, smash the enemy's new "encirclement and suppres-
 sion," resist the imperialist policy of dividing up China like a melon and
 expand the soviet movement throughout the nation.  Comrades, this is the
 significance of the election this year.  My report is to explain this sig-
 nificance.   I will discuss it in several sections.
 (1)   This year's election is at a time when we have smashed the enemy's
 fourth "encirclement and suppression" and continue to strive for victory
 over its fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 From last year until the time of the victory of the battle of Tung-huang-p'o,
 the fourth enemy "encirclement and suppression" was completely smashed.  We
 have expanded the Red Army, consolidated and developed the Soviet areas and
 led and helped the nationwide great revolutionary struggles against imperial-
 ism, the Kuomintang and the landlords and capitalists.   The victories of the
 revolution have been greater than any previous year.  What about the counter-
 revolution?                            They are weaker than ever before.   The counterrevolution, however,
 is still waging a desperate struggle, especially imperialism.   Confronted by
 imminent world revolution and war, the imperialists are desperately invading
 China.   Japan has already established Manchukuo under its artillery and plans
 to form a nation of Mongolia.'  England wants to set up a nation of Tibet in
 west China.   France invades Yunnan and Kweichow.   America hopes to divide up
 the Yangtze provinces.   All these imperialists are directing their running
 dog, the Kuomintang, to turn China into a colony, and the imperialist Kuomin-
 tang is carrying out its fifth large-scale "encirclement and suppression"
 against us.   Our current task is to smash the fifth "encirclement and sup-
 pression" with a gigantic effort and resist the imperialist diyision of China.

 Revolution and war of a larger scale are spread before our eyes.   The Soviet
 under the leadership of the Communist Party is the organizer and leader of
 the revolution and war.  The Soviet election this year is at the time of
 smashing the fifth "encirclement and suppression."  We must elect a powerful
 Soviet to organize and guide the war.  This is the momentous significance of
 this year's election.  This is also the year when the Second All-Soviet Con-
 gress will be convened, and a new Central Government, the organizer and leader
 of the revolution and war on a national scale, elected.  To enable the Second
 All-Soviet Congress to shoulder its great historical mission, the election
 this year cannot be regarded as an ordinary one.
 (2)   In order to understand the importance of the election, we must explain
 the functions of the soviet.
 There are two aspects in the functions of the Soviet, which is a worker-
 peasant democratic dictatorship, and both aspects are completely contrary
 to the government of the old ruling class.  First, the Soviet of worker-
 peasant democratic dictatorship is a weapon to hit the counterrevolution.
 It eliminates the external counterrevolution by means of war--our resistance
 to the enemey "encirclement and suppression" in the past and at present, our
 victorious attacks, and our task to prosecute a revolutionary war against all
 the counter-revolutionary forces in the nation.  Meanwhile, the Soviet sup-
 presses the internal counterrevolution by means of the court--our handling,
 in the past and at present, of the AB League, the Reorganization Faction,
 the Social Democratic Party, the Trotskyites and all the landlords and capi-
 talists in the soviet areas.   The moment they perform any counterrevolutionary
 activity, we immediately suppress them.  The revolutionary class--the toiling
 worker-peasant masses--handles internal and external counterrevolution with
 the  Soviet as the weapon.   This is the first function of the Soviet.   Only
 when all the counterrevolutions are overcome will our class become the ruling
 class and our political power the ruling political power.   As you can all
 see, we are in control today because we have overcome innumerable enemy
 attacks and suppressed the counterrevolutionary activities all along.
 Now we will discuss the second function.  The Soviet of worker-peasant demo-
 cratic dictatorship is a tool for the masses to manage their own lives.  The
 lives of our worker-peasant masses were entirely managed by the landlords and
 bourgeoisie in the past.   Because they possessed political power, they enjoyed
 freedom, while withholding freedom from us.   The peasants had no land.   The
 workers had no labor law for their protection.  What about today?  The peasants
 have land, and the workers enjoy the protection of the labor law.  Our own
 political power gives us freedom, and we promote all kinds of necessary con-
 struction under our own political power.  We completely manage our own lives.
 We are truly free and equal, without interference from any landlord or capi-
 talist, while we enforce dictatorship over the landlords and capitalists,
 excluding them from participation in our political power.  We formulate all
 kinds of laws to control them, giving them no political freedom at all.   This
 is the function of the Soviet in the second aspect.

 All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing
 political power and consolidating it, while the desperate struggle of the
 counterrevolutionaries against the revolutionary forces is solely for the
 purpose of defending their political power.   The worker-peasant masses in
 the Soviet areas have already seized political power.  We must defend and
 develop it so that it can fulfill the momentous functions of hitting internal
 and external counterrevolutionary forces and improving the living condition
 and welfare of the workers and peasants.  We must elect large groups of the
 most advanced and most positive elements, with the greatest awareness, into
 the Soviet, and eliminate unsatisfactory elements among the existing per-
 sonnel.   This is important.
 Many people do not understand clearly the solemn significance of political
 power and elections.   If. they do not understand the functions of the Soviet,
 they will not participate in the election in a positive manner.  When the
 Soviet personnel do not understand them, they will not guide the election
 successfully.   Comrades, the election will soon be held.   To spread the
 effect of the Soviet and the election among the masses, Soviet personnel
 must first understand it clearly.  Only then will the election this year be
 successful.  Only then will we mobilize unanimously and struggle for the
 building of a powerful Soviet of worker-peasant democratic dictatorship!
 (3)   There are the favorable conditions in the election this year.
 We are at the most critical point of the revolution and war, while the effect
 of the Soviet and its election is momentous.   Can the task be accomplished
 in the election this year?  Our answer is, Yes, because we have many-favor-
 able conditions.  First, although the scale of the fifth enemy "encircle-
 ment and suppression" is very large, we already have initial successes.   In
 the past 2 months, we won three successive big battles.  We captured Lien-
 deleted and defeated the 19th Route Army in the first battle.  We took Wu-
 chiang and routed the 80th Division in the second battle.  We laid siege
 to Yen-p'ing and repelled enemy reenforcements in the third battle.  Over
 6,000 weapons were captured.  We will hold the election during the great
 victories of the Red Army.
 Second, the election this year will cover a wider area because we have
 greatly expanded the Soviet territory by smashing the fourth "encirclement
 and suppression."  We will hold elections this year in 10 soviet provinces--
 Kiangsi, Fukien, Kwangtung-Kiangsi, Fukien-Kiangsi, Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi,
 Hunan-Kiangsi, Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi, Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei, Hunan-Hupeh-deleted
 and Szechwan.   The scale of the election will be bigger.
 Third, in many Soviet provinces, the rural urban class struggles are more
 intensive this year than last year.  Many achievements have been made in the
 land investigation movement, the enforcement of the labor law, culture and
 education and economic construction.   Especially in the land investigation
 movement, many hidden landlords and rich peasants have been uncovered and
 their right to vote deprived.   Undesirables concerned in the Soviet organs

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 have been purged in large groups.   All these constitute the foundation for
 a more successful election this year.
 Fourth, we possess experiences of past elections, especially last year, which
 are valuable lessons for the election this year.  We must continue with the
 good achievements of past elections and bring them to a greater light, but
 we must avoid and discard the defects and errors and guard against their
 repetition.    The Central Government has made a correct summary in its
 directive and clarified the achievements and the errors of past elections.
 The comrades must study them carefully, and each and every Soviet work com-
 rade must do likewise and explain them clearly to the voting masses.   Only
 when the lessons of the past are correctly understood will the election this
 time become even more successful.
 (4)  How to guide the election this year.
 Comrades, as we know that the election this year is at the time when the
 imperialist Kuomintang divides up China and carries out the fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression," the political task of the election has been greatly
 increased.  Because we also know the great revolutionary effect of the Soviet,
 while the election will be held under many favorable conditions, we must
 properly guide the election and strive for its complete success with a mighty
 effort.   In regard to the principle and methods of election, the Central
 Government has made them very clear in the Election Law and Election Directive,
 and I will not repeat them item by item.   Today, I wish only to bring several
 important issues to the comrades' attention.  These are the propaganda and
 agitation of the election, basic election, voter registration, work reporting,
 election units,, candidates' lists, voters' mass meeting and the duties of the
 election committee.   Let me present a simple explanation of these issues,
 because they are extremely important and require the attention of each and
 every comrade.
 The first issue concerns the propaganda of the election.   For the election
 this year, we must perform the most extensive propaganda in the 3 weeks be-
 fore the election, explaining the relationship between smashing the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression" and resisting the imperialist division of
 China and the election this year, the revolutionary functions of the Soviet,
 and the fact that the election is held on the foundation of victory.   Then
 the masses will regard the election as something vital, participate in it
 with full confidence and elect many advanced elements to the Soviet.  Those
 elected will undertake the affairs of the state with courage.   Such propa-
 ganda and agitation are the prerequisites of a successful election.                      With-
 out them, the masses will not understand the current political situation, the
 functions of the Soviet and the foundation of victory of the election.   Then,
 they will not enthusiastically participate in the election, nor will the
 elected increase their courage.   The propaganda for the first election last
 year was relatively good.   Therefore, the achievement was also relatively
 good.  The propaganda for the second election was inferior.  Therefore, the
 achievement was also inferior.   This year, the election propaganda must sur-
 pass that of the first election last year in order to encourage the greater
 majority of the masses to participate in it.

 Second, the urban and rural congresses are the basic organizations of the
 Soviet.   Therefore, their election is the Soviet's basic election.   The urban
 and rural soviets are the level closest to the masses.   All decrees and
 policies of the higher level soviet and all tasks of expanding the Red Army,
 land investigation movement, the labor law, economic construction and cul-
 tural construction must go through them before practical implementation.   The
 election of the urban and rural soviets is, therefore, the most basic and
 important election.  Moreover, a successful all-Soviet congress will require
 good representatives from the provincial soviet congresses.  A successful
 provincial soviet congress will require good representatives from the county
 soviet congresses.   A successful county soviet congress will require good
 representatives from the district and town soviet congresses.
 What is required for a successful district soviet congress?  It will require
 good representatives from the township soviet congresses.  The election of
 the town and township soviets is linked with the entire Soviet election of
 the district, county, province and nation.   That is why the election of the
 town and township soviets is the most basic and most vital.  Comrades, a Red
 Army patriots' memorial tower is being erected along the side of our meeting
 ground.   The tower has a 15-foot rock foundation.   To build a strong tower,
 we must begin with a strong foundation.   To build a strong Soviet, we must
 also begin with a strong foundation, which is the urban and rural soviet
 congresses.
 Third, to build firm urban and rural soviets, not only must we make the most
 propaganda to get the greater majority of the masses to come to the election
 meetings, but we must be sure that all the voters coming to the meetings are
 genuine workers, peasants and others entitled to vote and that no person who
 has been deprived of his voting right infiltrates the meetings and that no
 person who should have his voting right deprived misrepresents himself as a
 worker or peasant.  This task is called voter registration.  The strict demar-
 cation between those with and those without the voting right is the basic
 starting point of the Soviet political power and the most important item in
 the Soviet constitution and election law.   Look.   Isn't the tower foundation
 made of stones?    The  tower is, therefore, firm.   If some dirt and manure
 are mixed in it, the tower will not be so firm.   If we want to build a firm
 Soviet, we must start by guarding against any landlord, rich peasant, or
 capitalist stealing the voting right.
 Fourth, the election unit last year was too big.    This year, it is reduced.
 Article 11 of the Election Law provides that the workers will hold a separate
 election meeting, the peasants will use the village as the unit and the urban
 poor will elect according to the neighborhoods.  This change has a close con-
 nection with the complete success of the election, because when the election
 unit is small, it will not only enable most or all of the voters to come to
 the election meeting, but make it easier for the voters to select among the
 candidates, improve the quality and quantity of the voters' proposals and
 facilitate the exercise of. the recall rights in the future.   Therefore, the
 comrades must refrain from making the election unit any larger.

 Fifth, 'in regard to the work reports to the voters by the town and township
 soviets, the Central Internal Affairs Department has drafted an outline.
 The district soviet must guide the township soviets to call mass meetings
 in the various villages and make reports, according to the outline.   In the
 election last year, many areas did not follow the report system.   This year,
 it must be followed, because, by reporting to the masses, government work
 will have a chance to undergo mass inspection, and the enthusiasm of the
 voters will reach a higher pitch.  The governments of the district level and
 above must make work reports when the lower level governments hold their
 congresses.
 Sixth, in regard to the list of candidates, its proper preparation is an
 important link for the success of the election.  As stated in the directive
 of the Central, the opinions of the masses on the candidates must be collected
 before the election and published, so that the voters will be able to give
 full consideration to the candidates.  Primary attention must be given to the
 components of the candidates' list.  Not only the proper numbers of workers
 and peasants must be elected according to the Election Law, but at least 25
 percent of the elected must be laboring women, in accordance with the Election
 Directive.   Next, attention must be given to the candidates' political mani-
 festations.   All those guilty of corruption, decadence and negative slowdown
 and all those compromising with the landlords, rich peasants and capitalists
 must not be elected.   All those elected must be positive in their work and
 correct in their concept.   Next, suitable attention must be given to the
 work capacity.   Those whose ability is too inferior must not be elected into
 the government.   Then, among the current Soviet work personnel, such as dele-
 gates, committee members and chairmen, all those who are guilty of grave mis-
 takes such as corruption and decadence, negative slowdown, bureaucraticism
 and sheltering landlords, rich peasants and capitalists and have not reformed,
 must not be reelected.   But those comrades who are positive in work and cor-
 rect in concept may be reelected without question.   It is entirely wrong to
 think that election means electing new people for all the posts and discard-
 ing all the existing personnel.
 The seventh point concerns the election mass meeting.   Election itself re-
 quires only 1 day, but its preparation will take weeks, because the many im-
 portant tasks discussed above must have several weeks for their preparation.
 It is absolutely necessary, therefore, to make the preparations in advance.
 We must not put it off day-after-day and only become busy 2 or 3 days before
 the election.   Now the 18 northern counties have scheduled 1 September to
 5 October as the period for urban and rural elections.   The various districts
 must schedule the election in the last 10 days and devote the several weeks
 before 25 September to the work of election propaganda, voter registration,
 work reports and candidates' lists before full success can be achieved on
 election day.   The 18 southern counties may hold the election a month later,
 at the end of October, and devote the months of September and October to
 preparation.  Next, on election day, the voters must be mobilized to attend
 the meeting.  This year, we must be able to get the greatest majority of the
 voters to come to the election meeting and succeed in completing the election

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 at one meeting. We must avoid having to call a second meeting because of
 the lack of a quorum for the first meeting.   Still next, when the list of
 candidates is proposed at the election meeting for discussion and voting,
 the masses must be activated to express their opinions, similar to the en-
 thusiastic criticisms at the election meeting in Hsing-kuo last year.   The
 masses must not be forced to pass the list of candidates if they do not
 approve of any one of them.  Should there be any evil elements making trouble
 and forcing the masses to pass the candidates' list prepared by them, they
 must be severely punished upon discovery.   Lastly, after the election, the
 proposals of the masses must be discussed and their opinions collected and
 presented to the Soviet to serve as the administrative policy of the new
 government.
 Eighth, the tasks discussed above require a special organ for their handling.
 This is the election committee of the town and district soviets.  According
 to Article 46 of the Election Law, the election committee is formed by the
 representatives of the government and the various mass organizations and
 approved by the county soviet.   It is responsible for all the work of the
 election.  Most of the election committees last year did not produce any
 effect, and the election was directed by government personnel only.  There-
 fore, the election was not carefully guided in many areas.   There were also
 instances of undesirables in the government manipulating the election.   To
 avoid such shortcomings, election committees must be organized this year,
 to be formed by the government and mass organizations.
 Comrades, I said much.  I have discussed the significance of election and
 the important points   of election work.  As for what I have not touched upon
 --that the county soviet must guide all the district soviet congresses of
 the county with plans, that the provincial soviet must guide all the county
 soviet congresses of the province with plans, that the Central must guide all
 the provincial soviet congresses with plans, and individual items concerning
 the election--detailed instructions are given in the Election Law and the
 Election Directive, which I shall not reiterate here.   In regard to the
 important points discussed by me here, I hope the comrades will repeat them
 to the comrades of the county and district soviets and bring them up at the
 presidium meetings for detailed discussion.   Comrades, this year's election
 is not an ordinary one.   It is an election with great historical significance,
 a sharp class struggle.   We must handle it with our full attention.   Besides
 the many tasks connected with the election itself, we must seize the oppor-
 tunity and launch the land investigation and class investigation struggles
 and the Soviet prosecution movement.
 Only through class investigation and the prosecution movement will we uncover
 those stealing the voting right, purge the undesirables infiltrating the
 Soviet and make the election this time more successful.   This is especially
 true with the 18 southern counties, because there are still 2 more months
 for us to proceed with the land investigation movement.   In addition, in areas
 where the administrative divisions have not been defined, they must be prompt-
 ly.   By so doing, we firmly believe that this year's election will be a com-
 plete success.   Currently, the proletariat and oppressed nations of the whole

 world are hoping for the success of China's soviet movement.  And the toiling
 masses of the entire nation are looking for the Soviet banner.   They under-
 stand that only the Soviet can save China.   In these few days, the delegates
 of various nations are holding an anti-imperialist war rally in Shanghai.
 They, likewise, eagerly hope for the success of China's soviet.   Comrades,
 we must respond to all such eager hopes. How do we do so?  We will respond
 to them with the success of the election of all the soviet areas, with our
 Second All-Soviet Congress.
 Our slogans are
 Strive for the complete success of the election!
 Smash the fifth enemy "encirclement and suppression"!
 Resist imperialist division of China!
 Long live Soviet China!

 DECLARATION TO THE TOILING WORKER-PEASANT MASSES OF THE WORLD
 6 September 1933
 [Text]   Dear Brothers, Sisters, Comrades, Friends!
 We are China's workers, peasants, urban and rural poor and revolutionary
 soldiers and intellectuals.  We are unwilling to remain forever the slaves
 of imperialism and domestic landlords and capitalists.  We are creating our
 own new life of freedom.  We are in the process of leading the 450 million
 people of China to wage a struggle of liberation.   On one-sixth of China's
 soil (in many areas in the provinces of Kiangsi, Fukien, Hupeh, Hunan,
 Szechwan, Anhwei, Honan and Shensi), we have, by our own effort, begun to
 create the one and only true people's political power--the Soviet political
 power and the one and only true people's army--the Worker-Peasant Red Army.
 China's Soviet government and Red Army struggle for the fundamental improve-
 ment of the political and economic conditions of China's toiling worker-peasant
 masses.   China's Soviet government and Red Army wish to attain this point
 right from the beginning--to let the workers, peasants, poor people and revo-
 lutionary soldiers and intellectuals do what they want to do freely and de-
 cide on their own destiny.  We want to enable those who are without food,
 clothing, housing and jobs; who are illiterate and live as beasts of burden
 to have food, clothing, housing and jobs; be able to read and to live human
 lives.   In order to achieve this, the Soviet government has given them land,
 houses and jobs; opened many free schools, literacy classes, libraries and
 clubs for the adults and children; and started many free hospitals and sana-
 toriums for the sick and the old.
 Yet, the small group of parasites controlling China--foreign imperialists and
 Chinese warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, capitalists, usurers--are always
 unwilling for us to live a human life.
 Precisely because we have begun to create our own new life of freedom, because
 we only work 8 hours a day at higher wages, because those of us with little
 or no land now have land and because our women have gained liberation, Chiang
 Kai-shek, Wang Ching-wei and all the Kuomintang beasts revile us as "Red
 bandits" and "communists bandits' and continually launch "encirclement and
 suppression" against us.

 When Japanese imperialism wildly slaughtered our compatriots and occupied
 China's Northeast and northern territory province by province, and when
 American, British and French imperialists actively divided China, we de-
 clared to the people and troops of the entire nation, time and again:   The
 imperialists want to divide up China completely.   All the people of China
 must rise up as a man to defend the nation!
 We have openly proposed over and over to all the troops--any troops, as long
 ?
 as they support our three simple conditions--they may sign battle agreements
 with us, in order to arm ourselves and resist Japan and other imperialists,
 defend our national existence and strive for national liberation.  The neces-
 sary conditions to truly organize and arm the people for the sacred national
 defense against Japan and other imperialists are:   (1)   immediately cease
 attacks on Soviet areas; (2) give the people the minimum democratic rights
 --the freedoms of speech, publication, meeting, association, demonstration
 and strike; and (3) permit the people to organize and arm the anti-Japanese
 volunteer army.
 Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Ching-wei and all the Kuomintang traitors always reply
 to us in the same way:  Intensify and expand the cruel attack of the Soviet
 areas!
 The Kuomintang has now begun its sixth '-'.encirclement and suppression" against
 our free Soviet China!  For this "encirclement and suppression," just around
 our central Soviet area alone (Kiangsi, Fukien, Hunan and Kwangtung), over
 442,000 Nanking and Kwangtung troops are assembled.  These troops are equipped
 with new model superior weapons, including artillery, tanks, planes and poison
 gas.
 Where did the Kuomintang warlords and politicians acquire so many new weapons
 and large sums of money for their troops?  They acquired them from the Ameri-
 can, British, Japanese, French and German imperialists.
 These imperialists utilize the weapons manufactured by you and the money
 extracted from you to destroy the people of China who are struggling for
 their own national and social liberation!
 You and we still remember clearly that, not long ago, the troops of England,
 America and Japan shelled our Canton Commune and Ch'ang-sha Soviet, and the
 planes of French bombed our Lung-chou Soviet in Kwangsi!
 In the Kuomintang's sixth "encirclement and suppression," the role of the
 imperialists is clearly revealed.   Besides the 50-million dollars of so-
 called "cotton and wheat loans" and the 40-million dollars of so-called
 "aviation loans" to the Nanking government, American imperialism gave the
 Nanking troops 150 military planes and artillery, tanks, machine guns, chemi-
 cal poisons and ammunition loaded in several dozen ships and sent several
 hundred pilots and all kinds of military and technical experts.   The British
 ambassador to China (Lampson) personally went on an inspection trip to

 Szechwan and gave Liu Hsiang 20 million English pounds to attack our Red 4th
 Army there.   Though the British, American and Japanese imperialists vigorously
 compete against one another in the division of China, they take unanimous
 action against soviet China.   They order their own running dogs--the warlords
 of the Nanking, Kwangtung and northern factions--to conduct a common "en-
 circlement and suppression" of the liberated people of our Soviet areas.   The
 German fascist government sent 70 military experts (including the former
 National Defense Chief (Sai-k'o-t'o)) to Nanking.   Chiang Kai-shek organized
 them into a special unit in the Nan-ch'ang General Headquarters, in order to
 direct the combat activities against the Red Army.   The so-called "Technical
 Committee" sent by the League of Nations to Nanking precisely at this time
 actually is to help Chiang Kai-shek plan and attack China's Soviet and the
 Red Army.
 Brothers, Sisters, Comrades, Friends!
 Look!  The pilots and the military and technical experts of the so-called
 "democratic" America and other nations are, under the direction of Germany's
 fascist generals and China's Kuomintang warlords, carrying out the cruelest
 air and chemical warfare with American, British, French and German planes,
 poison gas, tanks and artillery in the territory of the Soviet China and
 slaughtering large numbers of workers, peasants, soldiers, poor people and
 intellectuals, in order to eliminate the free Chinese Soviet Republic and
 Worker-Peasant Red Army
 Brothers, Sisters, Comrades, Friends!
 In order to defend their own Soviet Republic, thousands and tens of thousands
 of men and women, old and young, did not hesitate to use their own flesh and
 blood, brains and lives to repel courageously the five successive "encircle-
 ment and suppressions" of the Kuomintang, superior in number and weaponry.
 Today, this young Chinese Soviet Republic faces a grave crisis.
 At this critical point, we request you

 ON EDUCATION WORK
 Directive No 17 of Central People's Committee
 15 September 1933
 [Text]   Culture and education occupy an important position in the entire
 soviet movement and constitute an indispensable force in the current mobili-
 zation against the fifth enemy "encirclement and suppression."  Intensifying
 education to raise the political and cultural levels of the broad masses,
 enhance their class awareness and train revolutionary successors is one of
 our major tasks.
 The education work at present apparently lags behind other, soviet work and
 still cannot truly keep pace with the need of the successful development of
 the revolutionary war.   It is due to the many errors and defects in the work
 of the Education Department so far, the neglect of education by some soviet
 organs and responsible comrades, the failure to understand the importance
 of education in the current domestic war, and even the opportunist viewpoint
 that it is impossible to pursue education in an environment of war.   This
 situation must not be allowed to continue.
 The biggest defect of education so far is the lack of a clear policy.   Though
 the issue was mentioned in Directive No 1 of the Central Education Depart-
 ment, it was inadequate and not completely correct.   The Education Department
 has so far, as shown in its work and documents, neglected to build a popular
 free education system.   It has not properly linked popular education with
 social education and developed them.   Instead of placing the task of com-
 munist education in the forefront, it limits education to the realm of the
 bourgeois democratic tasks of opposing feudalism and superstition.  Meanwhile,
 it must also be pointed out that the lack of planning to wipe out illiteracy,
 an extremely important cultural-educational task, and the "leftwing" oppor-
 tunist error on the issue of utilizing bourgeois intellectuals are, so far,
 the big defects of the work of the Education Department.
 While mobilizing for the current revolutionary war, we must establish a free
 popular education system, create revolutionary successors according to the
 communist spirit and spread Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theories.  We
 must completely eliminate in the shortest possible time the most vicious
 legacy left by the evil gentry and landlord bourgeoisie--illiteracy.  We

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 must set up Lenin teachers' schools and all types of cadre training schools,
 cultivate a powerful educators' army that can popularize education and give
 full attention to and organize  the development of social education work such
 as worker-peasant drama associations, blue-shirt leagues, clubs, libraries
 and reading rooms.   These constitute the education policy and central task
 at the present time.
 Besides training large groups of worker-peasant education work cadres, we
 must utilize those bourgeois intellectuals and experts who are willing to
 serve the Soviet.
 Whenever possible, we must educate and give preferential treatment to ele-
 mentary school teachers.  At the very least, we must give government funds
 to the elementary school students for their books and stationary and meals
 to the elementary school teachers.
 The People's Committee is in complete agreement with the Central Education
 Department's suggestion to hold a culture and education rally with the League
 Central Bureau in October.  Without doubt, such a rally will be extremely
 important in the future of the culture and education of the Soviet areas.
 For its complete success, the Central Education Department is charged with
 the responsibility of making full preparations.
 The People's Committee believes that the education work assistance movement
 recently initiated by the League Central Bureau will serve as an effective
 surprise attack on the culture-education front of the Soviet areas and help
 to expedite the elimination of the backward situation of education.
 For the prompt and thorough change in education work and the successful com-
 pletion of the central task of education at the present time, we must ruth-
 lessly struggle against the neglect of education and all the'incorrect con-
 cepts in education work.   Only under such an ideological struggle will the
 culture-education construction of the Soviet areas urgently needed by the
 war be truly developed.   It is so ordered.

 CORRECT COMMANDISM IN SELLING BONDS
 Letter From the Central Government to the Governments of All Levels
 23 September 1933
 [Text] Provincial Soviets of Kiangsi, Fukien, Fukien-Kiangsi and Kwangtung-
 Kiangsi, County Soviet of Jui-chin and Soviet Governments of All Levels:
 Because of the issuance of the economic construction bonds, great achievements
 have been made within a short time.   In all areas where the means of mobili-
 zation is good, the broad masses enthusiastically arose to support the bonds,
 such as Yun-chi District in Jui-chin and Ts'ai-ch'i and Hung-fang districts
 in Fukien, which are all good examples.  In many other areas, nevertheless,
 there has been the grave error of commandist allocation.  The People's Com-
 mittee has issued Directive No 16, an announcement, and propaganda outline
 pointing out that full mobilization is the guarantee of bond selling and
 severely opposing commandism.  In its letter of instruction to the bond com-
 mittees of all levels, the Central People's Finance Committee extended the
 time limit for bond selling to December.  The number of bonds to be sold is
 determined according to the local situation to avoid coercive allocation and
 afford the local areas ample time for mobilization and selling. Since the
 issuance of such instructional documents, methods of selling bonds in all
 areas is changing.
 The change, nevertheless, is extremely inadequate.  Many areas are still
 practicing coercive allocation.  The most serious instance occurred in Lo-
 fang District in Yu-tu, where a middle peasant and the district soviet
 chairman committed suicide due to the coercive allocation of bonds.  The
 400 or more people who fled their homes in Hsiao-ch'i District in Kwangtung-
 Kiangsi were also connected with coercive allocation.  These were shameful
 incidents which should never have occurred.  Yet, they did.  Upon hearing
 the news, the Central sent men to investigate and will severely punish the
 Yu-tu county soviet.  When this letter is received, the provincial soviets
 must immediately instruct the county soviets to inspect the mobilization
 method of bond selling in the districts and townships. They must warn the
 soviet personnel with the example of Yu-tu, immediately launch a campaign of
 intense self-criticism, concentrate the firepower against coercive commandism

 in all work and never resort to it whether in expanding the Red Army, the
 land investigation movement, the election movement, the sale of bonds, or
 the development of cooperatives.  Yu-tu's commandist error has occurred
 seriously in its work in all aspects, but more apparent*in the sale of
 bonds.  The lessons of Lo-fang and Hsiao-ch'i districts also serve as the
 gravest warnings to the soviets of all levels.
 In order to complete the sale of bonds successfully, attention must be given
 to the time and amount.  In the competition agreements of the various areas,
 many of them have set mid-October as the deadline.  It is too short.  They
 must follow the 15 September instruction of the People's Finance Committee
 and appropriately extend the time limit.  In areas where the harvest or
 bond selling is late, it may be extended to mid-December for the final com-
 pletion of sale, in order to afford them sufficient time for mobilization work.
 They must not, however, follow the example of Hui-ch'ang and other areas
 that put bond selling aside, wait for an extension, become slack on the
 performance of the work and try to reach the goal by coercive allocation
 in December.   This is absolutely not permitted.   In regard to the amount,
 it depends entirely on the practical local situation and the extent of the
 mass positivity.   There may be increases and reductions.  There must be no
 mechanical allocation.  The county and district soviets must increase or
 decrease the amounts of bonds according to the different situations of the
 various counties and district, in order to adapt to the local conditions.
 They must not issue the bonds all at one time and consider their tasks as
 ended, thus forcing the lower level to the path of coercive allocation.  This
 bureaucratic pattern must be immediately rectified.

 ORDER NO 49 OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF THE
 SOVIET REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 [Text] (1)  The decision of this committee on 10 October 1933 on certain
 issues in the land struggle is hereby published.
 (2)  All the class classifications prior to 10 October 1933 in the various
 areas which are incompatible with this decision must be revised accordingly.
 In regard to those who, due to the change in their class classifications,
 should have their land and assets handled differently.  Concerning the land,
 houses, woods, ponds and gardens belonging to the middle peasants, poor
 peasants, poor people and workers which have been divided, a means must be
 found to return them to the original owners.  As for assets other than land,
 houses, woods, ponds and gardens, they should be returned to the original
 owners only when possible (for instance, if there are still landlord assets
 in the local area which can be confiscated).  Concerning the land, houses,
 woods, ponds, gardens, draft animals and farm tools to which the rich peas-
 ants are entitled, and the assets to which the capitalists are entitled, they
 are returned to the original owners only when possible.
 (3)  In regard to the cases decided by the judicial organs of the various
 areas prior to 10 October 1933, where the judgments have been carried out,
 they will not be changed.  Where they have not been carried out, or are in
 the process of being carried out, they must be revised according to this
 decision.
 (4)  In regard to the class classifications or the disposal of land and
 assets according to such class classifications prior to and after 10 October
 1933 which are compatible with this decision and not erroneous, no one may
 request a change.

 DECISION ON CERTAIN ISSUES IN THE LAND STRUGGLE
 Passed by the People's Committee
 10 October 1933
 [Text]  In the struggle of land division and land investigation, many prac-
 tical issues arose.   Such issues were a result of lack of provision in
 previous documents, ambiguity in the provisions, or incorrect interpretation
 on the part of soviet personnel.  To rectify and prevent errors, the People's
 Committee, besides approving the principles of analyzing the landlords, rich
 peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants and workers in ""How To Analyze the
 Classes," hereby makes the following decision:
 Under ordinary conditions, if one member in the family spent one-third of
 his time a year on major work, it is called labor.  If it was less than one-
 third of his time, or if it was not devoted to major work, even though it
 involved one-third of his time, it is called incidental labor.
 Attention must be given to the following:
 (1)  The rich peasants  performed their own labor, and the landlords performed
 either no, or only incidental, labor.   Labor is, therefore, the major cri-
 terion to distinguish rich peasants and landlords.
 (2)  One person is the criterion to determine labor for a household.  Where
 there were several members in a household, if one of them labored, the house-
 hold is considered as performing labor.   Some people feel that only when two
 members, or the entire household, performed labor can the household be con-
 sidered as performing labor.  This is not correct.
 (3)  The criterion to determine the time spent on labor is one-third of the
 year, i.e., 4 months.  Performing major labor for 4 full months, or less
 than 4 full months, is the dividing line between labor and incidental labor
 (the dividing line between rich peasants and landlords).  It is erroneous
 for some people to consider performing major labor for 6 months out of the
 year as incidental labor.

 (4)  Major labor indicates labor in the major tasks of production, such as
 plowing, planting, harvesting and other important production labor.  How-
 ever, labor is not limited to agricultural production.   Firewood chopping,
 porterage and other important tasks are all considered major labor.
 (5)  Non-major labor refers to all kinds of supplementary labor, occupying
 a secondary position in production, such as assisting in weeding, assisting
 in vegetable planting, looking after draft animals, etc.
 (6)  Labor is the main criterion used to distinguish the rich peasants and
 landlords.  Those who only hired permanent help to cultivate the land, did
 not exploit by land rents or loan interests, were responsible for directing
 their own production, but did not personally perform major labor are still
 considered landlords snd will not receive land allocations.
 (7)  The time element for the landlord classification is computed backward
 from the time of the uprising.. Those who lived as landlords for 3 years or
 more are considered landlords.  Many errors have occurred on the issue of
 labor and incidental labor in the land investigation movement.  Major labor
 was called incidental labor and people were misclassified as landlords.  Or,
 incidental labor was mistaken for major labor and the people misclassified
 as rich peasants.  This came from the lack of a clear criterion between
 landlords and rich peasants.  According to. the above provisions, such errors
 can be avoided.
 The above provisions, nevertheless, are only "under ordinary conditions."
 Under special conditions, different handling is required.  If one member of
 a household exploited by collecting large sums of land rent or loan interest,
 such as collecting 100 tan or more of land rent or lending 1,000 yuan or
 more in large currency, and the members in the household were not numerous
 nor the expenses high, even if someone in the household performed 4 or more
 months of major labor in a year, it is still considered a landlord household,
 not a rich peasant household.   On the other hand, if the members in the house-
 hold were numerous and the expenses high, even if there was 100 tan of land
 rent or 1,000 yuan of loans, if someone in the household performed major
 labor, it is not a landlord household,. but a rich peasant household.  There
 are cases, too, of households being considered landlords according to their
 exploitation situation, but not landlords according to their living condition.
 For instance, an individual who was once a rich or. middle peasant, but who,
 a few years before the uprising, suddenly lost his labor force due to ill-
 ness or death and had to rent out all his land or hire people to cultivate
 for him.  His entire household lived as a landlord household, it is improper
 to consider him a landlord.   He must be classified according to his original
 status.  Or, an individual who was nominally a landlord but whose land ac-
 tually belonged to someone else, whose income from exploitation was small,
 who performed incidental labor, and who liveda life even inferior to the
 peasants, must be considered a rich peasant and allocated poorer land.  In
 extreme cases, with the consent of the masses, they may be allocated land
 of similar quality as the peasants.  Finally, those who were peasants in
 the past, but suddenly became wealthy due to special opportunities 2 years

 before the uprising and turned into landlords may, with the consent of the
 masses, be allocated inferior land the same as the rich peasants, while
 their own land must be confiscated, because they were peasants 2 years ago.
 The special situations discussed above have been overlooked in some areas
 in the land investigation movement.
 Well-to-do middle peasants who engaged in some minor exploitation of others
 are a part of the middle peasants.  Their income from exploitation must not
 have exceeded 15 percent of the total household annual receipt.  Under cer-
 tain conditions, though the exploitation income exceeded 15 percent of the
 total annual income, if it did not exceed 30 percent and if the masses do
 not oppose them, the parties concerned are still considered well-to-do mid-
 dle peasants.  Under the soviet political power, the interests of the well-
 to-do middle peasants receive the same protection as middle peasants in gen-
 eral.
 Attention must be given to the following
 (1)  The well-to-do middle peasants'are a part of the middle peasants.  The.
 difference is that they engaged in some minor exploitation of others while
 the middle peasants did not.
 (2)  The difference between the well-to-do middle peasants and the rich
 peasants is that the exploitation income of the former did not exceed 15
 percent of the total household annual income while that of the latter ex-
 ceeded 15 percent.  This demarcation is required to determine the class classi-
 fications.
 (3)  The minor exploitation by the well-to-do middle peasants refers to such
 acts as hiring shepherd boys, part-time help, or monthly help, lending out
 small amounts of money, collecting small amounts on loans or school rent,
 or renting out small parcels of land, provided the income from such exploi-
 tations did not constitute an important part of the livelihood of the house-
 hold, i.e., not more than 15 percent, and that the important source of its
 livelihood was the labor of its members.
 (4)  Those whose amount of exploitation was the same as the rich peasants
 close to the time of the uprising, but the time of such exploitation did
 not exceed 2 years, are still considered well-to-do middle peasants.
 (5)  When we say that, under certain conditions, although the exploitation
 income exceeded 15 percent of the total household annual income, if it did
 not exceed 30 percent, and if the masses do not oppose them, the parties
 concerned are still considered well-to-do middle peasants, the "certain
 conditions" indicate that, although the exploitation amount exceeded 15
 percent, the members of the household were numerous, its labor force small

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 and its living condition not luxurious.  In the event of flood, drought,
 famine, illness or death, they might even find themselves in difficulty.
 Under the above conditions, the parties concerned must not be considered
 rich peasants, but middle peasants, provided the exploitation amount-did
 not exceed 30 percent of the total household annual income.  Where such
 conditions did not exist, those whose exploitation income exceeded 15 per-
 cent of their total household annual income are considered rich peasants,
 not well-to-do middle peasants.  The' determination on the presence or
 absence of the conditions is by the public opinion of the'local masses.
 The well-to-do middle peasants constitute a considerable portion of the
 rural population.   In the land investigation movement in many areas, they
 have been handled as rich peasants, which is incorrect.  Most of the inci-
 dents of encroaching upon the middle peasants which occurred in various
 areas involved the well-to-do middle peasants.  This must be immediately
 rectified.
 Examples:
 (1)  A household of six members in which two of them performed labor owned
 50 tan of land, actually producing 35 tan of grain (total value 140 yuan,
 at   4 yuan per tan current price) ,  completely farmed by the house-
 hold.   They had a 5-room house, a cow and a pond which produced 12 yuan
 large currency.   Their annual income from sundry grain production and hog
 raising was approximately 100 yuan.  They loaned out 3 tan of raw grain at
 50 percent interest, collecting 1.5 tan a year (value 6 yuan) for 4 years.
 They loand out money in the sum of 100 yuan large currency (equivalent to
 1,800 mao small currency), at 25 percent interest, collecting 25 yuan a year
 for 5 years.  Decision:  The household depended on its own labor as the main
 source of its livelihood and its own production brought in 250 yuan or more.
 Although it exploited others by collecting interests, its annual interest
 income was only 29 yuan, which was under 15 percent of its total income.
 After expenses, it had a surplus and it lived fairly well.  Nevertheless,
 as the amount of exploitation was not great, it is considered a well-to-do
 middle peasant, not a rich peasant, household.
 (2)  A household of 5 members where 1-1/2 members performed labor had 25
 tan of land, actually producing 17 tan of grain.  It leased in 75 tan of
 land, actually producing 42 tan of grain and paying 25 tan in rent for 10
 years.  Its annual income from sundry grain production and. hog raising was
 50 yuan.   It hired a shepherd boy for 3 years.   It loaned out 60 yuan large
 currency, at 30 percent interest, collecting 18 yuan per year for 4 years.
 It had a 5-room house and one cow.  It had one parcel of wooded hill pro-
 ducing 30 tan of mu-t'ao a year.  Decision:  The household depended mainly
 on its own labor for its livelihood.  Its annual exploitation of others was
 very small, only over 20 yuan (combining amployment of the shepherd boy and
 loans), while it was exploited by others in form of 25 tan of land rent.
 After expenses, there was hardly any surplus.   Therefore, it is considered
 an ordinary middle peasant, not a well-to-do middle peasant, household.

 3.  The Time and Amount of Exploitation Practiced by the.Rich Peasants
 If a person, besides participating in production, relied on exploitation
 as a part, or a large part, of the source of livelihood of his household
 for 3 successive years immediately prior to the uprising, and if the exploi-
 tation amount exceeded 15 percent of the total annual income of the entire
 household, he is called a rich peasant.  Under certain conditions, though
 the exploitation amount exceeded 15 percent of the total income, if it did
 not exceed 30 percent, and if the masses do not oppose him, the party con-
 cerned is not a rich peasant, but a well-to-do middle peasant.
 Attention must be given to the following
 (1)  The time of the, uprising is the starting point to compute the time of
 exploitation by counting backward, and no other time may be used as the
 starting point for computation.   Some people reckon old accounts and take
 the interrupted exploitation of many years ago as the basis to determine
 the class classification.  This is incorrect.
 (2) Three successive years of exploitation constitute the time criterion
 to determine-a rich peasant classification.   If the exploitation time did
 not exceed .3 years, or if it totaled 3 years but was intermittent (not con-
 tinuous), although the exploitation amount was the same as the rich peasants
 in the same period, the party concerned is still considered well-to-do middle
 peasant.
 (3)  The exploitation amount must have exceeded 15 percent of the total
 annual household income before the party concerned is classified as a rich
 peasant.  If the exploitation amount was below 15 percent, although there
 was continuity of 3 years or more, the party concerned is not considered a
 rich peasant, but a well-to-do middle peasant.
 (4)  The total annual household income indicates the total of a person's
 receipts from his own production and his exploitation of others.   If a
 certain household produced by its own effort 400 yuan and received 100 yuan
 by exploitation, the 500 yuan total was the total income.  As the exploita-
 tion income constituted 20 percent of the total income, the party concerned
 is a rich peasant.
 (5)  The "certain conditions" indicate cases where the family members were
 numerous, the labor force small and its living condition not luxurious, or,
 where it encountered difficulties due to natural disasters or human calami-
 ties.   Under such conditions, although the exploitation amount exceeded 15
 percent, if it did not exceed 30 percent, and if the masses do not oppose
 it, it is considered a well-to-do middle peasant household.  Here, the
 opinion of the masses is extremely important, and consideration of such
 cases must be extremely careful.  The well-to-do middle peasants must not
 be mistaken for rich peasants, causing the dissatisfaction of the middle

 .peasants, nor must the rich peasants be mistaken as well-to-do middle peas-
 ants, causing the dissatisfaction of the poor peasants.   Therefore, careful
 consideration and the consent of the masses are required.
 There have'been many disputes on the issues of time and amount in the land
 investigation movement, because of the lack of a clear distinction between
 the rich peasants and the well-to-do middle peasants, so far.  The well-to-
 do middle peasants are sometimes handled as rich peasants, or vice versa.
 There have been frequent disputes.  Now, with the provision on their de-
 marcation, such disputes can be avoided.
 Examples:
 (1)  A household of 11 members in which 2 of them performed labor owned
 160 tan of land, actually producing 120 tan of grain (worth 480 yuan).
 They had 2 parcels of tea hills, producing 30 yuan large currency annually.
 They had a pond, producing 15 yuan large currency annually.  Their income
 from sundry grain production and hog raising was approximately 150 yuan per
 year.  They hired one permanent helper for 7 years, until the time of the
 revolution, thus exploiting approximately 70 yuan of surplus labor a year.
 They loaned 250 yuan large currency, at 30 percent interest, collecting 75
 yuan a year, for 5 years, until the time of the revolution.  A son of the
 household who is a scholar, wrote petitions and handled litigation and
 relied on his superiority to take advantage of others.  Decision:  While
 this household had two members performing labor, they hired permanent help
 and loaned out much money.  Their exploitation income exceeded 15 percent
 of the total annual hosehold income.  Although the members were numerous,
 the household had much surplus money after expenses.  Therefore, they are
 a rich peasant household and entitled to inferior land.  The evil gentry
 in the household is not entitled to any land.
 (2)  A household of three members in which one of them was able to perform
 major labor for 4 months in the year    had 60 tan of land, farmed 30 tan,
 actually producing 18 tan of grain, and rented out 30 tan, collecting 12
 tan of grain as rent for 5 years.   It regularly hired part-time help for
 20 days a year.  It had one cow and could earn 2 tan of grain a year from
 it.  It loaned out 120 yuan large currency, at 30 percent interest, col-
 lecting 36 yuan a year, for 3 years.  Decision:  The exploitation income
 of this household exceeded the receipts from its own production.  Never-
 theless, as one member performed 4 months of major labor, it is considered
 a rich peasant household and entitled to inferior land.
 4.   Reactionary Rich Peasants
 The rich peasants who were guilty of serious counterrevolutionary conduct
 around the time of the uprising, especially after the uprising, are called
 reactionary rich peasants.  The land and assets of such reactionary rich
 peasants and of their family members who participated in such counterrevo-
 lutionary conduct must be confiscated.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 The above provision is applicable to reactionary capitalists.
 Attention must be given the following
 (1)  Only the rich peasants guilty of "serious counterrevolutionary con-
 duct" are called reactionary rich peasants.  Reactionary rich peasants lead
 the Civil League during the uprising to massacre the workers and peasants:
 resisted the revolutionary government, especially leading others to organize
 counterrevolutionary groups or organs after the uprising or performed seri-
 ous counterrevolutionary activities individually, including assassination,
 serving as an enemy spy, volunteering as a guide to the White army, fleeing
 to the White area in aid of the Kuomintang, actively sabotaging the land
 investigation movement and economic construction, etc.   In regard to those
 who are rich peasants and who were guilty of serious counterrevolutionary
 conduct, after verification, their land and assets are confiscated.  As for
 those rich peasants who were guilty of counterrevolutionary conduct but who
 were not leaders or performed no important activities, their land and assets
 must not be confiscated.
 (2)  In regard to the family members of the reactionary rich peasants, only
 the land and assets of those who participated in the serious counterrevolu-
 tionary conduct are confiscated, but the land and assets of other members
 are not confiscated.
 (3)  Those who temporarily went to the White areas for the purpose of making
 a living are not considered reactionary rich peasants, and their assets must
 not be confiscated.  However, in regard to those who went to the White areas
 because they did not wish to reside in the Soviet areas and remained in the
 White areas for 1 full year or more, although they are not reactionary rich
 peasants, their assets must be confiscated.
 (4)  The above provisions are applicable in defining and handling the reac-
 tionary capitalists.   In many areas in the past, the land and assets of many
 rich peasants who were not guilty of serious counterrevolutionary conduct
 including the land and assets of their family members who did not participate
 in any counterrevolutionary conduct were confiscated.  This was erroneous.
 The source of the error was Article 3 of Kiangsi's Land Confiscation and
 Distribution Law:  "In regard to the rich peasants who joined counterrevolu-
 tionary organizations (such as the AB League, the Social Democratic Party,
 etc.), the entire household is confiscated," without distinction of princi-
 pal or accessory, participant or non-participant \  In regard to family mem-
 bers, the second half of the same article states:     "In regard to family mem-
 bers who did,not join any counterrevolutionary organization, were not guilty
 of any counterrevolutionary conduct and have severed relations with the
 counterrevolutionaries in the family, when they are not opposed by the
 masses, their land may be returned to them."  Nevertheless, because all the
 assets of the family have been confiscated, to return a portion afterward
 is still not the correct answer.  Therefore, the article in question must
 be revised according to these provisions.   In some areas in the past, the
 sphere of reactionary capitalists was expanded, and certain stores which
 should not have been confiscated were confiscated.  This was also wrong.

 Example:
 A household of nine members where one member performed labor and another
 incidental labor had 160 tan of land, farmed 80 tan and actually produced
 45 tan of grain, and rented out 80 tan of land and collecting 40 tan of rent
 for 10 years.  They had five parcels of hills, producing 70 yuan large cur-
 rency a year.                   They had one permanent helper.  They owed 425 yuan large
 currency, at 25 percent interest, for 3 years.  They loaned out 380 yuan
 large currency, at 30 percent interest, for 5 years.  One member served
 as a company commander of the Ching-wei League for 2 years and fought the
 Red Guard five times.  Another was a member of the AB League for 6 months,
 but not in an important position, and confessed to the government.  Other
 members of the family had no apparent reactionary conduct.  Decision:  The
 classification of this household is rich peasant.  The one member who per-
 formed serious counterrevolutionary work is a reactionary rich peasant, and
 his assets must be confiscated.  The assets of other members must not be
 confiscated.  In regard to the member who joined the AB League, as he did
 not have an important position and he had confessed, nor must his assets be
 confiscated.
 Under the policy of-weakening, the rich peasants, during the period of the
 domestic war, besides such basic means as allocating inferior land to them,
 confiscating their surplus buildings, plow animals and farm tools and levying
 higher taxes, to demand unscheduled donations from them is proper.  Never-
 theless, the amount of'donation must not exceed 40 percent of a rich peasant's
 cash on hand.   The number of times of donations must also be limited.
 (1)  Recently, there have been two tendencies in regard to rich peasant dona-
 tions.  One is to shelter the rich peasants and not ask them for donations.
 Another is to take all their cash as a donation, which is no different from
 fines imposed on the landlords.  Both are incorrect and the latter is a ten-
 dency to eliminate the rich peasants and may even affect the middle peasants.
 The limit has now been set at 40 percent.  All areas may, according to the
 rich peasants' payment of donations in the past and their current family
 situation, ask them to donate a suitable portion of their cash.
 (2)   Donations are of a temporary nature, different from the regular land
 tax.  The number of times of donations therefore, must be limited.  The rich
 peasants must not be asked to donate over and over again, without limit.
 (3)   The authority to ask for donations from the rich peasants is limited
 to the state financial. organs.  No other organ may ask them for donations.

 Peasants Are Entitled

 After the land, buildings, plow animals and farm tools have been decided
 as assets to which the rich peasants are entitled, the rich peasants; pro-
 vided they observe the laws.of the Soviet, have the right of disposal, and
 no one may interfere.  Only for the purpose of facilitating production and
 with the consent of the rich peasants, may the workers, peasants and poor
 people exchange buildings with the rich peasants.
 (1)  Recently in some areas, there have been incidents of workers, peasants
 and poor people exchanging their own land, building, plow animals and farm
 tools for those to which the rich peasants are entitled, or'even for clothes
 and fertilizer.  This is wrong, because there must be a limit to "weakening
 the rich peasants." The "weakening" policy of allocating relatively in-
 ferior land, confiscating surplus buildings, plow animals and farm tools,
 levying higher taxes and demanding a part of their cash as donations has
 been enforced.   Anything beyond such limit is a tendency to destroy the rich
 peasants, which is improper in the current stage of the revolution.  Only
 for the purpose of facilitating production and with the consent of the rich
 peasants may buildings be exchanged.
 (2)  After the correct solution of the land issue, when the inferior land
 allocated to a rich peasant has been improved into good land, no one may
 ask for its exchange.
 (3)  The plow animals, farm tools and buildings acquired by the rich peas-
 ants after the arising, although there may be a surplus, must not be con-
 fiscated again or exchanged.
 7.   Rich Peasants' Volunteer Labor
 The rich peasants must perform more volunteer labor than the workers,
 peasants and poor people for the state and the locality, but such volun-
 teer labor must be so limited as not to interfere with their production.
 There must be a distinction between compelling the rich peasants to per-
 form volunteer labor and compelling the landlords to do so.  All the able-
 bodies among the landlords must be organized into the labor team for train-
 ing and participation in the state and local labor work, thus reforming
 their class essence in the process of labor and eliminating the landlord
 class.  The rich peasants must perform more volunteer labor than the work-
 ers, peasants and poor people, but they must not be ordered to perform
 unlimited volunteer labor similar to the landlord so as to hinder their
 production.  Therefore, where the rich peasants and the landlords are or-
 ganized into one labor team, in the busy farming season, when the rich
 peasants have no surplus labor power nor the means to compensate for the
 lack, it is wrong to make them perform long-term volunteer labor severed
 from production.  Where production is not hindered, where the rich peasants
 have surplus labor power, or where there are means of compensating for the
 lack, this provision does not apply.

 8.  Bankrupt Landlords
 Landlords who lost all, or the greater part, of their land or assets used
 for exploitation before the uprising, but who still performed no labor,
 relying on fraud, plunder, or the help of relatives and friends for their
 main source of income are called bankrupt landlords.   The bankrupt landlords
 are still a part of the landlord class and may not be allocated land.
 However, those landlords who, after bankruptcy, relied on their own labor
 for the main source of their income for 1 year or more must have their
 classification changed.  They have the right to land allocations.
 Those landlords who, after bankruptcy, relied on their own labor for one-
 third of their annual living expenses may be treated as rich peasants.
 Calling partially bankrupt landlords bankrupt landlords is incorrect, be-
 cause they still possessed a part of their assets to be used for exploita-
 tion.  Only the amount of their exploitation income had changed.
 Calling bankrupt those landlords who performed major labor for 1 full year
 or more after bankruptcy is even more incorrect, because, after having per-
 formed major labor for 1 full year (before the uprising), an individual
 changed from a landlord to a worker, poor man, or peasant.
 To treat those landlords who performed partial labor after bankruptcy still
 as landlords is also incorrect, because, if such labor was sufficient to
 supply one-third of their annual living expenses, they should be treated as
 rich peasants.
 9.  Poor People
 Except the workers, peasants, independent producers and those following
 freelance occupations, all those depending on their labor to pursue one
 or more occupations, relying mainly on their own labor to make a living,
 or operating their own business with a small capital for the minimum living,
 are called poor people.  The unemployed poor in the villages and small towns
 must be allocated land.  The urban poor having no houses must be allocated
 the houses of the landlords.
 The urban poor constitute a large portion of the population.  A part of them
 are also found in the rural villages and small towns.  Their occupations
 are complex.  The occupation of some individuals changes with the season
 and is indefinite.  Their life is very difficult.  Their income often
 cannot meet expenses.
 Poor people operating their own business with a small capital are peddlers.

 Physicians, teachers, lawyers, news reporters, authors and artists who did
 not exploit others are people who follow free-lance occupations.
 (1)  The intellectuals, by themselves, do not constitute a. class.  Their
 class classifications are determined according to the class they belong to.
 (2)  Provided they observe the laws of the Soviet, all landlord and bour-
 geois intellectuals must be fully utilized for service to the Soviet.
 (3)  Intellectuals who performed non-exploiting work, such as teachers,
 editors, news reporters, service personnel, authors and artists, are mental
 laborers.  They must receive the protection of the laws of the Soviet.
 (1)  The unconditional rejection of intellectuals in many areas recently
 is incorrect.   Utilizing the landlord and bourgeois intellectuals to serve
 the Soviet is beneficial to the Soviet revolutionary policy.  During the
 time when they serve the Soviet, means must be found to solve their living
 problems.
 (2)  The class classification.of an intellectual is determined by the class
 to which he belongs.  For instance,  an intellectual with a landlord back-
 ground is a landlord.  One with a rich peasant background is a rich peasant.
 One with a middle peasant background is a middle peasant.  It is incorrect
 to regard the intellectuals as a class by themselves.  It is even more in-
 correct to consider peasant children who have attended school (the so-called
 "graduates") as undesirables.
 (3)  It is also wrong to regard the work of teachers as non-labor.
 11.  Lumpen Proletariats
 Workers, peasants and others who, immediately before the uprising, lost
 their jobs or land as a result of oppression and exploitation by the land-
 lords and bourgeoisie and relied on improper means for the main source of
 their livelihood continuously for 3 years or more are called lumpen pro-
 letariat (customarily known as vagrants).
 ti
 The policy of the Soviet on the lumpen proletariat is to win the masses
 and oppose the leaders and those who depended on the exploiting class and
 actively participated in the counterrevolution. The main means to win the
 lumpen proletariat masses is to make them return to production, to allo-
 cate land and jobs to them similar to the revolutionary people in general,
 and to give them voting rights.   Nevertheless, in order to receive land
 allocations, they must live in the rural village and have the ability to
 farm.

 Attention must be given to the following
 (1)  The "improper means as the main source of livelihood" indicate such
 improper occupations as stealing, robbing, swindling, begging,, gambling
 and prostitution.   It is incorrect to refer to all those who were employed
 or semi-employed but spent a part of their time on improper occupations
 (not as the main source of their livelihood) as vagrants.  It is even more
 incorrect to refer to the workers, peasants.and poor people who once had
 undesirable habits (such as visiting prostitutes, gambling, smoking opium,
 etc.) as vagrants.
 (2)  In some areas, the lumpen proletariat leaders (vagrant chiefs) who
 actively participated in the counterrevolution are not only not punished,
 but allocated land.  This is wrong.  Other areas refuse the demand of the
 general lumpen proletariat for land allocations.  This is also wrong.
 12.  Professional Religionists
 All those who followed the occupation of religious superstition for 3 full
 years (immediately before the uprising), including ministers, Catholic
 fathers, monks, Taoist priests, vegetarians, geomancers, fortune-tellers
 and diviners, are professional religionists.  Professional religionists
 have no voting right and may not receive land allocations.
 All those who followed the occupation of religious superstition but did
 not depend on it as the main source of their livelihood, and all those who
 depended on it as the main source of their livelihood for less than 3 years,
 must not be called professional religionists.  They must be treated accord-
 ing to their proper classifications.  They must not be all deprived of their
 voting right or withheld land allocations.  In other words, all those prac-
 ticing religious superstition as a sideline, or as their main occupation
 for less than 3 years, who were mainly workers, peasants, or poor people,
 they must retain their voting rights and those residing in.the rural vil-
 lage must receive land allocations.   This provision naturally applies to
 their family members as well as themselves.  It is incorrect to refer to
 monks, Taoist priests, geomancers and fortune-tellers as vagrants.
 13.   Red Army Soldiers With Landlord or Rich Peasant Background and Land
 Allocation
 Under the condition of firmly waging war in the interest of the workers and
 peasants, Red Army members of landlord or rich peasant background, they,
 whether officers or soldiers and their family members have the right to
 receive land allocations.
 (1)  Article 1 of the Regulations on the Preferential Treatment of Red Army
 Members states:   "In regard to all the Red Army soldiers whose families
 reside in Soviet areas, the soldiers themselves and their family members
 must all receive equal allocations of land, houses, woods and ponds similar

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 to the local impoverished peasants."  Here, all Red Army soldiers are in-
 cluded.                     Nevertheless, recently, some areas only looked into the social back-
 ground, without regard of the political manifestations and repossessed the
 land already allocated to Red Army soldiers.  This was incorrect.
 (2)  "Family members of Red Army soldiers" include the father, mother, wife,
 sons, daughters and younger brothers and sisters under 16 years of age.  No
 one else may enjoy this privilege.
 (3)  In regard to Red Army soldiers of landlord or rich peasant background,
 if they are expelled from the army, their land may be repossessed.
 14.  Workers Who Belong to Rich Peasant or Landlord Families
 Where a worker belongs to a rich peasant or.landlord family, the classifi-
 cation of the worker himself and his wife is unchanged.  Whether he should
 receive land allocation depends on whether he is in the village or the city
 and handled accordingly.  Other members of his family are handled as land-
 lord or rich peasants.
 (1)  In a landlord or rich peasant family, anyone selling his labor for 1
 full year or more immediately prior to the uprising is recognized as a worker.
 He and his wife are treated as workers.  His part of the family assets is
 not confiscated.  If he and his wife reside in the village, they will re-
 ceive land allocations, but no such allocation will be made if they reside
 in the city.  Where the individual himself resides in the city while his
 wife resides in the village,'he will not be allocated land, while his wife
 will be.  Other members of the family are handled as landlord or rich peas-
 ants and may not enjoy the rights of workers.  Should there be members of
 other classifications in the family, they are handled according to such
 classifications.   (For instance, if someone in the family residing in the
 village relied on rent collection and loans as the main source of his liveli-
 hood for 3 full years or more, he is a landlord.  Someone who had been sell-
 ing his labor for 1 full year or more is a worker.  Someone who had been
 operating his small handicraft store in a township for 1 full year or more
 is an independent producer.  Their classifications are determined according
 to the source of their livelihood within a certain period of time,, and their
 treatment under the soviet laws is determined according to their classifi-
 cations).
 (2)  The rural workers, independent producers, elementary school teachers and
 physicians who owned small parcels of land and rented them out because they
 had to go elsewhere to make a living, being unable to do so in their home
 village, but did not rely on the rental income as the main.source of their
 livelihood, will receive land allocations similar to the peasants in general.
 They must not be regarded as landlords.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (1)  The act of marriage does not change the class classification.
 (2)  The class classifications of landlord, rich peasants, or capitalists
 marrying workers, peasants, or poor people are determined by whether the
 marriage occurred before or after the uprising, the original class classi-
 fications and the living conditions after marriage.
 (3)  In regard to those who married before the uprising:  Women of land-
 lord, rich peasant, or capitalist families who married workers, peasants,
 or poor people and performed labor for 1 full year or more are recognized
 as peasants or poor people.  Those who did not perform labor, or who per-
 formed labor for less than a full year, will retain their original classi-
 fication without change.                      Women.of worker, peasant, or. poor people families
 who married landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists are only classified as
 landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists if they lived the same kind of life
 as the landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists for 5 full years.  If they
 did not live the same kind of life as the landlords, rich peasants, or capi-
 talists, but lived the life of workers, peasants, or poor people (relying on
 their own labor as the main source of their livelihood), or if they lived
 the same kind of life as the landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists for
 less than 5 years, their original classifications are unchanged.
 (4)  In regard to those who married after the uprising:..The classifications
 of women of worker, peasant, or poor people families marrying landlords,
 rich peasants, or capitalists are unchanged.  In case of women of landlord,
 rich peasant, or capitalist families marrying workers, peasants, or poor
 people, they must have performed labor for 5 full years before they are
 recognized as workers, peasants, or poor people.  If they performed no
 labor, or performed labor for less than 5 full years, their original classifi-
 cations will remain unchanged.
 (5)  Regardless of the time of marriage and the classifications of the
 parents, the classification of the children follows that of the father.
 (6)  The enjoyment of land and public rights depends on. the classification.
 (7)  Women of landlord,, rich peasant, or capitalist families marrying work-
 ers, peasants, or poor people may not be organized into the labor team.  Where
 the cash dowry was under 50 yuan, they may not be fined or assessed donations.
 (8)  In case of worker, peasant, or poor people daughters sold as child-
 brides to landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists, or in case of worker,
 peasant, or poor people families acquiring a husband into the family for
 their daughter from the landlord, rich peasant, or capitalist families, or
 vice versa, prior to the uprising, the provisions contained in (1) to (7)
 above are applicable to the classification and treatment of the children sold
 and the husbands acquired.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (9)  Where, before the uprising, the workers, peasants, or poor people gave
 their sons to the landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists as heirs, or vice
 versa, regardless of the age of the children at the time of transfer, the
 classification of those children under 10 years of age will remain unchanged.
 From age 10 on, where the sons of workers, peasants, or poor people were given
 to the landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists, if such children lived the
 same kind of life as their foster parents for 5 full years, their classifi-
 cations are the same as the foster parents.  If their way of living was not
 the same as their foster parents, but the same as their natural parents,
 their original classifications are not changed.  Where the sons of landlords,
 rich peasants, or capitalists were given to workers, peasants, or poor people
 as heirs, if they lived the same kind of life as their foster parents for 3
 full years, their classifications are the same as the foster parents.   If
 their way of living was not the same as their foster parents, but the same
 as their natural parents, their original classifications are unchanged.
 "Labor" in the foregoing provisions includes household labor.
 (1)  In case of landlords who were also merchants, their land and their
 buildings and assets adjacent to the land are confiscated.  Their business
 and their stores, residences and assets adjacent to the business are not
 confiscated.
 (2)  In case of rich peasants who were also merchants, their land and their
 buildings and assets 'adjacent to the land are handled-according to the rich
 peasant classification.  Their business and their stores, residences and
 assets adjacent to the business are not confiscated.
 (3)  The fines and donations of landlords  and rich peasants who were also
 merchants are limited to the landlord and rich peasant portion of their
 assets, and must not include the business portion.
 (4)  Merchants are not organized into the labor team.
 17.  Managing the Public Hall
 Managing the public hall was a kind of exploitation, but managing by the
 landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists must be distinguished from managing
 by the workers, peasants, or poor people.
 Managing the public hall refers to managing the land and assets of all kinds
 of ancestral halls, temples, or associations.  Undoubtedly, managing the
 public hall was a kind of exploitation, especially in case of the landlords
 and rich peasants who provided public halls and concentrated large amounts
 of land and assets, making it one of the main forms of exploitation.  The
 fact that a few individuals controlled a public hall and collected large
 sums of exploitation is a factor in determining the class classification of
 the managers.   Nevertheless, the fact that some small public halls were managed
 by the worker, peasant, or poor people masses by rotation, and the amount of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 exploitation was very small will not serve as a factor in determining the
 class classification of the managers.   It is incorrect to regard all those
 who managed the public hall as landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists.
 18.   The Living Problem of Some Work Personnel
 Where the work personnel of the soviet organs or other revolutionary organi-
 zations have not been allocated land and experience difficulty in their
 livelihood, they and the members of their families may be allocated a suit-
 able amount of land, or have their difficulties solved by some other means.
 In regard to the livelihood of the Soviet work personnel in general who
 have been allocated land, the Central Government has issued an order to solve
 their difficulties (by activating the masses to cultivate their land).  The
 provision here refers to the personnel who have not been allocated land.
 Family members include father, mother, wife, sons, daughters and younger
 brothers and sisters under 16 years of age.
 19.  Public Enterprise Land
 In regard to land division in new areas and redivision of land uncovered in
 the old areas, a suitable amount of land must be reserved for public enter-
 prises such as bridges, ferries, tea pavilions and agricultural experimental
 farms.
 In regard to the funds to maintain the public enterprises, such. as bridge
 repair, ferry boat repair, wages for the boatmen and tea pavilion repair
 and installation, a suitable amount of land must be reserved and the masses
 activated to cultivate it.  In addition, the country, district and township
 soviets must reserve some land in a suitable location near the government
 organs for agricultural experimental farms.   (The county soviet may reserve
 50 to 150 tan, the district soviet 15 to 25 tan, and the township soviet 5
 to 10 tan.)  Before the agricultural experimental farm is started, the land
 may be leased to the peasants for cultivation at a nominal rental.
 (1)  Where landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists loaned money or articles.
 to the workers, peasants, or poor people before the uprising, except for
 goods received from the stores, the principal and interest are both can-
 celled.  Where workers, peasants, or poor people deposited money or articles
 with the landlords, rich peasants, or capitalists, the principal and interest
 must be paid according to the actual figures.
 (2)  Those who relied. exclusively or mostly on exploitation by high interest
 loans for the main source of the livelihood of the household are called
 usurers. The usurers are handled in the same manner as landlords.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (3)  Provided the Provisional Loan Law promulgated by the Central Govern-
 ment is not violated, debts incurred after the uprising must be repaid.
 Those who were guilty of exploitation by high interest loans (in all areas
 controlled by the Kuomintang, whether urban or rural, the great majority of
 the debts are exploitation by high interest loans) but who did not rely ex-
 clusively or mostly on such loans for the main source of the livelihood of
 the household cannot be called usurers and the policy of total confiscation
 does not apply.  They must be handled individually according to their classi-
 fications.  It is incorrect to classify all those guilty of exploitation by
 high interest loans as "usurers."       In regard to those who loaned and borrowed
 money at the same time, their "credit" and "debit" must be offset and the
 nature and extent of the balance studied.  Then, by adding such balance to
 his other exploitations, his classification is determined.

 [Text]  According to experience gained after 18 months of implementing the
 Labor Law promulgated 1 December 1931, some provisions of the Labor Law were
 out of keeping with actual conditions in the Soviet Area and the Law did
 not provide for measures to accommodate the middle and poor peasants and
 handicraft workers who employ auxiliary labor.  As a result, there were dif-
 ficulties in enforcing the Law..  Moreover, the Law did not provide for many
 other practical matters.  Yet, these matters urgently needed to be included
 in the provisions of the Law.  With a view to improving the interests of the
 workers, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and developing the economy
 of the Soviet Area, the Central Executive Committee organized in April 1933
 a Labor Law Drafting Committee to redraft a labor law.   For the past 5 months,
 through discussions of a new draft labor law by worker-peasant masses in
 various places, numerous opinions were mustered.  In accordance with the
 draft labor law and the opinions gathered from various places, the Central
 Executive Committee examined the draft and made amendments.  Now it is espe-
 cially resolved that
 (1)  The articles of the Labor Law be adopted, promulgated and put into effect
 as from 15 October 1933.
 (2)  After the new Labor Law is promulgated, the Labor Law that went into
 effect 1 December 1931 be declared null and void.  All other decrees con-
 cerning the labor problem that contradict the provisions of the new Labor
 Law shall also be without legal force.
 (5)  Detailed formalities to enforce the provisions of the new Labor Law be
 promulgated by order of the People's Council and the Central Department of
 the People's Commissioner of Labor.
 (4)  Any amendments to this Labor Law be made by order of the Central Execu-
 tive Committee.
 (5)  This Labor Law take effect within the territory of the Chinese Soviet
 Republic.

 ing the concurrence of the All-China Federation of Labor, specify that several
 types of working personnel under special 'circumstances (e.g., responsible

 ences, workers who are working in producers' cooperatives or in other spe-
 cial circumstances) shall not be bound by the working hours stipulated above
 and formulate measures to deal with them separately.
 Article 17.  Working hours of all people who work at night should be shorter
 than the usual working hours during the day.  However, under the conditions
 of continuous production or working in shifts, working hours at night should
 be the same as in the day, but wages for night work should be increased.   (If
 wages pertain to the stipulations contained in Article 13, they should be in-
 creased by one-seventh of the wages for work done during the day.   If wages
 pertain to the stipulations contained in Article 14, they should be increased
 by one-fifth.)  In the case of people who are paid on a piecework basis, if
 their work is done at night, apart from the wages earned at the piece rate,
 they should receive an increase of either one-seventh or one-fifth.
 (Note)  What is called "night" in this article refers to the period from
 2200 hours to 0600 hours the following day.
 Article 18.  Between the daily working hours there should be a rest from work
 from 1/2 to 1 hour to provide the time needed by the workers to eat and to
 rest.  This break, however, should not be considered in figuring the working
 hours.
 (Note)  With regard to those workers-in an industry which cannot suspend
 work, the Department of Labor of the Central Government shall formulate
 separately special measures to enforce such a break.
 Article 19.   Work done beyond the number of working hours prescribed by law
 (overtime work) shall be prohibited in accordance with universal fundamental

 local department of labor are obtained.
 (Note)  If in an emergency (e.g., taking precautions against a public disas-
 ter or doing away with an obstacle in a project) it is necessary to do over-
 time work, and there is not enough time to obtain the concurrence of the
 labor union and the department of labor, the management should notify the
 labor inspector the following day in order to keep the record straight.

 (Note)   In agriculture and other seasonal work, when it is necessary to do

 think about increasing the amount of such work after obtaining the concur-
 rence of the workers and labor union and the sanction of the department of

 EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION ORDER ISSUED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOR SMASHING
 THE FIFTH 'ENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION CAMPAIGN'
 [Text]  The large-scale decisive battle to smash the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" of the enemy has begun!  We are striving for an even greater
 victory!
 After sustaining an initial serious blow to its large-scale invasion in
 Ch'ing-liu, Lien-ch'eng, Yang k'ou, Wu-chiang and Li-ch'uan, the imperialist
 Kuomintang is frantically waging a desperate attack.  This engagement is a
 crucial moment in the decisive battle between the two roads of sovietism and
 colonialism!
 To mobilize all our strength and fight for a way out for the Soviet and to
 strive for our complete victory in this decisive battle are the crucial
 tasks of the Soviet regime at present.  The result of an inspection by the
 Central Government of the work of the soviets at different levels, however,
 revealed that many local governments displayed an attitude of extreme uncon-
 cern toward war mobilization.  Manifestations of enthusiasm for enlarging
 the Red Army, enlarging and training regional armed forces and mobilizing
 transport teams to go to the front recently were utterly lacking in many
 places.  People in many places did not link all kinds of work--land investi-
 gation campaign, economic development, cultural and educational work and
 sovietization--closely with the mobilization for revolutionary war so as to
 really rally the masses and lead them to struggle for the sake of complete
 victory in smashing the fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 Because a number of local governments adopted an attitude of unconcern, even
 negligence, toward war mobilization, the following serious incidents came
 about recently.   On the northern front a small unit of the enemy dared to
 penetrate deeply into the Yung-feng and Pei-k'eng soviet area and raided the
 district government, and on the southern front enemy scouts infiltrated into
 the vicinity of Yun-men-ts'en in search of military intelligence.  Yet our
 district and township governments were completely unaware beforehand.   In
 Fukien Province, this July, preparations to fight for victory at Lien-ch'eng
 in coordination with the Red Army were utterly insufficient and efforts made

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 after victory to win over the new area of Lien-ch'ing-kuei were extremely
 slow.  In Fukien and Kiangsi provinces, more than 300 rifles were unexpectedly
 intercepted and seized by the enemy recently.
 At the front there are not enough coolies to move the large quantities of
 war booty and recently a great deal of rifles taken from the enemy at Li-
 ch'uan had to be moved entirely by fighters of the Red Army.  For the people
 in these places to adopt such an attitude of unconcern and negligence toward
 maintaining vigilance against the enemy and toward war mobilization is vir-
 tually to commit a crime against the Revolution!  This is a phenomenon that
 cannot go on for even a short time longer!  It should be rectified at once.
 Beginning with the date of receipt of this order, the governments at dif-
 ferent levels should promptly carry out the following kinds of work:
 1.  Provincial, county, district, township governments and all units of the
 Red Army should forthwith convene all kinds of meetings, and particularly
 at election meetings of the soviets, to explain in detail the tense present
 situation in the Revolutionary war and to use all their strength to proceed
 with mobilization for war.  Likewise, all kinds of mass organizations should
 convoke meetings to report on the war situation and their own roles so as to
 be certain that every worker and every peasant in the Soviet Area will under-
 stand the significance of this most important battle to smash the fifth "en-
 circlement and suppression" and come forward enthusiastically to carry out
 the work for participation in the war.
 2.   Bearing in mind the experience gained and lesson learned in our smashing
 of the fourth "encirclement and suppression" the government at different
 levels must fulfill the plan of the Central Revolutionary Military Affairs
 Committee to enlarge the Red Army and enthusiastically rally whole battalions
 and whole companies of the Red Guards and Young Pioneers to join the Red
 Army before the decisive battle to smash the fifth "encirclement and sup-
 pression."  At the same time, they must separately rally large numbers of brave
 activists to join the Red Army.   They should carry on the experience of the
 Red month of May and perpetuate the splendor of the Red month of May to en-
 large the Red Army sharply.  At the same time, they should apply the experi-
 ence of Hsing-kuo County's rejoin-one's-regiment campaign and make all de-
 serters return to the army.
 3.   The governments at different levels must rally citizens between the ages
 of 18 and 40 to join the Red Guards of their own free will in large number
 and the broad masses of workers and peasants to join the Young Pioneers.
 They should revive and expand model Red Guards battalions and model Young
 Pioneers organizations, send them down regularly for drilling and step up
 their military and political training.  Where no model Red Guards battalions
 and model Young Pioneers exist, they should be established in the shortest
 possible time.   Under a unified plan of operations (to be decided by mili-
 tary organs), they should rally the Red Guards and Young Pioneers to engage

 in battle in coordination with the Red Army.  Under the orders of the
 Military Affairs Committee, all guerrilla units must thrust deeply into
 the rear of the enemy in order to pin down enemy forces and then attack
 them.
 4.   The governments at different levels must assure the supply of materials
 to the Red Army.  Every single item of economic development should be linked
 closely with the war.  They must also rally the broad masses to complete
 selling of economic development work before the end of December and begin
 levying the land tax in November and be through with it within 2 months.
 The governments at different levels must intensify the work of fund raising
 and particularly in the new areas and border areas.  The equalization bureau
 and trade bureau of the governments at different levels must use all their
 strength to insure the supplies of the Red Army so that the difficulties of
 the spring-summer period this year in procuring staple foods for the Red Army
 will not arise again and affect its movement.   It is imperative that the
 worker-peasant masses be mobilized to stand ready to render economic aid
 to the Red Army at all times.
 5.  The governments at different levels should, in accordance with the
 Voluntary Labor Law promulgated by the Central Government, mobilize the
 broad masses to take up transport work.   Every member of the Red Guards
 should have a carrying pole and a bedspread, and five of them should together
 have a stretcher.  As soon as they hear a command from the government, they
 will be able to assemble immediately to undertake transport work and help to
 attack the enemy.  And when the route of communication is damaged, they must
 immediately make repairs so as to facilitate the movement of the Red Army.
 6.   The governments at different levels must especially step up the work of
 suppressing counterrevolutionaries and enforcing the Red state of siege.
 Counterrevolutionary cases should be rapidly resolved within a few weeks
 and escape of prisoners should be done away with.  Sentry posts must be set
 up so as to tighten up the inspection of safe conduct passes.   In the border
 areas, it is even more essential-to guard against any surprise attack by
 enemy plainclothes corps.   The necessary alarm signal should be set up accord-
 ing to the orders of the Military Affairs Committee.
 7.   The governments at different levels must pay attention to work in the
 border areas and new areas and transfer the most capable cadres there to work.
 In the new areas occupied by the Red Army, they should immediately strive to
 establish provisional regimes, distribute land, build up regional armed
 forces and bring into existence various mass revolutionary organizations.
 8.   The departments of worker-peasant prosecutors at different levels must
 step up the prosecution of passive and bureaucratic elements who are sabo-
 taging the work of war mobilization.  The departments of labor and the de-
 partments of education at different levels, in enforcing the Labor Law and
 carrying out cultural and educational work respectively, should link up their
 functions closely with the work of war mobilization.

 All sovietization work should be subordinate to the war!
 In the great and difficult battle immediately before us, it is necessary
 to deal a severe blow to alarm and to retreat and escape.  At the same time,
 it is necessary to oppose resolutely all suggestions of taking enemy attacks
 lightly and relaxation our efforts in mobilization work.  It is imperative
 that we make.a supreme effort to tighten up all our work and plunge into
 propaganda and agitation to mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants,
 concentrate all our strength, prepare to make all sacrifices, and fight for
 total victory in smashing the fifth "encirclement and suppression campaign":
 Fight for Soviet new China!
 The governments at different levels must conduct the most detailed report
 and discussion of this order and the 5 October order of the Military Affairs
 Committee at various meetings and draw up the most concrete measures to imple-
 ment these orders.  Stern administrative punishments should be meted out
 immediately to those who are either passive or remiss in implementing these
 orders.  Such is the order!

 WORK REPORT OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CHINESE SOVIET
 REPUBLIC TO THE ELECTORATE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT
 [Text]  Comrades of the Electorate!
 Today is the second anniversary of the Provisional Central Government of the
 Chinese Soviet Republic since its establishment.  Last year this day we de-
 livered a simple work report to you comrades.  On this second anniversary
 we ought to report briefly to you on the process of work in the past year.
 We hope to receive your views about our work in the past and your suggestions
 regarding administrative guidelines for the future.
 Comrades, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and
 with the initiative?of the broad masses of workers, peasants and toiling
 people as well as the courageous struggle of the worker-peasant Red Army,
 the Provisional Central Government is moving forward victorious on all fronts.
 The situation today is vastly different from that of a year ago.  Below we
 discuss these developments separately:
 1.   Victory in the Revolutionary War and Expansion and Strengthening of the
 Red Army
 In the past year the central task in the revolutionary war was the smashing
 of the four "encirclements and suppressions" of the enemy.  This war resulted
 in our complete victory in the various soviet areas throughout the country.
 According to incomplete statistics, during the past year upward of 100,000
 troops of the White army were liquidated and an equal number of rifles were
 seized.  Statistics for the period from January to June show that altogether
 41 regiments, 6 battalions and 10 companies of the White army were wiped out;
 8 divisions, 33 regiments, 19 battalions and 9 companies were routed; over
 31,700 rifles and 1,000 machine guns and automatic rifles were captured;
 20 divisional, brigade and regimental commanders were taken prisoner; 2
 divisional commanders were killed, and innumerable commanders from brigade
 commanders down were either killed or wounded.

 Because of our magnificent victories, the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang
 began wavering to a considerable degree.  They had to organize five "en-
 circlement and suppression" campaigns to make desperate attacks against us.
 We, relying on the Party's line on attack and on the bravery of the Red Army
 and enthusiastic support of the worker-peasant masses in both soviet and
 White areas, dealt a telling blow to the enemy right from the beginning in
 all five of their "encirclement and suppression" campaigns.  In the battles
 of Lien-ch'eng, Yang-k'ou, Wu-chiang and more recently Li-ch'uan, we won a
 victory and seized over 8,000 rifles.  In the past year, due to the fact
 that the worker-peasant masses courageously came forward to join the Red Army,
 the Red Army has grown to twice its size of last year, and fighting heroically
 in many a bloody battle it has forged itself into a strong and invincible
 revolutionary army of iron.   The Red Guards, Young Pioneers and guerrilla
 units in various places have also been strengthened.   Under the leadership
 of the Soviet government, the worker-peasant masses and the Red Army have
 smashed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns with revolution-
 ary war.  This is the core of our revolutionary tasks.  Therefore, all our
 work and our livelihood are, therefore, subordinate to the revolutionary war.
 To strive for victory in the war is the primary duty of every worker or peas-

 II.   Sharp Expansion and Further Consolidation of the Soviet Areas
 Since last year the Northeast Region of the Central Soviet Area has soviet-
 ized the six counties of Chien-ning, T'ai-ping, Li-ch'uan, Kuang-tse, Tzu-
 ch'i and Chin-ch'i to form an area contiguous to the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi
 Soviet Area and there the new Fukien-Kiangsi Province has been established.
 The recent victory scored by the East Region army has placed a large area
 from the border between Lung-yen and Hsin-ch'uan in Fukien'Province through
 Lien-ch'eng, Ch'ing-liu and Kuei-hua to the vicinity of Yen-p'ing in northern
 Fukien within the territorial limits of the Soviet.   In the course of smashing
 the enemy's fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaign, Kiangsi Province
 added portions of territory, totaling several hundred square li in area, to
 each of the six counties of Nan-feng, I-huang, Ch'ung-jen, Lo-an, Yung-feng
 and Hsin-kan.  As to soviet territory beyond the Central Soviet Area, such
 as the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi, Hunan-Kiangsi, Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi, Hunan-
 Western Hupeh and Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei soviet areas, although there were small
 portions of territory which were temporarily occupied by the enemy, some
 were recovered shortly after and some even made new progress.  Making espe-
 cially rapid progress on a broad front was the newly created soviet area in
 the northern part of Szechwan Province.   Owing to the heroic struggle of
 the Red Fourth Front Army there, in less than a year they have sovietized
 more than 10 counties and called on the worker-peasant toiling masses and
 soldiers of the White army in the entire province of Szechwan to lean toward
 soviet revolution.   Elsewhere, in the provinces of Shensi, Honan, Hopeh,
 Kiangsu, Kwangtung and Kwangsi, there is in existence either a soviet area
 or a guerrilla area of ours.   In the Northeast Provinces, the broad masses
 of anti-Japanese volunteer army forces are continuing to fight stubbornly
 against Japanese imperialism.

 The soviet areas have not only grown, but also have been more consolidated.
 For example, previous manifestations of shoddy implementation of the class
 line have, by and large, been rectified.  As a result of the realistic im-
 plementation of the Labor Law and promulgation of a new Labor Law, the eco-
 nomic life of the worker masses has been improved still more, the enthusiasm
 of the workers in participating in the revolutionary war and soviet construc-
 tion has been raised further and the class unions of the workers have been
 organized widely and have grown and progressed.  The extensive unfolding
 of the inspection of fields campaign has dealt the greatest blow to remnant
 feudalist influences in the soviet areas, heightened to an enormous degree
 the revolutionary potentialities of the toiling masses in rural areas and
 promoted poor peasants' groups far and wide.  By relying on the development
 of the initiative of the worker-peasant masses, we have attracted a great
 number of new worker-peasant cadres to participating in soviet work and got
 rid of many of the bad elements hidden in the soviets.  The leadership style
 and working style in the soviets have been improved further and the soviets
 are now linked even more closely with the masses.   This year the administra-
 tive area of a soviet has been reduced in size.  This move enables the soviet
 to come even closer in the system to the masses.   In the light of experience
 gained in past soviet election campaigns and soviet work, the Central Govern-
 ment promulgated a new Election Law and Organic Law of Local Soviets, making
 it possible for this year's election campaign to be unfolded even more cor-
 rectly and for local soviets to be organized even better.  All this has made
 the soviet a government in which the masses truly manage their own affairs.
 It has made this government meet the needs of the revolutionary war to be-
 come an organizer as well as a leader of the revolutionary war.
 Because of splendid victories of the Red Army and the development and con-
 solidation of the soviet areas, on the one hand, and, on the other, the
 total capitulation of the Kuomintang government to imperialism as a result
 of the occupation of the Northeast Provinces, Jehol Province and North China
 by Japanese imperialism and the economic catastrophe in the Kuomintang areas,
 the broad masses of workers, peasants and toiling people, revolutionary
 soldiers and revolutionary students in the Kuomintang areas have been aroused
 and oppose as one Japanese imperialism and all imperialists, the Kuomintang
 government and landlords and capitalists.  Revolutionary struggles are un-
 folding in vast areas throughout the country.   The exploited and oppressed
 masses in the whole of China enthusiastically support the Soviet and the Red
 Army because the Soviet and the Red Army are the only government and mili-
 tary forces fighting for national freedom and independence and only the
 Soviet and the Red Army can save China.
 The bitter and protracted civil war demands that the Soviet pay maximum
 attention to undertakings for the development of the economy.  Concerning
 work in this respect, the Soviet is making great effort to carry it out.
 Here the primary task is to develop agricultural production.  Thanks to the
 correct leadership of the Soviet and the heightening of the enthusiasm of

 the broad masses of toiling people during spring cultivation and summer
 cultivation, the autumn harvest this year on the average. increased one and
 a half times over last year.  The yield of miscellaneous. grain crops regis-
 tered an even bigger increase.   Cattle for plowing cooperatives and labor
 mutual aid societies have been established in a number of-places.
 There is only one kind of development which can insure the supplies of the
 Red Army and the masses and guarantee the exchange with the outside for in-
 dustrial products, and that is a development that depends on agricultural
 production.  The development of industrial production is our second task in
 economic construction.   The production of farm implements and lime here is
 closely linked with the development of agricultural production.  The supply
 of a number of handicraft products for daily use depends upon our own pro-
 duction in the soviet areas.  In the past, cigarettes, paper, lumber, grass
 cloth, wolfram and camphor were produced and exported in large quantities,
 but later they went into a decline.  Since the beginning of the year, the
 Soviet has been planning to resore these industries and in some of them
 we have achieved initial success.   To develop an export and import trade
 is our third task in economic construction.   This year the government estab-
 lished the bureau of foreign trade, which has begun to work along this line.
 For the purpose of carrying out the above-mentioned tasks, we must develop
 cooperatives.   Since the Central Government got down to promoting the co-
 operative movement, consumers' cooperatives and foodstuffs cooperatives have
 been spreading like a storm in various places.  The development of all kinds
 of producers' cooperatives is also being planned, while the planning of credit
 cooperatives has just begun.  Economic construction bonds floated by the
 Central Government in order to launch economic construction are winning the
 support of the masses.   Bonds issued so far have exceeded 3 million yuan.
 In all likelihood, the sum of 5 million yuan can be realized.  The develop-
 ment of the economic construction will certainly provide the revolutionary
 war with a solid material basis and bring about further improvement in the
 livelihood of the broad masses of workers and peasants.  Comrades, let us work
 hard together!
 The revolutionary war and soviet construction demand that we generally raise
 the cultural level of.the worker-peasant masses in the soviet. areas.  Only
 under the Soviet. regime are the worker-peasant masses able to enjoy the right
 to get an education.   In the past year, the Soviet has begun to get cultural
 and educational enterprises under way.   Primary schools, night schools,
 literacy movements and club campaigns have begun in various places.   The
 establishment of Marxism-Communism University, Soviet University and Red
 Army University and the development of the worker-peasant theatrical group
 and blue-gown group movements, all show that the Soviet cultural construction
 undertakings have entered the stage of expansion.   Recently, the Central
 Government has proclaimed Marxism-Communism to be the fundamental guideline
 of Soviet culture and education.   The Central Government is formulating a
 system of primary education and promulgating concrete measures to carry
 out social education.   To enable the laboring people in the soviet areas to
 acquire an education and to unfold a struggle on the cultural front have
 become an important portion of our task in Soviet construction.

 Comrades of the electorate, in the foregoing paragraphs we have briefly
 reported on the situation of the development of the Revolution and on our
 progress and achievements in Soviet work.  Now, we want to point out to you
 comrades our deficiencies in Soviet work in the past and our tasks in the
 work from now on.  You, comrades of the electorate, must, under the correct
 leadership of the Soviet, make every effort to substantiate these deficiencies
 and realize these tasks before we can fight for the complete smashing of the
 fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign and the victory of the Soviet
 throughout the country.  What are our tasks?  Where do our deficiencies lie?
 First, expansion of the Red Army.  Comrades, although the Red Army has been
 enlarged, it is still not large enough... To defeat the vast forces of the
 white army in the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign, it is still
 necessary to expand the Red Army.  Every. brave worker and every brave peasant
 ought to go to the front on their own initiative.' For the sake of coordinating
 with the Red Army in fighting the enemy and defending their own localities at
 the same time, it is imperative that the Red Guards and Young Pioneers be
 expanded considerably and model Red Guards battalions and model Young Pioneers
 be increased in number.   The work of putting out sentries to check safe-con-
 ducts must be tightened so as not to allow even one enemy scout to sneak into
 a soviet area under cover.  Transport teams must stand ready from time to
 time to go to the front to carry the wounded or move the spoils of war.
 Second, work in new soviet areas should be unfolded even more rapidly.  Al-
 though in the past year.we developed many new soviet areas, we still feel it
 is a little bit slow.  One reason for this is that we in the central area have
 not sent enough worker-peasant activist comrades to work in'the new soviet
 areas.   In order to expand the new soviet areas even more drastically in the
 fighting to smash the "encirclement and suppression" campaign, comrades in
 the central area should be delighted to go to work in the new soviet areas
 and comrades in the new soviet areas should redouble their efforts in perform-
 ing their work.
 Third, although we made great achievements in Soviet construction in the
 past year, there is still much work that remains to be done.   First of all,
 to protect the usual interests of the worker we must enforce the Labor Law
 even more generally and correctly.  Next, the land investigation. movement.
 We must make all possible efforts to launch movement and check up on classes
 in places where remnants of feudal influence have not yet been wiped out.
 But we must not start a quarrel with middle peasants and treat rich peasants
 the same as landlords.   Then, economic construction.  We must strive for
 winter cultivation this year and prepare for spring cultivation next year.
 We must develop the cooperatives so that they will-have a membership of 1
 million and set up central organizations of various consumers' cooperatives
 at different levels to carry out the plan to engage in trade.  We must carry
 out the development of export and import trade to. break the enemy's block-
 ade and solve our salt difficulties.   We must repair bridges and roads so
 as to facilitate economic development.  We must sell effectively 3 to 5

 million yuan worth of economic construction bonds to raise the capital for
 all kinds of economic construction undertakings. Next is cultural construc-
 tion.  We must establish a complete primary education system and unfold a
 campaign to eliminate illiteracy.   Then we must intensify the suppression of
 counterrevolutionaries?so that not a single counterrevolutionary will remain
 in the soviet areas to take advantage of an enemy attack to create trouble
 in our interior.   Moreover, we must step up fund raising so as to secure
 insurance for our war chest.
 In order to realize rapidly the above tasks, it is necessary to eliminate
 thoroughly bureaucratism from among the working personnel of the soviet.
 Comrades of the electorate should heed supervising the soviet personnel so
 that bureaucratism cannot exist.  It is necessary to see to.-it that this
 year's election campaign will culminate in success so that a great many
 worker-peasant activists will through their winning in the elections come
 to work in the soviet and clear out bureaucratic elements among members of
 the old administration.  In this way, the realization of the different combat
 tasks of the soviet will be assured.
 Comrades of the electorate, every item of work mentioned above is a combat
 duty of ours and an indispensable prerequisite to smashing the fifth "en-
 circlement and suppression" campaign of the enemy.   And as we make this re-
 port to you today, the enemy is attacking us in.force and we are concentra-
 ting our forces for a decisive battle against this enemy.   The fighting is
 getting to be extremely tense.   Our work, therefore, must be tightened up
 to the highest degree.   The Central Government has promulgated an emergency
 war mobilization order to call upon the entire working personnel in the soviet
 to employ the spirit of shock troops to unfold their own work so as to make
 soviet work in its entirety meet with the demands of the frontline.  All mem-
 bers of the electorate must rally forthwith under this call of the Central
 Government.  Comrades, let us make use of this kind of work to exchange for
 final victory!  First of all, we would like to exchange for a great victory
 that will come before the opening of the Second National Congress of Soviets.
 Comrades, let us dedicate such a victory to the Second National Congress of
 Soviets!
 Expand the Red Army drastically!
 Enlarge the soviet areas drastically!
 Unfold soviet construction work in combat fashion!
 Smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign of the imperialist
 Kuomintang!

 OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON 'DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS
 41 BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN'
 [Text]  People of the whole country!
 Ever since the Kuomintang Nanking Government concluded an agreement with
 Japanese imperialism (calling for the sale of Manchuria and Mongolia to Japan
 and a truce in North China and the holding of the Dairen Conference in which
 China, Japan and "Manchukuo" gathered for a "social") the Kuomintang Nanking
 government not only has sold off Manchuria and Mongolia and the so-called
 "neutral region" of Lo-tung, but also has directly mobilized its armed
 strength to force, in coordination with troops of Japanese imperialism and
 "Manchukuo," anti-Japanese Manchurian soldiers to withdraw from Mongolia.
 It also has,  under the name of "suppression of bandits," massacred thousands
 of troops of the Northeast Anti-Japanese volunteer armies and revolutionary
 soldiers.  All over China, Chiang Kai-shek, the ringleader of the Kuomintang,
 issued a blatant proclamation to the effect that "people who talk wildly of
 resisting Japan will be summarily executed without leniency" and that "to
 extirpate the bandits it is necessary to stop resisting Japan."  Then he
 proceeded to suppress all anti-Japanese revolutionary movements with the
 most ruthless White terror, withdraw his North China garrisons according to
 plan and concentrate all his military might to launch a new, fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" campaign against the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist
 main force--the Chinese Soviet Government and the Chinese Workers and Peasants'
 Red Army--to demonstrate his loyalty to imperialism and realize his prede-
 termined plan of holding "direct negotiations between China and Japan."
 Since key figures of the Kuomintang held their third Lu-shan conference in
 September, direct negotiations between China and Japan have been carried
 out at an accelerated pace.  The scope of the negotiations obviously is not
 limited to the public acknowledgement of the Kuomintang government that
 Manchuria and Mongolia are colonies of Japanese imperialism.   In addition,
 it is certain that the Nanking government will be further submissive to Japan
 in its betrayal of the nation.   It will recognize North, China as within the

 sphere of influence of Japan in exchange for the latter's aid in money
 and arms to extend the reactionary influence of the Kuomintang government
 and carry out its fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign.  What is
 described as Japan's willingness to relinquish its "extraterritoriality in
 China" is, of course, nothing but a trick to hoodwink the Chinese people.
 People of the whole country!   The Kuomintang Nanking Government has sold
 off the Northeast Provinces and Inner Mongolia.  Now it soon will sell off
 all of North China.  At the same time, the Kuomintang Nanking Government and
 the Kuomintang governments of various other factions have sold off Tibet,
 Sikang and the greater portions of Szechwan to British imperialism and nine
 islands in the South China Sea and Yunnan and Kweichow to French imperialism.
 They also have sold off to British imperialism a multitude of political and
 economic privileges.  The big loan of several hundred million yuan and large
 quantities of murderous weapons that the Kuomintan Government has obtained
 from various imperialist countries in Europe and America were the price
 paid to it for selling out China.
 Its sell-out of the whole country, capitulation to imperialism and its
 serving as a scavenger of the imperialists in their partition of China have
 been the standing foreign policy of the Kuomintang government.   Precisely
 because of this, it is opposing all anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist revo-
 lutionary movements and carrying out its frenzied, desperate fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" campaign against the only anti-Japanese, anti-imperial-
 ist, people's own Soviet Government and Workers and Peasants' Red Army.  Pre-
 cisely because of this, it is helping the imperialists to intensify the
 exploitation of the Chinese people and create the total breakdown of China's
 national economy so as to cause flood, drought and famine to spread widely
 over China, workers to lose their jobs, peasants to lose their land, students
 to lose their  opportunity to attend school and the overwhelming majority of
 Chinese people to live in grievous and deplorable hell and eventually die
 of cold and hunger!
 People of the whole country!  The road that the Kuomintang wants us to take
 is one that will lead to the conversion of China into a colony, one that
 will lead to the complete destruction of the Chinese nation!
 The only way ahead for the revolutionary masses of the whole people is to
 unite as one, arm themselves, unfold a national revolutionary war against
 the invasion of Japanese imperialism and all other imperialism countries,
 overthrow all Kuomintang warlords who betray the country and bring shame
 on the nation, first of all, the principal cat's paw of the imperialist--
 the Nanking Kuomintang government headed by Chiang Kai-shek--and fight for
 the Chinese nation and the ultimate liberation of the Chinese people!

 proclaims to the people of the whole country that for the sake of striking

 The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic firmly be-
 lieves that this proposal can win the sympathy and active support of the
 laboring masses of the whole country and all other Chinese people with even
 a slight amount of patriotic blood running in their veins.   Such sympathy and
 support will guarantee the total victory of the soviet road in the decisive
 battle between the two roads of colonialism and sovietism and enable the
 Chinese nation and people of the whole country to win ultimate liberation
 from the iron heels of imperialism!

 warlords and maintaining the independence, unity and territorial integrity
 of China, it stands ready at all times to shed the last drop of blood.   In
 order to maintain the independence, unity and territorial integrity of China,
 the Soviet Central Government is in the process of concentrating all its
 strength and preparing to make all sacrifices to smash the fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" campaign of the imperialist Kuomintang.   The struggle
 to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign is a struggle to
 prevent China from taking the road of colonialism and struggle for a free
 and independent Soviet new China!
 In order to concentrate all the strength of the people of the whole country
 to engage in a decisive battle against China's most vicious enemy, the Pro-
 visional Central Government and Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee of
 the Chinese Soviet Republic once again propose hereby to all armed units taking
 part in attacks against soviet areas throughout the country the conclusion of
 a combat agreement on the current anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang fighting under
 the following three conditions:   (1)  Cease all attacks against the soviet
 areas immediately;  (2) guarantee immediately the democratic rights of the
 people (freedom of assembly, of association, of speech, of the press and of
 strike); and (3) arm the people and create armed volunteers immediately to
 defend China and fight for its independence, unity and territorial integrity.

 ON THE AWOL PROBLEM IN THE RED ARMY
 Order No. 25 of the Central Executive Committee
 15 December 1933
 [Text] Desertion is a sinister enemy of the Red Army and revolutionary war.
 The struggle against desertion is an important work to insure the combat ef-
 fectiveness of the Red Army.  In the past there was no uniform procedure to
 deal with the problem.  By this Order it is specially announced that
 (1)  Those who desert with their rifles shall be summarily executed by shoot-
 ing, without distinction, as soon as they are apprehended.
 (2)  Those who organize desertion (such as forging trip tickets) and lead a
 squad, a platoon, or a company in desertion shall be executed by shooting,
 without distinction, after being apprehended and put on public trial.
 (3)  Those who repeatedly desert and spread rumors to undermine the Red Army
 and the return-to-the-army campaign shall be uniformly apprehended and handed
 over to the courts for sentencing to penal servitude for a limited term or
 execution by shooting.
 (4)  What about those who desert individually for lack of political conscious-
 ness?  The various governments shall intensify propaganda and agitation directed
 at them and organize work to extend preferential treatment to their family
 dependents, so that they will return to the army of their own free will.  The
 governments must in no way adopt measures of arrest and imprisonment.  Any-
 one who does shall be dealt with as having violated the laws of the Soviet.
 (5)   If deserters stubbornly refuse to return to the army after having been
 subjected to propaganda and given explanations, the governments may, having
 obtained the countenance of the masses, require them to indemnify the state
 (army uniform and blanket) and the masses (labor force expended in connection
 with giving preferential treatment to their family  dependents) for losses
 incurred, and strip them of the right to vote.

 (6) It is absolutely not permissible to harbor a deserter and let him work
 or serve in various organs, army units, and public bodies in the rear.   In
 case the deserter is harbored in an organ, then the responsible official of
 the organ in question shall be subject to punishment by demotion, dismissal,
 or imprisonment.
 (7)  Those who fail to execute this order shall be dealt with as having aided
 and abetted desertion and undermined the Red Army.
 (8)  This order shall come into force from the date of promulgation.

 INVESTIGATION IN CH'ANG-KANG TOWNSHIP
 [Text]  The actual implementation of all soviet work rests with the township
 and city soviets.  Everyone understands this.  As to how the township and
 city soviets should perform their work, many people do not understand.  Not
 understanding the work of the township and city soviets will make it impos-
 sible to truly lead the work of the soviet or truly follow the principle
 that "all soviet work must be subordinated to the demands of the revolutionary
 war."  We have encountered the following situation among the work personnel
 of higher level soviets.  They issue many orders and decisions, but they are
 ignorant of the practical work condition of any township or city soviet.
 Comrades!  This won't do.  This is bureaucraticm, a hindrance to Soviet work!
 Our tasks have been proposed, and many plans, from expanding the Red Army to
 building bridges and roads, have been published.  The question is how to
 mobilize the masses to carry out the tasks and plans completely and. practically.
 The extraordinarily tense revolutionary war demands our prompt and general
 solution of this question.  Yet such a solution cannot be produced out of our
 mind. We must collect all kinds of fresh and concrete experiences in the pro-
 cess of mobilizing the masses to implement the various tasks, bring such ex-
 periences to a greater light and expand our mass mobilization, in order to
 adapt ourselves to greater tasks and plans.
 Currently, such serious errors as perfunctory performance of duty and coercion
 have occurred in the soviet organs of many areas.   The relationship between
 such soviets and the masses is extremely bad, greatly hampering the implemen-
 tation of the tasks and plans of the soviet.  On the other hand, innumerable
 lower level soviet work comrades in many areas have created excellent means
 to mobilize the masses.   Becoming one with the masses, they have been very
 successful in their work.  One responsibility of the higher level soviet
 personnel is to collect and arrange such good experiences and spread them over
 a vast area.   This work must be started immediately in all the provinces and
 counties.   The most effective means against bureaucraticism is to demonstrate
 by live models.

 Limited by time and the material of the informants, the experiences of
 Ch'ang-kang township collected here only include a brief summary of the
 major items of their work.  Nevertheless, just such summary alone is suf-
 ficient to arouse our serious'attention and make us solemnly praise their
 work as "the model of Soviet work."  As their relationship with the masses
 is extremely close, they have produced a great effect in their work.  Our
 goal is to bring to light such experiences and to collect more experiences
 to serve as concrete models to all the backward township and city soviets,
 so that their work will be raised to the level of the advanced, rally mil-
 lions of people around the soviet and adapt all soviet work to the demand
 of smashing the enemy encirclement.
 Subdivided from Lang-mu township in the same district, Ch'ang-kang township
 belongs to Shang-she District, Hsing-kuo county, Kiangsi Province.
 The work levels of Shang-she District were:  First, Ch'ang-kang and Lang-mu;
 second, Yang-ch'en; third, Ho-fu, Hsiu-shui and T'ang-shih; fourth, Jen-
 t'ien and Shang-she.
 Ch'ang-kang township includes Ch'ang-kang, Tang-pei, Hsin-ch'i and Szu-
 kang, a total of four villages.
 1.  The township had 437 households, including 1,784 persons.  Of these,
 320 were away serving in the Red Army or performing work and 1,464 (including
 part-time laborers and district and township work personnel) resided in the
 township.  Among the township residents, there were 1,286 middle and poor
 peasants, 102 workers, farm laborers and coolies and 76 landlords and rich
 peasants.

 Existing rich peasants:  11 households, including 72 persons
 Wives and daughters of landlords marrying workers and peasants uncovered in
 the August land investigations:   6 persons
 36 tan, 6 tan of land were repossessed from the 6 persons.  No other land-
 lord or rich peasant was uncovered.
 II.  Delegates' Congress
 1.  The Congress
 The daily agenda was always:   (1)  opening of meeting; (2) reports; (3) dis-
 cussions; (4) others; (5) adjournment.  The agenda was written on paper and
 posted.  The concrete issues for discussion were written down by the chair-
 man but not posted.  In regard to "reports," the chairman would first report
 on the reason for the meeting, some 20 or 30 sentences.  Then the "attending
 comrade" of the district soviet would make his report about the political
 situation and the work condition. (Someone from the district soviet attended
 almost every meeting, mostly department members, 5 or 6 times out of 10,
 seldom department chiefs, only about 2 or 3 times out of 10.  The chairman
 and vice chairman rarely came, only once out of 10 times.)  The chairman and
 the branch secretary would supplement his report with matters not covered by
 him.   "Discussions" always concerned concrete issues.  At the meeting on
 8 November, for instance, the following items were discussed:
 (1)  Military mobilization.  The subject was subdivided as follows:
 (a)  Expanding the Red Army:  The Ch'ang-kang Village delegate promised to
 recruit 5 persons, the Tang-pei Village delegate 4, the Hsin-ch'i Village
 delegate 3 and the Szu-kang Village delegate 3, totalling 15, to be accom-
 plished by 30 November.   (b)                    Preferential treatment of Red Army families.
 It was decided that the model cultivation team and the labor mutual aid
 association would mobilize together.   (c)  Return-to-the-ranks movement:
 There were 7 AWOL's in the township.   It was decided that the propaganda
 teams (township village) and the surprise attack teams (organized by Red Army
 wives) would carry out the work.   (d)  Comforting the Red Army:  Each village
 promised to give 4 towels and a quantity of yellow hemp and cloth straw-
 sandals.   Ch'ang-kang pledged 110 pairs, Tang-pei 100 pairs, Hsing-ch'i 90
 pairs and Szu-kang 100 pairs.
 (2)   Economic mobilization.   The subject was subdivided as follows:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (a)   Economic construction public bonds:   The township pledged to sell 5,456
 yuan of bonds.   It had received 822 tan of grain, valued at 4,110 yuan and
 127 yuan in cash, totalling 4,237 yuan.  It was still 1,219 yuan short of
 the goal.   It was decided that the delegates must "devote their effort" to
 propaganda and fulfill the pledge by 25 November.   (b)  Cooperatives:  Only
 the district had a consumer cooperative in the past, but now the township
 organized a branch cooperative.  However, it had only collected 100-odd yuan
 in shares.  The masses had pledged 350 yuan.  It was decided that the dele-
 gates must propagandize in order to collect the money, and the propaganda team
 must also put in its effort.   (c)  The thrift movement:  It was decided that
 more vegetables must be planted and grain saved in preparation for spring
 famine.
 (3)  Repair of river dikes and roads:  It was decided that in the 10 days
 between 20 and 30 November, the 6 li of thoroughfare at Chiang-pei-tung must
 be completed, 6 ch'ih wide.  Other roads, 4 ch'ih wide, would be undertaken
 afterward.  Five preparation committee members were elected.  After the roads
 were completed, the 10 ch'ih wide river dike destroyed by flood would be
 repaired.  The large wooden bridge will be repaired jointly with Lang-mu
 township.
 (4)  "Supporting the district soviet."  For the masses of the entire hsiang
 to show their support of the third district wide soviet congress beginning
 12 November, it was decided that a red tablet made with 1.4 ch'ih of red
 cloth with an inscription of 4 characters, would be presented as a gift.   On
 12 November, 90 percent of the masses of the township were mobilized into
 teams to proceed to the soviet and set off fireworks.   (Finally, 800 percent
 of them set off 5,000 or 6,000 firecrackers, all bought by the masses themselves.)
 The two last items were discussed under "Others" in the agenda.  All the
 subjects of discussion were proposals of voters at the election mass meeting,
 which were transmitted to the township soviet for discussion.
 2. 'Inspection System
 Of the two delegates' congresses, one was to discuss problems and the other
 to inspect work.
 Before each work inspection congress, the on-duty delegates of the villages
 summoned the delegates under them to hold a meeting.   The on-duty delegates
 then reported the results at the delegates' congress.  Afterward, items which
 had not been carried out, or successfully carried out, were discussed in
 order to carry them out or correct them.
 This method was started in Lang-mu township.   Ch'ang-kang township adopted
 it after being subdivided out of Lang-mu township.  Subsequently, Yang-ch'en
 township also followed suit.  Recently, the district soviet called a district
 wide work inspection meeting and asked all the townships to adopt the method.

 3.  On-duty Delegates
 The numbers of delegates of the villages:
 Ch'ang-kang Village:  Over 500 population (at the time of land division)--
 14 delegates.
 Tang-pei Village:  Over 490 population--14 delegates.
 Hsin-ch'i Village: Over 300 population--13 delegates.
 Szu-kang Village:  Over 400 population--14 delegates.
 Work levels of the villages:  First, Ch'ang-kang; second, Tang-pei; third,
 Hsin-ch'i; fourth, Szu-kang.
 Each village had an "on-duty delegate" by rotation among the delegates for
 10-day periods.  It was started in September.  Before that, it was the "chair-
 man delegate" system, and one person was designated to serve as the chairman.
 After 2 years, the chairman, system was found defective.  As the responsibili-
 ties were given to one person, the others had no chance to practice, while
 rotation would remedy the defect.  But the on-duty system (actually 10-day
 duty) also had its defects.  The weak delegates were unable to lead the vil-
 lage.
 4.   Standing Committee
 Since the formation of the soviet, there was always a standing committee.
 The standing committee included a chairman, vice chairman, secretary, Chinese
 Communist Party branch secretary and Young Communist League branch secretary,
 totalling five persons.   When necessary, the on-duty delegates attended the
 meetings.
 5.   Delegates in Charge of Residents
 Each delegate was in charge of over 20 to over 50 residents.  Delegate Li
 Ch'iu-ying of Ch'ang-kang village, for instance, was in charge of over 50
 residents.
 Each delegate had a residents' handbook, divided into sections on adult male,
 adult female, male vanguard team (could serve as full-time laborers), female
 vanguard team (could serve as part-time laborers), male children and female
 children.   The male adults were further divided into those serving in the
 Red.Guard (could serve as full-time laborers) and those not serving in the
 Red Guard (could serve as part-time laborers).   The female adults were also
 divided into those serving in the Red Guard (could serve as part-time laborers)
 and those not serving in the Red Guard (could receive preferential treatment
 as families of the Red Army).

 6.   Changes of Delegates
 Before the new administrative divisions were made, Lang-mu township (7
 villages, population 3,000) elected over 70 delegates and 11 substitute dele-
 gates in the November election last year, totalling over 80, including 16
 women and over 60 men.  By the time of reelection on 1 November this year,
 only 5 men delegates were left.  Most of them had joined the Red Army and
 a small number had been transferred in their work.  Some 29 of them left
 at one time in Red May.  Before leaving, every department delegate called
 a meeting of the masses under his charge to elect an "acting delegate."
 7.  Political Manifestations of the Delegates
 Excellent--60 percent.
 Medium--35 percent.
 Inferior--5 percent (4 persons).
 The four inferior ones included two men and two women.  Very stupid and not
 positive, they attended only 4 of the 10 meetings and would not listen or
 express themselves at the meetings.   Their attitude toward the masses was
 "crude."  The masses did not like them and elected others to replace them in
 July.
 8.  The 16 Women Delegates
 Excellent--8 of them.  They looked for work to do and performed well.
 Medium--6 of them.  They did not look for work to do, but only did what was
 assigned to them.  They did not do the work well, and required help.
 Inferior--2 of them.   They did not do what was assigned to them.
 The delegates' congress of Ch'ang-kang township has many excellent creations,
 such as the standing committee, on-duty delegates, delegates in charge of
 residents, and inspection system, which all deserve emulation by other areas.
 The standing committee, however, should be renamed the presidium (7 members
 for the large townships; 5 for the small townships).  The on-duty delegate
 should be changed to the "chairman delegate," selecting the best delegate
 to serve a 1- or 2-month term.   It is too frequent to change every 10 days.
 The problems discussed at the meetings were very practical,. but the five empty
 items on the daily agenda should be abolished.  Why not post the list of
 concrete issues to be discussed?  The inspection system of Ch'ang-kang
 township is very good.   It is a means for the full performance of work and
 speed in performance.   The inferior delegates should have been replaced much
 sooner.   Replacing them by reelection 8 months later was too long.   Electing
 a replacement immediately upon the departure of a delegate was correct, but
 the replacement should not be called an "acting delegate."

 1.   The Election Committee
 Nine members:.  Chinese Communist Party branch secretary, Chinese Communist
 Women's manager, farm laborers' branch chief, handicraft branch chief, poor
 peasants' league chairman and a member, production brigade leader, and two
 township delegates.  The branch secretary served as the chairman.   It was
 organized in September.
 The county soviet originally decided to hold the election at the end of Sep-
 tember, but the date was changed twice, and was finally set at the beginning
 of November.
 2.   Election Propaganda
 In the propaganda, it was explained that the classes had not been clearly
 distinguished in the past, but now they were clearly distinguished.   There-
 fore, there must be an election.  It was also explained that, for the pur-
 pose of breaking the encirclement and for the purpose of inspecting the work
 and making it more advanced, there must be an election.
 3.   Voter Registration
 All four villages made up record books for the delegates to register the
 residents under their charge.   The books were then submitted to the election
 committee which compiled the lists and posted them.  Those with voting rights
 were on the first list, those under age 16 who had no voting rights on the
 second list.  And landlords and rich peasants who were also without voting
 rights on the third list.   The first and second lists were red in color and
 the third one white.  The three lists were posted at the gates of the four
 villages and the township soviet.  The voters' books were actually completed
 in September but, as the family members of workers were not classified as
 workers in the books, the error was rectified last month, and the lists re-
 published.   Some people among the masses were not clear about the distinction
 of criteria btween electing "worker" and "peasant" delegates.  Less than 10
 percent of the people in the hsiang correctly understood the issue of "work-
 er leadership."
 Each of the four villages was an election unit, and there was also a worker
 unit.
 5.  Work Report
 Voters' meetings were held on 2 different days (19 and 20 October), 2
 villages on the first day and 2 on the second.

 The chairman made reports in Ch'ang-kang and Tang-pei villages on 2 differ-
 ent days.  The vice chairman (who was the branch secretary) made reports in
 Hsin-ch'i and Szu-kang villages also on 2 different days.  The reports included
 military mobilization, economic construction and other work, altogether three
 items.
 After the report, the candidates' list was voted on.   The masses attending
 the meeting were asked to criticize the work of the  hsiang soviet, but no one
 did.
 The party branch managers' committee held a meeting on 19 October.  All the
 villages were represented (11 persons attending).  According to the ratio
 of workers and peasants in the villages, a list of 55 persons was drafted,
 exactly the number of delegates to be elected.   It was then distributed to
 the party cells, labor unions and poor peasants' leagues of the various vil-
 lages for discussion, proposed by the party members of the cells who made
 work reports at the voters' mass meetings, and passed, thus eliminating the
 procedure of preparing the list by the election committee.
 The list was published by posting it at the gates of the four villages and
 the township soviet.
 7.   Election Mass Meeting
 The workers' meeting, which was held at the township soviet, had a 90 per-
 cent attendance, the remainder being absent due to illness.  The peasants'
 meetings were held separately in the four villages, with a 93 percent
 attendance.  The meetings were started in the forenoon.  Upon entering the
 door, a voter would write the word "present" on his own name on the list.
 (The list had 24 spaces, printed and distributed by the county soviet, and
 the names of 24 voters were written thereon).  One man was posted at the
 door as guard.  Some children loitered outside, and a few of them came in.
 Knowing that they had no share in the election, no landlord or rich peasant
 showed up.
 Procedure:   Reports were made by the election committee member, the town-
 ship soviet chairman and the district soviet attending comrade.  The voters
 were asked whether they had any opinion.   (None).   The names on the candi-
 dates' list were introduced one by one and voted on.   (No vote in the nega-
 tive).  The proposals were discussed.   (Someone proposed that all those in
 the township age 16 to 45 in good health should proceed to the front line.
 It was passed by the majority.  In addition, the "military affairs," "eco-
 nomy" and "dikes and roads" proposals discussed at the delegates' meeting
 on 8 November were all proposed at the election mass meeting this time.)

 The meeting opened at 1000 after all participants had arrived, and adjourned
 at 1600. (The spirit was very good.)
 8.  Delegate Components
 Among the 55 delegates, 36 were most positive and 19 medium.  No inferior
 ones were discovered.        -
 Among the. delegates, 60 percent (over 30 of them) were old delegates who
 were reelected to their current positions, and 40 percent were  newly elected.
 9.  Delegates' Congress After the Election
 The first delegates' congress was held the next day after the election
 (5 November) in the forenoon, and it elected a chairman, a vice chairman,
 a secretary, and the delegates to the district mass meeting (10 persons).
 Three comrades from the district soviet attended the meeting.   The second
 congress was held the 4th day after the election (8 November) to discuss
 the proposals of the election mass meeting (see above).
 The defects in the election in Ch'ang-kang township this time were:
 (1)   In the propaganda, it was not pointed out that the Soviet was the
 political power for the masses to manage their own life, and that it was
 the most important right of the masses.   (2)  The number of people on the
 candidates' list was exactly the same as the number of delegates to be
 elected when it should have'been twice as many.   Therefore, the masses
 did not express any criticism of the candidates' list.   The election com-
 mittee did not produce any effect on the issue of formulating the candidates'
 list.   There was only party activity.   (3)   The work report meeting did not
 do its best to urge the masses to criticize the work of the township soviet.
 Aside from such defects, everything was successful.
 IV.   Committees Under the Township Soviet
 The following were the mass organizations, divided into village and town-
 ship levels.   The village committees had five members, and the township
 commissioner served as the chairman.
 Most of the township committees had 5 members, because there were village
 committees, but at times there were 7, 9, or 11 members.
 1.   Committee to Expand the Red Army
 A total of 7 members, including 3 delegates, to discuss "expansion," "pre-
 ferential treatment," "comforting" and "welcome."  The comforting team (7
 members, including a team leader and 4 delegates, 1 man and 3 women; the
 remaining 3 consisted of 1 man and 2 women) carried peanuts, beans, vege-
 tables and straw sandals to the hospitals and county seat, and once to
 Huang-p'o Hsiao-pu,  to comfort the Red Army.

 Seven members.   Several meetings were held during the land investigation
 movement in September, and the 36 tan of land uncovered in the previous
 month were disposed of.  No meeting has been held since.
 It should be changed to the agricultural experimental farm managing com-
 mittee.                     A farm products exhibition hall should be established in the ex-
 perimental farm.
 3.   Land Registration Committee
 Five members, 1 in each village.   The chairman was regularly stationed
 there.  Organized in July, it was active for 2 months.  After the regis-
 tration was completed, the meals for the chairman was discontinued.
 Method:  The committee members went to the villages and gathered the in-
 formation from the delegates for registration.  When the delegates did not
 have the information, the committee members visited the households concerned.
 The registration was not completed in August because they did not understand
 the contents of the forms.   It was completed after a 1-month extension.
 Five members.   Besides the chairman, there was one in each village, in
 charge of planting and protection.
 Some trees were planted, but did not flourish because of inferior soil.
 They should have been planted along rivers, roads, and houses.
 If many trees on a private hill were to be chopped down, the owner must
 consult the committee member, but if only a few, he did not have to do so.
 There was provision as to the size of the trees.
 Five members, in charge of directing the "water conservation" and "bridge"
 committees.
 6.  Water Conservation Committee
 Five members.   Besides the chairman, there was one member in each village.
 7.  Bridge Committee
 Five members, in charge of bridge and road repairs.   Should be called bridge
 and road committee.

 8.   State Owned Property Committee
 Five members. It was there, but what it did is unknown.
 9.   Granary Committee
 It was in charge of the care of public bond grain and the grain of Red
 Army public fields.
 The famine preparation granary was also under its care.   The grain from
 the 36 tan of confiscated land, totalling over 10 tan, was stored for
 famine preparation.
 10.   Confiscation Committee
 Three members, in charge of fines and donations.
 From September on, the landlords paid 9 yuan in fines and the rich peasants
 donated 225 yuan (11 households, donating from 10 to over 40 yuan each).
 In the past, the farms, hills and woods, buildings, plow animals and farm
 tools of the rich peasants were all confiscated, and the rich peasants were
 only allocated some inferior land, but no hills.  Now, they had to lease plow
 animals and farm tools from others.  As for their cash on hand, they were
 either "fined" in the past or at present.   One could not call it donation.
 Currently, their living condition is even worse than the farm laborers.   (It
 must be pointed out that Ch'ang-kang township's policy on the rich peasants
 is erroneous.)
 11.   Land Investigation Committee
 Nine members.  No longer in existence.
 12.   Education Committee
 Nine members.
 13.   Public Health Committee
 Five members.  Organized in April.
 14.   Air and Poison Defense Committee
 Five members.  Organized in October; 4 or 5 meetings were held.
 15.   Preparation Committee
 Organized for the purpose of the commemoration meeting.

 The "village" committees of Ch'ang-kang township (the villages have many
 of the committees) have expanded the contact of the Soviet with the masses.
 It is an excellent creation when Soviet work has developed to a high degree.
 As the villages have 5-member committees, many of the township committees
 only need 5 members.  Moreover, as 4 of the 5 members of each of the town-
 ship committees serve as the chaimen of the 4 village committees, a network
 is formed, and it is a great help to the work of the delegates' congress.
 However, the comrades of Ch'ang-kang township regard the committees as mass
 organizations in the same category as the labor unions and poor peasants'
 leagues.   They do not know that they are a part of the Soviet.  This is not
 proper.   The "construction committee" can be abolished.   In regard to the
 "land committee," in areas such as Hsing-kuo where the land struggle is in-
 tense, it should be changed to the agricultural experimental farm committee.
 "Grain," "census," "worker-peasant procurators" and "Red alert" committees
 should be added.   Provisions on these have been made in the "local Soviet
 Organization Law" promulgated by the Central Government.
 V.  Local Troops
 1.  Organization
 (1)  One platoon of men's Red Guards
 Age 24 to 45; the township had a total of 66 men within this age bracket.
 Except the chairman, the secretary and the seriously ill or crippled, total-
 ling over 20 persons, who were not included, all those of this age bracket
 were organized into it, totalling 46.
 One platoon leader, 1 assistant platoon leader, 6 squad leaders, and 6
 assistant squad leaders; one flag.
 (2)  One company of women's Red Guard
 Of the same age bracket; the township had a total of 146 women (more than
 twice the number of men).   Except the 20 or more sick or crippled, all were
 organized into it, totalling 120.   One company commander, one assistant com-
 mander, one political director, three platoon leaders, three assistant platoon
 leaders, nine squad leaders and nine assistant squad leaders, all female;
 one flag.
 (3)  One brigade of Young Pioneers
 Both men and women, age 16 to 23, were included in the brigade.   The town-
 ship had 21 men and 80 women (4 times the men) of this age bracket, total-
 ling 101.   Except about 15 crippled (club-foot, etc.), all were organized
 into it, totalling 86.

 Brigade commander and assistant commander one each.  Divided into one men's
 platoon and two women's platoons, each with a leader and an assistant leader.
 2.   Training
 (1)   Platoon drill
 The village as the unit, twice a month, separating the Red 'Guard and the
 Young Pioneers, men and women drilling together.
 Instructors:  Women's assistant company commander in Ch'ang-kang; women's
 company commander in T'ang-pei.  Young Pioneers had one woman and three men
 as instructors.  Items of drill:  Attention, at ease, left and right face,
 ch'a-tang-tzu, marching, running (seldom women), dispersal, and field work
 (3- or 4-li distance).
 Weapons:   Mostly sights, some wooden guns.
 Politics class:  Drill first and lecture afterward.   The political director
 lectured on the revolutionary situation, imperialism, tasks of the Red Guard,
 etc.   No set text (lecturing at random).
 Time:  Afternoon, roughly 1400 to 1800, 2-1/2 hours of drilling and 1-1/2
 hours of lecturing.
 Attendance:  Averaging 70 percent.
 (2)   Company drill
 The township as the unit, on the 15th of every month.
 Items of drill:  Each platoon went through the drill to determine the
 superior ones.   The accomplishments of the platoons in drilling were in-
 spected.
 Politics class:  After the drill, the director discussed the political
 situation.
 Time:   4 hours in the afternoon.   Currently, as the weather was cold in
 winter  and there was more time, it has been changed to the forenoon.
 3.  Service Work
 (1)   Transport
 Men served as full-time laborers (those over 45 years of age and not
 organized into the Red Guard served part-time).

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Women served as part-time laborers (some of them were selected and assigned
 to areas such as inside the city, Kao-shing-yu and Ch'a-ling).  Women also
 were assigned to rescue and nursing work (some of them were selected to
 organize rescue and nursing platoons; in readiness; no work) and laundry de-
 tail (more than 10 from each village who were not tied down by young children
 were selected and organized into laundry details; went to the replacement
 division and instructors team in Shao-chi-wo several times and Ch'a-ling
 two or three times  to do laundry).
 (2)  Night patrol
 Ch'ang-kang, T'ang-pei and Szu-kang had a total of three patrol stations,
 one shift per night, 5 or 6 persons%per shift.   The Red Guard and the Young
 Pioneers each sent several members to take turns performing the task, under
 the supervision of the squad leader or assistant leader.  One person stood
 guard and the rest slept.  The patrol would ask for the password (answer:
 "Ordinary citizen," followed with name, destination and purpose.  Actually,
 the people did not know the password) and check the road slip (someone from
 another township passing through).  No bad people have ever been caught.
 (3)  Daytime inspection
 Three persons were responsible during the day, one from the Red Guard, one
 from the Young Pioneers, and one from the children's league.  When anyone
 passed through, one would check his road slip (children's leaguer) and another
 would question him (Red Guard or Young Pioneer).  Messages would be delivered
 when necessary.   The Tang-pei patrol station caught four or five deserters
 and delivered them to the district government.   "Ordinary citizens" arrested
 someone without a road slip (when he took a small path in the hills), who
 came from another county, was very ferocious, suspected of being a spy and
 delivered to the county government.
 (4)  Air defense
 The air and poison defense committee of the township instructed the masses
 on air defense and asked them to give their attention to the following:
 They must not run around when the planes come.
 They must dig air-raid caves.   Several households could dig one together.
 In process, but not yet completed.
 In case of poison gas, they must cover their noses with a handkerchief.  Those
 returned from field maneuvers said that charcoal dust should be wrapped in
 a handkerchief to cover the nose.
 Every village had a signal gun station, manned by two persons.  When one
 was away, the other reamined ready to fire the signal gun:

 All young and adult laboring masses should be organized into the Red Guard
 or the Young Pioneers and given the proper military and political training,
 in order to defend the locality on the one hand and be ready to go to the
 front on the other.   It is an important task of the soviet in the domestic
 war.  Ch'ang-kang township has been successful in this aspect.
 VI.  The Living Condition of the Masses
 1.  Famine was encountered this year.  Some 80 percent of the masses ac-
 tually had no grain before spring planting this year, and rice had to be
 procured from such distant areas as Tung-ku, Sha-ts'un, Fu-t'ien, and Shui-
 nan.                  The 80 percent of the masses averaged exactly 1 month of grain shortage.
 Each person needed 5 tan a year, or 4 tan a month.  Eighty percent of the
 1,500 population of the township was 1,200, and 1 month's grain for them
 amounted to 480 tan.  The amount was procured from distant areas, and no one
 went hungry.
 2.   Though spring cultivation this year was good, the fall harvest was in-
 ferior due to insects, only equivalent to that of last year.  Nevertheless,
 (1) the fall cultivation was good, and there was a 40 percent increase in
 both potatoes and beans over last year.   (2)  Vegetables, broadbeans, snow
 peas and rape were added in winter planting.   (3)  After fall harvest last
 year, the masses sold large volumes of grain to the merchants, at only 2,800
 wen per tan, not quite 1 yuan.  While they needed the money, they could have
 sold less, but no attention was given to it.   This year a county-wide meeting
 was held.   It was decided that grain would not be sold for less than 4 yuan,
 and the volumes would be smaller.  (4)  After fall harvest last year, much
 was wasted on feeding hogs and ducks and chicken, but this year, less would
 be used for this purpose.   (5) Last year, for the public bonds of the first
 and second periods, 2 yuan of public bonds required 2.5 tan of grain.   This
 year, 10 yuan of public bonds would only require 2 tan of grain.  There would,
 therefore, be no famine in the coming spring.
 3.  Surplus in Oil.  The peanut harvest this year was better than last, and
 peanuts could be made into oil. Every household had been allocated some wooded
 hills, and they also had some oil.  Oil was ample.  There was even a surplus.
 4.  Beans could be traded for oil, but the amount of edible salt had been
 greatly reduced.   The bean harvest this year was good (watering was even;
 last year, almost the entire crop was ruined by flood), and the price of beans
 was good (last year it was 9 yuan per tan; this year, it was 12 yuan).   Beans
 could be traded for 60 percent of the edible salt needed by the township.
 The 40 percent remainder could be made up by trading the surplus oil (30 per-
 cent surplus in oil).
 The average per capita need of salt was 4/10 ounce [Chinese unit] per day
 (or 12 ounces a month).   It was reduced to half in July this year--2/10 ounce
 (or 6 ounces a month).   In November it was a little over 3/10 ounce (or appoxi-
 mately 10 ounces a month).  The masses used sour pickle juice and declared

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 that it was not much different from salt.   (This was the crime of the
 Kuomintang. Only by breaking down the blockade would there be salt).
 5.  Meat eating poor peasants doubled and workers tripled.  About 85 percent
 of the households "raised hogs," and 15 percent of them were unable to do so.
 They sold an average of 20 yuan's worth of hogs a year and bought about 12
 yuan's worth of pork per household, leaving a surplus of 8 yuan.   Before the
 uprising, they only bought an average of 10 yuan's worth of pork per house-
 hold per year.  According to the classes, before the uprising, the middle
 peasants bought about 12 yuan's worth of pork, the poor peasants about 6
 yuan's worth and the workers about 4 yuan's worth.  Now, almost all of them
 spent 12 yuan. (Some among them did not spend so much.)   In the past, let
 alone market days, not much meat was eaten even for the New Year and festi-
 vals.               Now, in addition to the New Year and festivals, everyone would buy
 some meat on market days.
 6.   The chickens and ducks, which were mostly sold in the past, were now
 mostly consumed by the peasants themselves.
 7.   The living condition improved, and less firewood was sold.  There was
 no lack of firewood in the locality.   In the past, more firewood was carried
 to the city to be sold.   Now, the amount sold was 30 percent less, because
 many people did not need to sell it any more.
 8.   The amount of clothes doubled.   For all wearing apparel, the average need
 per year per capita was one new unlined suit.  The middle peasants remained
 the same as before, but the poor peasants and workers had a 100 percent im-
 provement.   They now had the ability to spend twice as much on clothes than
 they did before.
 9.   The living condition of the farm laborers improved.  There were about 22
 households of farm laborers in the township and 60 percent of them were bet-
 ter off than the poorest of the poor peasants, because they had been allocated
 things.  The township had only 2 landowner households, but many things were
 confiscated from the rich peasants (12 households) and sent down from the
 cities.  The living condition of the remaining 40 percent of the farm laborers
 was the same as the poor peasants.
 10.   The middle peasants remained at the same position.   Generally speaking,
 the living condition of the.middle peasants was about the same as in the past.
 (The soviet must give attention to improving the living condition of the
 middle peasants.)
 11.   Rest and Labor of the Masses.   Each person averaged 5 full days of meet-
 ings (totalling the many meetings) a month, which served as rest periods for
 them.   As many people had left the area and the labor force in the township
 had reduced, the labor intensity of the masses was the same as before the
 uprising, but the significance of labor had changed.

 The soviet is the organizer of the mass life.  Only when it devotes all
 its effort to solving the problems of the masses, improving their living
 condition and gaining their confidence before it can mobilize the broad
 masses to join the Red Army, help in the war and struggle for the smashing
 of the enemy encirclement.  We must know that the great achievement of Ch'ang-
 kang township war mobilization was indivisible from its achievement in im-
 proving the life of the masses.
 VII.   Balancing of the Labor Force and the Plow Animal Problem
 Each of the 4 villages had 1 team, totalling about 70 persons. They were
 organized with Red Army family members who had labor force.  Led by a team
 leader, each team was divided into subunits.  The 20 or more members of the
 Ch'ang-kang village model cultivation team, for instance, was divided into
 3 subunits of 3 to 7 members according to the proximity of their residences.
 Each subunit was in charge of several to a dozen or more households nearby,
 giving constant attention to their proper handling of production.   The teams
 were organized last August at the time of rice harvesting, and their function
 was to balance the labor force.
 Method:   The labor mutual aid association helped the Red Army families to
 farm the land (no charge for wages), while the model team helped the masses
 with their cultivation (wages charged).   For instance, when a mutual aid
 association member had to help a Red Army family to cultivate while his own
 farm required cultivation, the model team would send someone to help culti-
 vate his land for him, or to take his place to help the Red Army family in-
 stead, and he would pay wages to the model team member.  The labor force was
 thus balanced.   Therefore, the model team and the mutual aid association must
 keep in close contact.
 Each of the four villages had a labor mutual aid association.   Except the
 Red Army families, 80 percent of those possessing labor power joined.   The
 township had over 300 association members.
 Among the population of the hsiang:
 Persons performing full labor--10 percent (about 150 persons).
 Persons performing half labor--20 percent (about 300 persons).
 Persons performing half labor--20 percent (about 300 persons).
 Persons performing incidental labor--35 percent (about 525 persons).

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Persons performing no labor--30 percent (about 450 persons).
 Most of the first two categories, totalling about 450 persons, joined the
 mutual aid association.
 Of the 320 persons away from their homes in township (226 serving with the
 Red Army, and 94 performing work), except for 10 or more belonging to the
 half-labor category, they all belonged to the "full-labor" category.   Com-
 pared with the remaining 150 persons performing "full-labor" in the township,
 the ratio was 68 percent to 32 percent.   Therefore, organized balancing of
 labor power became a central issue in production and the masses enthusiasti-
 cally welcomed the labor mutual aid association.
 The function of the mutual aid association was the preferential treatment
 of Red Army families, mutual aid among members and helping the "orphaned and
 aged."  All the goals were reached.  As a whole, the farms of Red Army fami-
 lies were successfully cultivated.                     The method was as follows:
 Preferential treatment of Red Army families:   In regard to the Red Army
 families in the township during busy seasons, each household required an
 average of about 25 work units of help per month; during ordinary times, an
 average of about 10 works units.   The masses rendered help according to their
 ability.   Those with more labor force rendered more help, those with less
 rendered less help and those without rendered no help.  Women with young
 children seldom rendered help.   Generally, during busy seasons, where all
 members in a household could perform labor, the household would contribute
 13 or 14 work units.  Where it had only 1/2 labor force, it would contribute
 1 or 2 units of light work.   In regard to those who rendered less help than
 they should,  they must pay those who rendered more help.  During a busy season,
 for instance, when household A contributed only 5 work units a month to Red
 Army families when it should have been 7 units while household B contributed
 9 work units when it should have been 7, household A must pay household B
 the wages for the 2 units.
 Mutual aid among members:   The work units were mutually offset.   Those who
 did less work would pay wages to those who did more work according to the
 number of work units.
 Helping the orphaned and aged:  Only meals for the members rendering help
 were provided; no charge of wages.
 Over-all production plans with the village as the unit were formulated and
 the manpower balanced.
 Account was settled at the end of every month and the wages computed.   (More
 people took money in payment.  Less took articles.  Accounts were always
 cleared.)

 Wages:   Rice harvesting work this year was divided into three levels.   The
 highest was 800 wen (such as threshing), next was 640 wen (such as cutting
 rice stalks, and carrying the stalks), and the lowest was 320 wen (such as
 taking the rice and bean dibbling).   The above was decided at the membership
 mass meeting in July (attended by up to 100 members).  In regard to the rice
 harvesting wages last year, it was 800 wen at the beginning and rose to a
 maximum of 1,400 wen at the busiest time.
 Wage reduction:  Wage reduction was supported by the farm laborers union
 because, with the land allocation, they were short of manpower. .
 Those with more labor force did not object either, because they must con-
 tribute much work to Red Army families.
 The mutual aid association had five committee members, including a chairman,
 an organizer and a propagandist.  It was under the guidance of the fall har-
 vesting and fall cultivation committee of the township.
 The great effect of the labor mutual aid association on agricultural produc-
 tion has been clearly demonstrated in Ch'ang-kang township.    According to
 the desire of the masses, overall planning of production with the village as
 the unit can be introduced in all areas, especially in areas where there have
 been many Red Army recruits.  When necessary, township or even the district
 can be taken as the unit for overall planning.   It was what Ts'ai-ch'i Dis-
 trict, Shang-hang, did.   The cultivation team may be merged with the labor
 mutual aid association, in order to unify the organization.   There is an
 important issue here:  Mobilizing the women to join production.   The young
 people and adults between age 16 and 45 in Ch'ang-kang township numbered 733.
 Of these, 320 left home, to join the Red Army or perform other work, leaving
 413 in the township, consisting of 87 men and 326 women (a ratio of 1 to 4).
 Therefore, Ch'ang-kang township relied mostly on women for its production.
 The township proposed the slogan that "women must learn to plow," and entire
 groups of women had joined the production front.   It proved that organized
 balancing of manpower and activating women to join production are tasks which
 cannot be separated.   That Ch'ang-kang township's production not only did not
 drop, but increased, was because they had successfully solved this problem.
 Ch'ang-kang township began to organize the plow animal cooperative in Sep-
 tember, one in each village, but had not yet completed the task.  Not many
 people joined the cooperative.   There was a five-man committee.
 The average was 25 cows per 100 households.   The township had a total of
 110 cows.
 No household had two cows.

 Among those owning cows, 50 percent of the households had one cow (mostly
 calves, costing 10 and odd yuan per head).
 15 percent of the households had one cow per two families.
 30 percent of the households had one cow per three or four families.
 5 percent of the households had one cow per five families (at times per seven
 families--large buffaloes).
 25 percent of the households had no cow.  Among the 437 households in the
 township, 109 had no cow.   The plow animal cooperative had not yet discussed
 its solution.
 No cow was permitted to be slaughtered.   When an animal should be slaughtered
 due to illness or age, the owner must notify in advance the hsiang soviet,
 which would inspect the animal before granting permission.  No one dared to
 kill a cow deliberately.
 Under the current agricultural technical condition, the function of the plow
 animal is just below manpower.  According to information of Shih-shui town-
 ship Jui-chin (30 percent of the households had no cow), Ch'ang-kang township,
 Hsing-kuo (25 percent) and Ts'ai-ch'i township, Shang-hang (20 percent), we
 know that peasants without plow animals constitute about 25 percent of the
 peasant population.   This is a big problem.   For its solution, nothing can
 surpass leading the masses to organize plow animal cooperatives and buy animals
 by pooling their funds.   Under the voluntary principle (with the approval of
 the cooperative membership mass meeting), every household will contribute 2
 to 3 sheng of grain per tan of land according to the amount of land allocated
 to it.   In Ch'ang-kang township, for instance, each person was allocated 6
 tan 2 ton of land, and 109 households have no cow.  With an average of 4
 persons per household, the total number of persons is 436, and the total area
 of land allocated to them is 2,703 tan.  At 3 pints per tan, there will be
 81 tan of grain.  At 5 yuan per tan, there will be 405 yuan.  At 20 yuan per
 animal, there will be 20 head.  With each animal plowing 80 tan of land, the
 20 animals will plow 1,600 tan.  Thus, more than half of the 2,703 tan of land
 will be plowed by animals.   By contributing 2 sheng per tan next year, the
 entire problem will be solved.  On the other hand, when leasing an animal to
 plow,  the animal rent is 5 sheng per year per tan of land.   The method was
 suggested by the masses of Shih-shui township.   They have already put it to
 practice.  We hope that all areas will follow suit.   It will not only solve
 a big difficulty of the impoverished peasants, but produce an even greater
 significance in increasing agricultural production.
 The public bonds issuance committee consisted of five members.  Every village
 had a chairman.

 The township chairman attended the county and district meetings and under-
 took to sell 5,000 yuan of bonds.   Subsequently, 456 yuan was added, total-
 ing 5,456 yuan.
 Upon his return, the township chairman called a delegates' meeting, and the
 various village delegates pledged the amount to be sold in their particular
 villages.
 The on-duty delegates of the villages called mass meetings in their own
 villages.   The delegates. and propaganda teams propagandized to the masses
 beforehand, led the masses to the meetings and explained the significance
 of bonds.   At the meetings, the delegates and the responsible persons of
 the various organizations took the lead and made their pledges, and the
 masses followed.  All the pledges were recorded on site.
 The bonds were not entirely sold.
 In regard to those who did not buy bonds or bought too little, the delegates
 and the propaganda teams propagandized from household to household.  "Such a
 large amount this year!"  Some of the masses could not understand.   The dele-
 gates and the propaganda teams compared last year's grain price (2.5 tan of
 grain for 2 yuan's worth of bonds) with this year's bonds (only 2 tan for 10
 yuan's worth of bonds), explained the benefits of the cooperative (2 dividends
 would exceed the cost of the shares; those having no shares would not receive
 dividends), and expounded the significance of enemy blockade and economic con-
 struction.
 A village-wide mass meeting was again held, and an additional amount of bonds
 was sold, but the bonds were still not completely sold.
 Propaganda was made again.
 A third village-wide mass meeting was held, and an additional amount was
 sold.   The bonds were still not completely sold, but not much was left.
 At the fourth village mass meeting, all the bonds were sold.
 A total of 5,456 yuan of bonds was sold, averaging over 3.70 yuan per person
 for the 1,464 population of the hsiang.   One household bought 45 yuan of
 bonds, which was the largest sale; 5or 6 households bought 30 yuan of bonds;
 many bought 20 yuan of bonds; very few bought 1 or 2 yuan, only around 10
 households; and none bought 0.50 yuan.   Some 10 or more "orphaned and aged"
 households did not buy any.   "The masses were completely satisfied."  From
 beginning to end, it took 15 days to sell all the bonds.

 The special feature of Ch'ang-kang Township in its work was. to devote their
 entire effort to mobilizing the masses and persuading them with a great
 patience.  As a result, their tasks were completely fulfilled and at the
 greatest speed.   Selling public bonds was only one of the instances.   The
 sale of over 5,000 yuan of public bonds was entirely done at the meetings,
 not by visiting the households.   It depended entirely on propaganda and
 agitation, not on coercive allocation.   It required four propaganda cam-
 paigns and four village mass meetings.                       Yet, it took only 15 days from be-
 ginning to end.                        Other townships while the sale was only 1/5 or 1/6 that
 of Ch'ang-kang township, resorted to coercive allocation, and could not
 even complete the job after 2 or 3 months.   Compared with Ch'ang-kang town-
 ship it was truly heaven and earth!
 IX.   The Cooperative Movement
 The cooperative began in Ku-lin village, Lang-mu township (Ch'ang-kang
 township being then a part thereof), in 1931, upon the conclusion of the
 third war.  At 0.50 yuan per share, the masses of the village collected
 over 80 yuan, began to do business, and were successful.   In January 1933,
 it was changed, to the Lang-mu township cooperative.  No additional shares
 were solicited,  the merchandise was cheaper than the market, and it was
 popular with the masses.   By September, it had gross receipts of 300 yuan
 and showed a profit.   In September last year,  the district cooperative was
 formed, 800 shares (at 0.50 yuan per share) were subscribed for and collected,
 and the Lang-mu township operative was merged into the district.
 Staff members:   During the village cooperative period, cooperative chief
 (Li K'uei-ying, who subsequently became the chief of the township district,
 and county cooperatives), purchasing (Li, who subsequently became the pur-
 chasing officer of the township district and county cooperatives), and
 accounting and business (Wang Jen-sen, who subsequently became the account-
 ant of the township and district cooperatives) had their meals provided by
 the cooperative, but they received no wage.  After the cooperative was changed
 to a township cooperative,  it was decided to pay them 3 yuan per month each,
 but they refused.
 The merchandise was directly procured from,country stores.  During the vil-
 lage and township cooperative period, the cooperative members and Red Army
 families were given a discount of 50 wen for every 1,000 wen of purchases,
 or 5 percent.   The non-members did not enjoy the discount, but the prices
 were cheaper than the market.   They could save 20 wen for every string of
 coins spent on purchases, or 20 percent.   In November this year, the dis-
 trict cooperative changed the discount on salt and cloth to 20 wen per
 string of coins (because salt and cloth were expensive and not profitable),
 while for other merchandise, the discount remained at 50 wen.  The non-
 members were charged market price.  At this time, there was a profit of 2
 yuan for every 100 yuan of gross receipt.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 From September last year to March this year (6 months), the district opera-
 tive made a profit of over 600 yuan on a capital of over 400 yuan.   It
 designated 50 percent as public reserve fund, 10 percent as bonus to the
 business personnel and the managing and inspection committees, 10 percent
 as culture-education expenses (stationary for the clubs, schools, and
 children of Red Army families), and 30 percent as dividends.  To increase
 the dividends and encourage the members, the education expenses were tem-
 porarily abolished (should be resumed in the future), and the dividends
 increased to 40 percent, paying 1 string of coins to every shareholder.  At
 the time of dividend payment, the accounts were cleared and published by
 posting.  After dividend payment, there was a big increase in capital.
 In July this year, there was a total of 2,000 shares for 1,000 yuan.  In
 November, at the second dividend payment, each share was entitled to 0.50
 yuan, but actually only 0.30 yuan was paid, leaving the 0.20 yuan as addi-
 tional share.   It was decided to change the share unit to 1 yuan, and no
 one was permitted to have more than 10 shares.
 The managing committee had 11 members, and the inspection committee 7.
 It was decided that the townships should establish branch cooperatives.
 The Ch'ang-kang township branch cooperative collected over 260 shares (at
 1 Yuan per share) and started business.
 The Ku-lin village cooperative was the first of its kind in the entire
 county.  Its operation was successful and it was known as a model coopera-
 tive.
 The grain cooperative of the township solicited over 220 shares (at 1 yuan
 per share).  Most of the subscribers paid in grain (at 5 yuan per tan),
 which was all stored in a granary in Ch'ang-kang village.   It had not started
 business.  A managing committee was organized.
 Every township and every district must emulate the consumer cooperative of
 Ch'ang-kang township and Shang-she district.
 X.   Culture Movement
 1. Elementary Schools
 Four Lenin elementary schools one in each village, each with a principal
 and a teacher.
 Students:   55 in Ch'ang-kang; 53 in Tang-pei; 33 in Hsin-ch'i; 46 in Szu-
 kang; total 186, constituting 65 percent of all the school age children in
 the township.  As for the remaining 35 percent, it was not because their
 parents.did not want them to go to school, but because they would rather
 play than study.   The students went to "catch" them.   Their punishment was
 sweeping the floor or being shut up, or even going without meals for those
 "big and savage."  The students initiated struggles among themselves, with
 "very good spirit."  The mischievous children spent less time in school than
 out.   The parents would see them out of the door, and they would then "sneak
 off into the hills to fight battles."   (Some of the punishments were not
 suitable.)

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 All schools were divided into classes A, B and C.
 The age of the students was 7 to 13.   There were also some who were 14 or
 15 years old, but they only attended half day because of production.
 Those living far away brought their lunch, and those nearby went home for
 lunch.
 The students provided their own paper.
 The teachers were volunteers.  They were considered in the same category
 as work personnel severed from production, and the labor mutual aid asso-
 ciation helped farm their land.   The teachers themselves would not say so,
 but the delegates' congress decided to give them preferential treatment.
 (Those regularly stationed in the township soviet received preferential
 treatment, but the delegates and the responsible persons of mass organiza-
 tions not severed from production received no preferential treatment).   In
 Ho-fu and Hsiu-shui townships, the students collected rice for the "teacher,"
 2 ton a month.  Yang-ch'en township had another method.  Where there was an
 elementary school in a certain village, the township soviet permitted the
 masses to select two persons (age 50 or more who could not perform full-
 time labor) to work as peddlers, do some small business, and provide the
 meals for the "teacher."  The amount was the same as the. township soviet
 personnel (0.09 yuan a day).  Meanwhile, the township soviet would not
 assign the two peddlers any service detail, and the two peddlers must be
 willing to undertake the task.
 Most of the teachers were "not profound in learning."
 2.   Night Schools
 9 in the township:   3 in Ch'ang-kang; 2 in.T'ang-pei, 1 in Hsin-ch'i; 3 in
 Szu-kang.
 Each school had an average of 32 students, totalling about 300 for the 9
 schools, 30 percent men and 70 percent women.  Most of the 412 young people
 and adults, age 16 to 45, in the township enrolled in the night school.   Some
 few "old comrades" over 54 years old also came to the school.  The masses
 were very pleased.   They declared that "the night school is excellent!"
 All schools were divided into A, B and C classes.
 A small number of students brought their own lamps and some 4 or 5 persons
 shared one lamp.  Mostly, they depended on the one wood-oil lamp furnished
 by the school, shared by 10 to 20 persons.   Each person contributed 2 or
 3 p'ien a month.
 The students provided their own paper, pens and ink.
 Teaching material:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Class A--newspaper reading; arithmetic.
 Class B--Adult reader.
 Class C--Children's reader.
 Each school had a principal and a teacher.  The principal did not have to
 be literate as long as he was enthusiastic.  When the students were absent,
 "the principal's instruction is requested."  The principal also attended
 the class.  Most of the principals were "old comrades."  Of the 9 night
 school principals, 5 were women.   There were no women teachers, of the 9.
 night school teachers, 7 were township soviet delegates, and all were volun-
 teers.
 3.  Literacy Classes
 Those tied down with children, those more advanced in age, and those with
 too few members in the family and too far away were organized into literacy
 classes.
 Organization:  According to the proximity of residences, as few as 3 and as
 many as 10 were organized into groups, and a group leader, who could read a
 few words, was elected.  Most of the group leaders were night school students.
 Teaching method:  Any time, any place, any number of persons, while resting
 or drinking tea, one, three, or five persons.  At the beginning, characters
 were traced on the ground.  Later on, each student would have a notebook to
 learn how to write, beginning with such characters as "table, chair, bench,
 pig, cow, chicken and duck."  Every 10 days, the group leader collected the
 notebooks from the students for correction by a "night school teacher," and
 those who "wrote more and well" were praised verbally.   The group leader would
 ask the night school teacher when he did not know how to write certain
 characters, and the latter, when he did not know how to write them,  would
 ask the day school teacher.
 By this method, those who did not know how to read at all before could now
 read 40 or 50 words, and some few of them could read 70 or 80.
 This method was introduced in the summer this year, but the literacy class
 was started last year.
 Literacy placard:  One in each village, nailed on walls of houses alongside
 the road.   Pictures and words were made on it, replaced every 2 or 3 days.
 Sometimes, it was replaced as often as once a day or as long as 4 or 5 days;
 2 or 3 words were given every time, accompanied with pictures.   The day
 school teacher was responsible for it.   It was very effective.

 (1)   Sweeping:  No ashes or manure was stored in hallways and bedrooms.
 Stagnant mud was cleaned out from ditches in front and  behind.  Open, level
 spaces were swept and cleaned.   The people took turns sweeping and cleaning
 public ditches and level spaces.  (2)  Food:  They only went as far as for-
 bidding the people to eat dead things.   (3)  Clothes were washed.   In regard
 to those who failed to perform the above items, the children's league was
 activated to ridicule them, especially those wearing dirty clothes.   The
 modern plays also depicted the hygiene movement.
 From April on, the first time was "fairly good," but it then petered out.
 Nothing was done in May and June.  Upon discovery, the township soviet
 criticized the hygiene committee chairmen, held another meeting of the
 committees (besides the township hygiene committee, every village had a
 committee, all consisting of five members), and called on the villages to
 compete against one another "to see which ones are better."  It was put
 into effect under supervision in July.   There were great achievements in
 the 4 months since.  It was twice as clean as before.
 4.    Public Opinion
 The township had four clubs, one in each village.  Every club had many com-
 mittees, such as "physical education," "wall bulletin,." "evening meeting,"
 etc.   Every village ran a wall bulletin, located in the Lenin elementary
 school.   Of the 10 articles, 8 of them were written by the elementary stu-
 dents and two by the masses.  All the clubs presented modern plays.
 Every township soviet must emulate the culture and education work of Ch'ang-
 kang township.
 XI.  Hygiene Movement
 ?     The residents were organized into hygiene details, according to the proxi-
 mity of their residences, consisting of 4 or 5, 7 or 8, 11 or 12 households
 per detail, mostly 7 or 8, with a leader.
 Though a major sweeping every 5 days was called for, actually it was mostly
 once every 7 days, and at times even every 10 days.   Supervision was neces-
 sary.   "Without supervision, it would not be remembered, and there is so
 much work to do."

 "The Red Army and the Communist Party think of everything!"  "The govern-
 ment work personnel are truly concerned about us!"  But some few people also
 remarked: "Opening the windows!   If we don't die of illness, we will die
 from the wind blowing on us!"  More intensive propaganda was needed.
 Illness is a big enemy in the soviet areas, because it weakens our revolu-
 tionary force.  Activating a broad mass hygiene movement and reducing, even
 eliminating, diseases similar to what Ch'ang-kang township did constitute
 the responsibility of each and every township soviet.
 The township committee of the mutual relief association had five members
 (including chairman, propagandist, and organizer).   The village had no com-
 mittee.            It had a chairman, and there were small groups under him.  The
 association had 611 members.  Only about 20 households, mostly "orphaned
 and aged," in the hsiang did not join the association.  The monthly charge
 was 1 p'ien, which everyone paid.
 1.   Comforting the Red Army.
 2.   Soliciting donations for refugee relief and anti-imperialism. This
 was done twice this year.  Once when over 70 refugees from Hsin-feng came
 to Hsing-kuo city (in the Lang-mu township period), over 20 strings of coins
 were collected.  Another time was in aid of the Northeast Volunteer Army,
 also during the Lang-mu township period (the population at that time was
 2,900, and the number of members about 800), when over 40 strings of coins
 were collected.  Donations started  at 5 p'ien, up to 100, 200, or 1 string.
 Most of them were 100, about 60 percent of the members.  Only a few persons
 gave as little as 5 p'ien or as much as 1 string.
 3.   Donations were solicited to relieve those whose houses had burned down
 and the unemployed workers who were sick and had no medicine. One house-
 hold had a fire last spring and one and one-half rooms were burned down.
 More than 6 strings of coins were collected and given to the owner.
 4.   Belief of the hungry.   In the summer this year,  three or four persons
 in Lang-mu township had nothing to eat (were beggars in the past, still very
 poor now) and asked the district mutual relief association for money and rice.
 They were given 1 to 3 pints each and every time for 3 or 4 times during the
 summer.
 5.   Relief of Red Army families.   To relieve those among the Red  Army
 families who were sick or had difficulties (no one hungry), more than 11
 strings of coins were collected at one time in the summer.   In April, the
 cooperative loaned the money for capital and several volunteers among the

 masses went to purchase rice, carried it to Ch'iao-t'ou Chiang-pei-tung to
 sell, and made a profit of over 100 strings of coins for the relief of those
 who were sick or had difficulties among the Red Army families.  The volun-
 teers did not take any money besides their meals.
 The soviet of many areas gives no attention to relief work.  The mutual re-
 lief association in such areas only collects the monthly dues but does not
 perform any relief work.  The social relief work of the township soviet and
 mutual relief association of Ch'ang-kang township is commendable.  Ch'ang-
 kang township solved every difficult problem of the masses in the west con-
 crete and practical manner.
 The women worker and peasant delegates' congress had a chairman in every vil-
 lage.  All the village chairmen and a women's director formed the presidium
 of the township women worker and peasant delegates' congress.  The township
 had a total of 43 delegates, 12 from Ch'ang-kang, 11 from T'ang-pei, 9 from
 Hsin-ch'i and 11 from Szu-kang.   It was organized in November last year.
 There was a reelection in March   this year.  The third election was held in
 September.  There was one meeting every 7 days in all the villages, all held
 according to schedule, with only a handful absent every time (tied down by
 children).  The delegates had separate responsibilities, each in charge of
 5 to 10 households, mos ly 6 or 7.
 The township soviet delegate was in charge of the first election upon the
 creation of the congress.  The village was the unit, and all the laboring
 women age 16 and above were asked to come to the meeting.  An average of
 60 percent of them in all the villages attended the meetings.  According to
 the proximity of their residences, several households (not the same numbers)
 elected one delegate.   The delegates elected at that time were slightly
 fewer than now.  At that time, as the women still did not understand the
 function of the women delegates' congress, they were not very enthusiastic.
 After the delegates were elected, some few of them were not very positive.
 The delegates' congress had no presidium, only a chairman.  The villages
 did not even have a chairman.
 There was a reelection in March this year.  The method was the same as be-
 fore, but the women's chairmen were in charge.  The township soviet dele-
 gates of the villages also participated to render help.  The number of house-
 holds to be under the charge of the women's delegates was determined, and
 the township was to organize a presidium, but there was no chairman in the
 villages.
 For the third election in September, the method was changed.  No village-
 wide women's mass meeting was called.  The women delegates called election
 meetings of the women in the households under their charge, and the town-
 ship soviet delegates participated to render help.

 During the first and second election meetings, only the delegates were
 elected, but no problem was discussed.  At the third election, such prob-
 lems as "expanding the Red Army," "comforting the Red Army," "preferential
 treatment of Red Army families," "women learning to plow," and "women buying
 public bonds with silverware" were discussed.   The marriage issue was dis-
 cussed among the problems brought up at the regular meeting every 7 days.
 The women declared:  "We want the correct freedom, not vagabond freedom.
 We must not ask for a divorce whenever there is an argument."  During the
 election movement this year, the women's candidates' list was discussed.
 However, other intimate problems concerning women, such as "women's di-
 seases," "children" and "women's education," were not discussed.
 There was complete freedom of divorce in the township.  The husbands seldom
 scolded their wives, but there were more wives who scolded their husbands.
 (Neither should scold the other.)  Spanking of children had not been com-
 pletely stopped, but it was reduced.  (There should be no spanking at all.)
 The children had become more intelligent.   In the past, when spanked or
 scolded by their parents, they seldom retorted, but now more of them re-
 torted.    (If the parents did not spank or scold them, the children would
 not be retorting.)
 About 1 percent of the women married 3 times in the 4-1/2 years after the
 uprising.   Clandestine love  affairs constituted about 50 percent before
 the uprising, but they were reduced to 10 percent after the uprising.  They
 were further reduced this year because of land allocation, freedom to divorce
 or marry, and busy revolutionary work.
 Their clothes were shortened and "fancy borders" eliminated.  Except "old
 ladies," the women cut their hair.  Some "old ladies" also had their hair
 cut.  Older women with long hair constituted about 20 percent of the women.
 Among the masses, in the past (before the uprising), there were frequent
 quarrels and fistfights, and even more arguments.   Now, there are no more
 fistfights, and even arguments decreased.  When there was an argument in
 the past, no one would explain matters to the parties, and even when some-
 one tried to pacify them, they were "not convinced in their mind."  Now,
 the moment an argument occurs, a delegate comes out to explain matters to
 them, and they immediately "became convinced."  Arguments mostly occurred
 among the older comrades.  They attended less meetings and did not under-
 stand revolutonary work clearly.  When asked to render preferential treat-
 ment to Red Army families, they would sometimes argue.  However, the majority
 who did not understand, they were mostly "old ladies" who "always refused
 to go to the meetings."
 Since last year, no old lady has worshipped the gods (burning incense and
 offering rice; begging the gods and bowing to the Buddha), but every vil-
 lage still has one or two persons who try to "summon the spirit of the dead."
 The reasons for such prompt elimination of superstition were (1) knocking
 down of local tyrants and land division,  (2) the anti-superstition propa-
 ganda of the children's league and Young Pioneers and the soviet movement

 to save the money on incense and candles, and (3) direct interference by
 the Young Pioneers (taking away the incense and candles).   (Should be
 persuasion rather than interference).  However, although they did not dare
 to worship the gods openly, some old ladies still believed in the gods.
 Most of those had no son.
 The great strength of women in the revolutionary war has been clearly demon-
 strated in the soviet areas.  In the land investigation movement and all
 types of mass struggles, on the economic front (Ch'ang-kang township relies
 mainly on them), on the cultural front (many women are in charge of rural
 education), in military mobilization (their movement to expand the Red Army
 and comfort the Red Army; their service as part-time laborers), and in the
 sovietorganization (the effect of the women delegates in the township soviet),
 their heroic bearing and great achievements have been manifested.  Here, the
 leadership and motivation of the women's worker and peasant delegates' con-
 gress are the crucial link.   It must first closely tackle the problems con-
 nected with the intimate interest of the women masses and coordinate all
 political mobilizations with the mobilization on such problems.  On this
 point, the attention of many areas is extremely inadequate, and even Ch'ang-
 kang township has not rendered it full attention.  The soviet of each and
 every township must place the work of guiding the women's worker and peas-
 ant delegates' congress on its daily agenda.
 The children's league committee in the township had 5 members, with a secre-
 tary.  In the villages, there was a chairman.  Of the children age 7 to 15
 80 percent joined the children's league.  Those who had not joined were
 mostly 7-year-olds (too small) and 15-year-olds (because they had joined
 the Young Pioneers.  Ordinarily the minimum age for the Young Pioneers was
 16, but some joined earlier because of their size).  More boys than girls
 joined.
 Work:   (1)  They propagandized on expanding the Red Army and the return-to-
 the ranks movement.                   (Only when a person refused after three or four propa-
 ganda efforts would he be ridiculed.   The township had never had a ridicule
 team.)   (2)  They held competitions to collect dog excrement for the "ferti-
 lizer station" and shovel up grass roots for the "fertilizer room."  (3)  The
 members paid 1 p'ien of monthly due to comfort the Red Army.   (4)  They
 promoted the thrift movement--eating less fruits and buying more public
 bonds, 0.50, 1, 2 or 3 yuan.  Most of them bought 0.50 yuan.   Sixty percent
 of the children bought public bonds.  (5)  They played games, drilled and
 practiced fighting battles in the drill field on Sundays.  A program was
 formulated.  (6)  The majority of them were enrolled in the Lenin school.
 The discipline of the children's league was very strict.   Some mischievous
 children who defied their parents and teachers obeyed the discipline of the
 children's league.  Punishments consisted of sweeping the floor or being
 shut up.  They always "listen to reason and admit their errors."   (Should
 be more persuasion and less punishment.)

 In the past, 9- and 10-year-olds  took care of cows for the landlords and
 rich peasants,,but this was no longer true.  In the past, whether at home
 or working outside, the labor time of children was always 10 hours or more,
 the same as for adults.  They had no time to rest or study.  Now, they spend
 the greater portion of their time studying and playing games, and only about
 1-1/2 hours in the morning taking care of cows or doing other jobs.  In busy
 farming seasons, they worked longer periods.  They would ask the teachers
 for leave to help their parents.   In the past, they were spanked and scolded
 by their parents.  Now, they were seldom spanked or scolded.
 Carpenters:   30 percent unemployed; only 7 work units available for each
 10 work units; daily wage 550.
 Tailors:  Most of them unemployed; daily wage 400.
 Masons:  30 percent unemployed; daily wage 550.
 Bamboo workers:  10 percent unemployed; daily wage 400.
 Barbers:  10 percent increase.  Each customer paid the barber 8 sheng of
 grain a year.
 Part-time laborers:  Daily wage at ordinary times 400 (2 mao); during busy
 time 800 (4 mao).
 XVI.  Poor Peasants' League
 The township committee had three members (chairman, propagandist organizer)
 and the village committee 5 members.  There were 271 members in July this
 year, which was increased to 386 in November.
 In the past, "the poor peasants' league is called on for everything,"  but
 attention was not given to making sound its organization.
 In the land investigation movement this year (July), the organization was
 readjusted, the village committee abolished, and the membership developed.
 Before July, sometimes no meeting was held for 2 months.  After July, the
 village poor peasants' league held a meeting every 5, 10 or 15 days, depend-
 ing on the need of the work.   The township league held one meeting a month.
 The problem discussed included "class investigation," "each member saving
 0.12 yuan," "developing the membership," "making sound the organization,"
 "developing production" and "fines and donations."  In regard to expanding
 the Red Army, preferential treatment of Red Army families, economic con-
 struction and culture and education, only reports were made to the members.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 When the township congress made decisions on such matters, they were "an-
 nounced" at the poor peasants' league meeting and there was no special dis-
 cussion.                     (There should be discussion).  No monthly dues were charged.
 There were small groups under the village.
 In all areas where the land investigation movement has not become intensive,
 the poor peasants' league is specially important.  The township soviet must
 be responsible for its leadership.  There should be a poor peasants' league
 committee in the village.  The village should serve as the unit for meetings,
 and meetings with the township as the unit may be decreased.  Ch'ang-kang
 township's practice is correct.
 XVIII.  Propaganda Teams
 The township had a propaganda middle team, 7 members, 1 leader.  Every vil-
 lage had a propaganda small team, 5 members in the large villages (Ch'ang-
 kang and Tang-pei) and 3 in the small villages (Hsin-ch'i and Szu-kang),
 with a leader.  They made propaganda for "expanding the Red Army," "economic
 construction," and the "commemoration festival."
 Patterns of propaganda: (1)   Individual propaganda, most numerous.   (2)  Mak-
 ing propaganda when the on-duty delegate gathered the masses of the village
 to discuss work.   (3)  Propagandizing to the masses when the district county
 held commemoration festival mass meetings; also propagandizing to the "ranks"
 of other township and ch'us.
 Every 7 days, the township soviet called together the middle and small team
 leaders, altogether five persons, for a "propaganda meeting."  The district
 soviet held meetings of all the propaganda team leaders in the district, at
 least twice a month, sometimes three times.  Every meeting lasted at least
 4 hours.  The participants went home to eat after the meeting.
 The township had a total of 23 team leaders and members, about 60 percent
 of them women.  They were all "relatively articulate," but not necessarily
 literate.  They were not replaced.  Only in case of transfers would there
 be replacements.  They concentrated on studying propaganda material and
 methods and "how to make the masses understand even better."  Organizing
 was started in last February.
 XVIII.   Surprise Attack Teams
 Five persons under the township soviet, one team leader.  In regard to the
 villages, Ch'ang-kang, Tang-pei and Hsin-ch'i had surprise attack teams
 and Szu-kang had none.  They were organized by Red Army wives.
 In any village where the work had become stagnated, the surprise attack
 team of another would go there to inspect and render help, explaining to
 the villagers the methods followed by other villages to perform the work.
 The township surprise attack team had the same function, inspecting and
 helping any village where the.work had come to a standstill.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 The surprise attack team performed less work than the propaganda team; it
 did not demonstrate a great effect.  The township soviet called them together
 for meetings three or four times.  Organizing began in Augus.
 Propaganda and surprise attack teams are excellent.  All the townships
 should organize them.
 XIX.   Revolutionary Competition
 The measure of holding competitions was started during the spring cultiva-
 tion movement this year and the items of competition included "comparatively
 early," "comparatively good," and "no uncultivated land."  All the township
 chairmen, holding a meeting at the district soviet, signed a competition
 agreement among the townships.  The district called a meeting of the village
 on-duty delegates to sign competition agreements among the villages.  The
 on-duty delegates of the villages each called a meeting of the village dele-
 gates to sign the competition agreement in the village.                     There was no com-
 petition among the households.                      (Could also be signed.)    The following items
 were included in the agreement:  The maximum standards for the items of com-
 petition; the competing villages; the kinds and numbers of prizes (first
 class, red flag; second class, 100 sheets of writing paper; third class,
 50 sheets of writing paper); the period of competition; the responsible
 person and the referee.  During the period of competition, the township
 congress held an inspection meeting, and the on-duty delegates made reports
 covering the progress of the various villages.  After the meeting, the chair-
 men (referees) made an inspection tour of the villages to verify the reports
 of the on-duty delegates.
 In April, there was another competition.  The goal was "military mobiliza-
 tion," divided into "expanding the Red Army," "comforting work" and "pre-
 ferential treatment of Red Army families."  (There was no return-to-the-
 ranks movement, because there was no deserter at that time.  This item was
 added in May.)
 On 20 May, the hsiang congress held a summation meeting on the competition
 in "spring plowing" and "military affairs."  Hsin-ch'i won the red flag,
 Ch'ang-kang 100 sheets of writing paper, Tang-pei 50 sheets and Szu-kang
 nothing.
 In July, competition agreements on "military affairs" and "economy" were
 signed.   There has been no summation yet, but Ch'ang-kang is known to be
 the best.
 To strive for speed in work, the method of revolutionary competition should
 be introduced in every township.  The township soviet is the leader of the
 competition, but only the "leader," because it is mainly a competition among
 the masses, not the village delegates.. Therefore, for the signing of every
 competition agreement, it must be reported to the masses at the mass meeting,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 with the village as the unit, for their approval, and the agreement posted.
 For competition on production items, a meeting of the several dozen residents
 under the leadership of every delegate must be held, and the competition re-
 ported to them for their approval.  The results of achievement inspections
 for any one period must also be reported at such meetings, in order to pro-
 mote the progress of the work.  Whenever a competition produces no achieve-
 ment, it is always because the competition agreement is put in the pockets
 of a few persons, and the broad masses are not motivated.  A summation must
 be made for each competition, and the prizes awarded.  As a whole, Ch'ang-
 kang township accomplished all these in its two competitions.  That was why
 they made practical successes.

 INVESTIGATION IN TS'AI-HSI TOWNSHIP
 1933
 [Text]   I Administrative Divisions
 The well-known Upper and Lower Ts'ai-hsi of the Central Soviet Area belong
 to Ts'ai-hsi District of Shang-hang County, Fukien.   After recent division
 of administrative areas, Ts'ai-hsi District is divided into the following
 8 townships:  Upper Ts'ai-hsi, Lower Ts'ai-hsi, Ling-pao, T'ung-k'ang, Tseng-
 k'ang, Wen-ts'ai, T'ai-ti and Hsia-sheng.
 Upper Ts'ai-hsi:  523 families, 2,318 persons.
 Divided into 4 villages:  Li-wu (population about 600), Yang-hsia (500),
 Chung-hsing (500) and Shang-wu (600).
 Regularly stationed in township soviet:   chairman, secretary.
 Because this is a big ship the secretary regularly posted here to help with
 the work of the township soviet.
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi:   503 families, 2,610 persons.
 Divided into 4 villages:  Chang-k'eng (population about 600), Hsia-k'eng
 (500), Fa-k'eng (800), Sun-wu (700).
 II  Representative Conference
 1.  Number of Representatives
 Upper Ts'ai-hsi:   Formerly 53 representatives.   In the recent election work-
 ers' dependents were counted as workers, increasing the number of represen-
 tatives to 75 (22 are newly added, mostly bricklayers of the tnw nship).  Of
 the original 53 representatives, 13 are workers.  With another 22 added,
 there are now 35 worker representatives.  The remaining 40 are peasant
 representatives.   There are 183 workers in the township belonging to 163

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 families averaging 3 persons each, bringing the total worker population to
 489.  Because there is one representative for every 13 persons, the above-
 mentioned number has been elected.
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi:  Formerly 73 representatives.  Now there are 91, with 28
 [sic] newly added, also because of an increased election ratio of workers'
 dependents.
 2.  Delegation of Representatives
 There are 10 to over 20 representatives in each village.  The representa-
 tives of each of the 4 villages hold separate meetings to elect one of their
 number to form a "delegation" to the township soviet, so that there are 4
 members. In the delegation.  Minor work is settled at conferences of the dele-
 gation called by the chairman.  Every time the representatives hold a con-
 ference, the delegation meets beforehand (either in the morning or the day
 before) to make preparations.  The representatives meet once about every 5
 days.  This procedure began in 1931.  (Delegation should be called chief
 representatives instead).
 3.  Relationship Between Representatives and Residents
 Each representative is in charge of 10, 20, 30, 40, or, at most, 50-odd
 residents.  Worker representatives have fewer residents in their charge,
 while peasant representatives have more.  This arrangement began in 1932.
 4.  Political Showing of Representatives
 Of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts'ai-hsi:
 The most active:  more than 20;
 Medium active:  more than 20;
 The worst: One.
 This worst representative attends only 3 meetings out of every 10.  He
 busies himself with making his own living, but works reluctantly at jobs
 assigned to him.  After repeated criticism, he has been removed from his
 office by the conference of representatives.
 There is no worse representative among the 73 representatives of Lower
 Ts'ai-hsi.
 5.   Transfers of Representatives, Election To Fill Their Vacancies
 The 53 representatives of Upper Ts'ai-hsi were elected in November last year.
 By the time a new election was held on 14 November this year, 27 had joined
 the Red Army (they all went at the same time in November last year) and 11

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 were transferred to other posts.  Altogether 38 left, leaving 15.  Meetings
 of electors were held at each of the villages to elect new representatives
 to replace the old ones.  Worker representatives were elected to fill va-
 cancies left by workers, and peasant representatives were elected to fill
 those left by peasants.  Where there were alternate representatives, the
 vacancies were filled by them.  This additional election meeting was held
 in November last year.  After that, no election meeting was held until
 October this year, when there were only 42 representatives left because 11
 of them were again transferred one after another in the interval.
 There were 73 representatives in Lower Ts'ai-hsi.   In Red May this year, 11
 of them joined the Red Army.  Additional election meetings were held at the
 village level to fill their vacancies.   In July another 15 joined the Red
 Army, and another additional conference was held to fill the vacancies.
 The vacancies left by 18 others who were transferred to other posts were
 filled by alternate representatives.
 6.  Women Representatives
 Of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts'ai-hsi at the time of the October
 election last year, 16 were women, or 30 percent of the total.  Of the 73
 representatives of Lower Ts'ai-hsi, 21, or also 30 percent, were women.
 After the additional elections and up to the October election this year,
 of the 53 representatives of Upper Ts'ai-hsi, 33, or almost 60 percent,
 were women.  Of the 73 representatives of Lower Ts'ai-hsi, 43, or also 60
 percent, were women.  After the recent election, of the 75 representatives
 of Upper Ts'ai-hsi, 43, or still 60 percent, are women.  Of the 91 repre-
 sentatives of Lower Ts'ai-hsi, 59, or 66 percent, are women.
 The system of having a chief of village representatives and fixed relations
 between representatives and residents is a great advance in soviet organiza-
 tion and leadership.                   Like the townships of Ch'ang-wang and Shih-shui,
 Ts'ai-hsi township has gained results in this regard.   The heart of the
 township is in the village.   Therefore, village organization and leadership
 is a problem that deserves the utmost attention.  The whole area of the
 township is divided into so many villages.  By relying on the strong leader-
 ship of the township soviet representatives of the people themselves, the
 village committee and mass organizations of the village, the masses of the
 whole village are organized like a network under the soviet to carry out all
 work of the soviet.  This is the most obvious superiority of the soviet
 system over all other political systems in history.  The system adopted
 in Ch'ang-wang, Ts'ai-hsi, Shih-shui and other townships should be extended
 to the whole soviet area.
 III.   This Election
 (1)   The election was led by the election committee.
 (2)   Residents and electors were registered.   Three rolls of names were made
 public.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 (3)   The namelist of candidates contained more than 160 in Lower Ts'ai-hsi
 (91 of them were elected).  The namelist was posted in each village, and
 each list contained more than 160 names.  Many of the people wrote comments
 of 2, 5 or 6, or more than 10 characters under the names of candidates.  Even
 children jotted down theirs.  Most of them wrote "good" or "not good."
 Some of them wrote "agree" or "negative." One of the candidates had the
 word "bureaucratic" written under his name.  Over 20 were criticized in
 wall posters.   The criticized candidates were those who were concerned only
 with making their own living, neglected the interests of the masses, and
 worked passively for the public.  There were some poems and songs, three of
 which criticized the township soviet for handling the problem of paper-
 making badly.
 (4)  Congress of electors was held with townships as the unit.  The township
 soviet reported on its work.
 (5)  Workers of the whole township formed a unit.  Peasants of each village
 formed a unit (4 of them).
 (6)  The election rally was attended by 80 percent of the electors.  The
 sick, those on sentry duty, those who worked for the cooperative and were
 out on buying missions, and women in their final month of pregnancy, total-
 ing 20 percent in all, did not attend.  Old people came, leaning on staffs.
 (7)  Many meetings were held for the election.  The labor union, poor peas-
 ants leagues, women's association, mutual-aid association and antiimperialist
 alliance held a rally of members together.   The children's league and.Young
 Pioneers also held meetings.  The Party and the League were the first to hold
 meetings.   There were slogans and pamphlets.   So this year's election propa-
 ganda was far more extensive than last year's and most people realized the
 meaning of election.
 Last year youngsters under 16 clamored for the right to vote.   They asked,
 because many of them had already joined the Red Army and their work was far
 better than that of others, why were they not given the right to vote?  This
 year they understood why their age was a barrier, and they clamored no more.
 Propaganda teams went to all villages to make propaganda.  During the day
 they made speeches.  At night they gave shows.
 (8)   At the rally of electors there was agitation to buy bonds.  More than
 1500 yuan's worth of bonds was bought by those at the rally in Lower Ts'ai-
 hsi.  Another 630 yuan's worth was bought in Upper Ts'ai-hsi.
 At the rally of electors in T'ai-ti township, 13 persons were persuaded to
 join the Red Army.  One of the 2 squads of the Model Battalion of the Red
 Guard Army of the whole township joined the Red Army.

 (9)  Election of new cadres:
 Of the 75 representatives of Upper Ts'ai-hsi, 21 are re-elected from the
 former 53 representatives and 54 are newly elected.  Thirty-two former
 representatives are not re-elected.  Of the 91 representatives of Lower
 Ts'ai-hsi, 50 are re-elected from the former 73 representatives and 41 are
 newly elected.   Twenty-three of the former representatives are not re-elected.
 In general, ,the elections in Upper and Lower .Ts'ai-hsi were successful.   In
 their election propaganda, organization of lists of candidates and urging
 of the masses to criticize the candidates,_correlation of the election to
 other work and organization of workers and women so they might be elected,
 they have fully implemented the Central Government's instructions regarding
 the elections, so that they become models of the election campaign in the
 soviet area.  On the other hand, in urging electors at the election rallies
 to make proposals for discussion by the new representatives, they have not
 made a good showing. The model in this respect should be Ch'ang-wang town-
 ship of Hsing-kuo.
 IV.   Committees Under the Township Soviet
 There are many committees under the township soviet.   The following are
 several examples:
 "Support the Red Army":  Upper and Lower Ts'ai-hsi each has 5 committee
 members.   Each of the 4 villages has a committee, also of 5 members each.
 "Preferential Treatment for Red Army Dependents":  Upper and Lower Ts'ai-
 hsi each has 5 members.                  Each village also has 5 members.
 "Land Investigation":   The two townships each has 11 members.  The villages
 have none.
 "Election":   The two townships each has 7 members. None for the villages.
 "Land":   Upper Ts'ai-hsi has 11 members and Lower Ts'ai-hsi 7. None for
 the villages.
 "Labor":   The two townships have 7 members each.   There is no such committee
 at the village level, but only groups, which are committees of the labor co-
 operative.
 "Forestry":  Upper Ts'ai-hsi has 7 members, Lower Ts'ai-hsi has 11.
 "Return of Deserters":   Each of the two townships has 12 members.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 There are no "spring plowing," "summer plowing"...committees.  Only "land
 tilling teams" are organized.   Five persons form a group, 10 a squad,  30 a
 medium team and 100 a large team.   Upper and Lower Ts'ai-hsi  each has a
 large team. Land tilling teams are organized principally for the sake of
 giving preferential treatment to dependents of the Red Army.
 The organizing and leading of the many committees under the township soviet
 becomes an important part of its work.  This is again demonstrated in Ts'ai-
 hsi township.   The Central Government has adopted the experience of various
 localities and incorporated it in the "Organic Law of Local Soviets."  This
 provides that a, township may organize more than 20 regular and ad hoc com-
 mittees.   The number may be appropriately increased or decreased in accord-
 ance with the requirements of the work of the localities.  An "urban" soviet,
 on the other hand, will have to organize a number of committees different in
 character to the rural ones, in accordance with the special character of
 urban centers.  The clearly defined and unified establishment of this sys-
 tem will draw still closer the relationship between the soviets and the
 masses, and will lend enormous strength to the execution of all work of the
 soviet.  One problem is that the village should also set up certain important
 work committees (people's organizations with large memberships should like-
 wise set up their village-level leadership organs).   This is because if there
 are only township-level committees, it will be impossible to carry out thor-
 ough, careful work in townships with a large population of about 1,000.  This
 will be assured if many village-level committees are set up.
 V.   Expansion of the Red Army
 In the 3 months of August, September and October:
 Upper Ts'ai-hsi:   60 persons.   Two platoons of a model battalion mobilized.
 In addition, 11 persons have rejoined.  There are still 2 or 3 who have not
 rejoined owing to illness.
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi:   65 persons.   The model battalion mobilized 52 persons all
 at once.  On another occasion, when men were individually mobilized, 13
 persons joined up.
 In addition, 11 persons have rejoined.  There are still 14 others who have
 not yet rejoined.
 There were 12 townships in the district (before division).  On 15 August
 273 persons were mobilized to join the model battalion.   The redivided
 district comprises 8 townships.   In all, more than 50 persons have not yet
 rejoined.

 Of the whole district, the two townships of Upper and Lower Ts'ai-hsi have
 produced the best results in expansion of the Red Army.   The principal
 reason is that they have always done well in giving preferential treatment
 to Red Army dependents and comforting the Red Army.  Previous to Red May,
 an average of 500 pairs of cloth and straw sandals a month could be col-
 lected from each of the 8 townships.  The quantity was recently slightly
 reduced owing to the blockade and scarcity of cloth.  Nevertheless, Upper
 and Lower Ts'ai-hsi have been able to produce the following results:  Upper
 Ts'ai-hsi, over 500 pairs in August, over 100 pairs in September, and over
 90 pairs in October.
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi, over 300 pairs in August, 280 pairs in September, 300
 pairs in October and 630 pairs in November.
 These results have been obtained mainly owing to mobilization by the Party
 and League branches of Party and League members to provide leadership to
 conferences of women worker and women peasant representatives:   (1)  Party
 and League members first held meetings;  (2) women representatives held
 meeting; (3) women held mass meeting.
 The women representatives meet once every 10 days.  There is a presidium
 of 5 at the township level.  One of these is elected director.   The re-
 maining 4 are assigned to the 4 villages, one for each village, serving
 as chief of the village.
 The women representatives discuss all problems which are also discussed by
 the township soviet.   They make particular exertions in matters of comfort-
 ing the Red Army, selling bonds and expanding production.   In addition, they
 also frequently discuss matters of interest to themselves, such as the mar-
 riage problem.   They explain marriage regulations to the womenfolk.
 Mobilization of large numbers of the masses to join the Red Army depends
 on:   (1)   Politically, full propaganda and encouragement, abolition of all
 methods of coercion; (2) full preferential treatment for dependents of Red
 Army men; and (3) healthy and sound organization and training of local armed
 forces.  Preferential treatment for dependents of Red Army men is a funda-
 mental work that would make the masses gladly join the Red Army and con-
 tentedly stay with the Red Army.   This is fully borne out by the experience
 of the townships of Ch'ang-wang and Ts'ai-hsi.   There are 407 young and
 adult males (16 to 45 years of age) in Ch'ang-wang.township.   Of this num-
 ber,  320, or 80 percent, have left to join the Red Army and work.  There
 are 554 young and adult (16-55 years of age) males in Upper Ts'ai-hsi,
 485, or 88 percent, of them have left to join the Red Army and work. In
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi there are 756 males, 526 of whom, or 70 percent, have left
 to join the Red Army and to work.   Such large scale expansion of the Red
 Army would certainly have been impossible if the problem had not been solved
 thoroughly from the viewpoint of economy and production.   Only by correlating
 economic with political mobilization will it be possible to create a high
 tide of Red Army expansion and accomplish results like those accomplished
 in Ch'ang-wang and Ts'ai-hsi townships.

 (1)  Problem of Labor Force
 Upper Ts'ai-hsi:   Of the total population of 2,318 (during the uprising),
 554 are males capable of labor (16-55 years of age, same below), and 581 are
 females capable of labor.  Of these, 419 have joined the Red Army and 88
 (66 males and 22 females) have been transferred to outside areas for work.
 Of the 554 males of the age group of 16-55 and capable of labor, 485 (419
 plus 66) have left for the Red Army or to work, and only 69 remain behind.
 Thus the male labor force is only 11 percent of the female labor force of
 559 (581 minus 22).  There are 258 families of Red Army dependents in the
 whole township.
 Lower Ts'ai-hsi:  Of the total' population of 2,610, there are 1,207 males
 and females able to labor (765 males and 442 females).   Of these, 442 have
 joined the Red Army and 98 (91 males, 7 females) have been transferred to
 outside areas to work.  Of the 765 males capable of labor, 533 have joined
 the Red Army or left for work, and only 232 remain in the township.  Thus
 the male labor force is only 33 percent of the female labor force of 435
 (442 minus 7).  There are 355 families of dependents of the Red Army in
 the whole township.
 As a result, it is mainly women who farm the land.   In Upper Ts'ai-hsi
 this year, about 300 women can use cattle and more than 60 can plant seed-
 lings.   Before the uprising only 1/10 of these 300, that is, 30 women, could
 use cattle.   The increase is obtained after several years' effort.
 Meanwhile, the "old comrades" are very energetic.   They make up a large
 number of those who cultivate hills and mountains and some can plant seed-
 lings and harvest crops.   Children, too, take part in production.  Hence
 production is developing.   The development of production also depends on
 mutual adjustments of the labor force, apart from the participation of women,
 old persons and children in production.  Within the same village, families
 with labor power to spare help those with little labor power.  Within the
 same township, labor-surplus villages help labor-deficit villages. Within
 the same district, labor-surplus townships help labor-deficit ones.   In
 this way,  the labor force is adjusted with the district as a unit for the
 purpose of doing labor.   In addition, Party and League members also work
 "Saturdays."  Hence production gains still greater development.
 Labor is adjusted mainly through the labor cooperative and land farming
 teams, whose task is to help Red Army dependents and make possible mutual
 aid among the masses.
 Help for Red Army dependents:   Carrying rice packs (but not other food) and
 farm implements for them.   The same when planting seedlings and harvesting.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Mutual-aid among the masses:   Daily wages agreed at 2 hao, the same for
 males and females, rush and slack seasons.   This has been the practice
 since 1930.  When one Red Army dependent helps another, the pay is 1.5
 mao a day.   When Red Army dependents help other people, the pay is 2 mao
 a day.  When the masses help Red Army dependents, no wages will be paid.
 The labor cooperative plans for the whole township.   There is a 5-man com-
 mittee of the labor cooperative of the township which takes charge of the
 whole, and one committee member for each of the 4 villages who plans for
 the village..  When labor is required, it must be procured through the vil-
 lage committee member.   There  can be no  private  employment,  other-
 wise labor  adjustment may be upset.   Pay  is  agreed on between
 the employer   and  the employee without  the  intermediation of the
 committee member.
 The labor cooperative of this township was set up in 1931.   It is the fore-
 runner of the "Labor Mutual-Aid Cooperative" which now functions all over
 the soviet area.
 Each of the committee members keeps a record of those who are or are not
 able to labor, or who are short of labor power, so that labor can be im-
 mediately supplied whenever anyone wants to employ it.   Those who are un-
 familiar with the situation may ask the intermediate team leader of the
 land farming team.   (There is one intermediate land farming team for each
 of the villages.   Five persons make a group, 2 groups of 10 persons make
 a squad, and 3 or 4 squads make an intermediate team). The intermediate
 team leader also keeps a record.   "It is agreed upon to combine the land
 farming team with the labor cooperative."
 Production situation:  After the uprising (1929-1931), production dropped
 by about 20 percent.   In 1932 half the loss, or 10 percent, was recovered.
 This year (1933) it increased by 20 percent compared with that of last year,
 (output of miscellaneous crops such as sweet potato, bean, taro and yam in-
 creased by 51 percent. compared to that of last year) exceeding that of the
 pre-uprising year by 10 percent.  After the uprising many of the fields
 throughout the district were not tilled.  Last year a small part of them
 was redeveloped.   This year there has been a massive development to the
 extent of over 1,300 piculs.  More hills have been developed than fields,
 as hills make up three-fourths and fields only one-fourth of the land de-
 veloped.   Because all fields have been opened, hills are now developed.
 Not a single ridge that divides the fields is not planted with miscellaneous
 crops.  All fields suitable for sweet potatoes are planted with sweet po-
 tatoes.   Female comrades "vie" with one another in developing hills.   Every-
 one wants to do it.   The effect of the competition is great.   The district
 was far short of grain before the uprising (and besides, many people made
 flour in those days).  Last year there was enough for consumption, and this
 year there is a surplus.   Now no one in the whole district makes flour or
 "cakes," and no one produces liquor by distillation.

 (2)   Consumer Cooperatives
 There are 14 consumer cooperatives in the 8 townships of the whole district.
 Two are in Upper Ts'ai-hsi:
 One is an oil, salt and meat cooperative.  It originally operated on a
 capital of 4 yuan, which was subsequently increased to 185 yuan at 50 cents
 a share.
 It was organized in October 1930.   There was a distribution of dividends in
 July 1933.   Each share was paid 50 cents. One person is regularly posted
 in the cooperative.  He is helped by two others on market days.
 The other is a cloth cooperative.   It originally operated on a capital of
 144 yuan which was subsequently increased to 255 yuan at 1 yuan a share.
 This was formed at the same time as the former.   There was a distribution
 of dividends in September 1933.   Each share was paid 1 yuan.  Two persons
 are regularly posted in the cooperative.  They are helped by another on
 market days.
 One cloth cooperative:   Original capital 120 yuan, subsequently increased
 to 240 yuan at 1 yuan a share.  It was formed in January 1930.  There was
 a distribution of dividends in February 1932.   Each share was paid 1 yuan.
 Two persons are regularly posted in the cooperative.
 One oil, salt and meat cooperative:  Original capital 35 yuan, subsequently
 increased to 157 yuan at 50 cents a share.  It was formed in October 1929.
 There was a dividend distribution in March 1933.   Each share was paid 50
 cents.   Two persons are regularly posted in the cooperative.  On market
 days they have a helper.
 One beancurd, candy and piglet cooperative:   Original capital 125 yuan,
 subsequently increased to 180 yuan at 50 cents a share.   It was formed in
 January 1931.   There was a dividend distribution in February 1933.   Each
 share was paid 50 cents.   Three persons are regularly posted in the office.
 Accounts of the cooperatives are audited twice a month (auditor eats. at
 home after checking accounts).  Members meet once a month (no meals pro-
 vided).  Officers are elected once every 3 months at members meeting.  New
 officers are elected immediately to fill the vacancies of those who have
 been transferred to county or district cooperatives, or who are young and
 have joined the Red Army (in which case older persons take their place), or
 who do not want to serve another term.   In practice, most of them serve
 consecutive terms and few are transferred.  Only dependents of Red Army
 men who are in financial difficulty may buy on credit.   They may pay on

 the next or the next two market days, but must pay on the third market day
 (there is a 10-day interval between 2 market days).  Debts may be repaid
 in kind, e.g.,.in rice, beans, etc.  Outstanding debts not paid on market
 days shall be fully paid in July and October each year.
 Sixty percent of the families of Upper Ts'ai-hsi and 90 percent of those
 of Lower Ts'ai-hsi have joined the cooperatives.
 Red Army dependents are given first priority when buying goods in short
 supply.  Next come members of the cooperatives, and lastly non-members.
 Price:  Red Army dependents (those who have certificates) are given a 5 per-
 cent discount on the market price.  No discount is given members of the co-
 operatives.  The same applies to Red Army dependents from other townships
 or districts.  Red Army dependents of the old country, Nan-yang and Kuan-
 chuang districts sometimes come to buy goods.
 "Cooperatives are tops"--this is public opinion.
 With the single exception of a medicine store kept by a Kiangsi native, there
 is no private store that sells goods from outside areas in the whole dis-
 trict.   (This situation is brought about by gradually whittling down the
 number of privately owned stores).  But on market days one or two persons
 privately sell salt.  There are also those who still privately sell bean-
 curd and other native produce.
 (3)   Food Grain Cooperatives
 These were formerly called Grain Adjustment Bureaus.   They began to be formed
 in 1930, with capital raised by the masses.   Funds were not generally col-
 lected, but were collected only from families who were comparatively well
 off.  Each share was 1 yuan.  One adjustment bureau was formed in each
 township.  There were 8 bureaus in the district, with a total capital of
 1,810 yuan.
 Method of adjustment:  When buying paddy from the masses every year,  the
 bureau gets 2 sheng less than the private buyer for every yuan's worth.
 For example, a private buyer buys paddy at 1 tou 7 sheng per yuan, while
 the adjustment bureau buys only 1 tou and 5 sheng per yuan.  Grain is offered
 for sale first to Red Army dependents and next to the masses who are in dif-
 ficulty.  Whether the masses are in difficulty or not is decided by the con-
 ference of township representatives after investigation.  Grain is sold not
 at the market price, but at cost after a slight deduction of losses and
 spoilage.  For example, when grain is bought at 1 tou and 5 sheng per yuan,
 it is sold at 1 tou sheng and 5 ho, 5 ho being deducted for loss and spoil-
 age.  Red Army dependents who do not have cash and the masses who are par-
 ticularly in difficulty may borrow grain, to be repaid in kind at harvest
 time without interest.   Every year when the work of collecting or selling
 grain is completed, the township soviet tell the masses to elect representa-
 tives who will check the accounts with the responsible person of the adjust-
 ment bureau.  After that, a statement of account is made public.  Every

 year after fall grain is collected, measured and stored in the granaries,
 which are then sealed by the township soviet with long strips of paper.
 Grain is sold once or twice in spring and summer.  When the masses need
 grain, the granaries will be opened so the masses may buy grain.   In gen-
 eral grain is sold every year in March when it is planting time and in May,
 when last season's grain is consumed while the new crop is not yet ready
 for harvesting.
 The bureaus were renamed grain cooperatives in February this year, but the
 organization remains the same.   Since the launching of the economic con-
 struction campaign this year, the grain cooperatives of all the townships
 have been expanded.   For example, the grain cooperative of Upper Ts'ai-hsi
 originally had a capital of 215 yuan.   Its capital is now increased by 203
 yuan to 418 yuan.   That of Lower Ts'ai-hsi originally had a capital of 137
 yuan.  It is increased by 200 yuan to 337 yuan.  The 5-man committee of the
 adjustment bureau and a chairman are regularly posted at the bureau.   They
 get paid for their meals.
 In May this year there was famine in the two townships of Shang-ts'un and
 Chang-wen (now incorporated in T'ung-hsien District).  The two townships are
 mostly bamboo hills.  Each person gets only 1 tan of arable land, and the
 paper-making industry has failed.   The grain adjustment bureaus of all other
 townships.of the district cooperated in giving relief.  The price of paddy
 was then 8 sheng per yuan, but the adjustment bureaus lent these townships
 paddy at last fall's price of 1 tou and 8 sheng per yuan, to be repaid after
 fall.   The whole district lent a total of 36 tan, in addition, miscellaneous
 food (dried sweet potatoes, etc) and cash were collected for relief.  As a
 result, no one starved.   There has been no famine in the other townships of
 Ts'ai-hai District this year, thanks to the efforts of the adjustment bureaus.
 In Lower Ts'ai-hsi there is also a "Rice Sales Cooperative" with a capital
 of 130 yuan at 50 cents a share. This is set up exclusively for the conveni-
 ence of Red Army units in transit, travelers, government personnel and the
 masses victimized  by disasters who went to buy grain.   The cooperative is
 government by a committee of 5, who are not regularly posted at the coopera-
 tive.  On market days one person works there for a half a day.  At other
 times its work is carried on by some other consumer cooperative.  The worker
 who buys rice for sale is paid his wages plus money for his meals.  No divi-
 dend is distributed.   The ordinary masses rarely buy their rice here.  Only
 1 or 2 percent of them buy rice here.   Rice is sold at market price. Since
 .this cooperative was set up with capital raised by the masses, Red Armymen
 and disaster victims no longer have to buy rice from door to door.
 (4)   Draft Cattle Cooperatives
 This cooperative has been set up only by Upper and Lower Ts'ai-hsi townships
 in the whole district.   Each cooperative owns 3 head of cattle.
 About 20 percent of the families of the two townships have no cattle.

 No solution has as yet been found to this situation.
 (5)   Everyday Life
 Rice:   Before the uprising, poor peasants and hired hands had an average
 of only 3 months supply of rice a year for their own consumption.   In the
 remaining 9 months they had to live on miscellaneous crops.  In the period
 before harvest, when the old stock was exhausted and the new crop was not
 yet ready, they had to subsist on goat weed and some on chaff.  Now they
 have 6 months reserve of rice and another 6 months reserve of miscellaneous
 crops, so they have enough to last them a whole year.   The region produces
 little rice, so the people still have to depend on miscellaneous crops half
 the time.  Production of miscellaneous crops has now increased.   Before the
 uprising, a meal was far from satisfying.  Now people can eat their fill.
 Moreover, they have a surplus which they can sell to the Red Army or use
 for paying land tax, buying public bonds or exchanging for oil and salt.
 In short, the food situation has improved 100 percent (6-month reserve of
 rice compared with 3-month reserve).
 Meat:   Before the uprising, poor peasants and hired hands consumed on average
 of 1 yuan (ta-yang) of meat a year per capita.   Now it is 2 yuan, an increase
 of 100 percent.  Before the uprising only 60 families in a 100 kept pigs.
 Now 95 families in a 100 keep pigs.
 Clothing:  Before the uprising each person could make an average of one suit
 every 2 years.  After the uprising each person could make an average of 1 1/2
 suits every year, an increase of 300 percent. This year the situation has
 again changed.  Cloth is scarce as a result of the blockade, so each person
 can make an average of only half a suit, a return to the pre-upsiring status.
 Before the uprising an unlined suit was worth 18 mao (15 mao for  cloth and
 3 mao for labor).  Last year one suit was worth 21 mao (17 mao for cloth and
 4  mao for labor) or equal to 1.5 yuan.   This year one suit is worth 34 mao
 (30 mao for cloth and 4 mao for labor, or the equivalent of 2.4 yuan in ta-
 yang).   Counterrevolution has jacked up the price of our clothing to this
 extent!
 Salt:   Before the uprising each person consumed an average of 1 catty of
 salt a month.   In November this year each person consumed only 3.2 Jiang
 of salt a month.   In other words, a family of 5 who consumed 5 cattles of
 salt a month before the uprising consumed only 1 catty in November this year.
 There will be no salt for anyone unless the Kuomintang is overthrown!
 Oil:   Before the uprising the per capita consumption (of wood oil from
 Kiangsi and local lard) was 6 Jiang a month.   There is now no reduction or
 increase.   But because wood oil from Kiangsi is reduced, the masses are con-
 suming more lard.

 (2)  Mobilization at meetings separately held by all organizations.
 (3)  Mobilization at meeting of representatives of township soviets.
 (4)  A mass meeting at the village level was held exclusively for propa-
 ganda, not for the sale of bonds.
 (5)  A mass rally was held at the township level to sell bonds.  Over 1,500
 worth of bonds was sold in each of the two townships.  Work not yet finished.

 (6)  Sales committee of township representatives (3 from each village) and
 propaganda team (organized by township with 5 persons from each village)
 carried out propaganda from door to door.
 (7)  At a rally of electors, over 600 yuan of bonds was sold in Upper Ts'ai-
 hsi and another 1,600 yuan was sold in Lower Ts'ai-hsi.  Up to that time
 over 2,000 yuan was sold in Upper Ts'ai-hsi, with over 1,000 yuan still un-
 sold.  Over 3,000 yuan was sold in Lower Ts'ai-hsi, with about 900 yuan still
 unsold.
 (8)  After that the representatives, sales committee and propaganda team
 .carried out door-to-door agitation, and sold all the bonds.  The people
 pledged to buy the remaining bonds, but certificates had not yet been re-
 ceived.
 The buying of bonds was entirely voluntary without coercion. At every one
 of the meetings there was talk about economic construction.   Because the
 county trade bureau has been set up and the masses can buy salt and cloth,
 they all the more realize the importance of the economic bonds.
 We repeat.  Only by coordinating economic construction with political mobi-
 lization is it possible to create a higher upsurge of the expansion of the
 Red Army and spur the broad masses to the battle front.  After the adult
 and young males have left Ts'ai-hsi en masse to join the Red Army or for
 work, production exceeds that before the uprising by 10 percent. All waste-
 land is developed, so it is necessary to carry development to the hills.
 There is not a single piece of arable land that is not planted with some
 crop.  The life of the masses is improved by more than 100 percent.
 The labor cooperative (called labor mutual-aid cooperative elsewhere),
 consumer cooperative and grain cooperative have organized .the economic
 life of the masses of the whole township.  Economic organization has reached
 a very high level, so Ts'ai-hsi becomes the first glorious model in this
 respect throughout the soviet area.   This economic achievement buoys up
 the spirit of the masses.   They can now take up arms and go to the front
 for the defense and development of the soviet area entirely free of worry
 for their dependents at home.  Of the total population of 4,928 of the two
 townships, 1,018 (485 from Upper Ts'.ai-hsi and 533 from Lower Ts'ai-hsi)
 have left to join the Red Army or for work.  This ironclad fact gives us
 an effective weapon with which to smash the humbuggery of all opportunities,
 who for example declare that economic construction is impossible during
 the Civil War, that the life of the masses of the soviet area has not im-
 proved, that the masses are unwilling to join the Red Army, or that expan-
 sion of the Red Army will leave no manpower for production. We call upon
 the hundreds and thousands of townships throughout the Soviet area to emu-
 late the townships of Ch'ang-wang, Ts'ai-hsi and Shih-shui.  We hereby
 solemnly place the glorious achievements of these several townships before
 all the worker-peasant masses, so they may build the several thousand town-
 ships like Ch'ang-wang, Ts'ai-hsi and Shih-shui and make them a strong
 advanced position for'winning victory in all China.

 [Text]  The land investigation movement is a violent, ruthless class strug-
 gle.   It is necessary to mobilize the largest number of the masses to take
 part with fervor in the struggle and form a mass movement, so as to insure
 the correct implementation of the class line and attain the object of strik-
 ing down the remnant forces of feudalism.  All bureaucratic modes of work
 that are alien to the masses are the greatest enemy of the land investigation
 movement.  Mass work in the land investigation involves mainly the telling
 apart of classes, confiscation and redistribution according to classes, cor-
 rect leadership for labor unions and poor peasant corps, etc.
 I.   Discussing Classes (Doing Propaganda)
 1.   Strategy of the land investigation movement:   In order to weaken rich
 peasants and liquidate landlords by making workers the leaders, relying on
 poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants.   Content of the propaganda:
 Explaining this strategy very clearly to the masses.
 2.   In order to explain this strategy, it is necessary to make clear the
 difference between landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants
 and workers.  In the course of the explanation, it is necessary to demon-
 strate how landlords are feudal exploiters and rich peasants are semi-feudal
 exploiters, so that only by adopting the policy of liquidating landlords and
 weakening rich peasants will it be possible to give all the benefit of the
 land revolution to middle peasants, poor peasants and workers.
 3.   But there is a difference between rich peasants and landlords.  Rich
 peasants do no labor themselves.   So against landlords a policy of liquida-
 tion is adopted, but against rich peasants a policy of weakening them is
 adopted.   Hence the tendency  to liquidate rich peasants is wrong.  At the
 same time, rich peasants should not be treated as landlords.
 4.   Strategy toward middle peasants:   Uniting with middle peasants is the
 innermost core of the strategy of the land revolution.   Support or opposi-
 tion by middle peasants makes the difference between success or failure of
 the land revolution.  Hence it is necessary to explain this strategy to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 the masses again and again, and make it clear that impingement on the
 interests of middle peasants will absolutely not be allowed.  To unite
 with middle peasants and avoid impinging on their interests, it is neces-
 sary to make clear what middle peasants are with the example of "well-off
 middle peasants."  It is necessary to make clear emphatically the boundary
 line between rich peasants and middle peasants, so as to stabilize the well-
 off middle peasants.  It is necessary to expose the deceiving of middle
 peasants by landlords and rich peasants, so middle peasants may free them-
 selves from the influence of landlords and rich peasants, rally around the
 poor peasants, and together with them wage struggle against landlords.
 5.   It is necessary to expose every deceptive slogan put forward by the
 landlords and rich peasants, and explain it broadly to the masses.   Care
 must be taken against the use by landlords and rich peasants and clannish,
 local backward ideas to deceive the middle and poor peasants and sabotage
 the movement.
 6.   It is necessary to make clear that land investigation is a weapon for
 smashing the enemy's encirclement and suppression campaign, because it will
 wipe out the remnant forces of feudalism.  Once enemy troublemakers concealed
 in the soviet area are removed and the revolutionary fervor of the broad
 masses is heightened, expansion of the Red Army, economic construction and
 other work will be easier to carry out.
 7.   Concrete slogans should be put forward according to local conditions.
 In a backward village, for example, it is necessary to find the cause for
 the backwardness and put forward concrete slogans for mobilizing the masses.
 Again, if there is a reactionary landlord in the area who intimidates the
 masses so they dare not rise to struggle actively, it will be necessary to
 put forward slogans mentioning the landlord by name.   Furthermore, if some
 local government personnel commit the grave error of drifting away from the
 masses so the masses are dissatisfied, propaganda will have to be done by
 exposing the error of such personnel so as to mobilize the masses for strug-
 gle.
 8.  All the above concerns the content of propaganda.  The following will
 deal with the way of doing propaganda. Propaganda on land ownership inves-
 tigation should be directed first to township-level cadres (representatives
 of township soviets and responsible officers of all mass organizations) to
 make them understand first so they may in turn do propaganda among the
 masses.   Second, to conferences of labor unions and poor peasant corps to
 make the members understand; and third, to mass rallies in villages to make
 every one of the masses understand.
 9.   Propaganda makers are chiefly township-level activist cadres, who will
 prepare to speak at mass meetings.  Next, propaganda teams will be organized
 which will speak to the masses after some training.

 10.  Modes of propaganda:   first, speech making, second, posting notices;
 third, writing slogans; fourth, distributing leaflets, fifth, staging new
 plays; sixth, writing articles, and so forth.
 II.  Investigating Classes
 1.  Land investigation is investigation of class status, not investigation
 of land holdings by the mou.  This will create fear among the masses and is
 absolutely wrong.
 2.  Investigation of class status is. to find out landlords, rich peasants.,
 exploiters and those who are hidden among the peasants but who are not
 peasants.   It is investigation of this handful of people, not investigation
 into the class status of middle and poor peasants.  Therefore, there must
 not be door-to-door investigation, which will create fear among the masses
 and is absolutely wrong.
 3.   Investigation of class status must be preceded by a period of propa-
 ganda, that is, a period of telling the classes.  Investigation without
 first universally speaking about classes will create fear among the masses,
 and is absolutely wrong.
 4.   In the investigation of classes, members of labor unions and poor
 peasant groups and large numbers of the masses must be mobilized to do the
 investigating.   Results of the investigation should be immediately reported
 to poor peasant corps and the land investigation committee.  Investigation
 should not be done  by only a few people, because this will create fear
 among the masses and is absolutely wrong.
 5.   Investigation of classes must be made thoroughly.  No matter whether
 the ones investigated are landlords or rich peasants, the way they ex-
 ploited others and the way they lived in the past must be found out in
 great detail.  Only by so doing can they be willing to admit their crime
 and the masses can be satisfied.   If a conclusion is made after a cursory
 examination, it will be easy to make mistakes.  The persons investigated
 will be unwilling to admit their guilt and the masses will not be satis-
 fied.   This will hamper the land                    investigation movement.   In dealing with
 middle peasants, all the more care must be exercised so as not to label
 them rich peasants or rich peasants as landlords.
 6.   All information gathered from a family in a class investigation must
 be written down in a "class status investigation form," so the people may
 comment on it and checks can be made in the future.   If details are only
 memorized, or if only a few lines are scribbled in a notebook, the infor-
 mation may be easily lost.  That will be bad.
 III.   Passing Class Status
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 1.  Passing class status means deciding a person's class status.  Because
 that will decide the person's life or death, extreme care should be taken.
 Everything must be made clear before a case can be put forward for passing.
 2.  Order of passing:   First the poor peasant groups must hold a general
 meeting. After discussion at the meeting and the cases are approved by the
 majority by a show of hands, they can be considered to have passed the poor
 peasant groups.   If there are any doubts about a case, it should not be
 passed at the meeting, but should be discussed again at the next meeting.
 3.  Second, the township land investigation committee will examine the view
 of the poor peasant groups.  If it is found correct, it will be passed;
 if incorrect, it will be rectified.   If in doubt, another investigation
 should be made.
 4. Third, it is the turn of the district land department.   If it cannot
 make a decision, the cases will be-referred to the district land investiga-
 tion committee.  If the district committee in turn cannot make a decision,
 they will be referred to the county land department.
 5.   Fourth, the village mass meeting.  A mass meeting must be held in the
 village of the person investigated, when he will report details of his ex-
 ploitation of others and his way of life, to see if the masses approve of
 his case.   If they approve, the case is passed. If they do not approve,
 another investigation should be made.   There must be no forced passing.
 If passage is forced, the masses will not be satisfied.   It will be command-
 ism, which must be resolutely and firmly opposed.
 6.   The above four steps of passing a person's class status are indispensable.
 Passing at a mass meeting is particularly important.   In some places land
 has been confiscated without first passing a mass meeting.   That is wrong.
 7.   If a case has been passed wrongly, such as passing a middle peasant for
 a rich peasant, a rich peasant for a landlord, or a landlord for a rich
 peasant, the decision should be overturned.  It will be necessary to ex-
 plain at a mass meeting the past error and the reason for correction, so
 as to make the masses satisfied.
 8.   In overturning a wrong decision, restitution of land and property must
 be made to the wronged person if he is a middle peasant.  Even if his land
 has already been redistributed, it must be resumed and given back to him.
 If the person is a rich peasant, restitution of land should also be made
 to him if such land is available.   If there is really no land available,
 some other way should be worked out in the future for him.   Such restitu-
 tion always wins the approval of the masses.   It is completely wrong to let
 errors go unremedied.
 IV.   Confiscation and Redistribution

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 1.   Confiscation of a landlord's land and property and confiscation of a
 rich peasant's land and surplus cattle, farm implements and houses should
 be carried out only after approval by the masses at a village mass meeting.
 There must be no confiscation without prior consent from the masses.  There
 must be no confiscation at night.
 2.   All property confiscated from landlords, with the exception of ready
 cash and valuables which must be handed over to the finance department of
 the government, should be distributed. among the masses.    This is one way
 of increasing the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle.
 3.   While the village mass meeting is in progress, an ad hoc committee to
 take charge of confiscation and distribution should be elected.   Confis-
 cation should be made immediately and so should distribution.   There must
 be no delay in confiscation or distribution.  Property should not be
 brought to the government office and then distributed after discussion.
 4.   Distribution should be made within the village where the confiscation
 is made and must not be equally distributed in the whole township.   (This
 does not apply to the property of big landlords).
 5.   Pigs,   chicken, etc. should be cooked and then consumed at the mass
 meeting.  They must not be eaten by a small number of work personnel.
 [Editor's note:   There is no paragraph 6 in the original]
 7.   Government workers are the ones most eager to demand a share of the
 distribution so as to set an example.   It articles of everyday use are
 extremely short, the consent of the masses must be obtained and distribu-
 tion should be approved at the mass meeting.  Work personnel must be pre-
 vented from freely taking things.
 8.   With the consent of the masses, those who receive a share of the con-
 fiscated land should form a cattle cooperative so they may jointly use the
 draft cattle and important farm implements confiscated.
 9.   It is not right to delay distribution of land that is confiscated.
 That should be distributed as soon as possible after setting aside Red
 Army common land and public business land.  Land should be distributed
 first to those who received no or very little land in past distributions.
 If there is land left after that, it should be equally distributed among
 the villages as a unit.   Forests, fish ponds, houses, latrines should like-
 wise be promptly distributed among the masses.
 10.   Every time a distribution is made, while the enthusiasm of the masses
 for struggle is at its height, slogans of Red Army expansion and develop-
 ment of cooperatives should be opportunely put forward so the masses may
 be led to take part enthusiastically in the revolutionary war and the con-
 struction of the soviet.

 V.   Labor Unions and Poor. Peasant Groups
 1.   Optimum results can be obtained from talking about classes, investiga-
 tion of class status, passing of class status, confiscation and distribu-
 tion and other work only by mobilizing the labor unions and poor peasant
 groups. Labor unions should be leaders in class struggle in rural villages
 and poor peasant corps the pillars and keystone of rural class struggle.
 2.   Correct development of the land investigation movement depends on the
 labor unions directing their own members to join the poor peasant groups
 and play an active role in the corps.
 3.   Poor peasant groups should be developed, so they may become organiza-
 tions which the broad mass of poor peasants can freely join.
 4.   Poor peasant groups must be purged of concealed bad elements.
 5.   Poor peasant corps should frequently hold meetings during the land in-
 vestigation movement. They should grasp the movement as their central work.
 6.   Middle peasants should be made to rally around the poor peasant groups.
 They should be induced to attend meetings of the poor peasant groups to
 .listen to the proceedings.
 7.   In leading the work of land investigation and struggle, the-labor unions
 and poor peasant groups must not run counter to the principles mentioned in
 the foregoing paragraphs.
 Only by mobilizing the broad masses in accordance with the aforementioned
 strategy and methods will it be possible to obtain satisfactory results in
 the'land investigation movement.  Any failure to do propaganda or to do it
 properly, seriously and univer.sally, and any failure to comply with the
 class line and mass line and to obtain the approval or consent of the masses
 in the investigation and passing of class status and in the work of confisca-
 tion and distribution will not achieve results in the land investigation move-
 ment.  On the contrary, it will make the masses dissatisfied and hamper the
 progress of the land investigation movement.   Therefore, opposition to Left-
 ist opportunism in the movement which trespasses against middle peasants and
 wipes out rich peasants, to Rightist opportunism which shelters landlords
 and rich peasants, and to bureaucratic methods of leadership and work is
 an essential condition for the correct development of the land investigation
 movement.

 FIRST CABLE MESSAGE FROM PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FUKIEN PEOPLE'S
 REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT AND THE 19TH ROUTE ARMY
 [Text]  Fukien People's Revolutionary Government and Officers and Men of the
 People's Revolutionary Army:
 More than a month has passed since representatives of the Soviet Government
 and Worker-Peasant Red Army and your representatives concluded an anti-Japan,
 anti-Chiang draft agreement, but up to now we have not seen you taking active
 anti-Japan, anti-Chiang action, nor have we seen any concrete, practical'
 work on your part in mobilizing the masses for struggle and arming them to
 oppose Japan and Chiang.   On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek has already sent
 three columns to attack Foochow and Yen-p'ing, and Japanese imperialism is
 already prepared to occupy Foochow and Amoy in response to Chiang Kai-shek's
 military action.  You and the broad mass of people of Fukien are in the midst
 of extreme danger.   The Soviet Government and Worker-Peasant Red Army want to
 tell you solemnly that any passivity, hesitancy and indecision in the face of
 such danger will be a very great crime against the Chinese revolution.
 Therefore, the Soviet Central Government and Worker-Peasant Red Army demand
 that you take immediate, resolute action in accordance with the basic
 principles decided upon in our anti-Japan, anti-Chiang draft agreement,
 concentrate all your armed forces and immediately begin an anti-Chiang
 battle of decision.   At the same time you must resolutely mobilize and arm
 the broad masses, organize a truly popular revolutionary army of volunteers,
 and truly give the people the democratic rights of speech, publication,
 assembly, association and strike to develop mass struggle against the
 Japanese and Chiang.  We believe that we can win ultimate victory only by
 relying on the strength of the millions of broad masses.   Our Soviet
 Government and Worker-Peasant Red Army are ready to join forces with you
 any time and conclude with you an operational military agreement to oppose
 and strike down our common enemies--Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's
 Kuomintang government in Nanking.  We hope you will let us know your de-
 cisions as soon as possible.

 SECOND CABLE MESSAGE FROM THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FUKIEN
 PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
 13 January 1934
 [Text]   Committee Members Li, Ch'en and Chiang of the People's Government:
 Judged on the basis of the present situation, Foochow is about to fall and
 the People's Government is in danger.   In accordance with our bilateral
 agreement of the past, the Soviet Central Government ventures to make the
 following emergency proposals to your esteemed government in the spirit of
 the anti-Japan, anti-Chiang united front:
 1.   The People's Government should immediately put in practice the people's
 democratic rights it has promised in its declaration and in the agreement.
 2.   The People's Government should immediately arm the masses of Foochow
 and its environs, Ch'uan-chou, Chang-chou and other places, and encourage
 and support the broad masses in their participation in the anti-Japan, anti-
 Chiang front to defend Foochow, Ch'uan-chou, Chang-chou and other areas.
 3.   Encourage the masses to organize at once anti-Japan, anti-Chiang fight-
 ing bodies, but do not obstruct or ban the development of such organizations
 under the excuse of the critical state of the war.
 4.   There should be practical encouragement to armed organizations of the

 (such as the coastal areas of Fukien and Chekiang).
 5.   There should be determination to purge from your ranks those elements
 who are ready to capitulate to Chiang Kai-shek or who want to ask imperial-
 ism for protection.
 6.   Conduct propaganda among all officers and men of the 19th Route Army
 and let them know that only by cooperating to the end with the Soviet and
 the Red Army can they oppose the Japanese and Chiang.   Take all effective
 measures and united military. action.

 Obviously, Chiang Kai-shek and Japanese imperialism are coordinating their
 action with the common object of wiping out the 19th Route Army.   If your
 esteemed government wishes indeed to implement what you have advocated,
 then our above-mentioned proposals will be the only way to save the People's
 Government and the 19th Route Army from the present danger.  They will also
 be the final test of your esteemed government's resolve to fulfill the
 promises made in your own declaration and in the agreement.  It should be
 realized that if an anti-Japan, anti-Chiang front of the masses and the
 armed forces is truly established, Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese imperial-
 ists will not be able to rule in peace for long even if Foochow falls,
 and this united front will undoubtedly develop steadily day by day through-
 out the country.  Moreover, if your esteemed government is willing to arm
 the masses and encourage the people of Fukien, firest of all the people of
 Foochow, to defend themselves, there will be new development in the
 situation and Foochow may not necessarily fall.   The matter is urgent.  We
 hope you will consider it and let us have your reply.

 comrades have gloriously sacrificed themselves!   The sacrifice of these
 comrades demonstrates the invincible courage of the proletariat and lays

 A SOLEMN OPENING SPEECH OUTLINE OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S SPEECH (AT THE SECOND
 ALL-SOVIET CONGRESS)
 22 January 1934
 [Text] Comrades!   On behalf of the Central Executive Committee I declare the
 Second National Soviet Congress open.  (Band plays)
 Comrades! Today is the day the Second National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet
 Congress opens.   On behalf of the Central Executive Committee I give the
 whole body of delegates the revolutionary salute!
 Comrades!   It has been 2 years and 2 months since the First National Soviet
 Congress.   Developments in the past 2 years have completely shown and proved
 that the counterrevolutionary ruling classes are further shaken and collaps-
 ing, while the soviet movement and the nationwide revolutionary struggle
 are developing greatly.
 China is a country oppressed and invaded by imperialism, a country in which
 the Kuomintang Government of the landlord - bourgeoisie carries out slaughter,
 repression and enslavement.   The vast territory of the country is surrendered
 by the Kuomintang to the imperialists, so that all China is being threatened
 with partition and joint rule by imperialism and is rapidly approaching a
 .state of doom.   In such a situation China's toiling worker-peasant masses,
 led by the Chinese Communist Party, have united and armed themselves and
 created their own government and state.   Our First All-Soviet Congress
 declared the inauguration of this state, which is our Chinese Soviet
 Republic.   Since then there has been extremely acute opposition between
 two governments in all China.
 Developments of the revolution in the past 2 years have even more developed
 the revolutionary situation throughout the country.   The broad worker-
 peasant masses, rallying around the banner of the Soviet, have been attack-
 ing our enemies, imperialism and the Kuomintang.  We have won great victories
 in the past 2 years.   In the face of our victories imperialism and the
 Kuomintang are trembling.   Following three "encirclement and suppression"
 campaigns they have organized the 4th and even the 5th "encirclement and
 suppression" campaigns.   But we have shattered the four "encirclement and

 suppression" campaigns of the enemies, and have already won an initial vic-
 tory in smashing the 5th "encirclement and suppression" campaign.  At
 present we are in a battle of decision against the 5th "encirclement and
 suppression" campaign and in a most crucial moment.
 In the past 2 years the Red Army of the whole country has won a great vic-
 tory in the bloody struggle.   In this many of our comrades have shed their
 last drop of blood and gloriously sacrificed themselves for the Soviet.
 Many of those who led the revolutionary struggle in Kuomintang and White
 areas have been murdered by the Kuomintang.  Among these comrades were
 Huang Kung-lueh, Chao Po-sheng, Wei Pa-ch'un, Yun Tai-ying, Ts'ai Ho-sen,
 Teng Chung-hsia, Ch'en Yuan-tao, Lu I, Shen Tse-min, Wang Liang, Hu A-lin,
 Chang Hsi-lung, Wu Kao-ch'un, P'eng Ao and others.   They gloriously
 sacrificed themselves under the enemy's bullets and butcher's knife on
 the fronts and various frontlines.   I propose that we show our grief and
 respect for these comrades by observing a 3-minute silence. (All delegates
 stand up in silence for 3 minutes)
 The tasks of the Second National Soviet Congress are to utterly smash the
 enemy's 5th "encirclement and suppression" campaign, to push the soviet
 movement all over the country and to oppose the scheme and vicious plot
 of imperialism and the Kuomintang to put China into extinction.   Our
 Congress shoulders a great responsibility.   Our Congress should call upon
 the toiling worker-peasant masses throughout the Soviet area and all China
 to struggle for expansion of the Red Army into 1 million ironlike men.  We
 should call upon the masses throughout the Soviet area and all China to arm
 themselves, concentrate all forces and shatter the 5th "encirclement and
 suppression" campaign to win the biggest, most thorough victory of the
 revolutionary war and victory of the revolution in all China.
 Our Congress is the supreme organ of state power of the.whole country.  It
 has immense strength to solve these problems.  We believe it certainly
 can solve them and is fully confident of doing so.   Our Congress will make
 the 5th "encirclement and suppression" campaign end in utter rout, develop
 the revolution in the whole country, extend the territory of the Soviet to
 all regions ruled by the Kuomintang, and unfurl the red flag all over the
 country.  Let us shout:
 Long live the Second National Soviet Congress!
 Long live the soviet new China!  (Overwhelming applause)

 1.   The Current Situation and the Victory of the Soviet Movement
 Two full years have passed since the first All-Soviet Congress.   The develop-
 ment of revolutionary events during these 2 years has fully revealed the
 further vacillation and collapse of the Kuomintang rule, and the accelerated
 unfolding of the soviet movement and its victory!   The period we are in today
 is a period of further intensification of the Chinese revolutionary situation,
 and it is precisely also the interim of the world's entrance into the new
 period of war and revolution.
 The confrontation of the socialist world and the capitalist world has become
 extremely acute now.   On the one hand the socialist economy of the Soviet
 Union has achieved final consolidation, its First Five-Year Plan was com-
 pleted within 4 years, and great achievements were attained in the first
 year of its Second Five-Year Plan.   The Soviet Union very early eliminated
 unemployment, and the cultural level and standards of living of its entire
 working people have been greatly heightened.   The Soviet Union's national
 defense has been greatly consolidated.  With the support of the people
 throughout the world, the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union have been
 successful everywhere, and even the most obdurate U.S. imperialism has been
 compelled to establish diplomatic relations.
 For the capitalist world it was a picture of another kind, the economic
 crisis has reached its apex, the entire production of the capitalist world
 has dropped to an unprecedented low, its unemployed workers are counted by
 the tens of millions, the temporary stability of capitalism has ended, and
 the peril of capitalism in general has entered a new stage.   The various
 imperialist countries are frantically preparing for war.   The result of
 Japanese imperialism's occupation of Manchuria was to bring about an unfold-
 ing of contradictions among the various countries on a new basis--especially
 the contradictions between Japan and the United States--and the imperialist
 bandit war for redistributing the world is threatening all the people.
 Nevertheless, imperialism is again attempting to mitigate the contradictions
 within its ranks for awhile and find a way out by sacrificing the Soviet
 Union and China.   The preparations for war against the Soviet Union have
 never ceased.   The war'to divide China and attack the Chinese Revolution
 is now being carried out even more openly.
 The revolutionary movement of the oppressed people of the world and the
 world's proletariat, however, was born and has grown under the influence
 of the success of the Soviet Union's socialist construction and the threat
 of war and peril of the imperialists.   Fierce class struggles and national
 revolutions are unfolding in all capitalist colonial and semi-colonial
 countries.   The flames of global war and revolution are pressing in on us.
 The Chinese Revolution is part of the world revolution.   But the deepening
 of the national peril, the collapse of the national economy, and the
 victory of the soviet movement have caused the further development of the
 Chinese Revolution and pushed it into special prominence in the world
 revolution.

 The core of the current situation in China is the vast Civil War, a life-and-
 death struggle between revolution and counterrevolution, and the intense
 confrontation between the political power of the worker-peasant Soviet and the
 political power of the Kuomintang landlord bourgeoisie.
 On the one hand, the Kuomintang landlord bourgeoisie wholly capitulated to
 imperialism and led imperialism into occupying vast expanses of Chinese
 territory and monopolizing all of the primary political and economic powers.
 And it led the national economy into general collapse, bringing unprecedented
 suffering to the lives of the hard-working worker-peasant masses.  It stripped
 all freedom from the revolutionary people, suppressed all revolutionary
 movements and carried out frenzied, fascist terrorism.  Under the direction
 of imperialism, it organized all counterrevolutionary forces to launch
 desperate attacks against the Soviet area and the Red Army.  All these have
 one objective.   That is to merge the interests of the Chinese landlord
 bourgeoisie and the interests of capitalism and lead China into becoming
 a colony.
 On the other hand, the Soviet regime called upon all the people of all China
 for a resolute war of national revolution, organizing and leading the Red
 Army and the masses in a struggle to defend and expand the Soviet terri-
 tories.   It sought to smash the repeated "encirclement and suppression"
 campaigns of the imperialist Kuomintang with determined attacks, and mount
 a strict guard against the counterrevolutionary attempts of all exploiting
 elements within the Soviet territories.  All land is to be given to the
 people and the soldiers of the Red Army.  The workers are to be placed on
 an 8-hour work day system, wages are to be increased and aid is to be given
 to the unemployed.   The social insurance system is to be implemented.   All
 the people are to have complete freedom of assembly, speech, publication
 and strike.   The broad masses of workers and peasants are to participate
 in the administration of their own government organizations, but no element
 of the exploiting class is to take part.   The economic life of the people
 is to be organized so as to bring about a change from the former situation,
 under the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie, of suffering cold and hunger,
 to a position that is not only wholly free of hunger and cold, but is also
 improving with every passing day.   The broad masses of people who had no
 possibility whatsoever to enjoy education under the rule of the landlord
 bourgeoisie are to gain to a position where their cultural level is
 heightened daily.   There is only one objective--to overthrow the rule of
 the landlord bourgeoisie throughout the country, drive imperialism out
 of China, liberate several hundred million people from oppression and
 exploitation under the role of the imperialist Kuomintang, obstruct the
 path of colonization that will doom China and establish a Soviet China
 that is free and independent, with territorial integrity.
 The daily mounting intensity of the opposition between two political powers
 cannot but help stimulate the daily intensification of the life-and-death
 struggle between these two powers.   The current period is the historic

 period deciding the victory or defeat of the struggle between the two sides.
 Following on the heels of the fourth "encirclement and suppression" which
 was smashed, the counterrevolutionaries' fifth "encirclement and suppres-
 sion" is now advancing against us on a massive scale. The historic task of
 the Soviet Government is to call upon, organize and lead all revolutionary
 people throughout the Soviet areas and in all China to take part in this
 great and decisive battle, mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants
 to join the Red Army.  We must improve the political education and military
 techniques of the Red Army, enlarge the local armed forces and the
 guerrilla units, launch guerrilla warfare on a broad scale and strengthen
 the centralized and unified leadership of the Soviet over the Red Army in
 the various Soviet areas. The speed and quality of work carried out by the
 Soviet will improve.   Fiscal and economic organizations of the Soviet are to
 ensure that the material needs of the revolutionary war will be met. We will
 launch a workers' class struggle, organize a revolutionary activism of the
 worker masses and bring it to bear on the struggle to smash the enemy.   The
 peasants' land struggle will unfold and we will organize the broad masses
 of peasants to struggle to seize land and protect it.  We call on the toil-
 ing masses of workers and peasants in all China to sacrifice everything
 and exert all efforts for the war.   By so doing we shall thoroughly smash
 the fifth "encirclement and suppression" of the imperialist Kuomintang,
 prevent China from becoming a colony, and win victory, first, for the
 Soviet, in one or several provinces, and then within the entire nation.
 2.   The Imperialist's Offensive and the Soviet Government's Leadership of the
 Anti-Imperialist Campaign
 In the 2 years since the Provincial Central Government was established, the
 most momentous event in the country was the attack of imperialism and the
 counterrevolutionaries' fourth and fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 campaigns launched against the revolution.
 In the bandit war of Japanese imperialism which began on 18 September 1931,
 the eastern provinces of Heilungkiang, Kirin and Liaoning and Jehol Province
 were occupied under the butchery carried out with planes and artillery.
 The P'ing-Tsin area fell under its control, and preparations are now under-
 way for an even more massive and murderous war against Inner Mongolia and
 all of North China.   The British imperialists attacked Szechwan from Tibet.
 The French imperialists attacked Yunnan and Kweichow provinces.  U.S. im-
 perialism wanted the Yangtze River basin and Fukien Province to be placed
 under its direct rule.  All these imperialists extended their poisonous
 hands and schemes over the vast territory of China in order to enslave
 China, wipe out the Chinese Soviet regime, prepare for the offensive
 against the Soviet Union and, at the same time, prepare for World War II
 among the imperialist bandits.   But the landlord bourgeoisie Kuomintang,
 under a policy of giving everything to imperialism, gave away several
 million square li of territory, adopted the shameful policy of non-
 resistance against the attacks of the imperialists.   They bargained the
 interests of the Chinese working people for political and military assistance
 from imperialism so as to facilitate the concentration of its forces to
 attack the Soviet and the Red Army.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 At this time the revolutionary people of China were faced with actions of a
 contradictory nature from two political powers.   The Kuomintang completely
 capitulated to the imperialists and suppressed, in every way possible, the
 people opposing imperialism.   The Soviet resolutely opposed imperialism,
 and in every conceivable way tried to give help to and lead the anti-
 imperialist movement.
 Under such an unprecedentedly grave national crisis, the anti-imperialist
 movement of the revolutionary people throughout China unfolded in an ex-
 tremely fierce manner.  The struggle of volunteer forces, several hundred
 thousand strong, in the Three Eastern Provinces and the bloody battle of
 Shanghai fought by the soldiers of the 19th Route Army caused the anti-
 imperialist movement to spread throughout China and surged to unprecedented
 levels.
 In the past 2 years the Provisional Soviet Central Government has repeatedly
 cabled its opposition to Japanese imperialism's war of banditry and of the
 Kuomintang's capitulation and betrayal of the nation.   On 14 April 1932, the
 Provisional Central Government officially declared war on Japan.   Simultane-
 ously, it issued the mobilization order for war agaisnt Japan, and called
 upon the people of all China to launch a national revolutionary war and keep
 the imperialists from enslaving China and oppose the Kuomintang which is
 betraying China.   The Provisional Central Government and the Revolutionary
 Military Committee previously called upon all Kuomintang units attacking
 the Soviet and the Red Army,making it known that they were willing to con-
 clude a fighting agreement to oppose Japan and all imperialism under three
 conditions.   These were 1) immediately cease attacks on the Soviet area;
 2) guarantee the democratic rights of the people (freedom of speech,
 publication, assembly and association and strike); and 3) arm the people
 and organize an anti-Japanese volunteer army.  When the Kuomintang concluded
 the Tangku agreement with Japan and when it held the recent direct Sino-
 Japanese negotiations, the Provisional Government repeatedly proclaimed
 to the nation, and to the world, its opposition to such policies and
 actions, which betray the national interests.  The Soviet gives aid to
 the people's struggle against Japan in various areas.   The anti-Japanese
 strike of the Hu Hsi Factory of Shanghai alone was given 16,000 yuan in
 aid by the Soviet.  Also, there was the soliciting of funds by the people
 in the Soviet area to help the anti-Japanese North China volunteer army,
 and much other aid in material and moral support were also given to other
 anti-imperialist struggles.   In the Soviet territories the special rights
 of imperialism were completely abolished long ago.   The influence of
 imperialism was wiped away.   The preachers and priests were driven out by
 the people.   The people's property occupied by the missions has been
 recovered and mission schools have been abolished.   In China it is only
 the Soviet territories which have shaken off the rule of imperialism.
 All these facts clearly indicate that the Soviet Government is the only
 government that is opposing imperialism.   The Soviet Government should
 point out to the people of the country that it is the greatest responsi-
 bility of the Soviet and the entire people to wage direct warfare against

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 imperialism and defeat it.  In order to discharge this responsibility, the
 only way is to rely on the unfolding of the anti-imperialist struggle of
 the broad masses.  First of all, unite all forces and defeat the Kuomintang,
 the running dog of imperialism, because it is the biggest obstacle to the
 opposition put up by the Soviet and the people against imperialism.  The
 people must understand that precisely because of the Kuomintang's obstruc-
 tion--spreading across the area between the Soviet territories and the
 advance of imperialism,. and concentrating all its forces on attacks against
 the Soviet territories--it is impossible for the Red Army to engage the
 imperialists in direct warfare.   They have forced the Soviet and the Red
 Army to take, as their first step, the clearing of the pathway with resolute
 attacks, to smash the Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression."  The direct
 and massive conflict between the Soviet and imperialism draws nearer every
 day.   This makes it necessary for the Soviet to fully strengthen its leader-
 ship of all anti-imperialist struggles.   The Soviet should become the
 organizer and leader of the people's anti-imperialist struggle throughout
 the country.   Only by exerting all efforts to make the people understand
 the current peril and the crimes of the Kuomintang, and depending upon the
 heightening of the anti-imperialist, anti-Kuomintang consciousness of the
 broad masses of people and their organizational strength, can the Soviet
 Government carry out its sacred task to topple the rule of the imperialist
 Kuomintang in China with national revolutionary and the revolutionary civil
 war.
 3.   The Struggle Between the "Encirclement and Suppression" of the Imperialist
 Kuomintang and the Anti-"Encirclement and Suppression" of the Soviet Government
 Because the Chinese Soviet area is the revolutionary base area of the nation-
 wide anti-imperialist movement, because the Chinese Worker-Peasant'Red Army
 is the main force of the nationwide opposition against imperialism and
 because the Soviet movement and the revolution are fiercely advancing in
 their development, the Kuomintang, with the direct assistance of imperialism,
 concentrated all its forces to launch hopeless attacks against the Soviet
 and the Red Army one, two, three, four and even five times in an attempt to
 wipe out the strength of the Chinese revolution and to clear the way for
 imperialism to carve up China.
 But each attack of the imperialist Kuomintang has met with crushing defeat.
 With the support of the people throughout the country, and under the correct
 leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Soviet and the
 Worker-Peasant Red Army have become an invincible force.  Simultaneously,
 the victories of the Soviet and the Red Army have greatly heightened the
 enthusiasm of the working people of China.   It has made them realize that
 only the Soviet and the Red Army are truly fighting for national inde-
 pendence and freedom, and only the Soviet and the Red Army can save China.
 The 4th "encirclement and suppression" began right, after the Kuomintang
 sold.out the Three Eastern Provinces--Kirin, Liaoning and Heilungkiang--
 and concluded the Shanghai cease-fire agreement.   The Kuomintang national
 traitors did not station even a single soldier to oppose the aggression of
 Japanese imperialism, and ignored the repeated announcements of the Soviet
 Central Government and the Red Army stating their willingness to conclude

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 a combat agreement to fight Japanese imperialism with any troops truly
 opposing Japan.   On the contrary, the arch criminal of national betrayal
 in the Kuomintang, Cliiang Kai-shek, concentrated several hundred thousand
 troops to attack Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei and the western Hunan-Hupeh Soviet areas
 to force the Red Army and to withdraw from the area surrounding Wuhan.   On
 our side, although there was a need to avoid battle with vastly superior
 enemy forces, the Red Fourth Front Army was forced to withdraw from the
 Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei border Soviet area due to our subjective errors in
 strategy.   It made the famous long march and created a new, vast Soviet
 base in the area along Szechwan, Nan-chiang [0589 3068], Yu-han [1335 3352]
 and Sui-ting [4840 1353].  From the long march of the Red Fourth Front Army
 came the unfolding of a widespread people's revolutionary struggle in the
 distant northwestern area of China, spreading the seeds of the Soviet
 into an area where the revolutionary situation was relatively backward.  The
 courage and skill of the Red Fourth Front Army in battle turned more than
 10 counties into Red areas in less than a year, induced the hard-working
 workers and peasants and soldiers of the White army in all of Szechwan Pro-
 vince to lean favorably toward the Soviet revolution.   In spite of them-
 selves, Chiang Kai-shek and the Szechwan warlords were forced into a state
 of trembling and fear when faced with the great victories of the Red Fourth
 Front Army.   At the same time, the 2d Red Army Corps, which withdrew from
 the Hung Hu [3163 3275] area, not only did not suffer any appreciable
 losses, but, in positive actions taken in coordination with the Red Fourth
 Front Army in the Szechwan-Hupeh-Hunan border Soviet area, won new victories.
 As for the area around Hung Hu, guerrilla units were still present there.
 In the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei Soviet area our base not only did not sustain
 any great losses, but won a consolidated position and has mounted guerrilla
 warfare on all fronts.
 The Central Soviet Area is where the Central Government is located, and it
 is the homebase of the Soviet movement throughout the country.   It is also
 the prime target of the enemy's attack.  The enemy concentrated the greater
 part of his forces to wage a tenacious campaign against us, deploying the
 so-called "Central Government Forces the forces of warlords Chiang and
 Tsai, the warlords of Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces, and the Hunan
 warlords to surround the Central Soviet Area and various neighboring Soviet
 areas from all directions.   After a year of arduous struggle we won an
 unprecedented victory.   The biggest victory was won in the first half of
 1933.   In this half year period.alone, the Red Army of the Central Soviet
 Area wiped out 24 regiments, 6 battalions and 2 companies of the White Army,
 smashed 3 divisions, 12 regiments, 5 battalions and 2 companies of the
 '    White Army and captured about 20,000 rifles, and some 1,000 machine guns
 and side arms.   Especially in the Tung Huang Pi [2639 7806 7095] campaign,
 the most tenacious basic column of the enemy was wiped out and a final
 and most disastrous defeat was inflicted on the enemy's fourth "encirclement
 and suppression."
 In the great victory of the campaign that smashed the fourth "encirclement
 and suppression," the Red Army not only grew in numbers but also strengthened
 in quality.   Enormous improvements were attained in the political resolute-
 ness and military techniques of the Red commanders and fighters as compared
 to the period before the fourth campaign.   The Soviet territory has been

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 enlarged. Except for the Soviet area in Szechwan Province,'the vast Soviet
 areas in northwest Fukien Province and east Kiangsi Province have been
 expanded with an increase in population of nearly 1 million and the new
 Min Kan [7044 63731 Province was established.   The old Soviet areas have
 become even more consolidated, and this is manifested in the improvement
 of the functions of the Soviet, the heightening of the revolutionary
 enthusiasm of the worker-peasant masses, the development of class struggles
 in the rural and urban areas, as well as the strict suppression of remnant
 counterrevolutionary forces in the Soviet areas.   Simultaneously, this
 victory had a great impact upon the Kuomintang areas.  Under the influence
 of this victory, the courage to struggle was heightened even further among
 the worker-peasant masses in the vast White area.  Not only was there general
 vacillation-among the soldiers of the Kuomintang participating in the
 "encirclement and suppression," there was great fear among the cadres, which
 resulted in forcing Chiang Kai-shek to openly proclaim the desperate order:
 "Those who do not suppress the bandits but want to fight Japan will be shot
 without mercy."
 However, the winning of these victories did not happen by chance.   It was
 dependent upon the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's political
 line, the centralized leadership of the Soviet Government, and the correct-
 ness of its plans and policies, the courage and skill of the Red Army in
 battle, and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers and
 peasants in the Soviet areas, as well as the daily struggles of the worker-
 peasant masses of the White areas and the unfolding of the anti-imperialist
 and anti-Kuomintang movement.  All these fare the basic conditions of de-
 feating the enemy.  Without these conditions there would be no victory.
 After its disatrous defeat in the fourth "encirclement and suppression"
 campaign, the only way out left for the Kuomintang warlords was to
 capitulate to imperialism in an even more shameless manner.   It obtained
 large loans and huge quantities of armaments from imperialism and hired
 foreign advisors in large numbers.   It assembled the forces it formerly
 had and organized new forces (such as training new soldiers, training new
 units and training the blue shirt society of the officers corps).  They
 concentrated all counterrevolutionary forces and, under the direction of
 imperialism, launched the fifth "encirclement and suppression" against
 the Soviet and the Red Army.
 The Soviet, with regard to the fifth "encirclement and suppression," was
 completely in accord with what the Party Central Committee had pointed
 out:   "It is a struggle to prevent imperialism from extricating itself
 from the peril it is in, and it is a struggle to win freedom and
 independence for Soviet China."  The campaign to smash the fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" will decide "whether China will be divided up by
 imperialism and ruled by it jointly, or wholly become a colony,"or
 whether it will become a new Soviet China, independent, free and with its
 territory intact."

 The Soviet should call on all the masses in the Soviet and White areas who
 are participants in the struggle to clearly recognize the gravity of this
 struggle.   Only by uniting with all revolutionary forces to strengthen our
 own forces and uniting with great enthusiasm under the leadership of the
 Soviet, can we achieve complete victory in this campaign.
 The Soviet should give instructions to all the masses participating in the
 struggle:   In smashing this "encirclement and suppression," especially
 after smashing the fourth "encirclement and suppression," we have all the
 basic conditions for defeating the enemy.   The correct leadership of the
 party and the Soviet, the powerful Red Army and its expansion, the activism
 in struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Soviet and
 White areas--all these form the foundation for our victory over the enemy.
 Through our efforts and through the development of contradictions inside
 the ruling class, the new and massive attacks of the imperialist Kuomintang
 have been dealt a severe blow.   The original plans of the enemy have failed,
 and they have been forced to launch the final offensive against us under
 a new plan and on a new front.   We are now face-to-face with the final,
 decisive battle of the fifth "encirclement and suppression."  Although
 the blockhouse policy and the policy of economic blockade of the Kuomintang
 warlords are extremely vicious, they are not impregnable walls of iron and
 bronze that cannot be overcome.   These policies of the enemy disclose only
 their own weakness.  We will raise the level of our military techniques
 and skills, concentrate all our forces and overcome all these difficulties.
 Victory belongs to us.
 We should point out that the difficulties of the enemy greatly exceed ours.
 The vacillation of the White Armies' soldiers, the hate and dissatisfaction
 of the workers and peasants and the broad masses of petite bourgeoisie under
 enemy rule, the struggle and division of the various warlord factions in
 the ruling class, the contradictions and conflicts among the imperialists
 helping the Kuomintang and the bankruptcy of the Kuomintang's finances and
 economy--all these are objective conditions of victory for the revolution.
 Here we should point out that while the imperialist Kuomintang was carrying
 out its fifth "encirclement and suppression," a people's government emerged
 in Fukien Province.   The emergence of this people's revolutionary government
 indicates the further disruption of the Kuomintang's system.
 The great victory of the Soviet movement and the Kuomintang's bankruptcy
 in the eyes of the people throughout the country has forced a part of the
 reactionary ruling class of China to adopt a new method, attempting to find
 a third road outside of the road of the Kuomintang and the Soviet so as to
 preserve the lot of the reactionary ruling class, which is near death.
 However, this plan is futile, because if an organization such as the People's
 Revolutionary Government does not truly proceed from the interests of the
 hard-working masses of. workers and peasants and does not carry out many

 basic policies similar to the ones that have been implemented by the Soviet,
 does not resolutely accept the three conditions already announced by the
 Soviet Government in April of last year and conclude an agreement with the
 Soviet Government to oppose imperialism and the Kuomintang and carry it
 out, it will merely be empty talk and a swindle.   Then, the broad masses of
 revolutionary people will not see the difference between the Kuomintang
 and the People's Revolutionary Government.   It can also be predicted that
 they will fail tragically.  With the trust and confidence of the people
 throughout the country in the Soviet growing day by day, and with the daily
 bankruptcy of the swindles perpetrated by the Kuomintang and all counter-
 revolutionary factions, the Soviet will resolutely smash the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression," obstruct the path of imperialism to turn
 China into a colony and proceed from victory, first in one or more provinces,
 to nationwide victory.   These will give proof to that well-known saying:
 "Only the Soviet can save China!"
 4.   The Formulation of Various Basic Policies of the Soviet in the Past Two
 Years
 When we talk about the various basic policies of the Soviet, we must first
 ask from what basis do these policies proceed?  In answering this question,
 we should understand the past and present situations of the Soviet and the
 tasks that emerged from these situations.
 In the past, the Soviet was born in the midst of guerrilla warfare.   It
 emerged from various very small places, places which were independent from
 each other and were not united.   All around each Soviet area was the world
 of the enemy, and the enemy wreaked destruction and carried out suppression
 of the Soviet areas every minute of the day.  However, it could defeat all
 these enemies.   It emerged and developed from the oppression of defeating
 the enemy countless times.   This was the situation of the Soviet.
 There are many differences in the present situation of the Soviet compared
 to that of the past.   It now has vast territories, a broad mass of people
 and a powerful Red Army.   It has assembled many dispersed forces (although
 they have not all been concentrated), and it has organized and become a
 nation--our Chinese Soviet Republic.   This nation has its place and central
 organizations, and it has already established a provisional central govern-
 ment.   This government is a centralized organization of power.   It relies
 on the broad masses and on the armed forces of the people--the Red Army.
 It is a government of workers and peasants, it has implemented the revolu-
 tionary dictatorship of workers and peasants.  With regard to the workers
 and peasants it is a broad democracy, but it absolutely does not permit
 any landlord bourgeois elements to take part in it.   It is a dictatorship,
 a dictatorship that already has great powers. This dictatorship is already
 having a widespread impact within the country, and there is great trust
 in it among the people.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 There is a great change in the situation from the guerrilla era of the past.
 War, nevertheless, is a daily way of life for it and, furthermore, the war
 has intensified and spread even more.  The reason is because the confronta-
 tion between this dictatorship and the dictatorship of the Kuomintang
 landlord bourgeoisie is becoming more acute with each passing day.   It has
 now entered the decisive period of victory or defeat for both sides, and it
 is faced with the massive "encirclement and suppression" of the imperialist
 Kuomintang.  This is the current situation of the Soviet.
 This kind of situation has decided its tasks, which are that it must exert
 all of its efforts toward mobilizing, organizing and arming the people.   It
 must not cease even for a night its attacks on the enemy so as to smash
 the enemy`s "encirclement and suppression."  Its task is revolutionary war,
 the concentration of all its forces to wage revolutionary war, and the use
 of revolutionary warfare to overthrow the other dictatorship of the enemy.
 It must also overthrow the rule of the powerful imperialists, because
 imperialism is the supporter and leader of that other dictatorship.   The
 objective of overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang is to unify China
 and carry out a democratic revolution of a bourgeois nature, and, further-
 more, it must make it possible for this revolution to be transformed into a
 socialist revolution in the future.  This is the task of the Soviet.
 Can we understand what the purpose of the Soviet is in implementing various
 basic policies in such a situation and under such tasks?  Its purpose is to
 consolidate the already victorious dictatorship of the workers and peasants,
 to spread this dictatorship throughout the nation, and to mobilize, organize
 and arm the hard-working worker-peasant masses throughout the Soviet areas
 and in all China to overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang,
 so as to consolidate and develop this dictatorship.   The Soviet, moreover,
 must implement various necessary and basic policies in preparation for the
 future transformation of the current worker-peasant dictatorship of a
 bourgeois nature into a socialist proletarian dictatorship.   This is the
 point of departure for all Soviet policies.
 The Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee, holding to the
 instructions of the First All-Soviet Congress, have adhered resolutely to
 this kind of general line in policy during the past 2 years and attained
 immense achievements.   From experience it has proved to all of the revolu-
 tionary people in China that only the Soviet Government's policy is a policy
 in the interests of the people and for the people's political power, a policy
 of resolute opposition against the counterrevolutionary policies of
 imperialist Kuomintang for toppling the rule of the imperialist Kuomintang
 throughtout the country, and for rescuing the nation from doom and liberat-
 ing all hard-working people from oppression.
 Needless to say, in the China where two regimes are in acute opposition,
 each and every one of the concrete policies of the Soviet must immediately
 win the support of the broad masses of people.  To the people who have
 drunk the dregs of oppression and exploitation under the counterrevolutionary

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 policies of the imperialist Kuomintang, each and every one of the concrete
 policies of the Soviet is like a magnet attracting iron filings.  This kind
 of situation has caused great alarm in the reactionary ruling class.  It
 did not hesitate to use the most shameless sort of rumor-mongering to
 slander the policies of the Soviet.  However, ironclad facts powerfully
 refuted the shameless rumors.  Provided he is not a fanatical Kuomintang
 landlord capitalist, every Chinese who has eyes will have to admit that
 there is a vast difference between the policies of the Soviet Government
 and that of the Kuomintang Government.
 Let Us First Talk About the Soviet Arming of the People and the Building of
 the Red Army
 For the purpose of opposing the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" and
 waging the revolutionary war, the first task of the Soviet is to arm the
 people, organize a powerful Red Army, local troops and guerrilla units and
 organize supply and transport for waging war.   In the resolute struggle
 against the enemy's fourth and fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaigns
 during the past 2 years, the Soviet forces have achieved great success.
 First of all, the establishment of the Central Revolutionary Military
 Affairs Committee unified the leadership of the Red Army throughout the
 country.   It brought about the beginning of mutual help and coordination
 of the Red Army units on the various fronts of the various Soviet areas
 under a unified strategic purpose.   This is the key to the transformation
 from activities of dispersed guerrilla units to activities of a regular
 and massive Red Army.   In the past 2 years, the Revolutionary Military
 Affairs Committee, leading the Red Army throughout the country, primarily
 the Red Army in the Central Soviet Area, conducted a glorious and
 victorious war, smashing the fourth "encirclement and suppression" of the
 enemy and also winning the initial victory in the campaign against the
 enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 In 2 years the Red Army expanded very rapidly, growing several times larger
 than it was 2 years ago.  The success achieved in this respect was dependent
 upon the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants for parti-
 cipating in the revolutionary war.   It was also dependent upon the improve-
 ment of mobilization methods and the implementation of the Soviet law and
 decrees on preferential treatment of Red Army members.   In the month of
 Red May, 1933, there was an increase of nearly 20,000 new fighters in the
 several counties of the Central Soviet Area.   In many areas, masses of
 workers and peasants rushed into the Red Army as a surging tide.   The
 opportunist contention of the impossibility of enlarging the Red Army
 in the new and border areas or that the masses were unwilling to enlist
 in the Red Army were proven wrong in practice.   The key to the rapid
 accomplishment of the mobilization plan lies in the correctness of
 mobilization methods and the thorough implementation of the Soviet law and
 decrees on preferential treatment of Red Army members.   Abolishing coercive
 orders, carrying out ample propaganda and persuasion and placing restraints
 on class alien elements sabotaging the expansion of the Red Army and giving
 leadership to deserters were important program items of the mobilization
 methods.   It is necessary to raise the social status of Red Army fighters
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 to a higher standard, giving all possible and necessary spiritual and
 material support to each individual Red Army fighter.  We will distribute
 land to Red Army fighters of non-native residence and mobilize the masses
 to farm the land for them and to cultivate the land well for the family
 of each individual Red Army fighter.  There is a 5-percent discount for
 families of Red Army members at the consumer cooperatives and we run special
 shops supplying daily necessities to them, giving 10 percent of the profits
 made by state enterprises and cooperatives to the families of Red Army
 members.  We call on the masses to raise funds and aid families of Red Army
 members afflicted with sickness and to give moral and material comfort to
 the families of Red Army members.   These practical and thorough implementa-
 tions of the laws and decrees on the preferential treatment of Red Army
 fighters and their families are necessary and very important measures
 ensuring that the Red Army members will proceed to the front without worry
 and that their will to fight will be consolidated.
 A great many models of such work exist in the various Soviet areas.   The
 broad masses of workers and peasants in these areas regard as their sacred
 trust to protect and expand the Soviet areas with guns in their hands,
 and they march to the fronts in large numbers.  Among these, for example,
 is Chang-kang [7022 1481] Village in Kiangsi Province.  Of the 407 youths
 and adults between the ages of 16 to 45, 320 left the village to join the
 Red Army or work for it.   The ratio of those who left the village and those
 who remained, 87 persons, was 80 percent to 20 percent.  Of the total
 number of 554 youths and adults of Upper-tsai-chi [0006 2088 3305] Village
 in Fukien Province, only 67 remained.   The comparative ratio between those
 who left and those who stayed behind was 88 percent to 12 percent.  What
 about the production of the village and the livelihood of families when
 such large numbers of able-bodied persons so heroically and courageously
 took to the fronts?  Not only was there no adverse effect, but there was
 even greater expansion and improvement.  What was the reason for this?
 Because of the mutual-help cooperatives, cultivation units and all other
 methods used have gone about in an organized and planned way to arrange the
 distribution of the labor force in the village and resolved every one of
 the difficulties of the families of Red Army members.   I think such
 glorious lessons are worthy of study by all the Soviet areas.   The trans-
 formation of the Red Army into an iron-like consolidated body should be
 closely linked with its expansion.   Similarly, good results have been
 achieved on such work in the past 2 years.   The present Red Army has stepped
 onto the road of becoming a regular, revolutionary armed column of steel.
 This is demonstrated by:   1) increase in (class) elements, putting into
 practice (the principle of) only the hard-working masses of workers and
 peasants have the glorious right to bear arms and resolutely driving out
 those class alien elements who have infiltrated (into the ranks);
 2) worker cadres have increased and the system of political committee
 members has been established on a general scale, and the command of the
 Red Army is held in reliable hands; 3) political work has improved, firming
 up the determination of Red fighters to struggle to the end for the Soviet,
 heightened the discipline of class consciousness and the liaison between

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 the Red Army and the broad masses of people has become closely linked;
 4) military techniques have been improved.  Although the Red Army at present
 lacks the adoption of the most modern weapons and the training in their use,
 there have been great improvements in general military techniques in compari-
 son with the past, and 5) changes have been made in organizational structure,
 strengthening the Red Army organizationally.  All these have greatly
 increased the combat effectiveness of the Red Army, transforming it into
 an invincible Soviet armed force.
 The expansion of Red Youth Units and guerrilla units on a large scale is an
 extremely important enterprise of the Soviet in the arming of the people
 to wage revolutionary war.   The Red Guard Army and the Young Pioneers are
 existing reserve forces in the rear area of the Red Army on the front
 lines.   These are the local forces for defending the Soviet areas, and they
 are also the bridge spanning the present voluntary enlistment system to
 the obligatory service that will be implemented in the future.  As for the
 guerrilla units, they are the creators of new (Soviet) areas and an indis-
 pensible detachment of the Red Army main force.   In the past 2 years, these
 units have been developed in the various Soviet areas and their military
 and political training have also been considerably strengthened.   Their
 participation in the Red Army, the defense of local areas, attacks on and
 creating havoc among the enemy, have been clearly demonstrated in the many
 smashings of the "encirclement and suppressions" to have achieved extremely
 great results.   These have caused the enemy to fear and wonder and they
 have become the greatest difficulty facing the enemy's aggression of the
 Soviet areas.   Their functions were specially demonstrated in the Central
 Soviet Areas and the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi Soviet area.
 It is an important responsibility of the Soviet to spread this system to
 all newly opened Soviet areas, vigorously strengthening their training so
 as to transform these troops into the most reliable brothers of the Red
 Army in the revolutionary war.   The fleshing out of the Red Army's rations
 and supplies, organizing military transportation to maintain liaison between
 the front lines and the rear lines, and organizing military hygiene and
 medical treatment are enterprises all of which have similar decisive
 significance to the revolutionary war (efforts).  Under the situation of
 economic blockade by the enemy and where we have not yet captured some
 central cities, the implementation of this task is extremely difficult.
 But in the past 2 years, we have been able to establish a considerable
 foundation in this work by relying upon and drawing from the enthusiasm
 of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Soviet and White areas.
 In this respect we had ensured the supply and transportation of rations
 to the Red Army over extended periods of time.   This, we are forced to
 admit, is an extremely great achievement.  However, in the current decisive
 campaign to smash the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" and in
 the even more massive war to follow, we are required to use our greatest
 power to strengthen the forces in this respect and ensure that there is an
 even more adequate supply.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 We are faced with a revolutionary war on an even more massive scale, and
 the Soviet policy of arming the people demonstrates its top priority nature.
 Without slackening the arming of the people for even a moment, we must realize
 the formation of a million strong iron-like Red Army, by carrying out our
 work with the greatest of speed.   This is the basic fighting task of the
 Soviet.
 The basic task of the Soviet is revolutionary war, the mobilization of all
 forces of the people to wage war.   Revolving around this basic task are
 other pressing tasks for the Soviet.   It should carry out extensive demo-
 cracy for the broad masses of people.   It must resolutely suppress counter-
 revolution within its ranks.  It must launch the workers' class struggle,
 unfold the agrarian revolution of the peasants and, under the principle of
 uniting workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class,
 heighten the enthusiasm of the worker-peasant masses.   It should carry out
 correct financial and economic policies so as to ensure the material needs
 of the revolutionary war.   It should carry out cultural revolution and arm
 the minds of the worker-peasant masses.   All these, as well as very many
 other basic policies, are geared to one objective.   That is to topple the
 imperialist Kuomintang's rule with revolutionary war, consolidate and develop
 the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants as well as preparing
 for the transition to the stage of proletarian dictatorship.
 Let us now discuss the democratic system of the Soviet.
 The Soviet of worker-peasant democratic dictatorship is the people's own
 political power, and it is directly dependent upon the people.   It must
 maintain to the highest degree of intimacy the relationship between itself
 and the people, and only following that can it play its role.   The Soviet
 is imbued with mighty powers.   It has already become the organizer and
 leader of the revolutionary war, as well as organizer and leader of the
 lives of the masses.   The greatness of its powers cannot be compared with
 any form of government in history.   It is entirely dependent, however,
 upon the people and cannot be separated from the people for even a moment.
 The Soviet regime must use force in handling all class enemies, but toward
 its own class--the hard-working masses of workers and peasants--it cannot
 use force of any kind, and what it demonstrates is only the most extensive
 form of democracy.
 The most extensive democracy of the Soviet is, first of all, displayed in
 its own election.   The Soviet wholly grants to all exploited and oppressed
 people all the rights to elect and be elected.  Women have equal rights
 with men.   For the hard-working workers and peasants, obtaining such rights
 was a historical precedent.   In summing up the election experiences of the
 various Soviet areas during the past 2 years, generally speaking, the
 achievements made were very great.
 First, on the registration of voters.  A strict segregation of those
 residents with voting rights and those without is carried out with the use
 of Red and White placards.  A mass meeting of voters, which strictly
 prohibits any exploiting elements from participating, was substituted for
 the mass meeting held in the past for election purposes.

 Second, the ratio of constituent elements.   In order to ensure the proletariat
 forming the core of leadership in the Soviet regime the method of electing
 one representative out of 13 workers and their families and one representa-
 tive out of 50 peasants and their families was adopted.   These elements
 were used to organize urban and rural congresses of representatives.  A
 suitable ratio of worker and peasant representatives was included in all
 levels of congresses of representatives and executive committees from area
 governments to the central government.  By so doing, it ensures the alliance
 of workers and peasants in the organization of the Soviet Government, and
 places the workers in the position of leadership.
 Third, regarding election units.   In order to ensure that the majority of
 the voters participate in elections, and to enable workers to elect suitable
 representatives of their own to the Soviet, the new election law proclaimed
 by the Central Executive Committee in September 1933 provided that each
 township or city Soviet was to be divided into several election units to
 carry out elections.   That is, the peasants carry out elections with the
 village as a unit, while the workers carry out elections with each individual
 as a unit.   This made the participation of the masses in elections a very
 convenient matter.
 Fourth, on the number of people participating in the election.  The develop-
 ment of the Soviet election campaign has made the voter masses become
 greatly aware of the relationship between election and their own lives.
 Many of those who were not enthusiastic about participating in elections
 in the past became more active.   In the two elections held in 1932 and in the
 one held in the latter half of 1933, more than 80 percent of the electorate
 participated.   In some places only those who were ill, giving birth or on
 sentinel duty did not take part in the election meetings.
 Fifth, on the candidates' list.   In the election held in the latter half
 of 1933, the system of listing candidates was implemented so as to enable
 the voter to be prepared, before the election, as to whom he should, or
 should not, vote for.
 Sixth, on the candidacy of women.   Currently, in most of the rural and
 urban soviets, women candidates elected as representatives account for
 more than 25 percent.   In some areas such as Upper-tsai-chi Village in
 Shang Hang, there were 43 women among the 75 representatives, accounting
 for 60 percent, and there were 59 women among the 91 representatives from
 Lower-tsai-chi Village, accounting for 66 percent of the total.  The broad
 masses of working women are now participating in the management of the
 country.
 Seventh, work report.   The village and city soviets called voters to a
 meeting before the election.   A report on the work of the Soviet is made
 to them and they are led to comment on this kind of report.   This method
 was applied on a more general scale in the election held during the latter
 half of 1933 than the one that was held the year before.   All these gave
 the people a satisfactory method of conducting and managing state organi-
 zations--the election of the Soviet--and it ensures the consolidation
 .of the foundation of the Soviet regime.

 Next, Soviet democracy can be seen working in the city and village representa-
 tives congresses.   The system of urban and rural congresses of representatives
 is the organizational foundation of the Soviet.   It is the agency through
 which the Soviet can maintain close liaison with the broad masses of people,
 and the improvements attained in the past 2 years have made this system even
 more perfect.   Its most prominent characteristics as follows.
 1.   In order to have the representatives of the township and city soviets
 maintain a very close relationship with the local residents and facilitate
 the absorbing of suggestions from the residents, the entire resident popula-
 tion, in accordance with the distance between the residence of the repre-
 sentatives and the local residents, are suitably allocated under the leader-
 ship of each representative (usually 30 to 70 people are placed under the
 leadership of one representative), thereby creating stable relationships
 between each representative and the people under his leadership.  This,
 then, enables the people to link up with the Soviet, organizationally,
 as one.
 2.   For township and city soviet representatives, in accordance with how
 far away he lives, one from among  3  to 7 representatives is elected as
 chairman of the representatives.   His task is to allocate and guide, under
 the instruction of the presidiums of township and city soviets, the work
 of each representative under his leadership, relay to each representative
 the notices from the presidium, call meetings of residents under his
 leadership and resolve comparatively minor matters.   In a village there
 should be a chairman of representatives with the responsibility to lead
 the work in the entire village.   There will be a close link between the
 representatives and the city and township presidium.  And the work in the
 village will have strong leadership.
 3.   Under the township and city soviets permanent and provisional commit-
 tees of various types are organized, such as committees for the preferential
 treatment of Red Army members, committees for water conservancy, education
 committees, committees for provisions and committees for health.   There
 can be as many as 10, and attract large numbers of activists from the people
 to participate in the work of these committees.   Not only does the township
 have committees, but the village should also have some committees that are
 necessary to it.   In doing so, the work of the Soviet is organized into a
 network, and the broad masses of people are brought in to participate
 directly in the work of the Soviet.
 4.   Elections of township and city soviets are scheduled to be held once
 every 6 months (half a year for area soviets and once a year for county
 and provincial soviets).   Thus, it will be easy for new suggestions from
 the people to reach the soviets.
 5.   Between elections, representatives who have committed grave errors are to
 be recalled after more than 10 voters petition and more than half of the
 voters concurred, or they may be expelled after a resolution has been passed
 by the congress of representatives.   This will prevent bad elements from

 maintaining a position in the Soviet organizations for a long period of time.
 These are the characteristics of the township and city soviets which are
 being implemented in many Soviet areas.   Everybody can see that the develop-
 ment of the democracy of the Soviet political power reaching to such a
 degree has never before happened in history under any type of political
 system.   In depending upon this system and closely linking up with the
 broad masses, the Soviet has become an organization most capable of develop-
 ing the creativity of the masses and mobilizing the masses to meet the needs
 of the civil war and revolutionary construction.   This is also something
 which has not been achieved by any government in history.  The political
 power organizations of the various levels of the Soviet above the area
 level are all built on the foundation of the township and city soviets,
 and it is organized from the various levels of worker-peasant-soldier
 representatives congresses and executive committees.   Government function-
 aries take their appointments to positions through elections, and those
 who are not trusted are replaced by public opinion.   The discussion and
 resolution of all problems are up to the people.  Therefore, the Soviet
 Government is truly the regime of-the broad masses.
 Besides, the democracy of the Soviet can be seen in the giving of complete
 freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication and to strike to the
 revolutionary masses.  At a time when all freedom and rights of the people
 have been stripped from the revolutionary people in areas under Kuomintang
 rule, and fascist terrorism is being frantically carried out, each revolutionary
 citizen under the Soviet Government has the right to freely express his
 opinion, and the Soviet also provided by all possible means conveniences
 in material conditions (such as assembly halls, paper and printing press).
 The Soviet constantly goes all out to give leadership to all anti-
 imperialist, anti-Kuomintang assemblies, associations, speech and publica-
 tions.  What the Soviet does not permit is the counterrevolutionary freedom
 of those exploiting elements.
 The Soviet, furthermore, in order to consolidate the democratic dictatorship
 of the workers and peasants, must induce the broad masses of people to
 supervise and criticize its work.   Every revolutionary person has the right
 to expose the errors and shortcomings of Soviet functionaries.   Corrupt
 officials of the Kuomintang cover the whole country, and the people of
 the country only dare to be angry but fear to speak out.   Such a phenomenon
 is absolutely not allowed under the Soviet system.   If corruption, de-
 generacy, negativism and feet dragging, as well as bureaucratic elements,
 are discovered among the Soviet functionaries, the people can immediately
 expose their errors and the Soviet will immediately punish them.  There
 will be absolutely no leniency.   This kind of amplitude in the democratic
 spirit can only exist under the Soviet system.
 Finally, the democratic spirit of the Soviet can also be seen in the de-
 limiting of its administrative areas.   The Soviet abolished the former
 bureaucratic administrative areas which are larger and unweildy.  It has
 reduced the jurisdictional areas of all levels of the Soviet from
 provincial to township.  What does this mean?  It means that the Soviet
 can keep close contact with the people and, because its jurisdictional
 area is not big, have general knowledge of what the people want, very

 quickly reflecting the opinions of the people to the Soviet which then quickly
 discusses and resolve them.   It makes the work of mobilizing the masses for
 the war and for Soviet construction very convenient.   The Kuomintang warlords'
 use of the system of large provinces, counties, districts and townships of
 the feudal era tends only to isolate the people.  The Soviet has no use for
 it.  We should point out here that the delimiting of villages is a very
 important program, because, below the township soviet, the most convenient
 way to carry out the work of the Soviet is to mobilize the people with the
 village as a unit.   Only by relying on suitable delimiting of villages,
 establishing of village people's organizations, and the strong leadership
 of the village by representatives and chairman of the representatives will
 the work of the township soviet achieve its greatest affects.
 Next, we discuss the Soviet's attitude toward the landlord bourgeoisie.
 The Soviet has realized the most perfect democratic system in the world.
 It is open to direct participation by the masses.   It provides the broad
 masses with all democratic rights, and it absolutely will not, and has no
 need to, use any kind of force.   However, with regard to the landlord
 bourgeoisie, that is, the exploiting elements overthrown by the revolution-
 ary people, the Soviet reserves for them a different attitude.
 The landlord bourgeoisie, because they are the exploiters and, in the past,
 were the rulers, hold extremely deep hatred for the Soviet.  Because they
 have not been wiped out, although they have been overthrown, they still
 possess a deep-rooted social base, superior knowledge and technology.
 Although they have been toppled, they do not cease for a moment to plan
 a comeback, overthrow the Soviet political power and resume their former
 system of exploitation.   Especially in this era of Civil War when the enemy
 is unceasingly carrying out military attacks against the Soviet areas, the
 overthrown exploiters are even more active in planning, every minute of
 the day, to respond to the enemy's attacks with counterrevolutionary
 activities.   The Soviet regime is forced to take strict punitive and
 suppressive measures in an all-around manner against these elements.   The
 first item in the Soviet policy of restraint against these exploiting
 elements is to keep them outside the regime.  With regard to landlord
 bourgeoisie and all others who stand in enmity to the revolution, their
 voting rights have been wholly abolished, and their right to serve in
 the Red Army and local forces has been voided.   These elements are always
 resorting to a thousand and one ways to attempt infiltration of Soviet
 organizations and into the ranks of the Red Army and local forces.
 Especially in the newly opened areas, the mass struggle has not been fully
 developed, and it is even easier for these elements to utilize opportunities
 and infiltrate.  Past experiences have demonstrated that the launching of
 a ruthless and merciless struggle against those elements who have infil-
 trated into the revolutionary government is, for the Soviet, a task of the
 most gravest importance.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 The second item is the stripping of all freedom of speech, publication,
 assembly and association from all the landlord bourgeoisie.  This kind of
 freedom the Soviet gives only to the revolutionary people and not to any
 elements of the landlord bourgeoisie.  Because these elements of the land-
 lord bourgeoisie will inevitably use this kind of freedom as a tool for their
 counterrevolutionary campaign, it is absolutely necessary to strip them of
 it.   Stripping these class enemies of their freedom and lessening the
 opportunities for them to become active under the pretext of these freedoms
 is also an important reason why the Soviet is becoming more consolidated
 daily.
 The third item is the use of revolutionary armed forces and revolutionary
 courts to suppress all counterrevolutionary activities.   Basing itself on
 the task of arming the people, the Soviet has established a powerful Red
 Army and widespread local forces.   These form the iron strength on which
 the Soviet is directly dependent.   Only by relying on them can the Soviet
 defeat the armed forces of the imperialist Kuomintang, and suppress counter-
 revolutionary activities within the Soviet areas.   The Soviets also have
 an important weapon to suppress counterrevolution.   This is the Soviet
 courts.   The Soviet courts are directly dependent upon the armed forces,
 the activities of the state's political defense bureau and the class
 struggle of the broad masses to enforce strict suppression of all counter-
 revolutionary attempts in Soviet areas.   In the past several years, serious
 counterrevolutionary activities have flared up in every one of the Soviet
 areas, such as the AB group in the central and Hunan-Kiangsi Soviet areas,
 the social democratic party of Fukien, the reorganization faction of the
 Hunan-Hupeh-Kwangsi, Hunan-Honan-Anhwei, Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi, and
 Fukien-Kiangsi areas, and the Tuo Chen Chu Hsiao [2094 7115 0648 31941
 faction of the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi area, all of which have attempted or
 are even carrying out counterrevolutionary uprising.   But it resulted in
 all being severely suppressed by the Soviet courts, their plots to stage
 uprisings were overcome and the Soviet regime was consolidated.  With
 regard to this matter, the Political Defense Bureau and the Soviet courts
 have compiled rich experiences and rectified the errors committed in the
 past of not implementing a clear class line in many areas.   The transforma-
 tion of Soviet courts into people's courts, that is, the punishment of
 counterrevolution, should be linked with the struggle of the broad masses
 to suppress counterrevolution.   Great improvements have also been made
 in this respect, of which general use of mobile courts is proof.
 From an overall view, the Soviet is equipped with an extremely extensive
 revolutionary democracy with regard to the broad masses.   Simultaneously,
 it is within this democracy that its greatest powers are formed, powers
 erected on the foundation of solid trust and consciousness of tens of
 millions of worker-peasant masses.   Usi.n, these powers, the Soviet formed
 its own dictatorship, organized the revolutionary war, organized the Soviet
 courts and launched fierce attacks against the enemy on various fronts.
 The Soviet courts thereby played a magnificant role in the suppression
 of counterrevolutionary activities within the territories of the soviets.

 If a comparison is made between the courts of the Soviet under the dictator-
 ship of the workers and peasants and the courts of the Kuomintang under the
 dictatorship of the landlord bourgeoisie, a wonderful picture appears.
 The objective of the Soviet courts is the suppression of crimes committed
 by the landlord bourgeoisie, and sentences meted out are generally light on
 crimes committed by worker-peasant elements.  The Kuomintang courts have the
 suppression of the worker-peasant class as their objective and are generally
 lenient in sentences passed on crimes committed by the landlord bourgeoisie.
 The roles of the courts have been completely shaped by their class nature.
 On the one hand, the Soivet courts severely suppressed the activities of
 counterrevolutionary elements, and the Soviet should not display any
 leniency whatsoever toward such elements.   On the other hand, inhumane
 treatment of prisoners is prohibited.   The Soviet Central Government has
 proclaimed an open order abolishing physical punishment.   This is a major
 reform in history.   But the Kuomintang courts are still full of the inhuman
 and cruel tortures of the Middle Ages.
 Except for capital crimes, the Soviet prisons have adopted a policy of
 conversion.   They apply the spirit of communism and labor discipline to
 educate the prisoners and transform their criminal nature.   But the
 Kuomintang prisons are hells on earth for the working masses and revolu-
 tionaries filled with purely feudalistic barbarous killings and fascist
 tortures.
 Wiping out the counterrevolutionary plot of the enemy against the class,
 establishing the revolutionary order in the Soviet territories, abolishing
 all barbarous, feudal'vestiges from the sphere of judicial administration
 is the target of the Soviet courts.   The reforms carried out by the Soviet
 in this respect similarly have their own historic significance.
 The Soviet labor policy is to be discussed next.
 Proceeding from the basis of the class nature in its political power and
 from its glorious task of arming the working masses to overthrow the
 imperialist Kuomintang by waging revolutionary war, the Soviet must
 resolutely promote the workers' class struggle, ensure the daily interests
 of the workers, develop the revolutionary activism of the workers and
 organize such activism to bring it to bear on the revolutionary war,
 as well as transform the workers into active leaders of the revolutionary
 war and the pillars supporting the consolidation and development of the
 Soviet.   This is the starting point of the Soviet labor policy.
 The interests of the workers is given complete protection under the Soviet
 labor policy.   The difference is as great as that between paradise and
 hell when they are compared with the era of Kuomintang rule in the past
 and the present areas under the Kuomintang.

 In the era when the Soviet areas were still under Kuomintang rule, the
 workers were slaves of their employers.  Work hours were long, wages small,
 treatment was cruel and there was no legal guarantee of the workers' status.
 These are things no worker will ever forget.  In the areas presently under
 Kuomintang rule all these not only still exist, but have become ever worse.
 According to the latest situation the real wages of the workers in the White
 areas has decreased by more than 50 percent, while decreasing work, laying
 off workers and closing factories are the usual methods used by the
 capitalists in their attacks against the workers.   They created mass
 unemployment, with over 60 percent of the workers of production enterprises
 unemployed.   In all of-the areas under Kuomintang rule, strike is a criminal
 offense, and the Kuomintang openly announced in Hankow in March 1933 that
 strikers would be sentenced to death.   In all disputes between the workers
 and the capitalists, the Kuomintang always takes the side of the capitalists
 to oppress the workers.
 Under Soviet political power the workers are masters.   The workers leading
 the broad masses of peasants have shouldered the glorious responsibility
 of consolidating and developing the Soviet.   Therefore, the principle
 underlining the labor policy of the Soviet is the protection of the workers'
 interests and the consolidation and development of the Soviet regime.   In
 accordance with this principle the Labor Law was proclaimed in December 1931.
 In 1933 it was revised and reproclaimed.   The revised Labor Law is suitable
 for application to all urban and rural, big and small enterprises.
 The Soviet areas have generally implemented the 8-hour work system, and have
 concluded labor contracts and collective labor contracts.   In the cities
 and in many townships and villages labor inspection stations with labor
 inspectors have been generally established to inspect whether employers
 have broken the Soviet Labor Law.   The punishment of offenses committed by
 employers is handled by labor courts especially set up for this purpose.
 To guard against capitalist manipulation of labor and protect the unemployed
 workers, the Soviet has monopolized the right to find employment for workers.
 All applications for labor submitted by the capitalists must be made at the
 employment offices set up by the Soviet.   The establishment of agencies
 to help the unemployed is spreading daily, and unemployed workers are
 receiving concrete assistance.   Also, workers in the rural areas have been
 distributed land.   The system of social insurance has been firmly established,
 and social insurance bureaus have been set up in each of the cities in the
 Soviet areas.  None of these has ever been available to the workers under
 the Kuomintang regime, while the Soviet considered the implementation of
 these policies as its greatest responsibility.
 Due to the resolute implementation of the Soviet's own policies the well-
 being of the workers in the Soviet areas has been greatly improved.
 First, with regard to labor wages.   The actual wages in the various Soviet
 areas have generally increased in comparison with pre-revolution period.
 The following is an example from Ting-chou [3060 1558].
 [See attached table "A."]

 have increased
 at
 least
 32
 percent
 over that
 of
 revolution, and the largest increase (carpenters) was 1,450 percent, an
 increase of 14.5 times textile industry workers.   Such startling increases
 wholly reflect the shockingly low levels of the Kuomintang era.   Of course,
 the wages of Ting--chou workers are especially high when compared with other
 cities and towns (the workers meals are also included in the computation),
 but the wages in other towns and cities have also increased.   For example,
 during the most recent period, the masons and carpenters of Jui-ching [3843
 6855] township received increases of 80 percent in wages from the 2 chiao
 5 fen daily in the period before the revolution to 4 chiao 5 fen.  Wages
 have increased not only in towns and cities but also in the rural areas.
 The following is a comparison table of wages received by workers in miscel-
 laneous enterprises during different periods in the Tien-chun [3944 2625]
 area of Kan Hsien [6373 4905]:
 [see attached table "B"]
 This table represents one rural area.   The wages in other rural areas have
 generally increased.  With regard to the wages in state-run enterprises,
 a general increase of 20 percent has been made within the recent 2 years of
 the various types of enterprises directly under the jurisdiction of the
 Central Government, with the largest increase registering 40 percent.
 Generally speaking, wages are paid on time, and there are very few cases of
 employers owing wages, due to overseeing by the Soviet.  After being
 punished by the labor courts, a handful of obdurate capitalists also did
 not dare to create difficulties for the workers.
 The application of the 8-hour day system to the work period of the courts
 has become generla during the past 2 years in all of the towns and cities
 in Soviet areas.   The hours of the hired workers in rural areas are generally
 less than those for adults.
 The protection of women and minors, such as equal work, equal wages, rest
 before and after birth, prohibition of child labor under 14, has been
 fully implemented.
 With regard to the protection of apprentices, the age limit has been general-
 ly shortened, treatment of apprentices has been improved and the feudal
 oppression of apprentices swept away.   Considerable improvements have
 been made in the well being of the apprentices, and their wages have been
 increased (for example, apprentices in the Kiangsi area receive at least
 15 yuan subsidy annually, and some as large as 3 yuan monthly).  As for
 treatment in general, great improvements have been made in cities,
 especially in state enterprises, with regard to workers' meals and hygiene.
 The monthly meal allowance for city workers is generally over 6 yuan.   The
 meals of workers in the rural area are, at least, the same as that of the
 employers.

 The workers in the Soviet area have organized a powerful class trade union.
 Such trade unions are the pillars of the Soviet, the bulwark defending the
 interests of the workers.  At the same time, they have become schools for
 the broad masses of workers to study communism.  With regard to the trade
 unions the Soviet guaranteed their right by law.   There has been a great
 growth in union membership.   In accordance with the statistics compiled
 by the All-China General Trade Union, taking into account only the central
 Soviet area and the nine areas in its vicinity, there are 229,000 members
 in the trade unions of the Soviet areas, with their distribution as
 follows: 110,000 in the central Soviet area, 23,000 in the Hunan-Kiangsi
 area, 40,000 in the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi area, 25,000 in the Fukien-Chekiang-
 Kiangsi area, 6,000 in the Fukien-Kiangsi area and 5,000 in the northern
 Fukien area.   Based on the materials of the central Soviet area, there are
 only 3,676 persons who have not joined the trade unions, which is less
 than 5 percent of all the workers.   That is to say, 95 percent of the workers
 are members.   In some places, such as Hsing-kuo [5281 0948], 98 percent of
 the workers joined trade unions.   Could this, I ask, be dreamed of in the
 Kuomintang areas?  Not only in China, but also the whole world, with the
 exception of the Soviet Union, which imperialist country enjoys such a
 situation?
 In brief, the Soviet Labor Law has been implemented in all the towns and
 cities in the Soviet areas during the past 2 years, and the important
 articles of the Labor Law have also been implemented in the rural areas.
 Although opposition by quite a few capitalists and rich peasants to the
 Labor Law has been encountered during the 2 years, such opposition came
 to nought due to the spirited struggle of the worker masses and the strict
 supervision of the Soviet.  At the same time, cases of transgression of
 the Labor Law arise from time to time in the hiring of workers by inde-
 pendent producers, middle and poor peasants, and these should be handled
 through sincere remonstrations until they understand and voluntarily
 support the Labor Law.   Therefore, great improvements were made in the
 well-being of the workers.  This has led to the development of the
 enthusiasm of workers on a massive scale, and the workers were able to
 play a glorious role in the revolutionary war and in Soviet construction.
 In accordance with the compilations made by the 12 counties of Kung-lueh
 [0361 3970], Wan-tai [8001 3141], Lung-kang [7893 1481], Hsing-kuo [5283

 area, the 19,960 union members, out of a total membership of 70,580, who
 are serving in the Red Army and in guerrilla units are equivalent to
 20 percent of the entire membership.   The 6,752 working in revolutionary
 Soviet organizations account for 10 percent of the membership, and they
 are'mostly in responsible positions in the Soviet organizations. The
 above two items, totaling 26,712 persons, account for 38 percent of the
 membership.   There are 43,868 members who are still at home.   Second
 issue bonds valued at 43,855 yuan have been redeemed from the members

 remaining at home in these 12 counties.   Recently they bought economic
 construction bonds valued at 197,803 yuan, averaging out at 4 yuan 5 chiao
 per person.  Of the trade unions members who remained at home, 12,435 have
 become members of the Communist Party and the tuan,accounting for 28 percent
 of the total number of members at home.   These statistics prove that the
 worker masses are actively participating in the Red Army and they are parti-
 cipating and supporting the revolution, and supporting the Chinese Communist
 Party.   This resulted from the Soviet's protection of workers' interests,
 thereby sparking the enthusiasm of the workers.   Those remarks about
 workers not having received anything after the revolution began, and that
 the enthusiasm of the workers has not been developed, can all be written
 off as pure nonsense.
 ,Q   Let us now discuss the agrarian revolution of the Soviet areas.
 The.Chinese Soviet and the Red Army emerged and developed in the midst of
 the agrarian revolution.   Only agrarian revolution could liberate the broad
 masses of peasants from the ruthless oppression and exploitation of the
 landlord class and the Kuomintang warlords.   The land policy of the Soviet
 is based on the principle of completely overthrowing all of the feudal
 and semi-feudal oppressions and exploitations of the landlord class and
 the Kuomintang warlords.
 Now,as in the past, shocking land rents (60 to 80 percent), shocking
 usurious rates (.30 to 100 percent) and shockingly exorbitant taxes and
 miscellaneous levies (over 1,700 kinds of taxes and levies throughout the
 country) prevail in the rural villages in the Kuomintang areas.  As a result,
 land was concentrated in the hands of the landlord class and the rich
 peasants.   The greatest majority of the peasants lost their land and fell
 into a terrible situation of suffering from which there was no escape.
 Because of the ruthless plunder of the land the peasants lost their ability
 to protect themselves against the disaster of famine.   As a result, the
 entire country had floods, droughts and famines.   In 1931, the area struck
 by disasters covered 809 counties; and over 44 million people were affected
 by them.   Due to the layer-upon-layer of rapacious plunder the peasants
 lacked the ability to produce again.  Much cultivated land became unfruit-
 ful and much just turned into wasteland.  At the same time, the only
 produce the peasants had was overwhelmed by the imperialist's dumping of
 agricultural products.   For this reason the rural economy of China fell
 into a state of complete bankruptcy.  It was from this basis that the
 flames of agrarian revolution exploded with powerful force in the rural
 areas.   The might of the Soviet agrarian revolution swept away all vestiges
 of feudalism.  Millions and tens of millions of peasants have been jolted
 into awareness from a long period of darkness, seized all the landed
 estates of the landlord class, confiscated the lands of the rich peasants,
 abolished usury and liquidated exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies,
 overthrew all who stood against the revolution, and established their
 own political power.   The first time they emerged from hell, the peasant
 masses became masters.   This is the difference between the rural situation
 under the Soviet political power and that under the Kuomintang political
 power.

 The First All-Soviet Congress promulgated the Land Law and created a correct
 basis for the solution of land problems throughout the country.  Because of
 the intensification of the class struggle in the rural areas many disputes
 arose from the problem of class analysis.   The people's committee, in
 accordance with experiences gained from land struggles of the past, set
 forth the "resolutions on various problems in land struggle," and correctly
 resolved many problems such as landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants,
 poor peasants and vagrants.   Struggles in the rural areas will become
 even stronger.   As with many problems on land distribution such as distance,
 fertility, green sprouts, forests and ponds, we urgently need to collect
 the experiences of various areas and make the necessary decisions.  This is
 imperative in the leadership of land distribution in new areas.
 In order that the remnant forces of feudalism are thoroughly eliminated and
 to enable the fruits of agrarian revolution to fall completely into the
 hands of tennant farmers, poor peasants and middle peasants, the Central
 Government has launched a widespread and penetrating movement`of land in-
 vestigation.  According to the statistics compiled in the 3 months of July,
 August and September 1933, a total of 3,980 landlord families and
 6,638 rich peasant families was unearthed in the three provinces of Kiangsi,
 Fukien and Kiangsi-Hupeh in the central Soviet area.   From the hands of
 these exposed landlords and rich peasants 307,539 tan of land were recovered,
 and cash from landlords and contributions from rich peasants totaling
 606,916 yuan were confiscated.   The revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasant
 masses developed even further and the tenant farmer trade union and the poor
 peasants group became the pillars of the Soviet in the rural areas.   Gaining
 such great results in 3 months proves that the Soviet must still give its
 full attention to the class struggle in the rural areas, and the land
 investigation movement being a powerful method to continue the development
 of struggles in the rural areas for thoroughly wiping out the remnant forces
 of feudalism has also been wholly proved.
 The class line of the land struggle is to rely on tennant farmers and poor
 peasants, unite with the middle peasants and exploit the rich peasants and
 wipe out the landlords.   The correct application of this line is the key
 to guaranteeing the victorious development of the land struggle, and it
 is the basis of each concrete policy of the Soviet formulated for the rural
 areas.   The Soviet should place severe restraint on erroneous tendencies
 toward infringing upon middle peasants (primarily toward rich middle
 peasants) and elimination of rich peasants. But, at the same time, there
 absolutely should not be any slackening toward those errors of seeking
 compromise with the landlord rich peasants.   Only by opposing such errors
 can the land struggle be led onto the correct path.
 With regard to the work done on the masses with respect to land struggles,
 considerable experiences have been accumulated during the past 2 years.
 In summary, its principal points are:

 1.   In both the movement of land distribution and the land investigation
 movement, an all-out effort must be made to mobilize the broad masses of poor
 and middle peasants and the broad masses of workers in the rural areas to
 struggle personally against landlord rich peasants.   The work of land
 distribution and land investigation must be carried out with the concurrance
 of the masses.   The handling of each one of the class elements must be done
 through meetings of the masses.   There is the danger of decreasing enthusiasm
 of the masses fur struggle if Soviet personnel, alone or with a handful of
 others, were to carry out the distribution of land or investigation of class.
 2.  When assets of the landlord class, besides land, and surplus plow oxen,
 farming implements and buildings are confiscated, the greater part of it must
 be distributed to the poor people.   If this is not done and they are given
 over to a handful of people for use, it will also lower the spirits of the
 masses and will land itself to the opposition of the exploiting elements.
 3.  Distribution of land over a long and erratic period of time is not appro-
 priate.   It should be completed within a considerably short period of time
 so that the land will remain firmly in the hands of the peasants.   Later,
 redistribution of land should not be lightly undertaken in the absence of
 a request from the majority of the local people.   If we do not adhere to this,
 we will be going counter to wishes of the peasants.  We would not only
 adversely affect the attitude of the peasants toward producing from the land,
 but would allow exploiting elements to obstruct the progress of the land
 struggle.
 4.   The object of land investigation is to ferret out exploiting elements
 and not to expose the exploited elements.   Therefore, house-to-house
 and mou-to-mou inspections should be avoided.  What should be done is the
 mobilization of the greatest number of people to ferret out those landlord
 and rich peasant elements who are in hiding.
 5.   Those counterrevolutionary elements who impeded land distribution and
 land investigation must be severely dealt with.   With the concurrance of
 the masses use the most severe method to control them, from the time they
 were arrested, imprisoned and publicly tried by the masses, right up to
 the time of their execution.   This is absolutely necessary, because if it
 is not done in this manner, the land struggle will be greatly impeded.
 6.   Class struggle should be developed in an all-out manner, but avoid strug-
 gles between localities, between clans and between nationalities.   The
 landlord class and the rich peasants desire wholeheartedly to replace class
 struggle with this kind of struggle and obstruct the progress of agrarian
 revolution, and personnel of the Soviet should not be taken in by them.
 7.   The progress of agrarian revolution is dependent upon the enhancement
 of the level of organization and class consciousness of the basic masses
 in the rural areas.   Soviet personnel, therefore, must carry out propaganda
 on a wide and intensive scale and make sound the organization of poor

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 peasant groups and tenant farmers trade unions.  The agrarian revolution not
 only gets land to the peasants, it must also make the peasants develop the
 production force of the land and due to the leadership of the Soviet and the
 enhancement of the peasants' enthusiasm for labor, agricultural production
 has recovered over a wide area in the Soviet areas.   In some places it has
 developed even further.
 On this basis the peasants' well-being has been vastly improved.   The peasants
 overthrew the exploitation of landlords and the Kuomintang and, as a result,
 production came into their own hands.  The current standard of living of the
 peasants has been at least doubled, in comparison with that under the
 Kuomintang.   The majority of the peasants were hungry many times in the
 past year, and in times of difficulty they had to eat tree bark and grain
 chaff.   But, generally speaking, there is no more hunger now, and living
 conditions have improved with each passing year.   In the past, the majority
 of the peasants had very little meat during the year.  Meat is eaten more
 frequently now.   In the past, the majority of the peasants  were clothed in
 rags. This is generally improved now, sometimes by 100 and even 200 percent.
 What kind of life and what kind of political power do the peasant masses
 want?  Let the peasant masses in all of the Kuomintang areas answer this
 question themselves!
 We then discuss the financial policy of the Soviet.
 The object of Soviet finance is to guarantee provisions and supply for the
 revolution and the disbursement of all other revolutionary expenditures.
 The Soviet Republic, required to meet outlays in vast revolution war and
 revolutionary work expenditures and constituting a small portion of the
 entire country, which is also an area with a comparatively backward economy,
 is carrying out a taxation policy favorable to the broad masses.  Many
 outsiders do not know where the solution for Soviet finances will come from.
 Meanwhile, why did the Kuomintang become bankrupt, with it occupying a
 vast area and extracting the wealth of the people in vast quantities?
 There is nothing strange about it.   There is a basic difference between the
 financial policy of the Soviet and its application of funds with that of
 the Kuomintang.
 The Soviet financial policy is 'founded on the principle of class interests
 and the interests of the revolution.   The Soviet's sources for funds are:
 1) confiscation or forceful collection from all feudal exploiters;
 2) tax revenue; and 3  development of the national economy.  What confisca-
 tion or forceful collection from all feudal exploiters means is to make
 collections from landlords and rich peasants in the Soviet and the White
 areas.   Based on past experience, this revenue frequently accounts for the
 lion's share.   This is exactly opposite to the Kuomintang's fiscal policy.
 The Soviet places the main financial burden on the exploiters,?whereas the
 Kuomintang places it on the hard-working masses of workers and peasants.

 The tax collection of the Soviet is a unified excalating:tax.   It is current-
 ly being carried out in a simple manner on two sides, that is, commerce tax
 and agricultural tax.  The principle of taxation is similarly placing the
 burden on the exploiters.
 The collection of commercial taxes is divided into custom tax and business
 tax.   The custom tax is for the purpose of regulating the export and import
 of commodities in accordance with the degree of need of the Soviet areas.
 The rates include complete exemption, and some going as high as 100 percent.
 Only the Soviet has implemented a wholly free customs tax system which is
 not subjected to any interference from foreign countries.  All merchandise
 goes into circulation all over the Soviet areas after paying taxes at the
 border customs, and there is no second taxation, thereby sweeping away the
 Kuomintang's tyranny of the money barrier and the layers of extortion.
 Business tax is sales tax (industrial tax is not being collected at present).
 In accordance with the size of the businessman's capital and his profit, a
 unified, escalated tax is collected.   Tax is light on small capital and
 small profits, and heavy on big capital and big profits.  Where the capital
 is below 100 yuan, the people's cooperatives, and surplus products sold
 directly by the peasants are all exempted.
 The agricultural tax is dependent upon the revolutionary fervor of the
 peasants as this tax is collected on a voluntary basis, and it is similarly
 progressive.  Where there are few in the family and land distributed is
 small, the tax is light, and where there are many in the family and land
 distributed is large, the tax is heavy.   Tax is light on poor and middle
 peasants, but heavy on rich peasants.   Tenant farmers and families of
 Red Army members are exempted from taxation, and in disaster areas tax
 is reduced or exempted in accordance with the lightness or severity of the
 disaster situation.
 The unified, progressive tax system adopted by the Soviet is the best tax
 system in the world, and it is a system all capitalist countries dare not
 adopt or adopt it in its entirety.  As for the Kuomintang's tax collection,
 it is one complete mess.   Its tax policy is primarily to collect from
 peasants and other petit bourgeoisie.   Besides the principal tax, there are
 countless tacked-on taxes.   In accordance with the statistics compiled by
 the TA KUNG PAO and published in 22 March 1933 there are as many as
 1,756 items of taxations in the Kuomintang areas.  And the land taxes in
 Szechwan Province have been pre-collected up to 1987, and the land taxes
 in Shensi Province have increased 25 times over the period before the
 arrival of the Kuomintang.   These are the "benefactions" of the Kuomintang
 for the hard-working masses!
 To increase our revenue by developing the national economy is a basic
 principle of our financial policy; it has already brought tangible results
 in the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi border area and is beginning to do so in
 the central area, too.   It is the duty of our financial and economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 organizations to apply this principle conscientously.   In this connection,
 we should make quite sure that the issuing of notes by the state bank is
 based primarily on the needs of economic development, and only secondarily
 on purely fiscal needs.
 Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government expenditures.   It
 should be made clear to all government workers that corruption and waste
 are very great crimes.   Our campaigns against corruption and waste have
 already achieved some results, but further efforts are required.   Our                o
 system of accounting must be guided by the principle of saving every
 copper for the war effort, for the revolutionary cause, and for economic
 construction.   Our method of spending state revenue must be strictly
 different from those of the Kuomintang.   There are difficulties in the
 finances of the Soviet.  With the expansion of the Red Army and the develop-
 ment of the revolution, the Soviet does face difficulties in its finances.
 Overcoming difficulty is inherent in the difficulty itself.   The method
 for overcoming the difficulty is to develop our revolution, improve our
 Soviet work, augment our revenue from all of the Kuomintang areas, place
 the burden of Soviet finance on the shoulders of all exploiting elements
 and increase the revenue of the Soviet through the development of the
 national economy.
 We will discuss Soviet economic policy.
 Only the shameless Kuomintang warlords will create rumors every day about
 the utter devastation of the Soviet region when the people are impoverished
 and the finances exhausted in the area under their control.  The goal of the
 imperialist Kuomintang is to. sabotage the Soviet region, the advancing
 Soviet construction, and the welfare of the tens of millions of liberated
 worker-peasant masses; therefore, the counterrevolutionaries have not only
 organized all their military strength for "encirclement and suppression,"
 but also enforced a ruthless policy of blockade in the economic aspect.
 Nevertheless, the broad masses and the Red Army led by the Soviet govern-
 ment have not only routed the enemy "encirclement" time and again, but also
 undertaken all possible and necessary economic constructions to break down
 the vicious enemy blockade.   Currently, this measure taken by the Soviet
 is successful step by step.
 As the central task of the Soviet is to strive for victory in the war
 against the imperialist Kuomintang, while the current Soviet region is
 situated in areas relatively backward in economy and hemmed in by enemy
 blockade, the principle of the Soviet economic policy is to undertake all
 possible and necessary constructions in the economic aspect and concentrate
 strengths to supply the war.  Meanwhile, the Soviet is doing its utmost
 to improve the people's living, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance
 in the economic aspect, assure the proletariat's leadership of the peasants,
 and create the premise and superiority for the development of the socialist
 construction in the future.

 The nucleus of the Soviet's economic construction is to develop agricultural
 production, industrial production, export trade and the cooperative movement.
 Currently, the agriculture of the Soviet region is obviously making progress.
 The 1933 farm output of the Central Soviet region increased 15 percent com-
 pared to that of 1932, while that of the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi Soviet
 region grew 20 percent.   In the first or second year after the uprising,
 the agricultural output of Soviet areas often appeared to be dropping.
 However, with the decision to divide the land, the promotion effort of
 the Soviet, and the growing labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses, produc-
 tion recovered.   Currently some areas have not only recovered, but also
 surpassed the level before the uprising.   Other areas have not only
 eliminated the land laid waste in the course of the uprising, but also re-
 claimed new land.   Many areas have organized labor cooperatives and farming
 teams to relieve the rural labor force.   They have organized plow oxen
 cooperatives to solve the shortage of plow animals.  Meanwhile, the broad
 masses of women have joined the emergency work on the production front.
 All these would have been absolutely impossible in the Kuomintang era.   In
 the Kuomintang era, land was the private property of the landowners, and
 the peasants were neither willing nor able to improve the land with their
 own effort.   Only after the land distribution to the peasants by the Soviet
 and the Soviet's promotion and encouragement was the labor enthusiasm of
 the peasant masses stimulated, leading to great production victories.  Here
 it must be pointed out that, under the current condition, agricultural
 production takes the first place in the Soviet economic construction.
 Agricultural production will not only solve the most important grain issue,
 but also shoulder the responsibility of supplying the raw material (cotton,
 hemp, sugarcane, bamboo, etc.) for such everyday necessities as clothes,
 sugar and paper.   In addition, afforestation and livestock production are
 also important parts of agriculture.   It is both permissible and necessary
 to formulate appropriate production plans on the foundation of the small-
 peasant economy and mobilize the peasants to fulfill the plans (for example,
 so many 10,000-catties of cotton per province).   The Soviet must pay further
 attention and devote a greater effort in this aspect.   In regard to the
 many basic conditions of agricultural production, such as manpower, plow
 oxen, raw material, seeds and water conservation, the Soviet must vigorously
 guide the peasants toward their solution.   Here, organizing the manpower to
 relieve the shortage and activating the women to participate in production
 constitute the most fundamental issue of agricultural production in the
 Soviet region.  Meanwhile, organizing labor cooperatives and farming teams
 and mobilizing and encouraging the entire rural masses during the crucial
 spring and summer seasons are the effective means to solve the issue.
 The lack of plow oxen by a large portion of the peasants (about 25 percent)
 is also a very big problem.   Organizing plow oxen cooperatives and mobiliz-
 ing all households without plow animals to buy the animals together and
 share in their use are matters which the Soviet must give attention to.
 Water conservation is the lifeline of agriculture, and the Soviet must give
 serious attention to it.  Naturally, this is not yet the time to bring
 up the problems of soviet and'collective agriculture.  However, for the purpose
 of promoting agriculture, organizing a soviet experimental farm on a small
 scale in every village and ward and establishing agricultural study schools
 and farm products exhibition sites are urgently needed.

 Enemy blockade has made our export difficult.  Many handicraft enterprises
 in the Soviet region have deteriorated, especially tobacco and paper.
 However, it is not absolutely impossible to overcome such export difficulties.
 Furthermore, in view of the need of the broad masses in the Soviet region,
 we possess our own extensive market.  We must systematically develop our
 industry for export, but mainly for self-sufficiency.   In the past 2 years,
 especially since the first half of 1933, as the Soviet has begun to pay
 attention and as the mass production cooperatives have gradually developed,
 many industries have started to recover.   Here the main items are tobacco,
 paper, tungsten, camphor, farm tools and fertilizer (such as lime), while
 textile, drug manufacturing and sugar refining are also not to be overlooked
 in the present environment.   In the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi region, some of
 the areas did not have much industry to start with, such as paper making,
 textile weaving and sugar refining, but now such industries have actually
 been started and are producing good results.   To relieve the shortage of salt,
 they have undertaken the manufacture of nitrate.   In regard to industry, it
 is even more necessary to have suitable planning.  Naturally, it is impossible
 to formulate general and precise plans on the foundation of the scattered
 handicraft industries, but, in regard to certain minor industries, primarily
 the enterprises operated by the state and the cooperatives, it is entirely
 necessary to formulate appropriate precise production plans.  The accurate
 estimate of raw material production and the assessment of the market in the
 White and Soviet regions are matters requiring the attention of Soviet and
 cooperative industries right from the beginning.
 Planned organizing of foreign trade and direct handling of the circulation
 of certain necessary commodities, such as the import of salt and fabric,
 the export of grain and tungsten, and grain circulation inside the Soviet
 region, are currently extremely crucial.   Such work was begun relatively
 early in the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi region, while the Central region started
 in the spring of 1933.  With the establishment of such agencies as the
 Foreign Trade Bureau, preliminary achievements have been made.
 Currently, the national economy of the Soviet region is developed in three
 simultaneous aspects--state operated, cooperative and private enterprises.
 Now limited to the feasible and essential, the state operated economy has
 been started in both industry and commerce.   Its future is naturally
 inestimable.
 As for private economy, as long as it stays within the limits of the law,
 the Soviet not only will not block it, but will promote and encourage it,
 because the development of private economy at the present time is required
 by the interest of the Soviet.  Needless to say, private economy occupies
 a position of absolute predominance at the present time, and such pre-
 dominance will remain for a considerably long period of time to come.  The
 development of private economy in the Soviet region generally follows the
 pattern of small capital.

 The cooperative economy is developing rapidly.  According to the September 1933
 statistics of 17 counties in Kiangsi and Fukien provinces, all types of coopera-
 tives totaled 1,423, with the shares amounting to 305,551 yuan.  Due to the
 promotion by the Economic Construction Mass Meeting, the development of such
 counties as Jui-chin and Hsing-kuo in a little over a month after the meeting
 surpassed the figures for the entire period before it.   Currently, the large-
 scale development of cooperatives covers mainly consumer and grain coopera-
 tives, with production cooperatives second.   As for the credit cooperative,
 it is still just beginning.   The development of the cooperative movement will
 doubtlessly become the pivot of the economic development of the Soviet region.
 The cooperative economy and the state operated economy, when coordinated,
 will become a tremendous force in the economic aspect.   In the long process
 of the struggle against the private economy, they will gradually gain the
 leading and superior position and form the condition for the economy of the
 Soviet region to develop to a socialist economy.  Therefore, developing
 state enterprises as much as possible and promoting cooperatives on a large
 scale must be pursued simultaneously with the encouragement of private
 economy.
 For the purpose of developing state operated enterprises and aiding the
 cooperative movement, the People's Committee, with the support of the masses,
 issued 3 million yuan of economic construction bonds.   Solving the economic
 construction capital problem by relying on the strength of the masses is the
 only feasible means at present.
 While all of China is engulfed in an economic calamity and the hundreds of
 millions of people are hungry and cold, the Soviet government, in disregard
 of all difficulties, conscientiously pursues economic construction for the
 revolutionary war and in the interest of the people.  Very obviously,
 only the victory of the Soviet over the imperialist Kuomintang and only
 its planned and organized economic construction will rescue the hundreds
 of millions of the nation from the unprecedented economic calamity.
 [Footnotes] Increasing our revenue by developing the national economy is
 our basic financial policy.   The apparent effect has been demonstrated
 in the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi Border Area and has begun to be demonstrated
 in the Central Region.   The enforcement of this policy is the responsibility
 of our fiscal and economic organs.   Here, attention must be given to the
 fact that the issuance of paper currency by state banks must be based
 on the need of the development of the national economy, and simply
 fiscal need can only take second place.

 Fiscal disbursement must follow the policy of thrift.  All government
 work personnel must understand that corruption and waste are serious
 crimes.   Some achievement was made in the struggle against corruption
 and waste in the past, and we must continue with our effort hereafter.
 Saving every penny for the war and the revolutionary cause, and for our
 economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system.  A
 strict distinction must be made between the way we spend our state
 revenue and the way of the Kuomintang.

 Reform of cultural education must be carried out by the Soviet in order to
 win victory in the revolution, consolidate and develop the Soviet regime,
 mobilize all the forces of the people for the purpose of waging the great
 revolutionary struggle, create a new and revolutionary generation and free
 the worker-peasant masses from the spiritual shackles placed upon them
 by the reactionary ruling class.  We must create a new, Soviet culture of
 workers and peasants.
 It is public knowledge that all educational and cultural agencies under the
 Kuomintang rule are in the hands of the landlord bourgeoisie.  Their policy
 is to carry out lopsided propaganda to eradicate revolutionary concepts of
 the oppressed class, on the one hand, and implement a policy of hoodwinking
 the people so as to exclude workers and peasants from education on the other.
 Educational funds were used by the reactionary Kuomintang to finance
 attacks on the revolution, most schools stopped operating and a majority
 of the students were idled.   The people became ignorant and foolish under
 the rule of the'Kuomintang and over 80 percent of the entire population
 was illiterate.  While extremely vicious White terrorism was adopted against
 revolutionary concepts, all left-wing literary figures and sociologists
 and revolutionaries in cultural and educational agencies were subjected
 to the ravages of the Kuomintang fascist emperor, turning all educational
 organizations into dark, hell-holes.   This is the Kuomintang's educational
 policy.

 Whoever comes to our Soviet area and takes a look will see immediately that
 it is a free and bright new country.
 All educational agencies are in the hands of the laboring masses of workers
 and peasants.   The workers and peasants and their children enjoy priority
 rights to education.  The Soviet Government is using all possible methods
 to raise the cultural level of workers and peasants, and for the purpose
 of attaining this objective all possible political and material aid are
 given to the masses.  For this reason, Soviet areas are today speeding up
 the revolutionary cultural construction, although they are situated in an
 environment of ruthless Civil War and were,'in the past, culturally very
 backward areas.   According to the compilations of the three provinces of
 Kiangsi, Fukien and Hupeh-Kiangsi, there are 3,05.2 Lenin elementary
 schools, with 89,710 students, 6,462 supplementary night schools with
 94,517 students, 32,388 adult education groups (this does not include figures
 from Fukien) with 155,371 members and 1,656 clubs with 49,668 functionaries.
 This is only a partial compilation of the central Soviet areas.
 The majority of school age children are in Lenin elementary schools in many
 of the Soviet areas.   For example, 12,806 (8,825 boys and 3,981 girls) out
 of 20,969 (12,076 boys and 8,893 girls) school age children in Hsing-kuo
 [5281 0948] are attending Lenin elementary schools, and 8,163 (3,251 boys
 and 4,912 girls) are idle.   The comparative ratios for those attending schools
 and those who do not is 6 to 4.   Children in many places in the Soviet areas
 are most of the time engaged in receiving education and in play, and only a
 small part of their time is applied to home chores.   This is exactly opposite
 to the situation prevailing during the Kuomintang period.   The children are,
 at the same time, enrolled in the Red Children Group.   These groups are
 similar to schools for the children to learn about communism.   Such
 enthusiastic demands of women for education have never before been seen.
 Of the 15,740 students attending supplementary night schools in Hsing-kuo,
 4,986 are males, accounting for 31 percent of the total and 10,752 are
 females, accounting for 69 percent.   Of the 22,519 members of the adult
 education groups, 9,000 are males, accounting for 40 percent, and 13,519
 are females, accounting for 60 percent of the total.   Illiterate women
 in Hsing-kuo and other areas have achieved initial liberation and are
 enthusiastic about activities.  Women are not only receiving education but
 also presiding over it.  Many women have become principals of elementary
 and night schools and members of educational committees and literary
 committees.   Associations of women workers and peasants have become common
 in the Soviet areas.   The focus is on the entire interests of women workers,
 and, of course, the education of women is also a part of it.
 The literacy of the masses has grown rapidly.  Night schools,!literacy
 movements and placards are used to induce literacy.  Night schools are set
 in location, literacy groups are located in the homes of the masses and
 literacy placards are mounted along the roads.   The literacy movement is
 led by a village committee.   Hsing-kuo is an example.   There is a general
 committee for the literacy movement in more than 130 villages, 3,387 branch

 committees for 561 villages and there are members enrolled in the 12,529
 literacy groups below the branch committees.   This is a mass movement on
 an extremely vast scale to sweep away illiteracy and it should be expanded
 to cover all rural and urban areas in the Soviet territories.
 We can also see from the publications of newspapers the rapid advances being
 made in the cultural movement in the Soviet areas.   There are 34 different
 kinds of big and small newspapers in the central Soviet areas, of which
 RED CHINA has increased its printing from 3,000 to 4,000 copies., THE
 TRUTH FROM YOUTH prints 28,000 copies, STRUGGLE 27,100 copies and RED STAR
 17,300 copies.  All these prove that the cultural level of the masses is
 being rapidly elevated.
 The revolutionary arts of the masses in the Soviet areas are beginning to
 be formed.   The theatre of the workers and peasants, the blue shirt group
 and the club movement in the rural areas are expanding widely.
 The Red physical culture movement of the masses is also developing rapidly.
 Track events are available even in isolated rural hamlets and villages
 and sports grounds have been established in many areas.   Soviet areas are
 still lacking in the construction of complete specialized education
 apparatus, although we have established the Red Army University, the Soviet
 University, the Marxist Communist University and many schools for educating
 cadres under the leadership of the department of education for the training
 of leading cadres in the revolutionary struggle.  Beyond doubt, limiting
 the expansion of general education for the development of secondary and
 special (vocational) education should be made part of the educational plans.
 The forming of worker-peasant intellectuals, developing cultural education
 and utilizing intellectuals with landlord bourgeois background to serve the
 Soviet should not be neglected in the Soviet's cultural policy.
 Where does the general guideline of the Soviet cultural education lie?  It
 lies in the education of the broad masses of laboring people with the
 communist spirit, using cultural education to serve the revolution and
 the class struggle, and linking up education and labor.
 What are the central tasks of the Soviet's cultural construction?  They
 are the implementation of obligatory education in full, developing and spread-
 ing social education and developing large numbers of high ranking cadres to
 lead the revolution.
 Everyone should understand that all these policies and tasks can be imple-
 mented only under the Soviet political power, because it is a manifestation
 of the intensification of class struggle.   This is an absolutely great
 victory in the spiritual liberation of humankind.
 We shall now discuss the marriage system of the Soviet.

 The Central Executive Committee promulgated the Soviet marriage laws in
 November 1931, in order to liberate women from the barbaric, feudal system
 and implement a marriage system which is truly equal for both men and
 women. It established the complete freedom of marriage and divorce,
 abolished the marriage system of contracting, coercion and buying and
 selling of marriages, and prohibited the rearing of child daughters-in-law.
 The law has been implemented in all of the areas under Soviet jurisdiction
 during the past 2 years.  All those who are not related by blood and are
 outside of the 5-generation group, who are not insane and do not have
 serious infectious diseases, can be married if the male is 20 years old
 and the female 18, and if both agree to it and it has been registered with
 the rural or urban Soviet.   The only requirement needed for divorce is for
 either the husband or wife to make the request and duly register it with
 the township or city soviet.
 This type of democratic marriage system has smashed the feudal fetters which
 have shackled mankind, especially its females, for many thousands of years.
 This is also a great victory in the history of mankind.  This is a victory
 to be attained only after the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship has
 been successful.   First, the dictatorship of the landlord bourgeois must
 be overthrown, the agrarian revolution carried out and the masses of men
 and women, especially the women, have political and relative economic
 freedom.   Only then will the freedom of marriage be finally guaranteed.
 The new system can be wholly initiated because the working women in the
 Soviet area have the same right to vote as the men, and they have also
 been distributed land and assigned work.
 The current Soviet marriage law emphasizes the protection of women because
 the marriage relationship for the past several thousand years has been
 barbarously inhumane.  Women are subjected to more oppression than men,
 and the obligations arising from divorces have been placed more heavily
 on the men to shoulder.
 In the society that has passed it was customary not to pay too much attention
 to the protection of children.   But children are the new generation of
 the revolution.   There is a law solely concerned with the protection of
 children in the marriage laws, and it has underscored the protection of
 illegitimate children and the acceptance of their status.
 The implementation of the marriage system won for the Soviet the support of
 the broad masses.   The broad masses of people have not only achieved
 liberation economically, but also in relationships between men and women.
 With just the marriage system as an example, the Soviet areas and the
 Kuomintang areas are two diametrically opposed worlds.
 Finally, we shall talk about our policy regarding nationalities.   The basis
 from which the Soviet nationalities policy proceeds is winning over all
 oppressed minority nationalities and rally them around the Soviet, and
 increasing the revolutionary forces opposing imperialism and the Kuomintang.

 Many of the minority nationalities such as the Mongols, Tibetans, Koreans,
 Annamese, Miao and Li in China have always been ruled and exploited by
 Chinese feudal emperors and feudal warlords.  After inheriting this rule,
 the Kuomintang has made no changes, and the so-called "five nationalities
 in harmonious peace" is just so much nonsense used to dupe people.  The
 Kuomintang's recent "reward" was the massacre of Hui people in Kansu
 Province carried out by Feng Yu-hsiang [7458 3768 4382] and the slaughtering
 of the Miao people by Pai Chung--hsi [4101 1504 4406] in Kwangsi.   On the
 other side, the ruling class within the minority nationalities themselves,
 such as the kings and princes, living buddhas, lamas and headmen, collaborat-
 ed with the Kuomintang landlords of China and brought even more severe
 oppression and exploitation upon the broad masses of laboring people of
 the minority nationalities.   Or they (like Tibet, Sinkiang and Inner Mongolia)
 capitulated to the imperialists and led imperialism to rapidly turn these
 areas into colonies and carried the robbing of the working people a step
 forward.   This was the essence of the lives of minority nationalities in
 the past.
 The Soviet Government firmly opposes imperialist and Kuomintang warlords'
 rule and plunder perpetrated upon the minority nationalities.  Article 14
 of the Constitution proclaimed by the First National Soviet Congress in
 November 1931 says:   "The Chinese Soviet political power recognizes the
 autonomous right of minority nationalities within the boundaries of China
 right up to the time they secede from China and establish their own
 independent and free nations.  All Mongolians, Huis, Tibetans, Miaos, Lis
 and Koreans residing within the boundaries of China will decide in accordance
 with the wishes of each nationality whether to participate in the Chinese
 Soviet Union or cecede from it.   The Chinese Soviet political power currently
 must strive to help these weak, minority nationalities to get out from under
 the oppressive rule of imperialism, Kuomintang warlords, kings, princes, lamas
 and headmen and attain complete liberation.  The Soviet should develop their
 own language and culture among these nationalities."
 This is a resounding answer to. the vicious colonial policy applied to
 nationalities by imperialists all over the world (including the Chinese
 Kuomintang).   The broad masses of workers and peasants of China and their
 Soviet Government are not only seeking to get rid of the shackles of
 imperialism by waging a resolute national revolutionary war on its own but
 also call upon all weak, minority nationalities in the country to do so at
 the same time until these nationalities have been able to cut themselves
 away and achieve complete independence.   Besides, Article 15 of the Soviet
 Constitution Outline says:
 "The various nationalities in China, as '?iell as revolutionary fighters of
 the various countries in the world, who are being persecuted by the
 reactionary rulers because of.their revolutionary activities will be given
 the right to asylum in the Soviet areas by the Chinese Soviet Government,
 and help will be extended to them to recover their strength to struggle
 again until the revolutionary movement of these nationalities and nations
 have achieved complete victory."

 The existence of many Korean, Taiwanese and Annmese revolutionary comrades
 in temporary residence in the Soviet areas, the attendance of Korean repre-
 sentatives at the First All-Soviet Congress and the attendance of several
 Korean, Taiwanese and Annamese representatives at this Congress prove that
 this proclamation of the Soviet is true.   The common revolutionary interests
 of the Chinese and minority nationality working people have truly united
 them.
 The oppression of nationality is based upon the exploitation of the nationality
 and when this system of national exploitation is overthrown, the free union
 of nationalities will be substituted for national oppression.
 This is possible only when the Soviet political power has won complete
 victory.   It is the responsibility of the various minority nationalities
 to support and help the Soviet political power to win victory throughout
 China.
 5.   The Concrete Fighting Tasks of the Soviet in Striving to Smash
 Thoroughly the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" and Win Nationwide
 Victory for the Revolution
 After we have discussed the current situation, the struggle of the Soviet
 political power against imperialism and against "encirclement and suppres-
 sion" during the past 2 years, and the basic policies implemented by the
 Soviet, we arrived at a determined conclusion and, that is to say, the
 Soviet movement is progressing with giant strides.   The victory of the
 Soviet movement in the past 2 years has  brought about a visible change in
 the strengths of both the enemy and ourselves.   The vacillation and collapse
 of the enemy is accelerating while the Soviet movement is vigorously
 developing.   The forces of revolution have grown even greater, and the
 battle lines of the revolution have become even more consolidated.   The
 national war and the revolutionary Civil War are being waged within the
 vast confines of China, and the Red Army has become an invincible force.
 The foundation of the democratic worker-peasant dictatorship has been
 established.  The Soviet's work of construction has achieved great results
 in various respects.   The centralized leadership of the Soviet Central
 Government has not only established a solid foundation in the Soviet
 areas, but it has also become the revolutionary banner of the broad masses
 in the areas under the Kuomintang rule. All these have become the current
 realities of life, they have become realities existing objectively and
 which are not to be denied.
 But the progress of the revolution has required us to take into consideration
 other situations.   It required us to apply an intensive spirit of self-
 criticism to examine the weaknesses existing in the revolutionary fronts.
 This is a responsibility we cannot disregard.   In evaluating our weaknesses,
 we must first of all realize that although the areas where the Soviet has
 already been victorious is very large, it is situated in very small and
 narrow confines when the entire country is taken as a whole, and in areas
 -  Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 where the economy is relatively backward.   The counterrevolutionaries still
 have their vast areas and occupy the important cities.  The task of the
 Soviet seeking nationwide victory by first achieving victories in one or
 several provinces rests very heavily upon our shoulders.   The daily in-
 tensifying life-and-death struggle between two political powers requires
 us to go all out to resolve this problem.   It does not permit the
 slightest bit of complacency to exist in our revolutionary ranks, and it
 also does not permit the slightest appearance of fatigue in our attitudes.
 Second, although the people's anti-imperialist movement has unfolded on a
 massive scale in the past 2 years and considerable achievements attained
 in the leadership given by the Central Government in the anti-imperialist
 movement, the forces engaged in the currently developing struggle against
 imperialism is woefully inadequate seen in the light of the grave nature.
 of the national peril and the seriousness of our task to stop imperialist
 aggression and the capitulation and national betrayal of the Kuomintang.
 The Soviet has not yet adopted numerous ways to spark the national and
 class consciousness of the broad masses and organize their struggle against
 imperialism.   Notwithstanding this fact, the Soviet Government's direct
 aid and leadership of the anti-imperialist struggle launched at the
 initiative of the masses are very much inadequate.   The Soviet Government
 has not fully discharged its responsibility with regard to the organiza-
 tion and leadership of the workers' struggle against the bourgeoisie and
 the peasants' struggle against landlords in the vast areas under White
 domination.   In the Kuomintang areas surrounding the Soviet areas, it also
 has not exerted the greatest effort to organize the people's struggle and
 create conditions that will rapidly transform them into Soviet areas,
 bring about ever-increasing efforts of the masses to coordinate with the
 Red Army's campaigns in these areas, and, especially, the situation wherein
 soldiers of the White Armies rebel in support of the Red Army.
 Third, the Red Army's entire military strength is still far from being able
 to accomplish the great task of defeating imperialism and the Kuomintang
 and achieving victory for the revolution throughout the country although
 numerically and qualitatively it has been increased and improved.   The
 rear echelon work of expanding the Red Army still cannot meet the require-
 ments of the front, and in many respects the organizing and training of
 Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneers leave much to be desired.  Also,
 the organizing of guerrilla units and their activities are generally very
 inadequate.   In some areas the work of giving preferential treatment to
 families of Red Army members is very poorly carried out.   These have caused
 achievements in the revolution to remain at a standstill and prevented us
 from being able to pursue in the flush of victory and win even greater
 victories each time we smashed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression."
 Fourth, with a mission of giving everything for the war effort, we still
 are unable to conform our work to the needs of the revolution.   Regardless
 of whether it is with respect to land struggle, workers' struggle, economic
 construction, finance, suppression of counterrevolution and cultural and
 education, each has its own weaknesses.   In pointing out these weaknesses
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 in general, we would like to say that the revolution requires this work to
 garner greater achievements with the greatest speed.   But this work is
 being carried out very unevenly in the various areas.  Many areas have
 truly attained the standard of greatest speed and greatest achievements.
 Reliance on the work of these areas has been of great help to the revolu-
 tion.   However, in some other areas work progress has been very slow and,
 in some cases, achievements that should have been attained are still
 unreachable after a long period of time.   Especially in some newly estab-
 lished areas and border areas, the work is done even more poorly.  The main
 reason for this is that in the Soviet organizations of these areas there
 exist elements who do not understand and are even unwilling to carry out, the
 laws and policies of the Soviet.   Some of these elements are people gravely
 afflicted with opportunism and bureaucracism, but others are outright spies
 e   sent in by the landlord bourgeoisie.   They do not advance the work of the
 Soviet but impede it.   They did not subordinate Soviet work to the war
 efforts, but caused it to become separated from it.   They were not willing
 to develop the struggle of the masses and brought it to a standstill.
 Instead of proceeding from mobilizing the broad masses and doing education
 work on them, they tried to implement the Soviet's work through empty talk
 and clamor, even to the extent of using coercive orders of bureaucraticism.
 Instead of trying to understand the situation at lower levels, educating
 new cadres and soliciting suggestions from the masses, they slandered lower
 level cadres and said that the masses do not have enthusiasm.  The Soviet
 democracy was not fully developed in these respects.   It did not attract
 a majority of the masses to participate in the election of Soviets or
 attract large numbers of intellectuals from the masses to participate in
 the work of the Soviet.   The system of urban and rural congresses of
 representatives has not been firmly established in these areas, nor the
 Soviet transformed into a political organization that is truly of the masses.
 For these reasons, many aspects of the Soviet's work did not achieve what
 should have been achieved in these areas and they were unable to meet the
 pressing needs of the revolution.   It should be clearly pointed out that
 this is the gravest shortcoming in the Soviet's work.
 All of these weaknesses have placed us on the highest alert to overcome
 them so that the Soviet movement will be able to conform with all objective
 and favorable conditions and expand on an even more massive scale over an
 even more vast territory.
 We already have one great force, and it has become the foundation for our
 expansion.   But it is insufficient because the requirement of the revolution-
 ary situation exceeds its capability, and we must strengthen it.
 The Second All-China Congress of Soviet Rrepresentatives must call on the
 revolutionary masses in all of the Soviet areas and all of China to resolute-
 ly carry out the following concrete fighting tasks in order to thoroughly
 smash the imperialists' and Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression"
 and win nationwide victory for the revolution:

 1.   On building the Red Army.
 Further strengthen and perfect the leadership of the Central Revolutionary
 Military Affairs Committee over the Red Army so that the activities of the
 Red Army throughout China will, under a unified strategic will, become
 even more mutually supportive and mutually coordinated than in the past,
 and the local military organizations will be able to discharge their own
 duties under the central leadership.
 Propagate on a general and penetrating scale the slogan "expand the Red
 Army into an iron force at least a million strong" into the ranks of the
 worker-peasant masses throughout the Soviet areas and throughout China,
 calling upon the broad masses to struggle for the realization of this
 slogan in the shortest time possible.  The masses must be made to understand
 that the imminent struggle to decide victory or defeat between the Sovicet
 political power and the Kuomintang political power, and the direct and
 massive struggle between the Soviet political power and imperialism is
 entirely dependent upon the establishment of the Red Army.  This task is a
 sacred responsibility of the Soviet and each one of the workers and peasants.
 The Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee and the various
 Soviets should be responsible for collecting the rich experiences gained
 in expanding the Red Army in various areas during the last 2 years,
 especially since Red May of last year.   It is emphatically pointed out that
 in expanding the Red Army, is for political encouragement to be used instead
 of forceful coercion.  We must deal with alien and bad elements who sabotage
 efforts to expand the Red Army and lead to desertion by applying merciless
 class struggle and the Soviet's laws concerning such matters.
 All laws and methods of the Soviet for the preferential treatment of Red
 Army fighters and their families must be implemented.  We must raise the
 social status of Red Army fighters, heightening the spiritual comfort of
 the Red Army fighters and their families and resolving material difficulties
 in their lives.   It is also necessary to point out that cultivating land for
 families of Red Army members and providing them with daily necessities are
 an important part of the work to give preferential treatment.  All those
 who drag their feet, are apathetic and feigned compliance with regard to the
 preferential treatment of Red Army fighters and their families should be
 prosecuted under Soviet law.
 Place the work of consolidating the Red Army in a place of importance in the
 work of building the Red Army so that it will not only be able to expand
 very quickly, but also become strong and healthy very rapidly.   Political
 education of Red Army fighters should be elevated even further so that each
 one of them will consciously struggle to the end for the Soviet New China,
 so that the Red Army is transformed into a propagandist and organizer
 for the Soviet and a creator of new Soviet territories. The relationship
 between the Red Army fighters and the laboring masses of workers and
 peasants in both the Soviet and White areas becomes even more closely
 linked.   Enhance the conscious discipline of the Red Army through political

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 education and make them understand that this is an important weapon guarantee-
 ing victory in the war.   The system of political commissars should be estab-
 lished throughout all Red Army, local and guerrilla units, and foster even
 more worker elements to become military and political commanders.  Transform
 the Red Army school to train better than in the past large numbers of senior
 and junior grade military and political cadres.
 Search for bad elements within the Red Army and deal severely with the
 attempts of landlord bourgeois elements who have stolen in to sabotage
 the Red Army.   The work of consolidating the Red Army so as to transform
 it into a form of iron is of the same importance as political work.   It is
 what the Red Army urgently needs now.   Improving the Red Army's military
 techniques is of vital importance to us in the face of the daily growing
 v     scale of the war and the daily adoption of new military techniques by
 imperialist and Kuomintang troops.   The slogan "Master and improve on new
 military techniques" should penetrate deeply into the minds of the Red
 Army fighters and the Red Army school should exert its greatest efforts
 toward this end.
 The new method of organizing Red   Guard  Forces and Young Pioneers units
 should be propagated to reach every nook and cranny of the Soviet areas
 and arm all of the youths and adult males and females of the working class.
 Every one of the members of the Red Guard Forces and the Young Pioneers
 should be made to understand clearly the roles and responsibilities of the
 Red Army's rear support troops and local defense forces.  The necessity for
 and the role to be played by obligatory service in the forthcoming Civil
 War which will be waged on an even bigger scale should be suitably propagated
 now to the broad masses of working people and members of the Red Guard Forces
 and the Young Pioneers.   An all-out effort should be made to carry out
 necessary military and political training whenever possible. Spread the
 method of bivouaking  and maneuvers to all Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneer
 units in all areas.   Under a situation of enemy attacks and attempts at
 trouble-making by exploiting elements in the Soviet areas, the responsibility
 of the Red Guard Forces and Young Pioneer units for the defense of the area
 should be increased in a special manner, and existing slackness in Red
 martial law in many areas should be speedily corrected.   One of the best
 means to expand the Red Army is to mobilize model units of the Red Guard
 Forces and Young Pioneers, immediately recognize these troops after
 mobilization and enlist them into the Red Army by the whole unit and by
 the entire company.   It is the Red guerrilla units of new and border areas
 and in the areas between the Soviet and the White areas who play the great
 role of detachments of the Red Army inseparable from the Red Army in battle.
 The most pressing task of the Soviet is to strengthen and enlarge present
 guerrilla units, establish new guerrilla units on a most widespread scale,
 collect the rich experiences of guerrilla warfare of the past, massively
 strengthen education and instruction in guerrilla tactics, send forth
 hundreds and thousands of guerrilla units into the White areas and into the
 rear and flanks of the enemy to attack them there, develop mass struggle,
 create guerrilla areas and expand them into new Soviet areas and, especially,

 be active in the areas between the Soviet territories which have not yet been
 linked up in coordination with the activities of the Red Army's main force.
 All means should be applied to ensure the supply and transportation of the
 Red Army's rations.   The finance and economic organizations of the Soviet,
 and the supply, transportation and health organizations within the military
 system should strive together to attain this common objective.   Past short-
 comings should be overcome in the mobilization of transport units so that there
 will be no shortage of transportation personnel to hinder the mobility and
 combat of the Red Army.  All for the war effort is the responsibility of every
 revolutionary and every worker of the Soviet.
 The Soviet should carry out various necessary and feasible economic construc-
 tion in a planned manner for the purpose of breaking through the enemy's
 blockade, opposing the manipulations of unscupulous merchants, ensuring the
 needs of the revolution,,and improve the well-being of the worker-peasant
 masses.
 First and foremost is the development of the vast agricultural production in
 the Soviet areas.   The Soviet should use all means to heighten the enthusiasm
 of the peasantry for production.   It should take advantage of the important
 seasons for agricultural work, such as spring and summer plowing and fall
 harvesting, to launch a general and widespread movement to increase produc-
 tion and mobilize the entire peasantry of the rural areas to plunge together
 into the front lines of production.   An important method to increase produc-
 tion is to organize labor cooperatives and plowing units, distribute the
 rural labor force in a planned way and mobilize the broad masses of women
 to participate in production.   Help and leadership should be provided to the
 peasants in solving concrete and important problems of agriculture, such as
 plow oxen, farm implements, fertilizers, seeds, irrigation and pest preven-
 tion.  Plow oxen cooperatives should be set up on a general scale.   Based
 upon the experience gained from the spring and summer plowing campaign of
 last year, "Completely eliminate waste land" and "Increase this year's
 harvest by 20 percent" should become battle slogans.   Experiences in
 planting cotton should be collected and the production of cotton in the
 Soviet areas should be developed.   A movement to plant trees should be
 launched, calling upon every person in the rural areas to plant 10 trees.
 The Soviet should pay attention to increasing stock animal raising.   The
 Ministry of the People's Council on National Economy of the Central
 Government and the Departments of National Economy of various provinces
 should set forth concrete plans of action in such important departments
 of agriculture as food grains, cotton and others.   The Soviet's Department
 of Food Grains, the Bureau of Food Grains Distribution and food grain
 cooperatives of the masses should closely link together in work and strive
 hard to ensure the supply of food grains to the Red Army and the people.
 The recovery of the large, handicraft enterprises and the construction of
 needed military industries are important tasks of the Soviet's economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 construction.   The Soviet's plan to recover and expand industry should be
 based upon the needs of the war, the needs of the people in the Soviet
 areas and the possibility of exporting to the White areas, wolfram, coal,
 iron, lime, agricultural implements, tobacco, paper, cloth, sugar, medicine,
 nitre, camphor and lumber should be the main departments.  A major effort
 should be made to develop people's production cooperatives of these indus-
 tries, and organize as many as possible unemployed workers, independent
 laborers and peasants and bring them into production cooperatives.  At the
 same time, permit and reward private capitalists to invest and expand
 these productions in the Soviet areas.   Currently, the Soviet should not
 attempt to monopolize all production enterprises, but the founding and
 expansion of especially needed and especially profitable state enterprises
 is permissible and should be done.  An important way to increase production
 is to heighten enthusiasm for labor, launch competitions in production and
 reward those making outstanding achievements on the production front.
 The smashing of the enemy's economic blockade, developing the Soviet areas'
 trade with the outside, exchanging surplus items (such as unhusked grain,
 wolfram, lumber, tobacco and paper) produced in the Soviet areas with
 industrial commodities from the White areas (such as table salt, cloth and
 kerosene) are the pivots in the development of the national economy.   The
 Soviet Bureau of External Trade and other commercial organizations must be
 further improved and strengthened.  At the same time, reward private
 businessmen and bring them to work hard toward the import and export of
 needed commercial commodities.   Consumer cooperatives are to be developed
 on a general scale and organize the broad masses of workers and peasants
 within these cooperatives so that the masses will be able to buy necessary
 items from the White areas at a cheap price and sell the products from
 Soviet areas at a high price.   All these occupy especially important positions
 in the Soviet's trade and in the entire project of economic construction.
 The Soviet should greatly strengthen its leadership over the general consumer
 cooperative of the Central Government and the general consumer cooperatives
 of the provinces and counties, and establish general cooperatives as quickly
 as possible in areas where they have not yet been established.
 In economic construction, the solution of the problem of capital is achieved
 mainly through the absorption of capital from the masses.   Organize them
 into the production consumer and credit cooperatives and attention should
 be paid to the development of credit cooperatives so that after usurious
 capital has been done away with the credit cooperatives can be substituted.
 Absorbing the capital of the masses into the construction of state enter-
 prises, expansion of trade with outside areas and assisting cooperative
 enterprises through such means as issuing economic construction bonds, issu-
 ing bank shares and deposits in banks are equally important.  Use all possible
 means to encourage private capitalists to invest within the boundaries of
 Soviet laws so that capital in the Soviet areas is more viable.   The role
 of the Soviet Bank should be given free rein by all possible means, issuing
 suitable amount of scripts in accordance with the principle of market
 demand, absorbing the deposits of the masses, making loans to profitable
 production enterprises, allocate the finances of the entire Soviet areas
 in a planned way, and lead the people's cooperatives to struggle against
 speculative businessmen.   All these are the tasks of the banks.

 The establishment of the Central Government provided general leadership to
 the Soviet movement throughout the country and it is of absolute significance
 to the Chinese revolution.   It has achieved a great and glorious victory
 in leading the struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang during the
 past 2 years. We should point out that the Central Government, in its
 organization and work, is still not sound and adequate enough in many
 areas.   In order to strengthen the Central Government's general leadership
 of the various Soviet areas and the revolution throughout the country it will
 be necessary to separate the work of the Central Executive Committee from
 that of the People's Committee.   Faced with a situation of accelerated develop-
 ment of the revolution, it will be necessary to make the work and the
 organization of the Central Executive Committee's presidium quite sound,
 the staff of the various people's committees must be fleshed out and their
 work methods improved and more people's committee departments must be estab-
 lished, such as the people's committee department of food grain, so as to
 enable the Central Government to play its full role as principal motive
 force.
 The provincial Soviet is the supreme organization of leadership for the
 local political power, and it is the Central Government's link with the
 various county and area soviets.  We must make a great effort to strengthen
 the Central Government's leadership of the various provinces, closely link
 the relationship between it and the various provincial soviets (the
 provincial soviets in the central Soviet area and those outside) and closely
 scrutinize the work of the various provincial soviets, put into effect the
 systems of collective discussion, precise division of labor and individual
 responsibility.  We must scrutinize the work of the various Soviet areas
 in the counties and strive hard to correct the phenomena of slackened
 efforts and non-centralization which had occurred in the past in some areas.
 As township and city soviets are the basic organizations of the Soviet, we
 must go all-out to improve the work of these soviets.   In those areas
 where a congress of representatives does not exist, it must be established.
 Further strengthen its work and form a presidium for the Congress.  The
 many committees under the Congress should be formed and spread this system
 of committees into the rural areas, attracting large groups of worker-
 peasant activists to join the committees and work in them.   A system whereby
 close relationships may be maintained between a representative and a
 definite number of residents must be set up, a system of chairmen of
 representatives formed so that there will be one in each village to oversee
 the work of the entire village, and he should be permitted to convene a
 meeting between a representative of a hamlet and its inhabitants to discuss
 the work being done in the hamlet.   The township and city soviets are
 organizations directly responsible for mobilizing the masses and carrying
 out the work of the Soviet.   The focus of its work should be how to mobilize
 the masses of the village or township in the soundest and most adequate way

 and struggle to implement successfully each task and each piece of work of
 the Soviet.   The village and ward soviets must give their greatest attention
 to the practical work being done by the village or street, and implement a
 system of scheduled examination of their work.  An effective way to achieve
 speed in work is the revolutionary competition between the various villages
 or streets.   The speedy and thorough improvement of village and ward soviets
 is dependent upon the correct and practical leadership of the area and
 municipal soviets.   The attention of the area and municipal soviets should
 be placed fully upon the improvement of the work of the village and street
 soviets, and the key to the leadership of the area and municipal soviets is
 full explanations, constant inspections, thorough examinations and tests
 by the people.   The county Soviet should apply these as criteria in examin-
 ing the work of the area Soviet.
 The Soviet of various provinces must. place its own attention strongly upon
 the newly formed Soviet areas, and regard the work of establishing revolu-
 tionary committees and strenthening their work as its important duty.  The
 essence of the work and the form of the organization of revolutionary com-
 mittees are in many places different from those of the village or township.
 The transformation of all White areas into Soviet areas has to pass through
 the stage of revolutionary committee.   The provincial soviets, the soviets
 of various new and boundary areas and the county soviet should place the
 organizational structure and work of revolutionary committees on a sound
 basis so that they will be able to shoulder the responsibility of arming
 the people, launching people's struggles, wiping out reactionary forces
 and speedily switching over to the establishment of the Soviet political
 power.
 Although Soviet democracy has developed, we should point out that there is
 still much to be desired in many areas, and it is necessary that a serious
 struggle be launched against bureaucracy to eliminate those obsolete
 things--bureaucraticism and commandism--hidden in the Soviets and among the
 people.   The functionaries (cadres of the Soviets)should carry out their
 work by mobilization and persuasion, and not by compulsory orders.   They
 should be attentive to, and not ignore, each and every request or suggestion
 from the masses.  Personnel of the soviets, especially the procurate
 committee of the workers and peasants, should induce the broad masses to
 launch criticism and struggle against bad elements within the Soviet
 organizations and sternly prosecute them under the laws of the Soviet so
 as to ensure that there will be good relationship between the Soviet and
 the people.
 In order to have sound elements in the Soviet, it will be necessary to
 popularize the election of soviets, explain the meaning of elections to
 the people and induce the greatest majority of the voters to participate
 in the elections.   In elections, those class alien elements and elements
 who are corrupt, wasteful and bureaucratic must be absolutely expelled
 and large numbers of worker-peasant activists elected to manage the
 state's work.   Here, letting in large groups of worker cadres, in accordance
 with the election laws to strengthen the workers' position of leadership

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 in the Soviet political power, is a key link in placing the work of the
 Soviet on a sound basis.   The Soviet must maintain close link with trade
 unions, poor peasants' groups, representatives' congresses of women workers
 and farmers, cooperatives and all other civic groups so as to popularize
 the work of the Soviet, and carry out the work of the Soviet by mobilizing
 the broad masses of people through these groups.
 In order to acquire speed and quality in the work of the Soviet so that all
 work will meet the requirements of the revolution, it is necessary to exert
 maximum effort to eliminate the relaxed and placid attitudes of Soviet
 functionaries and greatly heighten their work enthusiasm so that each one
 of them will consciously put out effort in the work of the state under the
 democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants.  Work discipline must
 be strict.   All those elements who fritter away their time and neglect
 their duties and do not give importance to the work of the Soviet must be
 struggled against severely until they are expelled from their work.   Corrup-
 tion and waste must be opposed because not only do these phenomena inflict
 loss upon the finances and economy of the Soviet, but they also corrupt
 Soviet functionaries, cause'them to lose enthusiasm for their work and lose
 spiritual essence.   The slogans of "Subordinate all work to the war effort"
 and "Achieve speed and quality in work" must be set before the masses, and,
 in this respect, the principal responsible persons, especially the worker-
 peasant procuratory committee, should adequately carry out the work of
 persuasive education upon Soviet functionaries.
 Place the burden of thoroughly and conscientiously carrying out the policies
 and laws of the Soviet on the shoulders of all Soviet functionaries.   Impose
 heavy penalties on transgressions against Soviet laws and policies, first
 and foremost on such misdeeds by the Soviet functionaries themselves.
 The Labor Law must be implemented in full, and every article of it explained
 to the broad masses of workers.   The application of the 8-hour work system
 and the stipulation of minimum wage are the core to ensuring the interests
 of the workers.   The labor inspection stations and the labor courts must
 see to it that they become fully effective.  We must conduct resolute
 struggle against those personnel who neglect the interests of the workers
 and attempt to seek compromise with the capitalists, provide practical and
 timely aid to unemployed workers, and organize committees on aid to the
 unemployed in all the areas where there are unemployed workers.  The system
 of social insurance must be put into effect where it is possible and required
 attention paid to the work of the social insurance bureau, avoiding past
 errors made in some areas with regard to the disbursement of insurance funds.
 The labor department of the Soviet should be placed on a sound basis in order
 to carry out this work fully, and there should be a close relationship
 between the labor department and the trade unions.   One of the central tasks
 of the Soviet is to fully implement the land law and all the laws governing
 the struggle for land by launching a massive campaign of agrarian revolution
 throughout the country.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 The struggle to confiscate land owned by the landlord class and big private
 land holders should be launched with emphasis and intensity in all the newly
 acquired territories of the Soviet.   The many experiences accumulated from
 methods used in the past to distribute land should be collected and applied
 generally to all new Soviet areas.   Develop the land inspection movement
 in all those areas where the land problem has not yet been throughly
 resolved, and rapidly sweep away from those areas the remnant forces of
 feudalism.   A correct class line and adequate work on the masses in the
 agrarian struggle are prerequisites guaranteeing absolute victory in the
 agrarian revolution.   Implementing the Soviet policy on culture and education,
 launching a cultural revolution within the soviet territories, arming the
 minds of the masses with communism, enhancing the cultural standard of the
 masses, putting into effect the system of compulsory education and
 strengthening the ability to mobilize the masses in the course of the
 revolution are tasks of similar importance for the Soviet.
 The Soviet policy of punishing exploiters and suppressing counterrevolu-
 tionaries must be carried out with determination.   The state's Bureau of
 Political Defense and the Soviet courts must enhance their own levels of
 alertness and sternly punish and suppress elements of the exploiting class
 who transgress against Soviet laws and all those who are engaged in
 counterrevolutionary activities.   In this respect, the work of the Bureau
 of Political Defense, the popularization of the Soviet courts, the mobiliza-
 tion of the broad masses to participate in the struggle to suppress counter-
 revolutionaries are of vital importance.   The general orientation of the
 Soviet's work in acquiring speed and quality in the work of the Soviet and
 making all the work of the Soviet meet entirely with the needs of the
 revolution.
 4.   On leading struggle against imperialism and work in White areas.
 The Soviet Government must strengthen its leadership of the nationwide
 struggle against imperialism and the revolutionary struggles of workers and
 peasants in the Kuomintang areas in order to oppose imperialist aggression,
 unfold an intense struggle of workers and peasants over the whole country
 and expand the Soviet area to cover the entire nation.  Apathy in this
 respect is tantamount to letting loose the bandit-like aggression of
 imperialism, prolonging the life of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang
 and restricting the speed and limits of the expansion of Soviet areas.
 The Soviet Central Government and the various provincial soviets must
 extend their views into the vast areas under the Kuomintang.  They must not
 only lead every anti-imperialist movement launched by the masses on their
 own initiative, but also utilize each concrete fact of imperialist aggres-
 sion and the Kuomintang's capitulation and national betrayal to rouse the
 national and class consciousness of the masses in the ranks of the broad
 masses of workers and  peasants and among the petite bourgeoisie, and, call
 them to organize and arm for the struggle to drive out imperialism and
 defend the territory of China.   Especially in the three eastern provinces
 (Kirin, Heulungkiang and Liaoning), Jehol, Chahar, north China and areas
 where the Japanese imperialists are attacking, organize people's revolution-
 ary armies and volunteer armies, lead the original volunteer army and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 bring them out from under the reaction influence of the Kuomintang to wage
 resolute war with the Japanese imperialists. The Soviet Government must
 give all possible material and moral support to every one of the anti-
 imperialist strikes launched by workers and the anti-imperialist struggle
 of the peasants and petite bourgeoisie.   The Soviet must use all possible
 means to organize, help and lead workers' struggle against, the bourgeoisie
 and peasants' struggle against the landlords erupting in the Kuomintang
 areas.   Every one of the Soviet personnel should understand that they must
 place their greatest attention upon the White dominated areas if they desire
 to develop the Soviet movement to envelop the entire country, create condi-
 tions to transform into Soviet territory the Kuomintang dominated areas
 which are several times larger than the Soviet's, establish new Soviet
 areas and be able to receive the help of the masses of the White areas in
 the struggle against imperialism and the massive "encirclement and suppres-
 sion" of the Kuomintang.   Prepared with all the material support needed,
 personnel must be dispatched from the Soviet areas to organize and lead
 the mass struggles in the White areas.   Apathy in this respect is tantamount
 to apathy toward the expansion of the Soviet area and developing the
 revolution.   Especially the masses in the Kuomintang areas in the vicinity
 of the Soviet territories have been most heavily influenced by the Soviet
 and they suffer most from the oppression of Kuomintang's military bondage
 and monopoly of salt.   The Soviet Government, especially the government of
 the various provincial soviets, border counties and border areas must use
 every opportunity to achieve a link-up with these people, organize their
 daily struggles and develop them into guerrilla warfare and mass uprising,
 until a Soviet area has been established and it is linked with the old
 Soviet areas.   In this respect, great importance should be placed on the
 work done in the boundary areas between the Soviet and White territories.
 In these areas, the Soviet (or the revolutionary committee) and the
 guerrilla units must completely abide by the basic policies of the Soviet.
 All indiscriminate beatings of local bullies without class distinction
 is prohibited.   Confiscated money and property of landlord bourgeoisie and
 reactionaries must be distributed among the local people.   Besides,
 effectively resolve such problems as the confrontation of Red and White,
 civilian deserters, the salt blockade and civilian victims in accordance
 with the class and mass lines and eliminate the cause of confrontations
 between Red and White and civilian desertion.  And improvement in the work
 carried out in the boundary areas is an important link in securing the
 transformation of White areas into Soviet areas.

 [Text]   Comrades! You have discussed for 2 days--in the subgroup meeting held
 yesterday and in today's general conference--the report I presented on behalf
 of the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee.   In these
 2 days, you have made many suggestions expressing in an all-round manner the
 lessons and experiences from our work done during the past 2 years.   In
 summation, it can be said that there was unanimous agreement with my report.
 With regard to the current situation, the tasks that emerged from this
 situation, the implementation of Soviet policies in various areas during the
 past 2 years and shortcomings that exist in our work, there was general
 agreement in the discussions you held yesterday and today.  The speeches made
 by the comrades were generally very correct.   This should be pointed out in
 the first place.
 It behooves me to point out that in the discussions of yesterday and today,
 mainly in the meeting of the subgroup held yesterday, incorrect views were
 encompassed in the speeches made by individual comrades.  These were mainly
 opinions expressed on the question of the fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 On this question the majority of the comrades accepted what I had said in my
 report:  We have won the initial victory of the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression," but the final and decisive battle still faces us gravely.   It
 is our current most important task to call upon the broad masses, unite all
 forces and strive for victory in the final and decisive battle of the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression."  Some comrades said in the discussion that
 "the fifth 'encirclement and suppression' has been completely smashed," and
 this viewpoint is obviously incorrect.  Other comrades said:   "We are pre-
 paring to smash the fifth 'encirclement and suppression'," and this viewpoint
 is also wrong.  We overestimated our own victory and lightly did away with
 the Soviet's task to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression," in the
 end, while in reality Chiang Kai-shek is concentrating all his forces for
 a final, massive offensive against us.  This kind of estimation is erroneous,
 and it is also very dangerous.   It is erroneous not to see that the Red Army
 has dealt  the enemy quite a serious blow in the past several months of
 arduous fighting and has won an initial victory.  This kind of victory, in
 combination with the great victory of smashing the fourth "encirclement and
 suppression," forms a solid foundation for thoroughly smashing the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression."  Underestimating our own achievements is
 similarly very dangerous.

 A comrade said that there was some revolutionary essence in the Fukien People's
 Revolutionary Government and that it is not wholly counterrevolutionary.   This
 view is also wrong.   In my report, I have already pointed out that the
 People's Revolutionary Government is but a faction of the reactionary ruling
 class, and it is a new trick used to swindle the people in order to preserve
 itself from death.   They regard the Soviet as an enemy, and the facade of
 the Kuomintang is too dilapidated.   They came up with this People's Revolu-
 tionary Government, using the gambit of the third road to swindle the people
 in this manner.   There is not a bit of revolutionary essence to it.   Current
 facts have already proven this to be so.
 Another comrade made erroneous remarks in the subgroup meeting.  He said that
 the Soviet has not expanded the Red Army, and it does not have any guerrilla
 units, that the peasants still have to pay rent to the landlords.   These
 remarks are, of course, quite inane, and require no further explanation.
 Yet  another comrade said that the functionaries in Fukien were all oppor-
 tunists.  Without the.need of an explanation, everybody will recognize this
 as erroneous. We admit that there are opportunists among some of the Soviet
 functionaries fomenting trouble and we should launch resolute struggle against
 such elements.   But remarks such as the one the comrade made vilify the Soviet.
 With regard to marriage, I have already said in my report that should one
 party of the marriage resolutely request divorce, the Soviet should grant it.
 It should be pointed out that the families of Red Army members are exceptions.
 In order to strengthen the will to fight in a Red Army fighter, the Central
 Government has resolved that a wife of a Red Army fighter can request a
 divorce only with the concurrance of her husband.   Divorce can be requested
 by the wife alone only after 2 years have elapsed with no news from her
 husband.   Quite a few of the comrades have proposed lowering the eligibility
 age for marriage.   I do not feel that such suggestions are sound.   In the
 interests of the race and of the class, the marriage age should not be lower
 than 20 for men and 18 for women.  We should understand that early marriage
 is extremely harmful.   Comrades, be a little patient (loud laughter burst
 forth in the conference hall).   In the days under the rule of landlord
 bourgeoisie, poor workers and peasants still could not marry at the age
 of 40 or 50, so why is there such impatience now for 1 or 2 years? (more
 laughter from the hall).
 The preceding has been the first part of my conclusion, but the principal part
 is still to follow.
 A very important question on which the comrades have not focused their atten-
 tion in the discussions is the well-being of the people with the revolution.
 This question was not pointed out with emphasis in yesterday's and today's
 discussions.   I feel that it should be clearly set forth.
 The central task of the Soviet at present is to mobilize the broad masses to
 take part in the revolution, overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang by means
 of such war, spread the revolution throughout the country and drive imperialism

 out of China.   Leading the revolution and organizing the revolution are cen-
 tral tasks of the Soviet, and anyone who does not attach enough importance
 to this central task is not a good revolutionary cadre.  A good Soviet
 cadre should have a clear and profound. view of this central task.  If he
 truly perceives this task with clarity and understands that spreading the
 revolution is our basic and pressing task, that the revolution must at all
 cost be spread throughout the country, then, he should in no way neglect or
 underestimate the question of immediate interests, the well-being, of the
 masses.  Why?  Because the revolution is a war of the masses.   It can be
 waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them.  We must place this
 task of waging war before the masses, and mobilize the masses on a massive
 scale to participate in the war and support the war effort.   Only thus can
 we win victory.
 If we only mobilize the people to carry on the war and do nothing else, can
 we succeed in defeating the enemy?  My answer is:   Of course not.   If we
 want to win, we must do a great deal more.  We must lead the peasants'
 struggle for land and distribute the land to them, heighten their enthusiasm
 for labor and increase agricultural production, safeguard the interests of
 the workers, establish cooperatives, develop trade with outside areas and
 solve the problems facing the masses--food, shelter and clothing, fuel, rice,
 cooking oil and salt, sickness and hygiene, and marriage.   In short, all the
 practical problems in the everyday life of the masses should claim our
 attention.   If the Soviet attends to these problems, solves them and satis-
 fies the needs of the masses, we shall really become organizers of the well-
 being of the masses, and they will truly rally round us and give us their
 warm support.   Comrades, will we then be able to arouse them to take part in
 the revolution and sacrifice everything for the war effort?  Yes, indeed we
 will.
 Here is the kind of thing we have found among Soviet organizations.   Some
 of the cadres talk only about expanding the Red Army, enlarging the trans-
 port corps, collecting the land tax and selling bonds; as for other matters,
 they neither discuss nor attend to them, and even ignore them altogether.
 For instance, there was a time when the Ting-chou Municipal Soviet Govern-
 ment concerned itself with the expansion of the Red Army and with mobiliza-
 tion for the transport corps, and paid not the slightest attention to the
 well-being of the masses.   The problems facing the people of Ting-chou city
 were that they had no firewood, no salt was on sale because the capitalists
 were hoarding it, some people had no houses to live in and the houses
 confiscated from local despots have not yet been distributed to them, and
 rice was both scarce and dear.   These were practical problems for the masses
 of Ting-chou and they eagerly looked toward the Soviet Government for help
 in solving them.   But the Ting-chou Municipal Soviet did not discuss any
 of these problems.   That is why when the new workers' and peasants' repre-
 sentative council was elected in the city, a hundred or more representatives
 were unwilling to attend after the first few council meetings had discussed
 only the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport corps,
 entirely ignoring the well-being of the masses, so that the council was

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 unable to go on meeting.   The result was that very little was achieved in
 regard to the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport
 corps.   This was one kind of situation.
 Comrades, you have probably read the pamphlets given you about two model
 township soviets.   There the situation is entirely different.  What a great
 number of people have joined the Red Army from Ch'ang-kang township in
 Kiangsi and Ts'ai-hsi township in Fukien!   In Ch'ang-kang township 80 percent
 of the young men and women have joined the Red Army, and in Ts'ai-hsi the
 figure is 88 percent.   There has been a big sale of bonds, too, and 4,500 yuan
 worth have been sold in Chang-kang which has a population of 1,500.  Much has
 also been done in other fields.  What accounts for this?  A few examples will
 make the point clear.   In Ch'ang-kang when fire broke out in a poor peasant's
 house destroying one-and-a-half rooms, the township government immediately
 appealed to the masses to contribute money to help him.  In another instance,
 three persons were starving, so the township government and the mutual-aid
 society immediately gave them rice.   During the food shortage last summer,
 the township soviet obtained rice from Kung-lueh County's Shui-nan [3055 0589]
 and Fu-t'ien [1381 3944] areas more than 200 li away for the relief of the
 masses.   Excellent work was done along these lines in Ts'ai-hsi as well. Such
 township governments are really models.  They are absolutely different from
 the Ting-chou Municipal Government with its bureaucratic methods of leader-
 ship.  We should learn from Ch'ang-kang and T'sai-hsi townships and oppose
 bureaucratic leaders like those in Ting-chou city.
 I earnestly suggest to this congress that we pay close attention to the well-
 being of the masses, from the problems of land and labor to those of fuel,
 rice, cooking oil and salt.   The women comrades want to learn plowing and
 harrowing.  Whom can we get to teach them?  The children want to go to school.
 Have we  set up Lenin primary schools?  The wooden bridge over there is too
 narrow and people may fall off.   Should we not repair it?  Many people suffer
 from boils and other ailments.  What are we going to do about it?  All such
 problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on our
 agenda.  We should discuss them, adopt and carry out decisions and check up
 on the results.  We should convince the masses that we represent their
 interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs.  We should
 help them to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher
 tasks which we have put forward, the tasks of the revolution, so that
 they will support the revolution and spread it throughout the country,
 respond to our political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the
 revolution.
 The masses in Ch'ang-kang say, "The Communist Party is really good!   It has
 thought of everything on our behalf."  The comrades in Ch'ang-kang township
 are an example to all of us.  What admirable people!   They have won the
 genuine affection of the broad masses, who support their call for war
 mobilization.   Look, 80 percent of the able bodied in Ch'ang-kang township
 have gone to the front!   Do we want to win the support of the masses?  Do
 we want them to devote their strength to the front?  If so, we must be with
 them, arouse their enthusiasm and initiative, be concerned with their well-
 being, work earnestly and sincerely in their interests and solve all their

 problems of production and everyday life--the problems of salt, rice, housing,
 clothing, childbirth, etc.   If we do so, the masses will surely support us
 and regard the revolution as their most glorious banner, as their very life.
 In the event of a Kuomintang attack on the Red areas they will fight the
 Kuomintang to the death.   There can be no doubt about this, for is it not a
 plain fact that we have smashed the enemy's first, second, third and fourth
 "encirclement and suppression" campaigns?
 The Kuomintang is now pursuing a policy of blockhouse warfare, feverishly
 constructing their "tortoise-shells" as though they were bastions of iron.
 Are they really iron bastions?  Not in the least!   Think of the palaces of
 the feudal emperors over thousands of years, were they not powerful with
 their walls and moats?  Yet they crumbled one after another the moment the
 masses arose.   The tsar of Russia was one of the world's most ferocious
 rulers, yet when the proletariat and the peasantry rose in revolution, was
 there anything left of him?  No, nothing.  His bastions of iron?  They
 all crumbled.   Comrades!  What is a true bastion of iron?  It is the masses,
 the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the
 revolution.   That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash, no force
 whatsoever.   The counterrevolution cannot smash us; on the contrary, we shall
 smash it.   Rallying millions upon millions of people round the revolutionary
 government and expanding our revolution, we shall wipe out all counter-
 revolution and take over the whole of China.
 I am going to talk about the second question.   I feel that this question must
 also be thoughtfully brought before the Congress.  The second question concerns
 our methods of work.
 The Soviet is the leader and organizer of the revolution as well as the leader
 and organizer of the life of the masses.  To develop the revolution and to
 improve the life of the masses are our tasks and our objectives.  With regard
 to such tasks and objectives, we must not only discuss them, but also carry
 them out.  In this respect we are faced with the serious problem of methods
 of work.   It is not enough to, set tasks and decide on the objectives to be
 achieved.  We must also solve the problem of the methods for carrying them
 out.
 If our task is to cross a river, we cannot cross it without a bridge or a
 boat.  Unless the bridge or boat problem is solved, it is idle to speak of
 crossing the river.   Unless the problem of method is solved, talk about
 the task is useless.  Unless we pay attention to giving  leadership to the
 work of expanding the Red Army and devote particular care to our methods,
 we will never succeed even though we recite the phrase "Expand the Red
 Army" a thousand times.  Like a monk, you may recite Amida Buddha from dawn
 to dusk, day in and day out and it will still be Amida Buddha.   No Red Army
 will materialize.  (general laughter).
 Are there similar situations in the work of our Government?  Of course, and,
 indeed, not just a few!  Let us take Jui-chin and Fukien as examples.
 Jui-chin's recent phenomenal campaign to expand the Red Army is worthy of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 our admiration.  Under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau and the
 Central Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee, the Red Army was expanded
 by nearly 4,000 during the 1 1/2 month period beginning 1 December.  They
 won the most recent campaign to expand the Red Army with phenomenal speed
 by applying correct methods of work, launching struggles against opportunism
 and bureaucraticism and by unfolding class struggles of the masses.  As for
 Fukien, the total achievements of more than 10 counties in the province
 barely equal that of Jui-chin.   This was possible only because of the change
 in the methods of work which took place under the direct leadership of the
 Central Political Bureau during the recent half month.   Under the leadership
 of bureaucraticism, as in December, it would not have been possible to even
 equal the achievements of one county such as Jui-chin.   Even Jui-chin was
 able to achieve an expansion by only 30 people in the entire month of last
 August.   Compared with the 4,000-men expansion in the recent period of
 45 days, it can be seen what a vast difference results between bureaucratic
 leadership and effective and concrete leadership.  Again, using the storm
 troop movement launched by Jui-chin in December to expand the Red Army as
 an example, hardly any achievements were made under the leadership of bureau-
 craticism in such areas as Ch'eng [1004], Hsia-hsiao [0007 5135] and
 Huang-po [7806 2672] in the first half of the month.
 In the latter half of the month, after the storm troop leader was replaced
 and work methods changed, not only was the quota for the month fulfilled but
 it was also exceeded by 100 percent.   This was so with the movement to expand
 the Red Army.  Now let us next take a look at the movement to sell bonds.
 By the time Jui-chin has sold and completed collecting the money on
 240,000 yuan of bonds, only 19,000 yuan was sold in Yu-tu [7184 6757] County
 under the leadership of bureaucraticism, and,till today, they still have in
 their boxes over 100,000 yuan of the 190,000 yuan of bonds issued to them.
 Ch'ang-kang township sold 4,500 yuan in bonds, averaging 3.80 yuan per person.
 If all the townships were like Ch'ang-kang, 12 million yuan worth of bonds
 can be issued in the Central Soviet areas alone, but if it were like Yu-tu,
 it would be hard to sell even 1 million yuan.  We have been taught a very
 serious lesson in the matters of leadership and work methods.  We cannot
 accomplish our tasks in any other field, for instance, in checking upon
 land distribution, or in economic construction, or culture and education,
 or our work in the new areas and the outlying districts, if all we do is
 to set the tasks without attending to the methods of carrying them out,
 without combating bureaucratic methods of work and adopting practical and
 concrete ones, and without discarding commandist methods and adopting the
 method of patient persuasion.
 The comrades in Hsing-kuo have done first-rate work and deserve our praise
 as model workers.   The comrades in northeastern Kiangsi have done good work
 and are also model soviet workers.   By li=king the problem of the well-being
 of the masses with that of the revolution the comrades in both these places
 are simultaneously solving the problems of revolutionary methods of work and
 of accomplishing their revolutionary tasks.  They are working conscientously,
 solving problems with minute care and shouldering their revolutionary
 responsibilities in earnest.   They are good organizers and leaders of bgth

 revoLutioti and the welt-being of the masses,   Elsewhere, too, the comrades
 have made progress in their work and deserve our praise--as in some parts
 of the counties of Shang-hang, Chang-t'ing and Yung.-ting in Fukien Province.
 In Hsi-chiang and other places in southern Kiangsi Province; in some parts
 of the counties of Ch'a-ling, Yung-hsin and Chi-an in the Hunan-Kiangsi
 burder area; in some parts of Yang-Hsin County in the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi
 border area; in districts and townships of many other counties in Kiangsi
 Province and in Jui-chin County, which is directly under our Central
 Government, progress was made.
 We should, however, point out that the work done by the soviets of some
 areas is far from satisfactory.  And we should apply the spirit of self-
 criticism to enhance our revolutionary vigilance with regard to the work of
 these areas.   For instance, there are many shortcomings in many places of
 the Fukien-Kiangsi, Hupeh-Kiangsi and Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi areas.   Similarly,
 Fukien and Hunan-Kiangsi are a far cry from Kiangsi and Fukien-Chekiang.
 Kiangsi area.  For example, the leaders of the Fukien Provincial Government
 are seriously afflicted with bureaucraticism.  Many of the cadres in these
 areas do not enjoy good relations with the masses.   They still do not compre-
 hend the need to link closely the revolution with the well-being of the masses,
 to exert themselves in learning the arts of the masses and giving their
 leadership.   They do not understand that without good methods of work, they
 absolutely will not be able to accomplish their tasks, that they should
 coordinate all work with the revolution war effort.  There should be a
 thorough change in the work of these areas after the conclusion of the
 Second All-Soviet Congress.   Especially those seriously afflicted with
 opportunism and bureaucraticism do not understand the situation prevailing
 in the lower levels and the feelings of the masses, engaging only in idle
 talk and even resorting to commandism in handling the work of the Soviet.
 The Congress should sternly censure these cadres.   Their views and work
 methods are absolutely wrong.   They hinder the work of the Soviet and are
 not beneficial to the revolution.   These cadres should immediately change
 their ways.
 In all the places under our leadership, there are undoubtedly many active
 cadres, excellent comrades, who have sprung from the masses.   These comrades
 have a responsibility.   That is to conduct a serious self-.criticism campaign
 against those opportunists and bureaucrats, instruct and help them to
 rapidly rectify their errors, and cleanse the Soviet of those obdurate ele-
 ments who refuse to change.  We are in the midst of a great revolutionary
 war.   We must break through the enemy's large-scale "encirclement and
 suppression" and spread the revolution to all parts of the country.  All
 revolutionary cadres have a tremendous responsibility.   After this Congress
 we must adopt effective measures to improve our work, the advanced areas
 should become even more advanced, and the backward areas should catch up
 with the advanced.   We must create thousands of townships like Chang-kang
 and scores of counties like Hsing-kuo.  They will be our advance strongholds.

 ment and suppression" campaigns, overthrow the rule of imperialism and the
 Kuomintang throughout the country and win victory for the revolution in all
 of China! (loud applause)

 report ends here.   As for the rest, I have brought them up in the report
 and will not repeat them.  My conclusion,is ended.  (thunderous applause)

 CLOSING SPEECH
 (At the Second All-Soviet Congress)
 1 February 1934
 [Text]   Comrades!   After 11 days of conference our Congress has been completely
 successful.   It has come to a victorious end!  (applause)  We decided upon the
 policies and plans for nationwide victory for the Revolution!  Nationwide
 victory for the Revolution is in our hands!  (applause)  We must smash
 imperialism's and the Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression."  We must
 overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang.  We decided upon the policies and
 plans to achieve them!  (applause)
 The current problem is to carry out these policies and plans 100 percent!  We
 must have the courage to act and act resolutely.  We must heighten the en-
 thusiasm of all the cadres for their work, heighten the enthusiasm and ac=tivism of the broad masses.   Our responsibility is great.  We are shouldering
 the glorious burden of revolution placed upon us by the Congress.  We must
 shoulder this burden with enthusiasm, resoluteness and courage and march
 forward.  We certainly must shoulder this burden until we reach our desti-
 nation!  (applause)   Smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" thoroughly,
 overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang and strive to achieve nationwide
 victory for the Revolution!
 Victory for the bourgeois democratic revolution throughout the country!
 Victory for the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship in all parts of
 Chiina!   These are our objectives and we must carry the burden handed to
 us by the Congress to these areas.  We will reach these areas, and reach
 them quickly!  (applause)   Is our mission accomplished after having reached
 these areas with the revolutionary burden?  Is the worker-peasant democratic
 dictatorship our final objective?  Comrades!  No.  The mission is not yet
 accomplished, and that is not our final objective.  The revolutionary
 burden has to be carried to an even more distant place.  Today, we shall
 point out this place.   It is the Socialist Revolution under the Dictatorship
 of the Proletariat.

 We have not only to accomplish the democratic revolution, but also bring about
 a change in the revolution and head it in the direction of socialism in the
 future!  We must not only overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang
 and wipe out the landlord class.  We must also prepare as of now for an
 opportune moment in the future to wipe out the capitalist system, the system
 of man exploiting man.  We must, as the Soviet Union is now doing, enter
 into communism in the final stage, putting into effect the system of "from
 each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," and emerge
 into a free, bright and great world.   Only when such a time arrives can there
 be the final liberation of mankind. Only then can there be a final victory of
 mankind!
 The Second All-Soviet Congress closes today.  We must carry out our responsi-
 bilities.  We must courageously shoulder the great responsibilities of the
 Revolution and march forward to realize our final victory!

 Long live worldwide victory for the Revolution!
 Long live Socialism!
 Long live Communism!

 ON ELECTION AT SECOND ALL-SOVIET CONGRESS AND THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

 DECLARATION ON THE FUKIEN INCIDENT
 11 February 1934
 [Text]  Masses of all China!
 The so-called People's Revolutionary Government of Fukien, due to the armed
 intervention of Chiang Kai-shek and the surrender and sellout by the leaders
 of the People's Revolutionary Government, is finally defeated.
 The leaders of the Fukien People's Revolutionary Government were severely
 attacked last year at Lien-ch'eng and Min-pei by our Workers and Peasants
 Red Army and Eastern Army.   They now know that temporary concessions of the
 soviet and Red Army are the necessary condition for maintaining their
 available forces and rule.   At the same time, the bankruptcy of the
 traitorous and oppressive Kuomintang rule, the growing anger and resistance
 of the tens of millions of worker-peasant masses to the imperialist Kuomintang
 and their sympathy and support for the anti-imperialist, anti-Kuomintang
 soviet Red Army gave the bureaucrats, politicians and militarists of the
 Fukien Kuomintang Provincial Government and 19th Route Army at that time no
 choice but to seek modes of rule besides those of the Kuomintang.  They came
 to preserve the entire rule of the landlord and bourgeois class.
 At that time, the bureaucrats, politicians and militarists of the Fukien
 Provincial Government and 19th Route Army first sent a special envoy,
 Hsu Ming-hung [1776 0682 7703], to the soviet Central Government where he
 indicated he was willing to accept the three provisions of the soviet Central
 Government and Revolutionary Military Committee, that is, 1) immediate halt
 to attacks on soviet areas; 2) immediate guarantee of freedoms and rights
 of the masses to speak, assemble, form associations and strike; and
 3) immediate establishment of a volunteer army of the armed masses to safe-
 guard China and to strive for the independence, unification and territorial
 integrity of China.
 The soviet government completely understood this scheme of the bureaucrats,
 politicians and militarists of the Fukien Kuomintang Provincial Government
 and 19th Route Army of that time.  All the empty words absolutely could not
 fool the leaders of the soviet government.  On the other hand, according to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 its own declaration, the soviet government was willing to provide real impetus
 and support to all anti-imperialist and anti-Chiang plans.  The soviet govern-
 ment and Worker-Peasants Red Army of that time, with the representatives of
 the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route Army permitted to accept all
 of our demands and conditions, and according to our own basic revolutionary
 position, drew up a preliminary agreement with them.   From the very beginning,
 the leaders of the soviet government told the representatives of the Fukien
 Provincial Government and 19th Route Army that only if they resolutely wage
 and back the anti-Japanese, anti-imperialist, anti-Chiang revolutionary
 struggle of the broad masses, arm them and give them all the democratic
 freedoms and rights, can they save the Chinese nation from perishing.  Any
 reformist deceptive propaganda can only serve as an additional tool for the
 imperialist Kuomintang.
 After the representatives of the Fukien Provincial Government and 19th Route
 Army drew up the preliminary agreement with the soviet government and Worker-
 Peasant Red Army, they stated that they would separate from the Kuomintang,
 announced some "left" reformist political programs and openly published
 declarations opposing Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanking Kuomintang Government.
 This was just lip service.   In reality, they still colluded with the Japanese
 and American imperialists as before and toadied to them.   They kept silent
 and did not make a sound about the provocations of the Japanese ronin in
 Foochow.   In respect to allowing democratic rights for. the masses and arming
 the masses, on the pretext that it was wartime, they did not make good on
 any of their promises.  As for the workers, peasants and all toilers, not
 only did they not have any concrete methods to improve their life but on
 the contrary, they made every effort to prohibit the workers' struggle to
 strike and the peasants' struggle to resist the landlords and seize land.
 Militarily, they completely took the defeatist line.   Faced with Chiang Kai-
 shek's relentless attacks, first of all they offered no concrete military
 deployment whatsoever and then they surrendered and sold out again and
 again, from the direct mutiny of Ssu-t'u Fei [0674 1778 7236] and
 T'an Ch'i-hsiu [6223 0796 4423] to Shen Kuang-han [3098 0342 3352],
 Mao Wei-shou [3029 4850 1108], Ou Shou-nien [0575 1108 1628] and
 Chang Yen [1728 3508].   The militarists of the 19th Route Army, the likes
 of Chiang Kuang-ting [5592 0342 7844] and Ts'ai Ting-chieh [5591 1694
 6946], retreated without a fight and surrendered the Kwangtung militarists
 to save themselves.  Many other bureaucrats and politicians, the likes of
 Ch'en Ming-shu [7115 6900 2873], Ch'en Yu-jen [7115 0645 0088] and Huang
 Ch'i-hsiang [7806 3825 5046], spent all day in empty talk and deceiving
 the masses.  As soon as they heard a shot they flew away as chickens,
 scattered as dogs and fled for their lives to imperialist legations and
 warships.   Although our Red Army had already taken positive action in
 Min-pei and occupied Sha-hsien to Yu-ch'i in order to coordinate their
 anti-Chiang struggle, it was still of no help to those packs of jackals.
 The soviet government and the Worker and Peasant Red Army had already warned
 the People's Revolutionary Government again according to the preliminary
 agreement that only by realizing every provision of the agreement and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 launching the revolutionary struggle of the broad masses could they defeat
 the armed attacks of Chiang Kai-shek and go right on to oppose the Japanese
 imperialists. The warning of the soviet government and Worker-Peasant Red
 Army could not get the attention of the bureaucrats, politicians and
 militarists in the People's Revolutionary Government.  They looked on the
 masses as enemies and they did not have the slightest difference from other
 Kuomintang bureaucrats, politicians and militarists.  As a result, just as
 we said, the People's Revolutionary Government, faced with Chiang Kai-shek,
 concluded its sad fate of over 50 days.
 Masses of all China!  You can see fully from the preliminary agreement drawn
 up by the soviet government and the People's Revolutionary Government and
 from the soviet government's delegram how the soviet government and the
 4 Worker-Peasant Red Army are unwavering in the struggle to oppose Japanese
 imperialism and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek and for the thorough liberation
 of the Chinese nation.  All the facts prove that only the soviet government
 and the Worker-Peasant Red Army are the anti-imperialist vanguard that can
 liberate China from the iron heel of the imperialist Kuomintang.  All the
 reformist factions, from the Productive Masses Party, Social Democratic
 Party and Third Party, right down to the Trotskyite Ch'en Tu-hsiu [7115
 3747 4423] liquidationists were all nothing but yes-men to the imperialist
 Kuomintang and accomplices with the imperialist Kuomintang in opposing the
 Chinese revolutionary masses!
 The soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Committee declare
 once more to the masses of all China, revolutionary soldiers and all armed
 ranks, that just because of the defeat of the Fukien People's Revolutionary
 Government or the breaking of the agreement by the bureaucrats, politicians
 and militarists in the People's Revolutionary Government, the soviet govern-
 ment absolutely will not forsake [two characters deleted] the proposals
 of the battle agreement drawn up and fought for under the three conditions
 of the past.   On the contrary, through the Fukien incident, every worker,
 every peasant, every soldier, every intellectual and anti-Japanese Chinese
 can see even more clearly that the soviet government, not in lip service
 but in actual deed, is willing to unite with all the armed forces which can
 truly resist Japn and oppose Chiang and strive for the independence, freedom
 and liberation of the Chinese nation.  All those who can truly resist Japan
 and oppose Chiang as well as all anti-imperialist and anti-Kuomintang forces
 can obtain strong guidance and support from the soviet government and
 Worker-Peasant Red Army but the soviet government and the Worker-Peasant
 Red Army will continue to attack and expose mercilessly all counterrevolu-
 tionary reformist factions which attempt to preserve imperialism and the
 Chinese landlord and bourgeois rule with empty promises and deceptive
 propaganda.

 Masses of all China!   The disastrous history of the Fukien People's Revolu-
 tionary Government pointed out again that only with your own brave,
 resolute struggle can you finally overthrow the rule of the imperialist
 Kuomintang and assure China's independence, freedom and territorial
 integrity. The victorious and successful experience of tens of millions
 of workers in the vast soviet areas of China tells you that only the soviet
 road can attain the national and social liberation of the masses nationwide!
 If you oppose the attacks of the imperialist Kuomintang against the soviet
 areas and safeguard the Chinese soviet, you are safeguarding the Chinese
 revolution and assuring your own victory!
 Anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist forces of all China unite!
 Smash the five "encirclement and suppression" of the imperialist Kuomintang!
 Down with Japanese and all imperialism!
 Down with the traitorous Nanking Kuomintang Government and all Kuomintang
 governments!
 Long live anti-imperialist soviet China!

 JUDICIAL PROCEDURE
 8 April 1934
 [Text]   By Order of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Soviet
 Republic No 5
 This is a proclamation of the promulgated judicial procedure of the Chinese
 Soviet Republic, 8 April 1934
 Mao Tse-tung, chairman
 Hsiang Ying, Chang Kuo-t'ao, vice chairmen
 In the situation of a civil war, the soviet courts, political security bureaus,
 committee for the suppression of counterrevolutionaries and other organs should
 adopt speedily resolute and correct methods to suppress counterrevolutionaries
 and guarantee the victory of the revolutionary people, and consolidate the
 soviet regime.   The following judicial procedures have, therefore, been
 specially set forth:
 1.   The special agent of the area Security Bureau, the area Procurator's
 Court, the area Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries
 (that is under the Revolutionary Committee of the new soviet areas), the
 People's Police, Labor courts all have the authority to arrest counter-
 revolutionaries and others who should be apprehended.   The law prohibiting
 the area from arresting a person without permission from higher levels
 should be abolished, and it is also set forth that when there is an emer-
 gency, the township and city soviets and the rural and urban revolutionary
 committees have the authority to arrest counterrevolutionaries and other
 important criminals provided they have received the support of the local
 revolutionary masses.  After apprehension they are to be handed over to
 counterrevolutionary suppression organizations of the area level.
 2.   The Procurator's Court and the Committee for the Suppression of Counter-
 revolutionaries of the soviet area have the authority to bring to trial and
 sentence all local criminals (counterrevolutionaries and others as well).

 At times of emergency mobilizations (such as the land inspection movement,
 the expansion of the Red Army and launching surprise attacks), the Procurator
 Department of the area, the area Committee for the Suppression of Counter-
 revolutionaries, with the support of the revolutionary people, have the right
 to apprehend criminals such as gentry and landlords in the new border areas,
 areas where the enemy is carrying out its offensives and, in areas where
 counterrevolution is especially active, have them executed immediately
 after they have been tried'.   After the sentence has been carried out,
 however, it must be reported to higher echelons for handling.
 3.   The procurator departments of the county and provincial levels, the
 c    Committee for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries, the preliminary
 level and higher courts of the military all have the authority to apprehend,
 bring to trial and sentence, as well as carrying out the sentencing (includ-
 ing the death sentence) of all criminals.
 4.   The state's bureaus of political security at various levels have the
 authority to pre-try all cases concerning counterrevolution.   They are to be
 handed over to the courts for handling afterward.   The security bureaus of
 the border areas and of the Red Army on the fronts have the authority to take
 direct action against enemy spying, against fascist imperialists, armed
 groups of bandits and counterrevolutionary landlords and gentry without going
 through the courts.   Emergency action may be taken by the State Political
 Security Bureau and its local bureaus, the branch bureau of the Red Army and
 the military zone in serious and urgent cases of counterrevolution.   If
 disputes arise between the local government and military and political
 leaders or other organizations after action was taken, the decision to decide
 the correctness or error of the action rests with the People's Committee and
 with the provincial presidium in areas which are not connected with the
 Central Soviet area.
 5.   The system of approval from higher levels is abolished and the system of
 reporting to higher echelons will be carried out instead.   Criminals are
 permitted to appeal if they are not satisfied with the sentence meted out.
 The period of appeal available will be 7 days at a maximum, beginning from
 the day the document of judgment is handed over to the defendant (verbal
 explanations must be given to illiterates).
 In areas under enemy attack and under other emergency situations, the right
 to appeal may be refused in cases of counterrevolutionaor landlords and
 gentry who have committed crimes.
 6.   It is hereby resolved that the soviet courts will function on a two-level
 system of preliminary hearings and final trials.   If preliminary hearings
 are held by the area, the county will carry out the final trial.  When the
 county is the one that carries out the preliminary hearings, the final trial
 will be held at the provincial level.   If the military courts happen to be
 the organs holding the preliminary hearings, then the final trial will be
 held by the Supreme Court.   In the structure of trial functions  the Supreme

 Court is the final organization.  All cases cannot be appealed after proceed-
 ing through these two trials and sentence passed.   But, should the procurator
 feel that there are points of disagreements after going through the two trials,
 he can protest against a judicial organization and have the case retried.
 7.   Except for those organizations so named in this functional system, no
 other organizations will have the authority to apprehend, bring to trial
 and pass judgment on any criminals.   Only emergency situations are the
 exceptions.
 8.   The judicial procedures set forth in the provisional procedures of mili-
 tary courts published on 1 February 1932, the provisional trial procedures
 and organizations of courts, published on 9 June 1932 and Ordinance No 6
 proclaimed by the Central Executive Committee on 16 December 1931 are here-

 [Text]   The basic organizations of the Soviet Government are the township and
 municipal soviets and they are the levels closest to the people.  They are the
 agencies which directly lead the people in carrying out the various tasks of
 the Soviet.
 In a Civil War, the work of mobilizing for war is very urgent and the liveli-
 hood of the masses needs to be improved.   It is of primary importance to go
 all out to improve the work at township and municipal soviets, strengthen
 the organization and leadership of these soviets so that they will be com-
 pletely suitable for developing the revolution and improving the livelihood
 of the people.
 The orientation of the work to improve the functions of township and municipal
 soviets should be directed at being most capable of contacting the masses,
 rousing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, mobilizing them to carry
 out the tasks of the soviets and expediting the, accomplishment of these tasks
 so that there will be complete coordination between the work of the Soviet,
 the revolution and the well-being of the masses.   This is the principle on
 which the work of the Soviet is based.   There are already many township
 soviets in our areas which are capable of meeting these basic requirements
 and they have created many good organizational structures and work methods.
 There are, however, many other townships which contravene these requirements
 in their work or have not completely complied with these requirements.   It
 is urgently necessary to clearly and concretely set forth regulations in
 the work of the township soviets based upon these requirements so that each
 township soviet functionary will have a uniform standard to work by.
 How shall the township soviets carry out their work?  They should be in
 accordance with the following regulations.
 A.   The Work of the Township Soviet Presidium
 1.   The presidium of a township should constitute seven members if large and
 five if small.   These are people elected by the Congress, only those who are
 most activist and capable should be elected.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 2.   The presidium is the supreme political organ of the entire township after
 the ending of the Congress.  It should resolutely implement the resolutions
 and instructions of Congress and higher level soviets, and directly lead the
 work of the entire township.
 3.   The presidium should know how to grasp the central task at each period
 and bring these tasks up for discussion at the Congress.   It should not busy
 itself with various minor matters and neglect the central task.
 4.   Meetings of the presidium must be well conducted, and the work of the
 standing members must be carried out with urgency and thoroughness.  There
 should be no phenomenon of laxness and laziness and commandism must be
 completely done away with.
 5.   The presidium must understand the situation of each village, the charac-
 teristics of each village and they must give their attention to the difficul-
 ties of the masses in each village and, in accordance with the actual situation
 prevailing in each village and its special characteristics, impel the work in
 order to resolve the difficult problems of the masses.
 6.   For rapid improvement in the work of each village, attention must be given
 to motivating the work of the chairman and vice chairman, the representative
 meetings of each village, the mass meetings, and the small group meetings
 under the leadership. of each member so that they all will be held promptly
 as scheduled and conducted properly.
 7.   The presidium must give attention to keeping the entire body of repre-
 sentatives, the various committees and the various mass organizations united
 and rally them around itself, motivating them to mobilizing the people of
 the entire township to carry out various tasks.  They should not become
 separated with the mass organizations, the representatives and the committees
 and leave only a few to do the job.
 8.  The leadership of the representatives meeting must be given careful
 attention, and the  'residium must have proper preparations made before they
 are held.
 9.  The presidium should meet every 5 days.  That is, the presidium must meet
 twice before and after the representatives meeting in the in-between periods,
 and the chairman of the township may be asked to attend.
 On the question of problems to be discussed at the meeting, at first it will
 mainly be discussions on how to inspire the chairmen and vice chairmen of the
 various villages as well as comrades of the Congress how to implement the
 work given to them earlier and carrying out the resolutions of the earlier
 Congress, and this meeting is best held 2 or 3 days after the next Congress.
 The meeting of the presidium has also had to contend with minor matters.
 Do not bring these trivial matters up for discussion at the next Congress.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 The meeting of the presidium should best be held after supper and should not
 last longer than 2 hours.
 10.  The presidium should have a system of division of labor and work should
 be assigned to those members who are not on the standing committee to spur
 the people of certain villages in carrying out certain types of work.
 The chairman of the presidium should naturally direct the work of the entire
 township, be the chairman of the presidium when it is in meeting, attend
 meetings convened by higher levels and manage daily routines.   He should
 grasp the central tasks assigned by higher echelon at certain periods of
 time (such as the expansion of the Red Army, the land inspection movement,
 elections, road construction, collecting land taxes, selling bonds, develop-
 ment of cooperatives and spring cultivation movement, etc.).   He should pay
 attention to routine work (such as the training of Red Youth Units, Red
 Martial Law, food grains, education, public health and preferential treatment
 of members of Red Army families).   He should also be careful of special
 situations arising in his own village (such as famine, plague epidemics,
 floods and counterrevolutionary activities, etc.).  He should constantly
 think about these problems and tasks, how such work should be done in the
 villages, which village is falling behind in its work and should be prodded
 and aid given.   He should divide the paper work with his vice chairman and
 also have a division of labor in attending the meetings of the various
 villages and gathering good experiences gained in each piece of work done
 in a village and the poor performance observed.   These are to be presented
 at the meeting of the presidium or reported at the meeting of Congress
 contributing material for the Congress to discuss (when that problem is on
 discussion).  Attending the meetings of the various mass meetings held by
 the villages, by various mass organizations and committees should also be
 delegated by the chairman of the presidium.
 The vice chairman should share the paper work with the chairman, attending
 the meetings of the various villages, and assign to himself the work of one
 or two villages.   He must be thoroughly capable of motivating and collecting
 materials and return to make a report.   He is also required to understand
 the work of the entire township so that when the chairman is absent he can
 work on behalf of the chairman.  A permanent vice chairman must help the
 chairman with the daily routine and also frequently attend the meetings of
 the various committees and mass organizations.
 The paper work consists of processing census and land ledgers, registration
 of marriages, births and deaths, various investigation reports, writing up
 reports to the area soviet, allocating transportation labor, sending notices
 to various villages, writing up travel permits, helping members of Red Army
 families write letters, reading documents from higher levels to those
 chairmen and vice chairmen who are illiterate, underscore the important
 parts when reading documents at presidium and congress meetings, keep
 minutes of the meetings, and remind the chairman and vice chairmen on those
 areas where they have neglected to give their attention.   The secretary
 should also attend the meetings of the presidiums and mass organizations and
 if he is a representative he should participate in the presidium.

 11.   The examination and education of representatives should be matter the
 presidium should give its attention to.  Among the representatives, there
 will be some who are activists in their work and some who are apathetic and
 go slow. The model work of the activists should be set forth as models for
 those workers with pessimistic outlooks.   These pessimists must be criticized.
 Some should be named in the representative meetings so as to rouse the others
 to struggle against them.   Educate the entire body of representatives in this
 manner, so as to transform the pessimists into activists.
 There are some to whom being elected representatives is their first experience
 and do not know how to go about their work.  They must be taught carefully
 how the work is to be done.   Those who have often undergone education through
 criticism and struggle and still do not show any change or progress (such as
 after 1 or 2 months being unable to accomplish the tasks given them, or even
 deliberately staying away from meetings 5 or 6 consecutive times) should be
 brought to the attention of the Congress and resolution passed to expel
 them and substituting alternate members.   It would be incorrect not to expel
 such worthless members and have them replaced.  After reassignment of a repre-
 sentative engaged in certain work, he should also be immediately replaced.
 Investigations should also be made to see whether landlord, rich peasant and
 counterrevolutionary elements fraudulently pose as representatives to sabotage
 our Soviet.   They should be immediately expelled. It is even more necessary
 to apprehend and punish counterrevolutionaries.
 12.   Inspectors at sentry points and transportation of the township soviet
 may be selected from the three methods defined as follows:  Appoint someone
 permanently to the post.  He will have to rely on his own rations, but will
 be exempt from various duties.  Also, dispatch people to help with the
 family's farming.   Or dispatch personnel from the Young Pioneer units on a
 rotational basis.   They will be notified the evening of the previous day to
 take up their work the next morning.   They shall return home to eat their
 meals, but no help will be dispatched to assist with the farming.   Or, send
 one person to stay permanently on site with the residents providing the
 meals through monetary contributions.   Each area will decide on their own
 which method to select.   The first method will be the best.  Young comrades
 should be selected in all cases for the post of transportation and sentry
 point personnel.   These people must be highly intelligent and should be
 literate.   They should be given training in their work.
 B.   The Functions of the Congress
 1.   The township congress is the highest organ of political power in the
 township.   Leadership of Congress is of extreme importance because from the
 discussions held in Congress emerge the implementation of all laws and
 policies of the Soviet and the accomplishment of various tasks of the Soviet.

 2.   Generally, congresses are held every 10 days.   It should be held in the
 evening when farm work is busy.   The duration of the meeting should be 2 hours
 at the most, and not to exceed 3 hours.
 Each meeting should be divided into the period for reporting and the period
 for discussions.   The chairman and participants from the area Soviet will each
 make a 10-minute report.   If there are too many, it should be brought up during
 the period of discussion.   In discussions about work done in their own
 villages, after the village chairman makes his report for several minutes, if
 there are many points to be reported they may be taken up during the period
 for discussions.   In special work investigative meetings more time should
 be given to the various village chairmen to make their reports.  The reports
 must contain factual materials and proposals.  Reports made up of empty talk
 will be abolished.
 3.   Each Congress will have but one principal matter for discussion.   There
 may be one or two problems of secondary importance.  A greater part of the
 meeting should be devoted to the discussion of the major problem, and less
 time given to the secondary problems.   If several problems of great importance
 are brought up for discussion every time then the meeting will wind up without
 any results.
 4.   Discussions of problems must be on a practical basis.   For instance, a
 discussion of spring cultivation should include such subjects as "the develop-
 ment of labor mutual help cooperatives," "development of plow oxen coopera-
 tives," "how the land cultivation troop should give preferential treatment
 to the families of Red Army members," "increasing fertilizers," "more plowing
 and more raking," "reclaim wasteland and mountains," "repair embankments,
 ponds and water-wheels," "planting of cotton," "planting more or less
 glutinous rice," "planting more vegetables" and others.  These discussions
 must be based on the actual situation prevailing in the villages.  Precise
 methods must be set forth for each item discussed.
 For example, on "developing the labor cooperatives," estimates must be made
 on how many more people can be expanded in the entire township now, set a
 total figure and, in accordance with the actual situation of the villages,
 set forth how many more people should each village include.   Then. this
 task should be handed over to the chairmen and vice chairmen of the villages
 to take back with them.   In accordance with the number of residents under
 the jurisdiction, each representative makes actual allocations.  And a period
 for the task to be accomplished must also be set.   In discussions, each item
 must be taken separately.  Proceed to the second item after the first item
 has been discussed and concluded, with the conclusions of these discussions
 deemed to be resolutions and recorded in the registry, to facilitate inspec-
 tion during.the next meeting and so that the presidium will be able to spur
 the people.   Incompleted discussions will be continued at the next meeting.
 At the second spring farming meeting, the resolutions made at the earlier
 meeting should be examined.  When examining a certain item, the various
 chairmen of the villages should report the actual situation, the reasons for
 258

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 completing or not completing certain tasks with-the main idea of searching
 out experiences and lessons for the various representatives to study.  After
 such an examination, continue with the discussions of new problems of the
 spring plowing.   Criticism should be made in the light of the circumstances
 of those representatives and village chairmen who were discovered not to have
 completed their tasks so as to alert them.   In the discussion of other
 matters this example should be followed.
 Many of the township representatives' meetings are not thorough in their
 discussions of problems and neglect to shift out the minor items from the
 bigger problems, or make a general discussion of all the problems without
 going through them one by one.   This causes people to return from these
 meetings without any clear-cut understanding of the resolutions made.  At
 these meetings, discussions are made without any regard to the actual situa-
 tion and characteristics of the various villages.  Nor are quotas set for
 each village (this is with regard to those cases where quantity has to be
 set).   Regulations were not set forth when the task was to be completed.
 Village chairmen were not charged with assigning definite tasks to the
 various representatives when they returned to their villages, to see to
 it that they were completed and encouraging them to do so.
 In setting tasks for certain villages with particular characteristics (for
 example, requiring certain village to dig ponds), they will not make it a
 special point to ask the representatives of a certain village "Do you think
 it is right to regulate it so?"  But they pass this as a general resolution.
 Resolutions were discussed by only certain township soviets.   In many
 meetings, these resolutions were not brought forth for examination.   Even when
 examined, the reasons for success or failure of each household or village
 were not settled.  Nor were those representatives and village chairmen who
 were dragging their feet criticized.  What is the use of such examinations
 and discussions, then?  They are empty of substance, bureaucratic and a waste
 of time that cannot accomplish the mission of the Soviet.   Taking an attitude
 of peace toward those pessimists and feet-draggers will cause the Congress to
 lose its vitality.  It will be unable to encourage those representatives of
 backward families and villages to lead the masses and work hard to reach the
 level of advanced families and villages.  This is wrong.
 5.   For a Congress to be successful, preparations made by the presidium must
 be good.  What was said before about the presidium requiring to hold a
 meeting before the representative meeting and make careful preparations on
 the reports and problems to be presented at the next meeting is indispensable.
 The preparation work is the special responsibility of the chairman and the
 vice chairman and secretary must assist him.
 6.   In many instances, chairmen presiding over the meetings were elected on
 the spur of the moment.   In some areas it is incorrectly regulated that members
 of the presidium should not be elected.   The presiding chairman should be the
 permanently assigned functionary.   The chairman of the township soviet would
 be best, because only he is knowledgeable about the entire township.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 7.   A roll call shall be made at every representative meeting.   Those who are
 absent shall be so marked on the name list.   The presidium should have a list
 of the representatives, names, sex, age and class element, in accordance with
 each household and village.
 C.   The Structure and Function of the Village
 1.   The village is the core of the work of the township.   The presidium of
 the township soviet should give its entire attention to the organization and
 leadership of the village.
 2.   It is imperative that all townships which have not delimited villages
 should do so.   Some townships may be delimited to two and some to three
 villages, while other big townships may divide into four or five villages.
 This delimiting shall be based upon actual situation.   Generally, in dividing
 the area into villages, the smaller they are the better they will be, because
 big areas cannot be easily directed.
 3.   The village shall have one chairman and one vice chairman, who will be
 elected at the representatives meeting of the township.   Electees should be
 the most capable and most activist of the representatives.   In a village
 with only a few families (a small village), the chairman and vice chairman
 should not be from the same family.
 The village chairman has the responsibility to oversee the work of the entire
 village and the vice chairman is to help him.
 (Note:)   In cases of chairmen and vice chairmen who have an inadequate labor
 force in their families, the township soviet may designate aid be given them
 by the masses during the'busy farming season in the form of pro-rated labor
 in order to make up for their time spent (more than the other representatives)
 in their endeavors to accomplish the tasks of the Soviet.
 Should the people agree, full preferential treatment may be given the village
 chairman so that he can devote his entire time to the tasks and seek benefits
 for the masses of the entire village.
 4.   Generally, the village chairman will hold a meeting of all of the represen-
 tatives every 10 days (for instance, if there are 15 representatives in the
 village, these 15 will be called to the meeting).  When work is busy these
 meetings may be called every 5 days.   In examining the work of the repre-
 sentatives, discuss how to accomplish the tasks given to the village by the
 township congress in accordance with the characteristics of each family or
 household.   Resolve minor disputes and problems of mutual.help among the
 village residents, prepare reports for the mass meetings to be held by the
 village and give impetus to the work of the village committee.
 5.   Village representatives meeting of this kind should be scheduled by the
 township soviet's presidium.   It is best to schedule meetings to be held
 between the two representatives meetings, but closer to the latter.   For
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 example, there are three villages in a certain township and the township repre-
 sentatives meetings are to be held on the 5th and the 15th.   The schedule can
 be set for the first village to hold its meeting on the eleventh, the second
 on the twelfth and the third on the thirteenth.   Then, standing committee
 members, especially the chairman, of the township soviet will be able to
 attend these village meetings.   If the meeting is to be held once every
 5 days, then they can be scheduled to be held once several days after the
 first township soviet meeting and once several days before the next repre-
 sentative meeting of the township soviet.  These meetings are mainly for
 examining and directing work, and for the village chairman to make this report
 on the results of the examinations at the next township congress.
 6.   Set up a system of a division of labor among the representatives in giving
 leadership to the masses.   For instance, a certain village has 15 repre-
 sentatives and 500 residents.   Divide these 500 people into 15 divisions in
 accordance with the distances of the representatives' residences to them and
 assign one representative over the people of one division.   This should not
 be done by averaging  but should be in accordance with the locations of the
 households, the strength and weaknesses of the representative and by assign-
 ing to them a suitable number of people.  There can be as many as 50 to 60
 to a representative, and as few as 30 or 40.
 This method of dividing work among the representatives will place responsi-
 bilities on all of the representatives.   Each representative shall, in
 clearly distinguished spheres, lead the masses in the work of the Soviet
 (such as supervising the score or so people working under him in spring
 farming, propagandizing a dozen or so of the activists among his group to
 join the Red Army, participating in cooperatives, supervising children in
 the day schools, encouraging adults to attend night schools, encouraging
 each family to sweep their houses and clean their sewers to maintain hygiene,
 taking a dozen or so people to hold mass meetings,.heep surveillance on the
 activities of landlords and rich peasants, etc.).   He should solicit the
 ideas of the masses and speedily bring them to the attention of the village
 and township representatives' meetings, speedily resolve difficulties and
 prbblems of the masses.   To date, however, there are some areas where such
 a system of division of labor among the representatives has not been
 implemented.   This system should be put into effect immediately.
 (Note:)  The village chairman should have a ledger in which the population
 of the village, the area of land available in the village, the number of
 Red youth'troops, the  quantity of food grains (the total quantity available,
 how many families have surpluses and how many are deficient) and other
 necessary items.   Each representative should also have a list of names of
 the people under their jurisdictions.
 7.   Each of the representatives must call meetings of those dozen or so people
 under their jurisdiction, examine the situation of the Soviet work done by
 each family, discuss the work currently to be done, report articles of
 competition, the township soviet's resolutions, collect proposals from the
 people and report them at the village or township congresses. Such meetings
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 will take the form of informal talks with the representative as the chairman
 of the meeting.   One hour will be enough time for the meeting and it should
 be held when everybody has leisure to do so.
 Such meetings should be scheduled once every 10 days, and the units under
 the jurisdiction of the representatives of the entire village may also hold
 their meetings on the same day.   Should a representative group by unable to
 hold the meeting with due cause they should be made responsible to hold it on
 another day.   The chairman of the township soviet convened the chairmen of
 the various villages and make up a schedule so that there will be no con-
 flicts between village, township and other meetings.  When this type of
 meeting is held, the masses should be directed to launch criticisms of each
 other.   For instance, is a family receiving a deserter and refusing
 to return him to his unit, or is a certain family failing to put its best
 efforts in the spring plowing, or is a household apathetic toward helping
 families of Red Army members cultivate their lands?  If a family is neglect-
 ing its aged members, neglecting to encourage its children in their studies
 and not maintaining a hygienic standard. they should be criticized.   Soviet
 resolutions can be very rapidly spread to the masses through such meetings,
 accelerating the work of the Soviet, rapidly improving the well-being of the
 people and heightening the fervor of the spirit of mass struggles.
 Besides attending such meetings, each representative must make time to visit
 individual households under his jurisdiction to check on whether they have
 any problems that require resolving, whether they have carried out the
 resolutions of the Soviet.   The first of these visits should be made on
 families of Red Army members and on the poorest people in the village.
 Visits should also be paid to households of landlords and rich peasants in
 order to observe whether they are committing anything improper.
 The small unit meetings and household visits of representatives should be
 directed by the village chairman who will have that responsibility.   From
 these observations the quality of the work of the representative can be
 evaluated.
 8.   The mass meeting of the village has the highest potential to educate the
 masses, mobilize them to carry out the tasks of the Soviet and enhance the
 spirit of struggle among them. It should be regarded as an important method
 to mobilize and educate the masses.   In many places not much attention is
 given to convening such mass meetings and this is incorrect.
 In such village mass meetings, reports are made on resolutions passed by
 the township soviet, the revolutionary competition that is being carried
 out between villages ahd households and explaining the revolutionary tasks
 set forth by higher level soviets so that after the masses have completely
 understood them these tasks could be carried out with all-out effort.
 A bi-monthly schedule should be set for such mass meetings by the township
 soviet for the various villages and notifying the village chairman.  Do not

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 let these meetings conflict with others.   So that the township soviet will be
 able to dispatch personnel to participate, do not hold these village mass
 meetings on the same day.
 In villages where the populace is concentrated in one household, the entire
 village will be considered as one unit in holding such meetings, and the
 village chairman will preside.   The majority of the villages in the soviet
 areas, however, have two or more households, and the meetings should be
 divided into two divisions so that everybody, men, women, old and young can
 attend.   The village chairman and the vice chairman will each preside over
 one of the meetings.   There should be proper preparations made before holding
 such meetings.  How to aid the various representatives to get the majority
 of the masses to attend the mass meetings, what to report at these meetings
 and how to lead the masses to voice their opinions--these must be discussed
 and agreed upon at the village congress.  These mass meetings should not
 exceed 2 hours, and they  must be held when the majority of the masses have
 nothing else to do.
 Mass meetings at the township level should not be held for good cause, such
 as memorial days or festival days.   The work of mobilizing the masses and
 educating them must be done mainly through utilizing the mass meetings of the
 small unit type under the jurisdiction of the representative or the village
 mass meetings.
 D.   The Committees of the Villages and the Township
 1.   Below the township, soviet committees administrating various special
 tasks to aid the township soviet should be organized.  Activists among the
 masses should join the committees as members and each representative of the
 township soviet should participate in one or two committees and play a
 leadership role in them.   The committee system must be regarded as one of
 the principal means to maintain liaison with the masses and propel forward
 the work of the Soviet.   Make haste to organize such committees in those
 areas where there are none.
 2.   Some committees are constantly being organized, such as those for the
 expansion of the Red Army, for giving preferential treatment and comfort
 to the Red Army, for maintaining alerts, for defense against air attacks
 and poisons, for agricultural production (such as spring and summer culti-
 vation, fall harvesting and winter plowing), for education in production,
 for forestry and water conservancy, for investigation and registration, for
 education, for health, for roads and bridges, for food grains, for State
 properties (in townships where there are State properties) and for worker-
 peasant surveillance.   All these committees always have work to do.
 Some of the committees are organized for temporary purposes, such as land
 inspection, confiscation and levies, land tax collections, selling bonds,
 land reclamation and elections.   These committees are temporary in nature,
 and they are no longer required after the work has been done.   The next
 time such work has to be done, these committees are again organized.   The
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 committees for land inspection, confiscation and levies are also no longer re-
 quired after the land problem has been thoroughly resolved.
 3.   Some committees should only be at township level.   Others (such as
 committees for the expansion of the Red Army, for the preferential treatment
 of the Red Army, for education in production, for spring cultivation, for
 forestry and water conservancy, for education and health) need to expand
 into the villages.   Only when the villages have such committees can the
 tasks be easily popularized and intensified.
 4.   In accordance with the nature of the committee, the personnel could range
 from as few as five to as many as seven or nine persons. Do not overstaff.  As
 for committees which exist at both village and township levels (such as the
 spring cultivation committee) five members will be enough for each of the
 village and township committees, while the chairman of the village committee
 is permitted to be a member of the township committee.
 5.   At the township level, the chairman and members of the committees should
 be elected at the township congress after the presidium has prepared a list
 and presented it.   At the village level, the village chairman will prepare
 a list and have it passed at the village congress.
 6.   The most activist comrade must be found to head the committee, and the
 presidium must educate the various chairmen how to carry out the work and
 supervise them to convene their own meetings on schedule and inspect their
 work.   Chairmen who dragged their feet must be impeached and replaced with
 a new chairman.
 7.   Preparations must be made beforehand by the chairman when holding his
 own meeting, ensuring that every meeting will achieve results.  After the
 meeting, each committee member must be assigned a task and told how to
 accomplish it.   At the next meeting they must be made to report on the task
 performed.   Committee members who drag their feet will be dismissed and
 others will replace them.
 8.   A new election of the committees should be held usually every 6 months.
 In these elections retain the activists and eliminate the feet draggers.
 9.   There should be a division of labor within the presidium of the township
 soviet so that the members will be able to participate in the meetings of
 the various committees at the township level.   The best means of doing
 this is for each member of the presidium to have several committees under
 his jurisdiction.   For example, the chairman will have jurisdiction over the
 committees for military affairs and finances (such as the committees for
 expanding the Red Army, for giving comfort to the Red Army, for the Red
 military alert, for defense against air attacks and poisons, for collecting
 land taxes, for selling bonds, for the confiscation of land and levying and
 the protection of State properties, etc.).   The vice chairman will have
 jurisdiction over economic matters (such as committees for the preferential
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 treatment of Red Army, spring cul.t:i.vation, forestry, water conservancy, food
 grains, roads and bridges and education in production, etc.).   The secretary
 may take over other areas of responsibilities (education, health, worker-
 peasant inspection, investigation and registration, etc.).  At the presidium
 meeting it will be resolved what duties each would be assigned and materials
 for the meetings collected so that the reports may be made at the meeting.
 When committee meetings are held, the township committee chairmen must attend
 the meetings of the committees under their jurisdictions (such as the chair-
 man of the township educational committee attending the village committee
 meeting on education).   The chairman and vice chairman of the village committee
 should also make a division of labor and take part.
 1.0.   The schedules of the meetings of the various committees of the townships
 and the villages should be set up by the township presidium in accordance
 with the priorities of the work to be done at different periods, such as more
 meetings of the spring farming committee should be held in the spring time,
 but when winter comes, the winter plowing committee could slacken their
 schedule of meetings.   Each meeting should not last more than 2 1/2 hours.
 E.   The Liaison Between the Township Soviet and the Mass Organizations
 1.   More attention and aid should be given to the various mass organizations
 of the township (such as the trade unions, poor peasants groups, women
 workers and peasants congress, the anti-imperialist alliance to support the
 Soviet, mutual help associations, youth groups, labor mutual help coopera-
 tives, plow cooperatives and various types of cooperatives such as the con-
 sumers co-ops, production co-ops, food co-ops and credit unions, baby-care
 centers, the association to eliminate illiteracy, the committee for the move-
 ment to gain literacy and clubs, etc.) rely on their efforts to mobilize
 the broad masses to complete the various revolutionary tasks.
 The township soviet has full responsibilities for those organizations which
 have no higher levels, such as the poor peasant groups, the women worker-
 peasant congress, labor mutual help associations, plow-oxen cooperatives
 and child-care centers.   It must inspect their work periodically and provide
 them with full leadership.   Should it find errors in the work of these
 organizations, discussion should be held speedily anti the errors corrected.
 The township soviet has the responsibility to help them resolve difficulties
 ?   regardless of the nature of the organizations.
 2.   The responsible person for the organization whose work is being discussed
 ?   by the township soviet and the representatives meeting should be invited to
 attend the meeting and when meetings are being held by these organizations,
 the township soviet should also dispatch personnel to participate.   This
 holds true with regard to the village congress and village mass organizations.
 Consultations should be held by the township soviet's presidium with the
 responsible persons of the various mass organizations when schedules of
 meetings are being worked out so that there will be no conflicts of meetings
 at the village and township levels.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 3.   The township soviet must give its attention to giving leadership to the
 Red Guards and the Young Pioneer units so that all young men and women and
 adults will be participating in these town units.  The majority of them must
 be made to participate in village and township trainings so that there will
 be progress daily.  Dispatch personnel to participate in their cadres'
 meeting.
 F.   Revolutionary Competition and Commando Units
 1.   In order to attain quality and speed in the work of the Soviet so that it
 will be done well and with speed, the method or revolutionary competition and
 the organization of commando units should be put into effect in every town-
 ship and village.
 2.   Regardless of whether it originated from higher levels or launched by the
 village themselves, revolutionary competition must first be discussed at the
 township congress and reported at the meetings of the people at village
 levels and at small units level.  When it concerns a certain mass organization
 it must also be reported at the meeting of that organization, so that there
 will be clear understanding and acceptance by each and every one of the
 representatives and the people.   Only by having every one understand and accept
 it can they be made to shoulder their responsibilities and ignite their
 revolutionary zeal and put their efforts into the work, thereby carrying out
 the work in a fast and better manner and completing the work as required by
 the competition or even ahead of schedule.  All methods of commandism and
 coercion must be abolished in this regard.
 3.   The competition of each item of work is not ended by merely discussing
 and reporting about it.  A very close inspection must also be carried out.
 Each representative examines each household, the chairman and vice chairman
 of the villages examine the representatives.   The presidium of the township
 soviet and the Congress will examine the chairmen and vice chairmen of the
 villages.   If such examinations are not carried out some person, representa-
 tive, village household, will do the work haphazardly and will not be able
 to complete the work assigned as scheduled, or even though they meet the
 quota the quality will be poor..  The system of examination is a very important
 method to achieve speed and quality in the work of the soviet.  Decisions
 without examinations is but as bureaucratic way of leadership, and it is as
 harmful as coercion.
 4.   In each of these competition events discussions shall be made at the
 village and township congress when the period set is over, distinctions will
 be made between the superior and the inferior performers, the superior
 performance will be rewarded while the inferior one will be criticized.
 5.   A commando unit consisting of from five to seven persons may be organized
 in each village in order to attain speed and quality in the work of the
 Soviet.   Select on a voluntary basis comrades from among the representatives
 and the masses those who are activists and have the capability to work to
 participate in these commando units, with each village having a leader of a
 commando unit.  Members should not be selected from the same household.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Work of the commando unit will be done in two ways.  The first kind will be for
 the member of one household to do commando work in the other (such as member
 of household A going to household B and vice versa).   But the emphasis will
 be to have members of advanced household going to the more backward ones.
 The other kind is within the sphere of the township, with commando units of
 one village going to another village to do commando work (village A going
 to village B) and it should primarily be on the basis of units from progres-
 sive villages going to more backward ones to do commando work.  Doing commando
 work is not to cuss at other people but to help with the work that is being
 done there, teaching them better ways so that the work there will improve
 rapidly and educating them in the work methods of the more advanced villages
 and households.
 -A unit leader in overall command of the commando units will be appointed under
 the township soviet presidium who will administer all the units and who will
 have the authority to deploy the commando units of the various villages.
 The presidium should call periodical meetings of commanders of village
 and township commando units to examine their work and tell them how to go
 about their work.   These units' leaders will then convene meetings of
 commando units members and give them training.   The presidium should also
 convene all of the members of the commando units on a monthly or bi-monthly
 basis to train them.
 G.   On the Leadership Exercised by the District Soviet Over the Township
 Soviet
 The district soviet must direct the township soviet to implement all of the
 aforementioned items accordingly, explaining these items to the comrades of
 the township soviet so that they will have full understanding.   Spot checks
 will be made on whether the township soviets are carrying out the afore-
 mentioned items as described.  More frequent explanations and assistants
 must be given, especially toward those township soviets whose work is
 falling behind.   Examinations of the district soviet's work by higher
 echelon will be based upon whether the district soviet has given thorough
 leadership to the various townships under its jurisdiction in implementing
 the aforementioned items to realize the best in quality and speed in the
 various tasks set by the Soviet.

 DECLARATION OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON 1 MAY LABOR DAY
 April 1934
 [Text]  Workers and Peasants of the Entire Soviet Areas!
 This year's "May Day" falls on a day when we are carrying out a merciless and
 decisive campaign against the fifth "encirclement and suppression" of the
 imperialist Kuomintang!
 Two-thirds of the regular Kuomintang troops throughout the country, the main
 force of Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit chieftain of all fascist imperialists,
 comprised of 66 divisions, 8 independent brigades, constituting more than
 700,000 White troops, are attacking our central Soviet areas!
 On all the battle lines of the front, Kuomintang planes and artillery are
 bombarding us, their machine guns and rifles are enfilading us with fire,
 their blockhouses are blockading us and they are carrying out inhuman burning
 and killings.   They want to drown our worker-peasant soviet regime in a sea
 of blood!
 However, this type of frenzied and hopeless attacks launched by the imperial-
 ist Kuomintang cannot frighten the courageous Red Army on the front lines and
 make the worker-peasant masses in the entire Soviet areas lose hope.  On the
 contrary, it further increases the anger and heightened the determination of
 every Red fighter and every worker and peasant to struggle on.   Tens of
 thousands of worker-peasant masses have been engulfed in the flood of parti-
 cipation in the war, pledging to fight to the very end in defense of the
 Soviet regime.
 The fifth campaign is an even more merciless and prolonged campaign than any
 others.   It is a war determining the survival or death of the Kuomintang
 landlord bourgeoisie or the political pow"r of the workers and peasants.   It
 is possible to achieve final victory only by mobilizing all of the worker-
 peasant masses in the entire Soviet areas and vigorously participate in this
 campaign!

 On May Day of this year the Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic
 calls'upon every one of the workers and peasants in the entire Soviet areas
 to arm themselves and join the Red Army!  Join the Red Guards, the Young
 Pioneers, Model Red Youth Units and guerrilla units!  Wage a decisive war
 with the enemy attacking us,
 Comrades of the members of the model Red youth units who took part in the
 armed review made during Red May have enlisted in the Red Army by entire
 battalions and regiments to struggle to the end and smash the enemy's fight
 encirclement and suppression campaign!
 Defend every inch of our Soviet areas by launching guerrilla warfare on a
 massive scale so as to confuse him, encircle him, tire him out, strike at
 him and destroy him thereby helping our Red Army and in coordination with
 them win a decisive victory!   Only victory through armed struggle--primarily
 by destroying the main force of the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek--can
 we be assured of the freedom of land possession, the 8-hour work system,
 and all revolutionary rights given to us by the Soviet revolution.  Only
 through victory attained by armed struggle can we ultimately overthrow the
 rule of imperialist Kuomintang and establish a nationwise Chinese soviet
 regime and finally be emancipated from under the iron heels of the landlord
 bourgeoisie!
 Worker-peasant masses in the rear areas!   Let's pool all our resources in
 order to assure the ration supply of our Red Army.  Let every worker and
 peasant save 3 sheng of rice to help the Red Army, plant more vegetables
 and raise more pigs for the Red fighters fighting on the fronts!   Let us
 complete as speedily as possible the selling of construction bonds, collect
 and transport our rations where they are needed, economize on all expendi-
 tures in the rear areas, save every penny and struggle for victory on the
 front lines!
 The masses of workers and peasants in all the areas of the soviets!  We are
 facing a battle to the death.  Let us smash the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" of the imperialist Kuomintang with our iron fists and the unified
 and powerful will of the worker-peasant masses to win victory throughout
 soviet China!   The soviet road is the only pathway leading to liberation
 for all exploited people and oppressed nations.
 Long Live "May 1" Labor Day!
 Long Live the Soviet New China!

 [Text] On 17 April, the Foreign Ministry of Imperialist
 Japan published its note to the big powers regarding their
 China policy.   Since then, the imperialist countries,
 from the viewpoint of their interests in their spheres
 of influence in China, have made known opinions express-
 ing dissatisfaction.   Immediately, the Kuomintang Nanking
 government also published treasonous comments of the most
 shameless nature.
 In order to secure the views of the Central Government of
 the Chinese Soviet Republic on this matter, the reporter
 of this paper made a special visit to interview Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung.   The following is the conversation that
 ensued.
 The recent note of the Japanese Foreign Ministry is the clearest indication
 of Japanese imperialism's plan to gain sole control of China.   In this note,
 Japanese imperialism has openly defined China as a Japanese protectorate.
 It has directly set forth its policy of protecting, with the force of arms,
 Japan's monopoly of all military, political and economic matters in China.
 This plan of Japanese imperialism is to directly suppress  the  Chinese
 Revolution with its own powers in the course of gaining sole control, and
 completely colonize China, as well as to create an even more consolidated
 rear defense area so as to launch a war against the Soviet Union.
 Although this plan of Japanese imperialism met with the opposition of other
 imperialist countries, the true intent of this opposition is limited to their
 unwillingness to see Japan gain sole control of China and their desire to
 have China divided up by international imperialism and become the "open door"
 common colony of all. With regard to the direct suppression of China's
 revolution and the strengthening of the rear area defense for the war against
 the Soviet Union, the various imperialist countries are naturally in complete
 accord with Japan.

 The traitorous Kuomintang Government of China behaves in the most shameless
 and pitiful manner.   On the 19th, the spokesman of the Kuomintang Nanking
 government published a vile and base statement in which it held that it is
 the "natural obligation" of the Kuomintang Government to "propose international
 cooperation in order to achieve international peace and security."  That is to
 say, to propose the joint partition of China by international imperialism
 and to guarantee the security of international imperialism's interests in
 China.
 Of course, the Kuomintang truly "never had the desire to harm any nation,"
 and it is even more true that it entertains no idea of disturbing the peace
 of Asia."  The Kuomintang explains carefully to Japan:   "The procurement of
 military supplies (such as military aircraft) and the employment of foreign
 military training officers and experts are only for national defense needs,
 and they are mostly for maintaining domestic peace and order."
 Nevertheless, the fact is such that not a single penny of the loans obtained
 from the various countries of Britain, France, America and Italy, nor a
 single bullet from the equipment bought from these countries, has been used
 by the Kuomintang to oppose Japanese imperialism's aggression in Manchuria
 and North China and British and French violent and forceful occupation of
 Tibet.   The Kuomintang has always adopted an attitude of compromise and
 capitulation toward imperialist aggression that does not even come near to
 anything like national defense.
 What is actually meant by the Kuomintang's so-called "maintaining domestic
 order and peace" is the suppression of the worker-peasant revolutionary
 movement in China and, especially, the offensive against the Soviet areas
 and the Worker-Peasant Red Army.
 Chiang Kai-shek, the arch criminal of national betrayal, deployed 70 percent
 of his regular troops in Kiangsi Province to carry out its fifth "encirclement
 and suppression."  This is exactly an expression of the Kuomintang's loyalty
 to imperialism, playing the role of street sweeper for imperialism in dividing
 up China.
 The Kuomintang has specifically underscored this point in its explanation
 to Japan.   The Kuomintang went a step further to announce that "If existing
 unequal matters can be rectified, improvements may be made in Sino-Japanese
 relations, thereby preserving the common interests of the two countries."
 This is ample expression of the slavish nature of the Kuomintang running
 dog.   The Kuomintang made such a shameless, tail-wagging announcement to
 the Japanese to gain their sympathy because it was fearful of not being able
 to efficiently discharge its duties as a dog and being unable to please
 every one of its owners.
 The Soviet Central Government, representing the hard-working worker-peasant
 masses of China and the Worker-Peasant Red Army, resolutely opposes
 Japanese imperialism's plan to gain sole control of China and points out the
 Kuomintang's plot to guide imperialism toward a common partitioning of China.

 In order tQ achieve freedom and liberation for the nation and society, the
 masses of Chinese workers and peasants must rise as one and, under the
 leadership of the Soviet regime, smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 of the Soviet Red Army by the imperialist Kuomintang.  This is the only way
 to obstruct the path to complete colonization of China, and wrest victory
 for the Soviet new China.

 DECLARATION OF THE CHINESE WORKER-PEASANT RED ARMY ON ITS INTENTION TO
 MARCH NORTH TO COMBAT JAPANESE AGGRESSION
 15 July 1934
 [Text]  Workers, peasants, soldiers and all revolutionary people in the
 country!
 The devilish Japanese imperialists have swallowed up our three eastern pro-
 vinces (Heilungkiang, Kirin and Liaoning), invaded and occupied Jehol and
 Inner Mongolia.   Now they have again seized our entire North China.   In
 South China, Japanese imperialism is planning the direct occupation of
 Fukien Province with the use of big naval guns and their army, navy and
 air forces.   It intends to transform all China into a colony and turn the
 people of China into colonial slaves, to forever suffer the butchery of
 Japanese bandits and to be raped, exploited and ravaged by them!
 The warlords of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek and Chang Hsueh-liang and
 others, have always adopted an attitude of surrender and betrayal in dealing
 with Japanese imperialist aggression.   They sold'out the three eastern
 provinces, Jehol  and Inner Mongolia.   Now they are directly trafficking
 with "Manchukuo," recognizing that entity and selling out all of North China
 and Fukien Province.  They are helping Japanese imperialism to suppress the
 Chinese anti-Japanese movement, the boycott of Japanese goods and the
 guerrilla warfare waged by the anti-Japanese Volunteer Army.  Under the
 pretext of "no strength to oppose Japan," they amassed over a million
 soldiers from all over China, expended 100 million silver yuan and used all
 the planes and artillery they have to launch endless "encirclements" against
 the only anti-Japanese, anti-imperialist Soviet government of the workers
 and peasants and the Worker-Peasant Red Army.   All these testify that the
 Kuomintang warlords are the loyalist of the running dogs of Japanese
 imperialism.   The Kuomintang warlords are the biggest traitors and national
 betrayers in the history of China.
 In dealing with the non-stop aggression of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese
 Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army have repeatedly called on

 the people of China to arm and oppose Japanese imperialist aggression with
 national revolutionary warfare.   They openly declared war and issued emergency
 mobilization orders for war against Japan to mobilize the people in the en-
 tire Soviet area and prepare them to directly fight against Japanese
 imperialism.   The Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army have
 repeatedly proclaimed to the people of China that under the three conditions
 of:
 1)   Cease all attacks against Soviet areas and the Red Army;
 2)   Cede to the people the initial powers toward democratic rights--the
 freedom of speech, publication, assembly and association and the freedom to
 strike and demonstrate; and
 3)   Immediately arm the people and create a people's anti-Japanese volunteer
 army to defend China," they are willing to conclude a fighting agreement with
 any armed unit.   The Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army
 have repeatedly opposed the Tangku agreement, direct negotiations between
 China and Japan, recognition of the Japanese puppet government of "Manchukuo"
 and the Kuomintang betrayal of North China.
 They have repreatedly called for open aid to the anti-Japanese volunteer army
 in North China and all revolutionary movements in China opposing Japan and
 imperialism and opposition against all suppressions and slaughter perpetrated
 by imperialism and the Kuomintang against the anti-Japanese, anti-imperialism
 movement.
 The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers and revolutionary people
 throughout China are against the Kuomintang's betrayal of Jehol, the three
 eastern provinces (Heilungkiang, Liaoning and Kirin), Inner Mongolia, North
 China, Fukien Province and all of China, and support the proposal of the
 Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army to oppose Japan and their
 anti-Japan activities.   This has compelled the Kuomintang to blockade us
 even more frantically and attack us, thereby preventing our Soviet Government
 and the Worker-Peasant Red Army from uniting directly with the people of
 China, from carrying out unified action with the anti-Japanese Volunteer
 Army in North China to launch a national revolution against the Japanese
 imperialists and drive the bandits of Japanese imperialism from China.   Not
 only have the Kuomintang warlords completely ignored the proposal to unite
 with the Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army and together
 oppose Japan, but they have even more shamelessly betrayed China and
 stepped up the fifth "encirclement and suppression" of the Soviet Government
 and the Worker-Peasant Red Army to help Japanese imperialism swallow up
 China.
 In order to mobilize all their forces to fight directly against Japanese
 imperialism, the Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army have
 been forced to first engage in bloody combat with the over 2-million-man
 bandit army of the Kuomintang which have been attacking us so as to preserve

 the free, Soviet territories, which have already shaken off the fetters of
 imperialism and prevent them from ever again being trampled upon and betrayed
 by the Kuomintang, the running dogs of imperialism.
 We absolutely will not abandon the anti-imperialist revolutionary base of
 China formed through countless bloody battles with the bandit army of the
 Kuomintang.   The Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army absolutely
 cannot idly watch the enslavement of the Chinese nation by Japanese
 imperialism, absolutely will not permit the traitors and national betrayers
 in the Kuomintang to completely auction off all of China.
 They absolutely will not allow Japanese imperialism to ravage and perpetrate
 mass butchery of the broad masses of the hard-working people of China, nor
 can it allow the solitary struggle of the Northwest Volunteer Army to go on
 (without support).  The Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army,
 at the crucial moment of the merciless, decisive battle against the superior
 force of the Kuomintang bandit army, have, with the greatest of determination
 and disregarding all difficulties, dispatched an anti-Japanese vanguard force
 to march north to fight the Japanese.
 If only the armed  units that are attacking us can accept the three conditions
 we have set forth, the main strength of our Worker-Peasant Red Army can then
 march north in full force, following the vanguard unit to unite with all
 armed forces in China and fight the Japanese together.
 People of all China!   The vanguard unit of the Chinese Worker-Peasant Red
 Army marching north to fight the Japanese is willing to unite with the
 people of China and all armed forces to fight together against the Japanese,
 launch a people's national revolutionary war and overthrow Japanese
 imperialism.  All the people opposing Japan should help the vanguard unit
 of our Worker-Peasant Red Army now marching north to fight against Japan,
 unite and rally around this vanguard force, join its column, arm and fight
 directly against the bandits of Japanese imperialism attacking China.  All
 people opposing Japan are our compatriots and all armed units fighting
 against Japan are fellow travellers.  We should all unite.  All individuals,
 groups or armed units who prohibit or oppress our opposition against Japan
 are traitors and betrayers of the nation.  We should all arise and wipe
 them out!
 We hold that only a national revolution waged by the armed units of the
 people of all China can overthrow Japan and all imperialism and secure the
 independence and liberation of the Chinese nation and preserve the
 ?   territorial integrity of China.
 For attaining victory in the national revolution the Soviet Government and
 the Worker-Peasant Red Army make these concrete proposals.
 1.  Resolutely oppose the selling out of the three eastern provinces,
 Jehol, Inner Mongolia, North China, Fukien Province and all China by the

 Kuomintang Government, oppose direct negotiations between China and Japan to
 sell out and take over the nation, oppose the recognition of the puppet
 "Manchukuo," and discard the dream of getting help from the League of Nations,
 the bandit clique of imperialism and from U.S. imperialism.
 2.   Immediately proclaim the severing of relations with Japan and the
 abrogation of the Tangku agreement and all secret Sino-Japanese treaties.
 Mobilize the entire Chinese Army, Navy and Air Force to fight against Japan.
 Immediately cease the attacks on the Soviet areas and stop blockading them
 so that the Worker-Peasant Red Army can be fully utilized in direct battle
 with Japanese imperialism.
 3.   Call on the people throughout the country to arm themselves with all of
 the weapons in the Kuomintang arsenals and in the Central Ordnance Factory,
 and the armaments being imported, organize anti-Japanese people's voluntary
 armies and guerrilla warfare and war against Japan and give active support
 to the Northeast Volunteer Army and the vanguard force of the Chinese Worker-
 Peasant Red Army marching north to fight the Japanese.
 4.   Confiscate all business enterprises and assets of Japanese imperialists
 traitors and national betrayers, stop all payments of principal and interest
 on all debts owed by China to Japan, establish a progressive tax system and
 seize the entire military budget of the Kuomintang to use as combat funds
 against the Japanese (to finance the war against Japan).
 5.   Organize anti-Japanese people's groups on a general scale (such as anti-
 Japanese associations, committees for boycotting Japanese goods, committees
 for the solicitation of funds in support of the volunteer army and the Red
 Army, as well as all kinds of anti-Japanese control units, sabotage units,
 communication units, propaganda units and transportation units.  Absorb the
 broad masses into the anti-Japanese groups without regard to age, sex, creed
 or political faction and use strikes, boycott of classes, absenteeism and
 closing of shops to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism and the
 national betrayal and capitulation of the Kuomintang Government.
 The Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army will struggle for this
 program without regard to any and all sacrifices.  The Soviet Government
 and, the Worker-Peasant Red Army ask the people of all China to support this
 program and, together with us, struggle to the end for the implementation
 of this program.
 Let the Kuomintang, the running dog of imperialism and the traitors and
 national betrayers in the Kuomintang clamor that "China has no strength
 to oppose Japan!"
 The anti-Japanese general mobilization of the people of China, the anti-
 Japanese armed forces countrywide, the anti-Japanese people's group through-
 out the nation have all the power to overthrow Japan and all imperialism
 and to overthrow the Kuomintang, this clique of traitors and national
 betrayers!

 COMRADE MAO TSE-TUNG TALKS ON CURRENT SITUATION AND THE ANTI-JAPANESE
 VANGUARD UNIT OF THE RED ARMY
 July 1934
 [Text] The correspondent of this paper called on
 Chairman Mao of the Central Government yesterday
 to inquire on the question of the current situa-
 tion and the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Unit of the
 Red Army.  The talk follows.
 After seizing Manchuria and Jehol by force and gaining control of P'ing-chin
 [1627 3160] to achieve open traffic and communication and following its
 publication of the announcement of its intention to solely take over China
 and its presentation to the Kuomintang of a list of over 1,000 "unresolved
 issues"--and a demand for their resolution--Japanese imperialism has begun
 stepping up its new offensive to swallow up China.   The Japanese Government
 recently presented to the United States of America its suggestion to divide
 the Pacific Ocean equally between the two countries.   It is frenziedly
 preparing for an anti-Soviet Union war in northern Manchuria and held the
 Dailen Conference with Kuomintang representatives, clearly indicating that
 Japanese imperialism is striving to mitigate the struggles between the
 imperialists in an attempt to achieve a temporary understanding among them
 and, together, divide up China, attack the Chinese revolution and oppose
 the Soviet Union.   The Kuomintang Nanking Government, the running dog of
 Japanese imperialism, is presently spreading a smoke screen of "abrogate
 the Tangku Agreement" and "recover the war areas" to cover up the Dailen
 Conference, which is very rapidly selling out all of China and, on another
 side, the veteran pro-Japanese Pei Yang [0554 3152] warlord, An Fu-hsi [1344
 4395 4762] is fully cooperating with the Kuomintang.   Such important people
 as Wang Ke-min [3769 0344 2404] are streaming south and holding secret
 talks in Shanghai and at Mo-ch'ien-shan [5359 0578 1472] with Huang Fu [7806
 6744], Tang You-jen [0781 2589 1103] and others.  Tuan Ch'i-jui [3003 4388
 3843],.a chieftain of An Fu-hsi, went to Lu Shan [1687 1472] and conferred
 in secret with Chiang Kai-shek.   This kind of massive cooperation between
 new and old traitors wholly shows that there is a high urgency in the new
 offensive of Japanese imperialism.   The Chinese nation has come to an
 extremely dangerous juncture.   The fate of slavery and doom is threatening
 the hard-working masses of the entire country.

 The new offensive of Japanese imperialism and the massive attacks of the
 Kuomintang on our Soviet areas are completely coordinated as one.   Several
 hundred thousand Kuomintang troops are advancing from the doorway areas of
 the Soviet region--Kuang-ch'ang [1684 2490], Lien-ch'eng [6647 1004],
 Lung-kang [7873 1481] and T'ai-ho [3141 0735]--into the central areas to
 carry out the last stage of the fifth encirclement, planning to bathe the
 Soivet area in blood, wipe out the Soviet Red Army and be the most dutiful
 running dog of imperialism in carving up China. These are the special
 characteristics of the current situation.  To protect their own territory
 and take punitive action against the traitors--the Kuomintang--the Soviet
 Government and the Red Army are leading the broad masses and the heroic and
 courageous Red Army to unleash the most intensive and blood battles on
 various fronts against the enemy.  They are putting all their forces
 and applying all means to the task of smashing this brutal "encirclement
 and suppression."  The Soviet and the Red Army have long ago made up their
 minds to smash this ferocious encirclement, no matter what  happens.  Now
 it is even more necessary for us to utilize all resoluteness, tenacity and
 perseverance to smash this encirclement.   By so doing we will also be sure
 of smashing it in the end.
 In the most recent period we have created 70,000 new Red Army soldiers  in
 the Soviet area and mobilized several hundred thousand tan of grain to solve
 the problem of supply between seasons, and, presently, we are carrying out the
 great mobilization for the autumn harvest.  Our guerrilla forces have been
 greatly expanded and they are still being expanded.   Guerrilla warfare is
 spreading on a wide scale.   A mass movement of boiling salt and weaving
 cloth is underway to provide material support.  Military industry, such as
 the manufacturing of ammunition, has increased by several tens of times.
 The Kuomintang does not even dream that we have such strength.  The Kuomintang
 has early claimed that we were in a "very poor position" and they had won
 big victories.   But the facts proved, and will prove in the end, that it is
 the rotten-to-the-core Kuomintang that is in a "very poor position."
 Chiang Kai-shek, very pleased with himself, began to build blockhouses for
 several thousand li and several tens of layers deep in the Soviet areas
 and boasted how their "easy-pickings-fishing in packed waters" policy was
 soon to "succeed."  True, Chiang Kai-shek has built many blockhouses and
 he has occupied some of our areas--Ningtu and Hsing Kuo.  Many of the
 Kuomintang units, however, were routed and annihilated under the iron fists
 of the Red Army.  These are things Chiang Kai-shek does not mention and
 prohibits from being mentioned.   Such a stupid pig as Chiang Kai-shek does
 not understand that in the end it is Chiang Kai-shek and the entire landlord
 capitalist Kuomintang and not the Soviet Red Army, who will be in a "very
 poor position."  They also do not understand that it is the imperialists
 who are directing the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang who will, in the end, be in
 a very "difficult position."
 Let me again point out two things.   First, what kind of influence is imparted
 to the over 1 million soldiers of theirs sent to attack our Soviet areas
 (Kiangsi, Szechwan, Hunan, Fukien and Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei) when confronted
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 with the Soviet Red Army?  We would like to say that such a broad mass of
 soldiers were, on the one hand, forced to attack us, and, on the other hand,
 they were receiving our revolutionary education.   It can be said that the
 various Soviet areas are universities where the soldiers o[the White armies
 are educated in revolution.  It is not only the Red Army, but also his own
 soldiers, who are helping to dig the grave of Chiang Kai-shek.  May I ask,
 does this stupid pig, Chiang Kai-shek, understand this?  Second, the
 Kuomintang is frantically selling out the country, daily groveling on its
 hands and knees before imperialism, the arch enemy of the people throughout
 China, and presenting China to Japanese imperialism.  Not a shot was fired
 against the several hundred-thousand Japanese bandit troops.   But all the
 troops it has from the three eastern provinces, Jehol, Peking, Tientsin,
 Shanghai, Hangchow, Hankow and Honan, Hopeh, Kiangsu and Chekiang were
 deployed to attack the Red Army while these areas were presented to
 imperialism to be ravaged and oppressed.   Similarly, Ch'en Chi-t'ang [7115
 3444 2768] did not guard against Hong Kong (British imperialism's base for
 aggression against China) but handed the Canton-Kowloon railway to the
 British and deployed 80 percent of his troops to Kiangsi and Fukien to
 attack the Red Army.
 Will the broad masses of these areas allow Chiang Kai-shek and Ch'en Chi-t'ang
 to go on selling out the country like this to the very end?  No.  They
 absolutely will not.  As for Chiang Kai-shek and Ch'en Chi-t'ang, (as well
 as Chang Hsueh-liang [1728 1331 5328], Ho Chien [0149 6943] and others),
 tens of thousands of bombs are buried right underneath their legs.  These
 bombs have exploded or are exploding in some areas (the anti-Japanese
 Volunteer Army of the three eastern provinces of Kirin, Heilungkiang and
 Liaoning, the People's Revolutionary Army, the Shanghai campaign, guerrilla
 attacks in various areas, and people's uprisings).   In some areas, bombs
 will explode on a massive scale.  Please tell me, who among the hard-working
 masses of the country and the soldiers of the White armies does not support
 the Chinese Communist Party's five big programs of opposition to the
 Japanese?  Who does not support the order of the Soviet Central Government
 declaring war on Japan?  Who does not accept the call made by the Soviet
 Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee to
 "desist from attacking the Red Army, unite with the Red Army to fight
 together against Japanese imperialism?"  There is no doubt that if they only
 read or hear about our programs, order, and call, they will jump up and be
 willing to carry them out.   There is no doubt that the storm of nationwide
 opposition against Japan and imperialism will break and gather force under
 the call of the bright, Red banner.
 At a time when the Kuomintang has sold out half of China and the people
 throughout the country, as though anticipating rain in a time of severe
 drought, look forward to the Red Army's march north to fight the Japanese,
 the Soviet Central Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee,
 on 1 August of this year when the working people of the world were staging
 massive demonstrations against the imperialist war of aggression, dispatched
 an anti-Japanese vanguard unit.   It has been approaching Fuchow for the

 last 2 days and will pass through the various provinces in the east as it
 marches north to fight the Japanese.   The purpose of this is to make the people
 throughout China realize that in all of China the Red Army is the only army
 that is truly in opposition to the Japanese.  Although the main force of the
 Red Army has been prevented from marching north by the Kuomintang's fifth
 encirclement, it is now proceeding to smash it and only after thoroughly
 smashing the Kuomintang's encirclement can the Red Army march north in
 strength.  Meanwhile, it has dispatched a vanguard unit of its own forces.
 Although this force has only one vanguard unit it is fully combat effective
 and has ample fire power.   The fighters and commanders are all of high
 calibre and they have already shown the greatest courage in battles against
 the Kuomintang troops.  Although this unit is not heavily equipped, we
 believe that it will receive the support of the people along the way.  All
 those elements in the Kuomintang forces who are determined to fight Japan
 will join the ranks of this unit in an endless stream and it will very
 rapidly grow into a huge force for fighting the Japanese.
 Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanking Government, this faithful running dog of
 Japanese imperialism, in order to discharge its duty, will surely send troops
 to block the path as the unit marches north.   If this should be so, then the
 vanguard unit will have to fight the blocking troops of Chiang Kai-shek as
 it advances.  This will necessitate directing massive propaganda toward the
 soldiers of this blocking force to win their sympathy and collapse their
 ranks so that the march up north will be fast.  The sooner we fight the
 Japanese the better it will be because the new offensive of Japanese
 imperialism is imminent.   Fangs are bared and claws unsheathed as all the
 imperialists prepare to divide up China and the disaster looming over the
 heads of the people all over the country is growing greater and greater.
 We are, therefore, calling for the country to rise as one and help the Soviet
 Red Army so that we will be able to quickly smash the fifth encirclement
 and concentrate our forces to fight against Japan and oppose imperialism.
 Give assistance to our anti-Japanese vanguard unit so as to enable the anti-
 Japanese Red Army to march forward rapidly.  The anti-Japanese vanguard unit
 of the Chinese Worker-Peasant Red Army is now on the move!   Our courageous
 and heroic Worker-Peasant Red Army has taken concrete action to oppose the
 aggression of Japanese imperialism and to save China from disaster.
 Simultaneously, the Soviet Government and the Revolutionary Military Affairs
 Committee have issued orders for the Red Army throughout the country to be'
 ready to move out at any time after the vanguard unit.   But, the Kuomintang
 is blocking the Red Army with a huge force of several hundred thousand,
 deploying its entire northern army southward into Kiangsi Province.  People
 of China, is it still unclear to you?  The Kuomintang is the street sweeper
 for Japanese imperialism.   People of the country and brothers of the White
 Army, oppose the Kuomintang policy of national betrayal and surrender!
 We demand the general mobilization of the army, navy and air force to fight

 ORDER OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC
 15 August 1934
 [Text] Kung Ho-ch'ung [1313 5440 1404] was a member of the Central Executive
 Committee and former commander of the Red 16th Army.  While working in the
 Hunan-Kwangtung-Kiangsi Soviet area he disobeyed orders of the Central Revolu-
 tionary Military Committee several times,  He was panicky and vacillating in
 attacks against the enemy and he led the Red Army in retreat and flight.   In
 consideration of the fact that elements of the counterrevolutionary liquida-
 tion faction infiltrated the unit and caused heavy losses to the Red 16th
 Army and the people of the Hunan-Kwangtung-Kiangsi Soviet area, he was several
 times educated through criticism, but to no avail.  Last October, he was
 relieved of his command of the Red 16th Army, but hoping that he would still
 be amenable to education, he was ordered to report to the Central Government
 for admission to the Red Army University to be educated.  Not only did he show
 no improvement whatsoever, but also took to opposing the revolution.  When he
 was assigned to the Replacement Division in July of this year he seized this
 opportunity to escape and surrender to the enemy.  A member of the Central
 Executive Committee, Kung Ho-ch'ung, who has a relatively long history of
 struggle, could not see the victorious future of the revolution and resorted
 to the most despicable action of rebellion at a time when our courageous
 and heroic Red Army and the broad masses were engaged in the final and
 decisive battle against the enemy's fifth encirclement.  Besides expelling
 him from the Central Committee, a special order has been issued to all the
 Red armies in China, various local units and the various levels of the Soviet
 Government and the revolutionary groups in various areas and the worker-
 peasant masses of the Soviet and White areas are called upon, that if
 Kung Ho-ch'ung is encountered, he should be executed on the spot as a
 warning to the vacillating and the rebellious.

 FINAL DECISION OF CCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE AGAINST ENEMY'S FIFTH ENCIRCLEMENT
 Adopted at Tsun-i Conference of Political Bureau on 8 January 1935
 8 January 1935
 [Text]   After listening to the summation report made by Comrade x x on the
 fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign and the supplementary report
 by Comrade x x x the enlarged session of the Political Bureau held that the
 report made by Comrade x x is basically incorrect.
 1.   In its decision on the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 the CCP Central Committee has clearly pointed out that the fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" is an ever more vicious offensive launched against
 the soviet revolutionary movement by imperialism and Kuomintang reaction.
 It also pointed out at the same time that in this ferocious and decisive
 battle of the classes, the inner weaknesses of imperialism and the Kuomintang,
 and the new intensification of the revolutionary, situation, has caused a
 new change in the relative strength of the classes in the country which is
 favorable to us, and it has arrived at the correct conclusion that "In the
 midst of the fifth 'encirclement and suppression' we possess all the condi-
 tions for winning a decisive victory, which are even more adequate than
 before" (CCP Central Committee decision 20 July 1933).  But, in his report,
 Comrade x x over-estimated objective difficulties.  He placed the reason for
 the inability to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" in the central
 Soviet area on the strong and powerful forces of imperialism and the
 Kuomintang.   But, at the same time, he did not adequately appraise the
 current revolutionary situation.   This will certainly lead to an opportunis-
 tic conclusion that, on the objective level, it will definitely be impossible
 to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 2.   The CCP Central Committee, in accordance with its own correct decision,
 has set forth concrete tasks for opposing the enemy's fifth "encirclement
 and suppression."  One-and-a-half year's difficult struggle against
 "encirclement and suppression" has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt
 that the CCP Central Committee's political line is correct.  Especially,
 the party committee in the central Soviet area, under the direct leadership
 of the CCP Central Committee, has achieved unprecedented results in mobiliz-
 ing the broad masses of workers and peasants to participate in the revolu-
 tionary war.   The movement to expand the Red Army has become an upsurge

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 of the masses. The mobilization of worker and peasant activists, arming and
 sending them to the front, has reached over 100,000, thereby greatly expand-
 ing the Red Army.   The model Red Youth Units are beginning to turn into rear
 support troops for the Red Army, and the people's armed organizations of the
 Red Youth Units have achieved great growth.  Under the slogan of "all for
 victory on the front" the party committee has resolved financial, food and
 all other material needs of the Red Army.  The intensification of the class
 struggle inside the Soviet area, the economic construction of the soviet
 and the thorough improvement of relations between the soviet government and
 the masses have even more vigorously developed the masses' enthusiasm and
 activism for participation in the revolutionary campaigns.  All these have
 created favorable conditions for the thorough smashing of the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression."  However, in his report, Comrade xx was
 clearly inadequate in his appraisal of these favorable conditions.   Coming
 from this kind of inadequate appraisal it will be inevitable to reach the
 conclusion that on the subjective level we will have no ability to smash
 the "encirclement and suppression."
 3.   It should be pointed out that there are still many serious shortcomings
 in our work.   With regard to the party's leadership of the broad masses
 of workers and peasants in opposing imperialism and the Kuomintang in the
 White area, and the leadership of the daily struggles, it still has not
 shown any marked progress.   The development of guerrilla warfare and the
 work of collapsing the soldiers of the White army are still weak.  The mutual
 help and coordination between the Red armies in the various Soviet areas
 given under a unified strategic purpose are still insufficient.  All these
 weaknesses will undoubtedly affect the action taken to oppose the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression" and it will become an important cause for
 our inability to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression."  The
 existence of these weaknesses absolutely must not be construed as the chief
 reason for the inability to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 But, in his report and conclusion Comrade x x exaggerated on these weak-
 nesses in the work.  And yet he did not understand, nor did he acknowledge,
 the basically erroneous estimates made on the strategic and tactical levels
 of the military leadership.   This has prevented us from understanding where
 the main reason for the inability of the main force of our Red Army to leave
 the central Soviet area and our inability to smash the fifth "encirclement
 and suppression" in this area was.   It covered up the evil fruits of the
 erroneous line in the strategic and tactical area of our military leader-
 ship.  With the courage and skill of the Red Army in combat, model rear
 area work and the support of the broad masses notwithstanding, it will be
 impossible to achieve a decisive victory in the war if we cannot apply
 correct strategy and tactics in our military leadership.  Herein lies the
 principal reason for our inability to smash the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" in the central Soviet area.
 4.   After suffering defeats in four "encirclement and suppressions," the
 Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek and his imperialist military advisers have
 learned that it was extremely unfavorable to use the strategy and tactic
 of "penetrating deeply" to give us battle inside the Soviet areas.  There-
 fore, in the fifth "encirclement and suppression," they adopted the strategy
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 and tactic of protracted warfare and blockhouse warfare in an attempt to
 gradually whittle away our effective strength and our material and financial
 resources, constrict our Soviet area, and, finally, to search out our main
 force and engage it in decisive battle so as to achieve the objective of
 wiping us out.
 Under these circumstances our strategic line should be defense through
 decisive engagements (offensive defense).   Concentrate superior forces,
 select the enemy's weak spots, and, by using mobile warfare, confidently
 go about wiping out a part, or a major part, of the enemy, destroying
 them one at a time and thoroughly smashing the enemy's "encirclement and
 suppression" thoroughly.   In the campaign against the fifth "encirclement
 and suppression," defense through decisive engagements was substituted with
 the line of pure defense (defensive defense), mobile warfare was substituted
 with positional warfare and blockhouse warfare and the tactical principle
 of "short, swift thrusts" was applied to support this kind of strategic
 battle lines of pure defense.  This enabled the enemy's strategy and tactic
 of protracted war and blockhouse warfare to achieve their objective and
 caused the main force of our Red Army to suffer partial losses and to with-
 draw from the central Soviet base area.   It should be pointed out that this
 line is diametrically opposite to the basic principle of the strategy and
 tactics that would achieve victory for our Red Army.
 5.  At this present stage of the Civil War in China when we do not yet have
 the coordination  of worker uprisings in big cities and towns and the mutiny
 of White soldiers, when our Red Army is still very inadequate in numbers,
 when our Soviet areas still constitute only a small part of China, when we
 still lack special weaponry such as planes and artillery, and when we are
 still in a situation of having to fight from interior lines, our strategic
 line, naturally, will be defense through decisive engagements when the enemy
 launches his "encirclement and suppression" and attacks us.   That is, our
 defense will not be pure defense, but a defense seeking for a decisive en-
 gagement and then switching over to the counteroffensive.  Pure defense can
 drain the enemy to a considerable degree and it can preserve territory for
 a certain period of time.   But it will be impossible to protect the Soviet
 area by smashing the "encirclement and suppression" in the end, and there is
 no hope of achieving final victory.   It is only by going from the defense
 to the counteroffensive (on a campaign and strategic level) and then to the
 offensive, winning victory in decisive engagements and wiping out enemy
 effective strength on a massive scale can we smash the enemy, protect the
 Soviet area and develop the Soviet revolutionary movement.
 With this strategic line we should not immediately engage the attacking
 enemy in decisive battle we are not confident of winning before we have
 discovered and exploited the weaknesses of the enemy.  What we should do is
 to continue to confuse and lure the enemy on various fronts by using our
 secondary forces (such as guerrilla units, people's armed force, independent
 battalions and regiments, and part of the Red Army's main force).   In this
 regard, the main thing is to contain the enemy with mobile warfare while
 the main forces withdraw to a suitable distance or move out on the enemy's

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 flanks or his rear areas, conceal and concentrate and seek favorable oppor-
 tunity and launch surprise attacks on the enemy.   Under the situation of
 fighting along interior lines, the withdrawal and concealment of the Red
 Army in the face of enemy's attacks with superior forces will be fully
 adequate to tire out the enemy and cause him to become arrogant and care-
 less and to commit errors and expose their weaknesses.  This creates the
 condition for switching over to the counteroffensive and winning victory
 in decisive battles.
 We must most carefully analyze and appraise the enemy situation so that
 the engagement will be properly planned and launched at a favorable time.
 Do not permit enemy's feints and provocations to make us unnecessarily
 deploy our forces and engage the enemy and become fatigued, thereby causing
 us to lose the opportunity for victory in decisive engagements toward a
 certain direction.   In order to achieve victory, we do not have to block
 the path the attack is taking when the enemy begins his advance in accordance
 to (his) plan.  We should wait until he has penetrated to a suitable distance
 and then encircle and wipe him out (that is, luring the enemy to penetrate
 deeply).   For the purpose of achieving victory we will do whatever is
 necessary, temporarily abandoning part of the territory of the Soviet area,
 even to the extent of having the main force withdraw temporarily from the
 Soviet base area, because we know that we will not only be able to recover
 abandoned territory, but also expand the territory of the Soviet area if
 we only can annihilate the enemy and smash his "encirclement and suppression."
 All these are for the purpose of enabling the Red Army to always assume the
 active role and fight successfully against the enemy's attacks and "encircle-
 ment and suppression," and to always avoid a passive role and its ensuing
 unfavorable results.
 All these principles, however, were flouted in the fifth battle.   In
 February of last year a cable from the Communist International correctly
 expounded this:   "We feel as if nearly all the plans and measures adopted
 by the military command during this period were frequently produced by
 the pressures brought to bear by the enemy.   The enemy's provocations have
 caused us to engage in unnecessary reorganization of our forces.   Therefore,
 our forces were unable to participate vigorously in engagements with the
 enemy because of continuous changes.  We feel that we should defeat the
 enemy in those areas where we have already won certain victories, and
 refrain from attempting to defeat the enemy on all fronts at the same time."
 The leaders of the pure defense line were unable to understand this kind of
 instruction from the Comintern, therefore, the pure defense line, which
 was wholeheartedly willing to place itself in a passive role, did not, and
 was also unable to, plan to defeat the enemy on all fronts at the same
 time, but attempted to stop the enemy on all fronts at the same time.
 This was so not only prior to February of last year but also after the
 main force of the Red Army had to withdraw from the Soviet area.   The slogan
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 "attack on all fronts" set forth in the past by Comrade x x x became resistance
 on all fronts during the fifth "encirclement and suppression."  Strategically
 speaking, both of them are wrong.  Politically, the slogan "do not abandon
 an inch of soviet territory" is correct, but it becomes wholly erroneous
 when mechanically applied to strategy.   It can easily become a camouflage
 for the line of pure defense.
 6.   In order to win victory in a decisive engagement it is absolutely neces-
 sary to concentrate superior forces.   Currently, in a contrast between enemy
 forces and ours, the enemy has absolute superiority in  troops.   They often
 attack us with troops several times, or even several tens of times, stronger
 than ours.   But this is not something we have to fear because the enemy is
 situated on the exterior line and has adopted a strategic policy of encircle-
 ment, advancing along different routes and converging to attack.   This
 creates the opportunity for us to defeat the enemy one at a time, and enables
 us to benefit from fighting along exterior lines in the campaign (localized
 exterior lines) while engaged in strategic interior line combat. That is,
 contain the enemy's one line or several lines of advance with part of our
 forces and concentrate the greatest force to encircle and wipe out one line
 of the enemy's advance, using this kind of method to defeat the enemy
 individually and smash his "encirclement and suppression."  Under the
 situation of fighting along strategic interior lines, it is only by concen-
 trating superior forces to seek victory in exterior line engagements in the
 campaign can it enable the Red Army to constantly grasp the initiative and
 force the enemy into a passive position, and finally to smash his entire plan.
 In the past, however, the leaders of the pure defense line almost always
 scatter their forces (primarily the dispersement of the 1st and 3d Army Corps)
 in their resistance along all fronts against the enemy's advance.  The re-
 sult of this dispersement has frequently put us in a passive position,
 weakening our forces everywhere and proving advantageous to the enemy for
 defeating us one at a time.   In the war of the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" we were unable to achieve victories in many of the campaigns
 (such as the campaigns at Hsun-k'ou [3169 0656], T'uan-tsun [0957 2625],
 Chien-ning [1696 1337], and Wen-fang [3306 0972] because our forces were
 not concentrated.   The central task given the Red Army by the leaders of
 the pure defense line was to block the advance of the enemy in an attempt
 to wipe out part of the enemy with "short, swift thrusts," and it was not
 to seize the initiative, not to win victory in decisive engagements.  The
 result was that the number of enemy (troops) wiped out by the Red Army
 was very small, and, in the end, the Soviet area was also ravaged by the
 enemy.
 7.  Wiping out the enemy in mobile warfare is the specialty of our Worker-
 Peasant Red Army.  When the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 began, the Comintern pointed out for us (in a cable sent in October of the
 year before):   "In our actions we should not adopt the method of positional
 warfare, but adopt the method of mobile warfare on both flanks of the
 enemy."   In last February's cable it was repeated:   "Based on past experience,
 it is plain that our troops have won many great victories in mobile warfare,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 but they were unable to win victory in battles fought by storming the block-
 house areas."                These instructions from the Cominterm were completely correct.
 Although we did not have the opportunity under the blockhouse warefare of
 the enemy's fifth encirclement to adopt mobile warfare on a massive scale
 as was the case with the enemy's "deep penetration" in the first, second,
 third and fourth "encirclement and suppressions," the feasibility of mobile
 warfare still exists.  This, in practice, has been proved many times (in
 the various campaigns of Hsun-k'ou, T'uan-tsun, Chiang-chun-tien [1412
 6511 3013], Chien-ning, Wen-fang, Hu-fang [3275 0972], and, especially at
 the time of the 19th Route Army uprising.  Nevertheless, the pure defense
 line which grew out of the fear of blockhouse warfare and Comrade Hua Fu's
 [5478 1133] theory of "short, quick, thrusts" caused us to switch from mobile
 warfare to positional warfare during the fifth campaign.   But this mode
 of positional warfare, at that time, was only beneficial to the enemy, and
 it was extremely disadvantageous to the Worker-Peasant Red Army.
 Under current technical conditions, storming the enemy's blockhouses should
 be rejected.   It is only in a situation where the blockhouses are weak, or
 isolated, or it is either for the purpose of striking at enemy reinforce-
 ments or to force the enemy to deploy his troops that attacks on enemy
 blockhouses are permitted.   Frequently, assaults on enemy blockhouses have
 been undertaken lightly with hardly any affect.   This is not surprising,
 because war has been taken as a child's game.
 Due to underestimating the feasibility of mobile warfare in the fifth war,
 there was absolute separation of the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppres-
 sion" from his first, second, third and fourth encirclements.   This, in
 turn, led to the absolute negation of past experiences in mobile warfare
 and to the absolute denial of the combat methods of luring the enemy in to
 wipe him out.   This, in practice, led to the reluctant rejection of the
 correct instructions of the Comintern and these were natural rationale
 for the leaders of pure defense and short, quick thrusts.
 8.   Because of the overestimation of the enemy's blockhouse warfare and the
 underestimation of the feasibility of mobile warfare, the theory that
 victory can only be realized through tactics was born.   It held that only
 tactical victory can be turned Into a campaign victory, and, then, victory
 in the campaign will bring about changes favorable to us strategically
 (Comrade Hua Fu's article and comrades x x and x x letters to Lin Piao and
 P'eng Te-huai).   It held that "under blockhouse warfare there can only be
 many small victories but no clear-cut victory" (see Comrade x x's speech
 in the Political Bureau and Comrade x x's "Red Star" article, and it also
 held that blockhouse warfare can be handled only by dividing the troops to
 resist and by short, quick thrusts.  The theory and practice of all these
 strategies and tactics of opportunism in the revolutionary war became
 bankrupt during the fifth campaign.
 We cannot deny that blockhouse warfare has created new difficulties for
 smashing the fifth "encirclement and suppression" (whereas they first
 reviled blockhouse warfare with the empty talk of the left--see Comrade x x's
 article in "Red Star").  We do not deny, but should prepare for, the

 technical conditions of the Red Army (planes and artillery), especially the
 uprising of worker-peasant soldiers inside the blockhouse areas so as to
 overcome even more powerful enemy blockhouses in the future.   However,
 blockhouse warfare can also be smashed, even at present.   Blockhouse warfare
 has fatigued the enemy's troops and dispersed his forces.   It has fostered
 the enemy's dependency on the blockhouses, causing them to lose confidence
 of victory when they leave them.
 At the same time the enemy cannot advance on us without leaving his block-
 houses.  Nor can he build enough blockhouses all over the country to restrict
 the movement of the Red Army.  All these taken together create favorable
 conditions for us to overcome blockhouse warfare.  The method to be applied
 by the Red Army toward smashing blockhouse warfare is still dependent upon
 mobile warfare, dependent upon unfolding guerrilla warfare all around the
 blockhouse lines in a coordinated move with the Red Army and dependent upon
 the intensification of the movement among the White soldiers.  We wait
 inside the lines of the blockhouses for the enemy to advance and then destroy
 his troops on a massive scale outside the lines of the blockhouses, when the
 Red Army has moved to an area free of blockhouses to carry out its activities,
 to force the enemy to leave his blockhouses and engage us in mobile warfare.
 If we only apply the strategic and tactical principles of mobile warfare
 flexibly, skillfully and with strategem, we will then certainly be able to
 smash the enemy's blockhouse warfare.   Only a correct strategic guideline
 can correctly lead a campaign and correctly apply tactics to smash block-
 house warfare and to smash the "encirclement and suppression."  In pure
 defense and in "short, quick thrusts" victory is not mainly dependent upon
 correct leadership of the strategic campaign, but merely on tactics.   This,
 in practice, is to surrender to blockhouse warfare, not to smash it.
 9.   The understanding of the leaders of the pure defense line is also incor-
 rect with regard to the question of protracted war and waging war with
 quick, decisive engagements.   The Chinese civil war is not a short-term
 war.   It is a prolonged, protracted war.  The Soviet Revolution was developed
 and consolidated in the midst of the continuous smashing of the enemy's
 encirclements.  When favorable conditions occur, we should switch over
 completely from the defensive to the counteroffensive, and then to the
 offensive, wipe out the enemy and smash the "encirclement and suppression"
 (for example, the first, second, third and fourth wars, and prior to the
 Kuang-ch'ang [1684 24901 campaign).  When unfavorable conditions arise we
 can temporarily withdraw to conserve our effective strength and then go
 over to the counteroffensive and offensive when other favorable conditions
 came into being (for example, after the Kuang-ch'ang campaign of the fifth
 war).   This is the first basic principle.   Simultaneously, however, another
 principle must also be understood.   In order to wage a protracted and
 prolonged war, all efforts must be made to achieve a quick and decisive
 battle situation in each of the "encirclement and suppressions" and in every
 one of the campaigns, because under the present balance of forces between
 ourselves and the enemy, it will be extremely disadvantageous for us to
 adopt the policy of protracted warfare toward each and every one of the
 "encirclement and suppressions" and toward each and every one of the
 campaigns.

 We must apply a correct strategic policy and smash the enemy's plans when he
 uses protracted warfare against us (as in the fifth "encirclement and suppres-
 s:ion") and win a decisive victory in a period of time we can sustain to
 smash the enemy's "encirclement and suppression."  Using figures of our
 manpower, material resources and munition supply to compare to what the
 Kuomintang has (the so-called competition with the enemy at attrition, see
 Comrade x x's article in "Red Star")--such understanding of protracted
 warfare is basically wrong.   In such things we are at present situated in
 an absolutely "inferior position" and such comparison of figures can only
 give proof of contrary conclusions.
 Precisely because we must wage protracted warfare in the long-range Civil
 War, and, at the same time, wage a campaign of quick decisions in every
 campaign, we must be especially careful in deciding upon our strategic
 campaign plans.  The strategy of pure defense pursued during the fifth war
 was basically wrong, and the many battles of desperate recklessness fought
 under this erroneous strategy (such as the campaigns of Kuang-ch'ang,
 Mao-ting-san [3029 0002 0005], San-chi-fang [0005 3305 0972], P'ing-liao
 [1627 4070] and others) were similarly erroneous.  The Red Army must avoid
 those battles which have no prospects of victory.  Even though the battle
 decision was correct at that point of time we should immediately refuse to
 engage in such battles when the situation changes unfavorably against us.
 It is a heinous crime to play with uprisings, and it is also criminal to
 play with battles.
 Exactly because we must wage protracted warfare and wage quick and decisive
 engagements in the campaign, we must provide the Red Army with the necessary
 time for resting its forces and for educating and training them.   These are
 prerequisite conditions for victory in the war.   It is wrong to say that
 it was not possible to rest and train during the fifth war.  That is the
 inevitable conclusion of proponents of pure defense and short, quick
 thrusts.   It is also incorrect to hold that in order to inject vigor into
 the Red Army activities we must have it fighting battles frequently, and
 without stop, and there is no need to give attention to rest and training.
 Without the necessary rest and training we cannot then fight battles well
 and victoriously.   The organization of the Red Army must be suitable to
 the environment of the current Civil War.   It is wrong to establish many
 new regimental and divisional units before the main force has been brought
 up to strength.   Only after the main force is up to strength should new
 units be established.   It is not right to throw into battle all by itself
 a division of new troops who have no education or training and who have no
 combat experience.   There should be a core of veteran soldiers in the
 division of new troops, and, in the initial stage, place them by all pos-
 sible means under the command of a veteran army corps in order to have
 some combat experience drilled into them.   The kind of unnecessary,
 unweildy, top-heavy organizations and those impropetly equipped, should
 all be converted to light equipment, and the company and the leadership
 of units below divisional level must be strengthened.

 Precisely because we must wage protracted warfare and fight short, decisive
 engagements in the campaign, we must oppose that kind of theory which places
 the need to conserve effective strength in opposition to the need to protect
 the Soviet area.   The heroic sacrifice of the Red Army is entirely necessary
 for the purpose of fighting a victorious battle.   This is the essence of
 the class armed forces, the foundation of victory for the revolutionary war.
 This kind of sacrifice is made in exchange for victory, and this kind of
 victory is worthwhile.  This cannot be suitably applied to conduct a battle
 of desperation because we must understand that only by conserving our
 effective strength can we truly defend the Soviet area.  Without a powerful
 Red Army the Soviet area cannot be protected, while with one we can, after
 all, recover, even if the Soviet area sustained partial loss temporarily.
 Furthermore, only by relying upon the Red Army can new Soviet areas be
 formed.
 Under the principle of waging protracted warfare we must oppose the two
 kinds of erroneous tendencies which may arise after we have smashed the
 enemy's "encirclement and suppression" with counteroffensive engagements.
 One type is conservatism rising from fatigue and overestimation of the
 enemy's strength.  This type of conservatism causes us to become dis-
 appointed and discouraged, causes us to stop and become immobile.   It
 causes us to become unable to go over from the counteroffensive to the
 offensive to wipe out even more enemies, develop even bigger Soviet areas
 and expand the forces of the Red Army.   It prevents us from being able
 to obtain adequate conditions to smash the new "encirclement and suppression"
 before its onset.   The other is adventurism rising from overestimation of
 one's own victory and inadequate appraisal of enemy strength.  This kind
 of adventurism prevents us from achieving victory from our offensives (such
 as offensives undertaken without prospects of victory, and unnecessary
 offensives against key cities), and even causes the victory already won
 to be wasted or go up in smoke.   It causes excessive losses to the Red
 Army effective strength, causes neglect in the mission to expand the Red
 Army, expand the Soviet territory and achieve the development and consolida-
 tion of strategic areas.  This similarly prevents us from obtaining favor-
 able conditions to continue smashing the enemy before the coming of his
 "encirclement and suppression."   Opposing these two erroneous tendencies
 is a serious problem for the party with regard to the question of strategic
 offensive.   That is, in the period between the enemy's two encirclements.
 Under the principle of waging quick, decisive engagements in the campaign
 we must oppose the opportunist tendency of hastily accepting battle, which
 has its roots in fear and panic, or of being imprudent in the initial
 battle.  We must oppose opportunist trend toward feeling that nothing could
 be done about it after failing to win victory in a battle against the enemy
 which was launched in the hope of knocking him out first, or not making
 adequate preparations on the pretext of launching a quick, decisive engage-
 ment, or not making all necessary preparations in a period of time that
 can possibly be sustained, against the enemy's encirclement.  For a quick,
 decisive engagement ther are many necessary conditions (such as strategic

 superiority, correctness of campaign leadership, mobile warfare, grasping
 the opportune moment and concentration of forces) to wipe out the enemy
 troops.   Only by wiping out enemy troops can a battle situation be quickly
 resolved and cause the enemy's offensive and "encirclement and suppression"
 to be smashed.
 10.   One of our important strategies for smashing the enemy's "encirclement
 and suppression" is to take advantage of every friction within the
 counterrevolution and vigorously widen the rift within their ranks so as to
 benefit our switching over to the counteroffensive and offensive.  The
 incident of the 19th Route Army in Fukien Province was the crux to smashing
 the enemy's fifth encirclement.   At that time, the CCP Central Committee
 adopted the correct political line of utilizing this contradiction within
 the Kuomintang.   It concluded a cease-fire agreement with the 19th Route
 Army so as to impel it to oppose Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.
 At that time, Comrade x x and others, under the empty talk of the left,
 adopted an opposing policy on the strategic plane.  They did not understand
 at all that utilizing the 19th Route Army incident politically and militarily
 was an important key to smashing the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppres-
 sion."  On the contrary, they felt that the Red Army's continuation of its
 activities on the eastern front and striking at the rear and flanks of
 Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacking the 19th Route Army was equivalent to
 helping the 19th Route Army.  They deployed the main force of the Red Army
 to the west to engage in the useless effort of attacking the blockhouses
 in the Yung-feng [3657 0023] area and lost this precious opportunity.   They
 basically did not comprehend that the existence of the 19th Route Army's
 People's Government at that time was advantageous to us. Striking at
 Chiang Kai-shek's flanks and rear in direct coordination with the 19th
 Route Army was precisely for our own benefit.   This was not because the
 19th Route Army was a revolutionary army.   On the contrary, it was merely
 a faction within the counterrevolution.   This faction planned to use even
 more swindles and arbitrary propaganda, and even such terms as socialism,
 to preserve in entirety the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie.   Only by
 demonstrating to the worker-peasant soldiers of the 19th Route Army with
 concrete action that we give aid to the anti-Japanese, anti-Chiang Kai-shek
 struggles of any faction can we even more easily expose the swindles of the
 warlords of the 19th Route Army and win the soldiers over to our side in the
 common war against Japan and Chiang Kai-shek.
 Only by adopting on a military plane a policy of direct coordination with
 the 19th Route Army can we retain the opportunity, at that crucial point
 in time, to wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's main force.   This kind of condition
 has no precedent in the many past battles.  We did not utilize this
 militarily.   For the leaders of pure defense this would not be out of the
 ordinary, because their objective, origir.ally, was merely to resist the
 enemy's advance.   As for using the frictions and contradictions within the
 enemy ranks to bring about our going over to the counteroffensive and the
 offensive was a rash move in their eyes.

 11.   Similarly, error in principle was also committed on the question of
 changing strategy and carrying out the breakthrough of the encirclement.
 The first thing we should discuss is that when we saw that the possibility
 of achieving decisive victory by continuing to fight along interior lines
 in the central Soviet area had become remote, and, finally, had become im-
 possible (period between May and July 1934, that is, after the Kuang-ch'ang
 campaign).  We should have altered our strategic policy without any hesita-
 tion and carried out a strategic withdrawal in order to conserve the effective
 strength of the Red Army's main force, and sought favorable opportunities in
 the vast blockhouseless area for an opportune moment to go over to the
 counteroffensive, smash the encirclement and create new Soviet areas to
 protect the old.   In its 25 June cable, the Comintern pointed out in this
 manner:   "(the resources for) the mobilization of new armed forces in the
 central area have not dried up yet.   The Red Army's strength to resist and
 the situation in its rear area are not enough to make us.panic.
 Even speaking on the matter of the Red Army's main force in the Soviet area
 withdrawing, its only reason is to conserve its effective strength and avoid
 the possibility of being attacked by the enemy.   On discussing the resolu-
 tions of the 5th Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the 13th
 Plenary Session of the Communist International the future prospects of the
 struggle and the current international situation as well as the flexible
 policy of the Red Army, it was, first of all, inclined toward the conserva-
 tion of effective strength, to consolidate and expand under new conditions
 and to wait for the opportunity to launch a massive offensive against
 imperialism and the Kuomintang."  On this crucial point it was clear that
 our strategic policy was also incorrect.   This question was not mentioned
 at all in the "strategic plan for the 3 months of May, June and July."
 Although this problem was brought up in the "Strategic plan for the 3 months
 of August, September and October"' and preparations were also begun for
 withdrawing from the Soviet area, nevertheless, the basic principle of the
 new plan was still contrary to the strategic policy which should have been
 adopted at that time.   "Use all available strength to continue with the
 defense of the Soviet area and win a massive victory in the campaign by
 doing so" and "launch guerrilla warfare and strengthen activities in the
 secondary direction to achieve a strategic change in the situation"--all
 these still remain as the second article of the first part of the basic
 principle of the new plan, and the question of conserving effective strength
 was completely ignored.  Whereas this question was the foundation of the
 strategic policy on which the decision to withdraw from the Soviet area rests.
 The error in timing, plus the emergence of positional warfare in this cam-
 paign, caused heavy losses to the Red Army.   This kind of contradictory
 attitude of preparing for a breakthrough on the one hand, and, on the other,
 "Use all available strength to continue with the defense of the central
 area" is precisely the manifestation of the inevitable panic of leaders
 of the pure defense line when they arrived at the crucial moment of change.
 Of even greater importance are our activities for breaking through.   In the
 mind's eye of Comrade Hua Fu they were basically irresolute and not combat
 orientated.   It was a kind of panicky running away, home moving type of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100030001-4
 activity. Precisely for this reason, not only was this massive changeover
 not conducted in accordance with the Comintern's instruction to carry out
 work directed at explaining the situation to the cadres and Red commanders,
 it was not even brought up for discussion at the Political Bureau conference.
 The political objective of the mass movement of several million people was
 not considered to be a significant problem.   The necessary time for rest,
 reorganization and training was not given to the main force of the Red Army
 for moving from the Soviet area to the White area and for changing from
 positional warfare to mobile warfare, and a hasty departure was made.   They
 were silent from beginning to end with regard to the basic questions of what
 the present mission was, where they were going and why they were withdrawing
 from the Soviet areas.   Therefore, they were unable to heighten the enthusiasm
 and activism of the Red Army fighters on the military level, and, especially,
 on the political level.   This cannot be but a grave error.  The huge column
 of the military committee and other rear echelon departmental organizations
 of the Army Corps caused great difficulties to the Red Army fighting on the
 move, turning all combat troops into a covering force, slowing down movement
 and losing the opportunity for reaching the pre-designated area.
 It'was completely forgotten that the strategic switch-over carried out by
 the Red Army would encounter serious opposition from the enemy, that in the
 course of the long move it would have to fight many difficult and decisive
 battles with all of the pursuing and blocking enemy forces before being
 able to arrive at its objective.   All these military, political and organiza-
 tional errors, especially the fact that the strategic policy was not based
 upon the principle of obtaining the necessary and opportune moment to engage
 the enemy in decisive battle brought about a situation in which we find
 ourselves almost always being placed in a passive position and frequently
 subjected to enemy attacks and being unable to strike at the enemy with
 strength.   It therefore turned the 3-month breakthrough campaign into a
 covering engagement everywhere, and there were no free rein offensives taken
 on our own initiative.   Although "preparing for combat" was frequently on
 the lips, in practice, we were frequently "avoiding combat" besides conduct-
 ing covering engagements.   The morale of the Red Army could not be uplifted,
 there was over-fatigue from being unable to get a moment's rest.   And it
 resulted in a decrease in personnel to an unprecedented degree. It also
 caused the correct slogan of "counteroffensive" to become, in practice, a
 camouflage for the policy of avoiding combat advocated by Comrade x x and
 others.   There was no preparation for actually seizing victory in the
 counteroffensive when it became necessary.  We failed to compel the enemy
 to change his entire plan to attack the central Soviet area with the Red
 Army's change of strategy so as to protect the central area, smash the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression," establish the Hunan base and even to con-
 serve the effective strength of the Red Army at a high level.   All these
 were the unavoidable result of basically adopting avoidance of combat in
 the strategic policy.  This strategic avoidance of combat stems from our
 erroneous viewpoints.  That is to say the Red Army must first arrive at
 its designated area (western Hunan Province), unload its baggage and then
 launch a counteroffensive to wipe out the enemy.   Otherwise, it would not
 be possible.

 In the pursuit of the enemy (for instance, the columns of Chou [0719] and
 Hsueh [5641], they were afraid to give battle even when the enemy became
 separated and they were fatigued.   The source of this kind of erroneous
 viewpoint lies in not understanding the fact that the current situation
 does not allow us to go about our task in such a simple, nonchalant and
 straightforward manner, as well as in overestimating the strength of the
 pursuing enemy.  This way of doing things might be possible in a brief
 situation involving inconsequential movements of small units.  But, in a
 situation covering several thousand li of the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" and involving the massive strategic relocation of the Red
 Army's main force it was impossible.  Avoid battles with the enemy which
 are unnecessary and where no weaknesses can be exploited.  Engagements with
 the enemy should not be avoided when the contrary arises.  Herein lies the
 main reason for the failure to accomplish their own mission in the break-
 through activities. This error in principle kept on developing right up
 to the final stage of the breakthrough campaign.  When the Red Army reached
 the borders of Hunan and Kweichow it still acted in a mechanical manner and
 wanted to advance into the area of the 26th Army Corps.  They did not know
 how to change action guidelines with the situation that had already changed.
 When the Red Army arrived in the area of Wu-chiang [3527 3068], they again
 did not know how to delineate the task of switching over in the counter-
 offensive in accordance with the changes in the new situation to wipe out
 the pursuing troops of Chiang Kai-shek, but only recognize the task of wiping
 out a handful of the enemy in Kweichow and some so-called bandits.  Although
 the last two errors were corrected due to the resolute opposition of the
 majority of the comrades in the Political Bureau, they were enough to display
 the habitual opportunist tendencies of Comrade Hua Fu and others with regard
 to strategy.
 The prospects in the development of the pure defense line are:  Either it
 would be desperate recklessness or flightism.   There could be nothing else.
 12.   The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that all the
 facts have substantiated that our line of pure defense in military matters
 is the principal reason for our inability to smash the enemy's fifth
 "encirclement and suppression."  All attempts to defend the erroneous line
 with regard to military leadership with the party's correct line will be
 futile.   The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that this kind
 of pure defense line in military affairs is a kind of concrete manifestation
 of right opportunism.   It rises from inadequate appraisal of enemy strength,
 overestimating objective difficulties, especially the difficulties of pro-
 tracted campaigns and blockhouse warfare, underestimating one's own subjec-
 tive strength, especially the strength of the Soviet area and of the Red
 Army and from not understanding the characteristics of the Chinese revolu-
 tionary war.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that the struggle against
 the pure defense line in military matters is the concrete struggle in the
 party against right opportunism.   This kind of struggle should be launched
 and intensified in the entire party.  All attempts to turn this struggle
 into an unprincipled individual squabble will be severely dealt with.

 13.   Furthermore, the enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that
 Comrade x x, especially Comrade Hua Fu's, method of leadership was very
 poor.   All the functions of the military committee were single-handedly
 monopolized by Comrade Hua Fu, the collective leadership of the military
 committee was abolished, there was a great increase of punitivism, and
 self-criticism was nonexistent.  Not only all differing opinions on the
 military plane were completely ignored but repressive measures were adopted
 against them, and the ingenuity, expertise and creativity of lower level
 commanders were stifled.  Many valuable experiences and lessons of past
 revolutionary battles were thrown away under the pretext of switching
 strategy and tactics and labeled "guerrillaism."  Although the majority of
 the comrades in the military committee have made correct suggestions many
 times, and many intense debates have broken out over it, it did not affect
 Comrade Hua Fu and Comrade x x.  All these contributed to the abnormal
 phenomenon within the military committee.
 At the same time, the Political Bureau believes even more so that, in the
 past, the Secretariat and the Political Bureau's leadership of the military
 committee was extremely inadequate.   The greatest part of the Secretariat's
 and Political Bureau's attention was focused on the huge Red Army and on
 matters concerning the assurance of material supply to the Red Army.
 Unprecedented great results were achieved in this respect (in these fields).
 Very little attention was given to strategy and tactics, placing this
 responsibility on the shoulders of a very few comrades, mainly Comrade x x
 and Comrade Hua Fu.  We did not clearly understand that the question of
 conducting a war affects the overall situation of victory or defeat, and
 mistakes could turn achievements gained from the best rear area work into
 smoke.   The mistake the Political Bureau made on this question should be
 admitted.   All the comrades of the Secretariat should bear an even greater
 part of the responsibility because some of the important decisions or
 strategic plans were approved by them.
 But the enlarged session of the Political Bureau especially set forth the
 grave errors of Comrade x x in this respect.   Representing the CCP Central
 Committee, he directed the work of the military committee.  With regard to
 the error in line committed by Comrade Hua Fu in directing battles and
 the abnormal phenomenon within the military committee, he not only did not
 correct it in a timely manner but vigorously supported and nurtured the
 development of this kind of error.   The enlarged session of the Political
 Bureau considers that Comrade x x should bear the main responsibility in
 this respect, but Comrade x x, in his conclusion, did not admit his own
 errors, nor did he accept the criticism of the greatest majority of the
 comrades.   It must be pointed out that with regard to Comrade x x, this
 kind of error was not an error of the entire political line, but a partial
 and serious political error.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that the error committed
 in the past on military leadership must be thoroughly rectified in order to
 smash the enemy's encirclement campaign, create new Soviet areas and improve
 the method of leadership of the military committee.

 14.   The enlarged session of the Political Bureau holds that although our
 past erroneous leadership in military matters has caused us to be unable to
 smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" within the central Soviet
 area and brought about the forced withdrawal, with partial losses, of our
 main force Red Army from the Soviet area.  Nevertheless, the Red Army's
 main force still exists.  We have the superior conditions based on the masses,
 the correct leadership of the party, a relatively good area with regard to
 materials and terrain and the support of the broad masses throughout the
 country.   In coordination with the victories of the Fourth Front Army and of
 the 26th Army Corps, plus the correct conduct of warfare, we believe all
 these difficulties can be overcome through the industrious efforts of the
 entire body of our comrades and the red commanders.  At the same time the
 difficulties of the enemy have increased greatly and the area of our activities
 has become very distant from.the counterrevolutionary base of the Nanking
 government.  The blockhouse area, which was run by Chiang Kai-shek for many
 years and on which he placed his reliance, is now no more.  The contradictions
 and disunity within the ranks of the warlords have further multiplied and the
 main force of our chief enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, has been weakened in the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression."  The division of China by imperialism, the
 Kuomintang's policy of national betrayal and the unprecedented collapse of the
 national economy throughout the country have made it even more clear to the
 people of the nation that only the Soviet can save China.  They, thereby,
 become even more sympathetic to the Soviet Revolution and give it support,
 and even directly participating in struggles on behalf of the Soviet
 political power.  All these are favorable conditions for smashing the enemy's
 new encirclement campaign, creating new Soviet bases and developing a'nation-
 wide soviet movement.   It must be pointed out, however, that the current
 situation has set critical tasks before the party and the Red Army.   This
 is because at no time will imperialism and the counterrevolutionary warlords
 of the Kuomintang relax their drive against us.   In the face of the new
 encirclement campaign we must recreate Soviet areas as there are no existing
 ones, and the central Red Army is not in the Yunnan-Kweichow area.  Our
 victory must be won through arduous struggles of our own.  The creation of
 new Soviet areas cannot be successful without going through bloody struggle.
 The current central problem is how to be victorious over the troops of
 Szechwan, Yunna, Kweichow and Chiang Kai-shek.  The movements of the Red
 Army must have a high degree of flexibility in order to fight successfully
 against these enemies.
 The basic principles of revolutionary warfare have been decided and to accom-
 plish battle tasks it will be necessary to apply these principles in a
 flexible way.   The special capacity of the Red Army for mobile warfare has
 been considerably weakened by protracted positional warfare in the battles
 of the fifth encirclement, and, right now, the various levels of Red Army
 commanders are required to have a high level of tactical skill in mobile
 warfare.        The resolute and rapid change over from the tactics of positional
 warfare (short, quick thrusts) to the tactics of mobile warfare is a very
 serious task.   Necessary training in skills must be given to the fighters,
 especially the new ones.   In political work everything must meet with the

 current need of the movement in order to guarantee the accomplishment of
 every combat task.  The Red Army needs even more to rest up and reorganize
 during battles and also to expand itself in a big way.  The Red Army should
 tighten up its own discipline.   It must maintain even closer relations
 with the broad masses of hard working worker-peasant masses and become as
 one with them and strengthen in a big way the work of the local people.
 The current situation demands that the leadership of the party and the
 Red Army should exert all efforts to resolve these basic questions con-
 cretely and positively.
 The work of the party in the White area must be established and strengthened.
 There must be a thorough change in the leadership method of the mass struggle
 in the White area.   The work of collapsing the White army must be launched
 in a positive manner.   The propagation of large-scale guerrilla warfare
 is one of the party's most central tasks.   The party must hold fast to the
 leadership of guerrilla warfare in the central Soviet area and the Soviet
 areas of Hunan,Kiangsi and Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi provinces, change past
 methods of work to conform with the new situation.   Finally, even more
 closer relationship must be established with the 26th Army Corps and the
 Fourth Front Army and also strengthen the leadership over them in order to
 achieve unified action of all the Red armies in the country and their
 coordination with each other.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that we can accomplish
 these serious tasks that have been placed before us, and their accomplishment
 ensures subsequent new victories in the revolution.  New victories in the
 revolution will make our central Red Army create a new Soviet base area in
 the vast expanse of the three provinces of Yunnan, Kweichow and Szechwan,
 bring about the recovery of our old Soviet area, and the creation of a unified
 liaison between the Red armies in various areas with the Soviet areas.   It
 will also bring about a change of the struggle of the worker-peasant masses
 throughout the country into a victorious revolution.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau believes that the Chinese
 Soviet Revolution, having its rich historic source, cannot be wiped out and
 cannot be conquered by the enemy.  The transformation of the central Soviet
 area, the Hunan-Kiangsi Soviet area and the Chekiang-Kiangsi Soviet area
 into guerrilla areas is but a partial  setback  in the overall Soviet revolu-
 tion.   Such a setback is not enough to make us display alarm and panic about
 the progress of the Chinese Soviet Revolution.   In practice, it will not be
 possible even for the Kuomintang and imperialism to contemplate temporarily
 stopping the advance of the Soviet revolution.   The victories of the
 Fourth Front Army and the 26th Army Corps, the brisk activities of the
 Central Red Army in the three provinces of Yunnan, Kweichow and Szechwan,
 and the revolutionary struggle of the worker-peasant masses throughout the
 country testify that the entire Chinese Soviet Revolution is advancing.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau pointed out that the past errors
 of the party in its military leadership are but partial errors when viewed
 from the standpoint of the party's entire line.   This kind of error is not

 enough to make us become dejected and discouraged.   The party has courageously
 exposed this kind of error and educated itself to it.   It has learned how
 to even better lead the revolution and battle to complete victory.   The
 party has not been weakened, but strengthened, after exposing such errors.
 The enlarged session of the Political Bureau calls on all comrades to oppose
 with the determination of a Bolshevik, all right-leaning opportunism of
 alarm and panic, dejection and discouragement, and, foremost, to oppose the
 line of pure defense.   The enlarged session of the Political Bureau even
 more urgently calls on all comrades to unite to a man around the CCP Central
 Committee and struggle to the end for the CCP Central Committee's general
 line.   Victory will inevitably be ours.
