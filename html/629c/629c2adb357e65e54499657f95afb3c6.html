OCTOBER 1976 
In September, P.A. News and Views invited Presidential Candidates Carter, Ford, Maddox, and McCarthy 
to submit brief statements on the topic, "The Management of the American Governmental System." 
Candidates Carter and Ford submitted statements prepared specifically for P.A. News and Views. Candidate 
McCarthy submitted a press release and an excerpt from a previous speech dealing with the subject, and 
Candidate Maddox thanked P.A. News and Views for the opportunity, but said he did not have the time 
nor the staff to reply. 
The following are the statements of three presidential candidates on: 
THE MANAGEMENT OF 
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM 
Jimmy Carter 
On the campaign trail, a lot of 
promises are made by candidates for 
public office to improve economy and 
efficiency in government if they are 
elected. This pledge has a natural 
appeal to the financially overburdened 
taxpayer. But when winning candi-
dates take office, they too often find 
that it's easier to talk about economy 
and efficiency in government than to 
accomplish it. I would like to share 
with you some of my ideas on how to 
carry out improved management of 
the federal government. 
The basic difficulty facing the fed-
eral government today cuts across all 
other campaign issues. National prob-
lems and the government programs 
and agencies intended to deal with 
them have become incredibly com-
plex. To begin with, the federal gov-
ernment is ill-equipped to deal with a 
President Gerald Ford _-
I commend the members .of the 
American Society for Public Adminis-
tration for your excellent work in 
helping to improve public manage?
ment. I especially note with satisfac-
tion your educational programs and 
efforts to exchange useful manage-
ment information and experience with 
federal, state, and local governments. 
The term "management" was not in 
use at the time of the framing of the 
Constitution, yet it is clear that man-
agement is what the drafters had in 
mind when they vested the President 
with the general executive powers and 
charged him to "take care that the 
laws be faithfully executed" (Art. II, 
Sec. 3). This "take care" clause con-
veys particularly well the fundamental 
responsibility of the President with 
respect to the management functions 
of planning, organizing, actuating, co-

CARTER_ 
Eugene McCarthy 
WASHINGTON, D.C., September 23, 
1976 ? Independent presidential 
candidate Eugene McCarthy today 
characterized the Carter energy pro-
gram as misconceived and inadequate. 
Said McCarthy, "There should be no 
separate department of energy since 
energy supplies, needs and use must be 
a part of general resources policy, 
which neither Ford nor Carter have." 
McCarthy continued, "The need is for 
a Department of Resources which 
would include, along with energy, agri-
cultural production (not marketing), 
forestry, mines and minerals." 
The Resources Department would 
be according to a projected reorganiza-
tion plan being prepared by the inde-
pendent McCarthy. He would propose 
to reorganize the Executive Branch of 
the government into five basic depart-
merits. The other four would be:

Thank you very much for yours of July 29th.

In an unrelated matter, I am enclosing here-
