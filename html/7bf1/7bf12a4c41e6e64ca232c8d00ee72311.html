PREFACE 
At the 22nd Party Congress in 1961 the CPSU decided to 
make cybernetics an instrument of national policies pertaining 
to management in the Soviet Union. Since that time the 
field of cybernetics has been undergoing a gradual, multifaceted, 
and programmed evolution under the immediate supervision 
of the Cybernetics Council, Academy of Sciences, USSR. This 
pattern of development has been paralleled by cybernetics pro-
grams in some of the Satellites and to a lesser extent in Com-
munist China. In this report, the recent organizational, sci-
entific, technological and philosophical developments in this 
program are reviewed, discussed, and placed in perspective in 
the context of related research and political and philosophical 
activities. Earlier developments were reviewed in The Features 
of the Soviet Cybernetics Program Through 1963, OSI�RA/65-2, 
5 January 1965. 
This analysis used information available through 1 June 
1966. 
This report has been produced solely by CIA. It was pre-
pared by the Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated 
with the Office of Current Intelligence and the Office of Re-
search and Reports.

MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
SOVBLOC CYBERNETICS PROGRAMS IN 1965 
PROBLEM 
To review and evaluate major events in the development 
of Sovbloc cybernetics programs during 1965. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The institutional base of the Soviet cyber-
netics program increased sharply during 
1965�the creation of cybernetics institutes 
at Tashkent, Yerevan, Minsk, Baku, Gorkiy, 
and Leningrad approximately doubled the 
number of such institutes. At least four new 
serial publications appeared during the same 
period: Cybernetics; Automatic Measure-
ments; Economics and Mathematical Meth-
ods; and Questions of Theoretical Cybernetics. 
A computer-based information-management 
system was established to systematize the re-
sults of the cybernetics program and to fa-
cilitate the exploitation of Western research. 
It is based on a well-structured subject index 
containing 80 main headings which range 
in subject coverage from "analog computers" 
and "automatic control" to "stochastic ap-
proximation techniques" and "utility theory." 
The Council for Cybernetics convened bi-
weekly during 1965 to foster coordination of 
research and the dissemination of ideas per-
tinent to the most important problems facing 
the cybernetics program. It also cooperated 
in the organization of at least six major con-
ferences: the First All-Union Symposium on 
Automatic Pattern Recognition; First All-
Union Conference on Experiment Planning; 
Second Symposium on Cybernetics (Tbilisi) ; 
All-Union Conference on Cybernetics and the 
National Economy; Third All-Union Confer-
ence on Automatic Control�Technical Cyber-
netics; and the Second Scientific Conference 
on Neuro-Cybernetics of the Schools of Higher 
Education. 
The scientific and technological accomplish-
ments revealed during 1965 indicate that the 
rate of progress of the Soviet Union is ac-
celerating in the fields of theoretical, techni-
cal, and applied cybernetics. Exemplifying 
Soviet progress in theoretical cybernetics is 
their pattern recognition research, which 
reached a relatively high plane of accom-
plishment during 1965. In their multifaceted 
mass attack on the recognition problem, the 
Soviets used psycho-biological, bionic, mathe-
matical, and combined approaches which 
found expression in reports of research on: 
heuristic programming; the relationships of 
information theory and learning to the recog-
nition problem; human speech recognition; 
the algorithmic simulation of human pattern 
recognition and problem-solving systems; and 
the hardware simulation of the human pat-
tern recognition apparatus. The last-men-
tioned research activity has resulted in models 
of individual neurons, neuron nets, and recep-

tor and analyzer systems which perform in-
formation transformation functions analo-
gous to those of the living prototypes after 
which the hardware is modeled. The most 
significant Soviet contributions to the solu-
tion of the pattern recognition problem dur-
ing 1965 come from the mathematicians. Es-
pecially notable was Ya. L. Tsypkin's discovery 
that there is a close proximity between prob-
lems solvable by the method of potential func-
tions and problems analyzed in the theory 
of stochastic approximations. 
The outstanding technical cybernetics ac-
complishment revealed by the Soviets during 
1965 was the BESM-6 computer. This all-
solid-state digital computer represents a con-
siderable advance over previous Soviet ma-
chines. It is well-suited to economic, mili-
tary, and other applications requiring a large 
volume of calculations. Translation of this 
advance into widely available machines and 
associated software will require some years. 
For the present and near future the URAL 
series of compatible computers and software 
will provide major support to the cybernetics 
and economic data processing programs. As 
to the more basic aspects of technical cyber-
netics, the Soviets continued to focus atten-
tion on optimal control problems with an un-
usual emphasis on those encountered in sto-
chastic systems. The large number of papers 
devoted to problems of optimal control of 
stochastic systems revealed that the consider-
able activity on this very difficult subject in 
optimal control theory has advanced to a 
somewhat practical statistical design stage. 
Soviet progress in applied cybernetics was 
evidenced by Soviet revelation during 1965 of 
a number of hierarchical systems for the con-
trol of industrial complexes. Among those 
described are experimental systems with the 
designations IMPUL'S and PROKAT and an 
unnamed system in which VNIIEM-3 comput-
ers are combined in hierarchical fashion for 
technological planning and administrative 
control of a steel mill. These systems rely 
heavily on self-adaption of the control ele-
ments because of the difficulty encountered 
in accurately knowing the process dynamics 
of such systems in advance. 
2 
The development of new software was re-
vealed during 1965. One is ALGOS (Algo-
rithmic Descriptions of Industrial Cybernetics 
Systems) , a special programming language 
for the automatic formulation of computer 
programs for controlling industrial processes. 
Another is EPSS (Heuristic Program for Self-
organization and Self-teaching) which is ap-
plicable to self-organized hierarchical man-
machine systems. ALGEK and KOBOL-
GAYAPEI, programming languages for use in 
economic decision-making and accounting 
operations, respectively, were considered for 
adoption during 1965 by the CEMA Group for 
Algorithmic Languages for the Processing of 
Economic Information. 
The Unified Information Network was the 
most significant planned application of cyber-
netics discussed during 1965. More than 100 
new computer centers were observed for the 
first time in the USSR during the year. Some 
of these may become, along with several 
thousand others, part of a nationwide network 
for collecting, processing, storing, and trans-
mitting information. Plans for this network 
are assigned perhaps the highest priority in 
the theoretical and technical aspects on the 
long-range cybernetics program. The litera-
ture reviewed during 1965 reveals that the 
Soviets are still at an early stage in the am-
bitious research and development program to 
institute this management system of unprece-
dented complexity. 
The newly created Council for Problems on 
Management of Economic and Social Proc-
esses of the Academy of Social Sciences under 
the Central Committee, CPSU, plays a leader-
ship role, especially in the philosophical as-
pects of this program. A possible guideline 
for these philosophical endeavors is a concept 
called the "theory of development." Based on 
analogies recognized by Sovbloc philosophers 
between the evolution of species and the de-
velopment of social systems, the theory of 
development holds that observed regularities 
in natural phylogenetic processes can be used 
as guides in engineering the evolution of so-
cial systems toward higher levels of develop-
ment. This theory incorporates modern 
mathematical approaches to the modeling of

�SEeRE.T._ 
social systems' dynamics with descriptive 
models of the evolutionary process as it oc-
curred in biological nature. One of its key 
postulates states that automation is a uni-
versal law in the development of species and 
is, therefore, a prerequisite to the progressive 
development of social systems. 
Recognizing an intimate connection be-
tween socio-economic development and secur-
ity, some Soviets believe that the success of 
their cybernetics program in providing means 
for the optimal management of social tran-
sition will prove to be the decisive factor in the 
East-West contest. Aside from what would 
be gained in terms of the security of the USSR, 
these Soviets believe that successes in devel-
oping techniques for the scientific guidance 
of social development could furnish an ex-
ample in this respect for the emerging na-
tions of the world and, hence, influence their 
paths of future development along lines in-
INTRODUCTION 
imical, perhaps to US policy. The organiza-
tional, research, engineering, and philosophi-
cal developments within the cybernetics pro-
gram of the USSR during 1965 indicate a 
marked acceleration of Soviet efforts to re-
alize the potential offered by that program 
in terms of their national and international 
objectives. 
Developments transpired in the East Eu-
ropean satellites and to a lesser degree in 
Communist China during 1965 which reflect 
the programs and aspirations observed in the 
USSR. A collaborative Bloc-wide program is 
suggested by reports describing activities in 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and East 
Germany which will be in support of national 
and international (CEMA) research programs 
devoted to scientific management of society. 
Parenthetically, even the Chinese Communists 
began to espouse cybernetics openly during 
1965. 
DISCUSSION 
The Soviet cybernetics program compre-
hends theoretical, technical, and applied re-
search in a multitude of scientific subjects 
and problem areas. The success of the pro-
gram is contingent, therefore, upon Soviet 
abilities to systematize and interrelate these 
previously independent fields with reference 
to the operation of general laws of communi-
cation and control. A step to develop further 
such abilities was taken by the Soviets during 
1965 with the establishment of an informa-
tion-management system for classifying, 
structuring, and interrelating the subfields 
included under the heading of cybernetics by 
the Soviets. 
The basis of the system is a subject index 
with more than 80 main headings each of 
which is identified by a 4 digit code. Some of

The first use was made of this subject index 
by the Soviets in systematically cataloging 
all the abstracts of cybernetic literature pub-
lished during 1965 in the Reference Journal: 
Cybernetics issued by the Institute of Scien-
tific Information, Academy of Sciences, USSR. 
The availability of this index with its thous-
ands of entries and of the source journals 
makes unnecessary any attempt at an exhaus-
tive recapitulation of Soviet research in cy-
bernetics. However, there is a time-lag be-
tween the publication of research and its in-
clusion in abstract form in the reference sys-
tem. Thus, the index for 1965 is to literature 
much of which goes back to 1964 or earlier. 
Hence a requirement for reviewing and eval-
uating material published during 1965. The 
scope of cybernetics depicted in the index 
demonstrates also the futility of any attempt 
at substantive completeness in such a review. 
Therefore an attempt has been made to pro-
vide only illustrative examples of develop-
ments in theoretical, technical, and applied 
cybernetics. 
A noteworthy attribute of the new, com-
puter-based information-management system 
beyond its contribution to the systematization 
of cybernetics is that it amplifies Soviet re-
search and development capabilities. By fa-
cilitating access to native and world litera-
ture, the information system permits a Soviet 
scientist to build upon rather than duplicate 
precedent research. 
Illustrative of the capability of an informa-
tion system for amplifying research and de-
velopment activities are the findings made in 
an extremely well-done US review completed 
during 1965 of Soviet progress in switching 
theory and logical design.2 It was obvious to 
the reviewer that Soviet authors are generally 
very familiar with nonSoviet work in their 
field, often with surprising promptness, due 
mainly to the availability of an information 
system. As a result of this awareness of non-
Soviet work, there has been relatively little 
duplicated effort by Soviet researchers on 
problems of switching theory and logical de-
sign that have already been adequately 
treated outside of the Soviet Union. It was 
noted that there was negligible duplication

Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
-SireHLT._ 
and overlap of results between publications of 
different Soviet authors; each contribution 
is usually related very carefully to the perti-
nent contributions that precede it. 
The status of switching theory and logical 
design in the USSR measured in terms of the 
accumulated technical content of past publi-
cations and the amount of significant activity 
in recent publications was found to be behind 
that in the US. On the other hand, the re-
viewer reaffirmed the pre-eminence of the So-
viet Union in particular aspects of the field, 
namely, complexity estimates for switching 
networks, certain minimization problems, the 
analysis of relay-type circuitry, the selection 
of logical primitives (building blocks), and 
the development and use of certain methods 
for the synthesis of multi-terminal contact 
networks. It is highly likely that pre-emi-
nence in these particular problems of cyber-
netics was achievable because Soviet scientists 
could concentrate on them knowing that in-
ternational progress in the other aspects of 
switching theory would be made available 
through the information system. 
The philosophical overview which is the 
basis for the new information-management 
system also facilitates more efficient manage-
ment of personnel, facilities, and projects in-
terrelated in the cybernetics program. The 
concept of optimal control lends functional 
unity to the program; the philosophical over-
view expressed in a "problem-tree" for cyber-
netics prescribes how the various parts of the 
program are to interrelate in performing pro-
grammed functions. The Soviets reached a 
new high during 1965 in the use of the in-
formation system and other management 
techniques for the consolidation of the cyber-
netics program. 
ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
DURING 1965 
New Research Facilities 
The research base of the Soviet cybernetics 
program was expanded with the establishment 
of new institutes at Tashkent, Yerevan, Minsk, 
Baku, Gorkiy, and Leningrad and with the 
creation of one "cybernetics center" in Kiev 
and possibly another in Moscow.* The Insti-
tute of Cybernetics at Tashkent, a part of the 
Uzbek Academy of Science, is the first one of 
its kind in Central Asia. With its computer 
center it is to concentrate on the economic 
planning and management of chemical and 
other enterprises found in the Uzbek Republic 
and elsewhere in Central Asia. To a lesser 
degree the Tashkent institute will engage also 
in theoretical research in biocybernetics. 
The Institute of Cybernetics at Yerevan 
was created by a reorganization of the Joint 
Computer Center of the Armenian Academy 
and of the Yerevan State University. Its ef-
forts are concentrated on the application of 
cybernetics to the social sciences and especi-
ally to economics, mathematical linguistics 
and machine translation, archeology, and so-
ciology. An Institute of Technical Cybernet-
ics, Byelorussian Academy of Sciences, was 
created at Minsk during 1965. 
The new Institute of Cybernetics at Baku 
is the result of a reorganization of the Com-
puter Center, Azerbaydzhan Academy of Sci-
ences. According to D. A. Babayev, its deputy 
director, the new institute has been directed 
by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, 
USSR, to concentrate on theoretical and ap-
plied problems in cybernetics. The special 
topics of theoretical cybernetics to be pur-
sued include research on the theory of finite 
automata, the theory of functions, the theory 
of operators, and other aspects of mathemat-
ics applicable to cybernetics. The second 
main trend involves the application of cyber-
netics to the solution of major complex prob-
lems connected with the development and 
management of Azerbaydzhan's petrochem-
istry-based industry. The institute will have 
14 laboratories. One will deal with develop-
ment of methods of research and control of 
processes occurring in petroleum-bearing rock 
strata. Another laboratory will develop de-
vices for storing and processing scientific and 
technical information for petroleum-refining 
and petro-chemical enterprises. A third lab-
* Research facilities at established cybernetics in-
stitutes are being expanded also. For example, con-
struction began during 1965 of an eleven-story 
laboratory for the Institute of Cybernetics in Tbilisi.

oratory will be concerned with the use of cur-
rently available computers and their mod-
ernization. 
The facility at Gorkiy is the Scientific Re-
search Institute of Applied Mathematics and 
Cybernetics, Gorkiy State University. Re-
search there has been concerned with the 
synthesis of nonlinear control systems.3-5 
The research facility opened at Leningrad 
during 1965 is the Institute for Complex So-
cial Research. It is the first scientific in-
stitution in the USSR in which mathematical 
and classical sociological methods are applied 
"on an equal footing" in approaching the 
problems of "man and society." * It has nine 
laboratories to cover a wide field of research 
in problem areas such as economic control, 
engineering psychology, work physiology, 
programmed instruction, and the "compre-
hensive study of the individual." 6 
The plans for the first of several "cyber-
netic centers" were completed by the Ukrain-
ian Academy of Sciences on 17 September 
1965. The Institute of Cybernetics in Kiev 
will be the nucleus of the center which will 
include departments for theoretical and eco-
nomic cybernetics, a computing center, a bio-
cybernetics department, a design bureau, and 
an experimental factory. The center will be 
used also to train cybernetics specialists in 
planning and management of the national 
economy, computer manufacturing, industrial 
automation, theoretical economics, and in bi-
ology and medicine. Housing plans for the 
center call for accommodations for 6,000 
people.7 What is possibly the second "cyber-
netics center" is under construction in south-
east Moscow. It will probably have as its 
nucleus the new and considerably expanded 
facility for the Institute of Automatics and 
Telemechanics (Engineering Cybernetics) .8 
* Many proposals have been made to US founda-
tions to establish a "Rand-type" institution for the 
study of social system dynamics and for the formu-
lation of mathematical models of the transition 
processes of societies. As yet there is no such es-
tablishment in the US. Recent US Government 
awareness of the vital importance of the social re-
construction dimension of the Vietnam conflict is 
motivating systems-oriented companies such as 
those in the aerospace industry to move into the 
field of social systems research.

New Soviet Publications 
The most significant of the four cybernet-
ics-related journals which began publication 
in the USSR during 1965 is Kibernetika (Cy-
bernetics) , an organ of the Ukrainian Acad-
emy of Sciences. V. M. Glushkov* is chief of 
an editorial board which includes such out-
standing Soviet Bloc scientists as A. A. Lya-
punov, A. A. Dorodnitsyn, S. L. Sobolev, and 
A. A. Stogniy. Issues received to date have 
emphasized automata and algorithm theory, 
computer theory, the theory of models, tech-
niques for simulation of human thought proc-
esses, information systems, and mathematical 
linguistics. 
The new journal, Avtometriya (Automeas-
uring), focuses on the theory and engineer-
ing of elements and systems for automated 
measurement procedures and for the trans-
mission of the resulting information. Its 
chief editor, K. B. Karandeyev, is Director of 
the Institute of Automatics and Electromeas-
uring at Novosibirsk and the deputy editor 
is M. P. Tsapenko of the same institute. 
Karandeyev and Tsapenko are chairman and 
deputy chairman, respectively, of the Section 
for Measurement Information Systems of the 
Cybernetics Council which recommended es-
tablishment of such a journal in September 
1964. 
A third new journal, Ekonomika i Mate-
maticheskiye Metody (Economics and Mathe-
matical Methods) , is edited by N. P. Feder-
enko of the Economics Section of the Cyber-
netics Council. The publication of Voprosy 
Teoreticheskoy Kibernetiki (Problems of 
Theoretical Cybernetics) began during 1965 
under the editorship of V. M. Glushkov. It 
complements the journal, Technical Cyber-
netics, which appeared during 1963.** 
* Glushkov is director of the Kiev Institute of 
Cybernetics, vice-president of the Ukrainian Acad-
emy of Sciences, a member of the Cybernetics Coun-
cil, Academy of Sciences, USSR, and an official of 
the State Committee for Science and Technology. 
** Soviet scientists also serve as editors of new 
serial publications for 1965 issued by Satellite or-
ganizations. One of these is ELK: Elektronische 
Informations veranbeitung und Kybernetik (Elec-
tronic Information Processing and Cybernetics) 
published in East Germany.

Major Meetings 
Conferences are used by the Cybernetics 
Council as a management tool for organizing, 
integrating, and monitoring research pro-
grams on specialized as well as on more gen-
eral problems of cybernetics.9 
The First All-Union Symposium on Auto-
matic Pattern Recognition was held in June 
1965.* The more than 60 papers presented 
dealt with such problems as the automation 
of data input to computers, methods for rec-
ognizing petroliferous strata, how to incor-
porate pattern recognition in universal auto-
mata capable of self-orientation in their en-
vironments, construction of machine analogs 
of the sensory organs of living organisms, and 
how to automate medical diagnosis pro-
cedures.10 
The First All-Union Conference on Experi-
ment Planning** was devoted to the use of 
modern techniques for planning and manag-
ing scientific and engineering research proj-
ects. It recommended the following: (i) Crea-
tion of a scientific research and consultation 
center for the study of experiment planning 
operations; (ii) conversion of the Problem 
Laboratory of Automation and Telemechanics 
of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute 
into a problem laboratory for the VUZ system; 
(iii) organization of courses for training re-
search planning specialists in the application 
of mathematical statistics; and (iv) provision 
in the plans of the State Committee of the 
Chemical Industry in association with Gos-
plan USSR for scientific research toward the 
broad introduction of mathematical methods 
of experiment planning in laboratory, pilot, 
and full-scale installations.,, 12 
The Second Symposium on Cybernetics was 
held at Tbilisi during November 1965 with 
Chairman of the Cybernetics Council, A. I. 
Berg, presiding. Approximately 130 papers 
* As early as 1963 it had been reported that 
classified research an automatic pattern recogni-
tion systems was being conducted under the direc-
tion of M. V. Keldysh at "his institute." According 
to a Soviet scientist, this research was "not in the 
plan." The symposium reports may have included 
some of the heretofore classified information. 
** This conference sponsored by the Cybernetics 
Council was held in December 1964 but was not re-
ported until July 1965. 
were presented by scientists representing the 
many scientific centers located in Moscow, 
Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Minsk, Tallin, Kiev, 
Baku, Yerevan and in other cities. The prob-
lems designated by the Cybernetics Council 
for consideration by the symposium were: (i) 
Analysis and synthesis of cybernetic systems; 
(ii) operations research; (iii) problems of 
heuristics and artificial intelligence; and (iv) 
programming languages and logical struc-
tures."-'5 
The Third All-Union Conference on Auto-
matic Control (Technical Cybernetics) opened 
in the Odessa Opera House on 20 September 
1965 and continued for five days aboard the 
steamship Admiral Nakhimail on the Black 
Sea. Two important technical addresses were 
delivered at the opening session, the first by 
V. A. Trapeznikov, chief organizer of the con-
ference, and the second by Ya. Z. Tsypkin. 
Trapeznikov's talk on the subject of "Auto-
matic Control and Economics" emphasized 
the importance of a logical hierarchy of 
control in large industrial systems, starting 
with a well-regulated and dependable lower-
level control which functions according to 
references set by higher-level controllers, but 
which can function well without constant cor-
rections from the higher level. Trapeznikov 
emphasized the importance of the proper de-
velopment of computer control of large-scale 
processes and in particular the use of a 
hierarchical control structure for maximum 
efficiency and reliability. Because of the dif-
ficulty in knowing accurately the process 
dynamics in advance, he also stressed the im-
portance of developing self-adaptive systems. 
Professor Tsypkin presented a rather spec-
ulative paper on a unified theory of cyber-
netics. He referred to three models for con-
trol systems: deterministic, stochastic, and 
self-adaptive, and to the diverse methods of 
analysis, synthesis, and optimization which 
have been applied to these models. He then 
spoke about a new method he has developed 
which embodies mathematical programming, 
stochastic approximation, and optimization 
theory. This method is claimed to allow the 
study of control systems, learning systems, 
and pattern recognition systems from a uni-

fled point of view. Although he had, at that 
time, only succeeded in solving problems 
which have already been solved by other 
methods, he seemed confident that his new 
method could be useful in attacking unsolved 
general problems of cybernetics. 
Substantive topics discussed included op-
timal systems, where the emphasis still seemed 
to be concentrated on the restricted class of 
problems amenable to analytical synthesis, al-
though there were two papers which dealt 
with computational aspects of optimization. 
Optimal control of distributed parameter sys-
tems also was discussed in two presentations. 
The two sessions on the theory of nonlinear 
systems were devoted to two major topics: 
stability conditions for nonlinear systems and 
the theory and design of control systems with 
variable structure. This latter topic, which 
has been extensively studied by Emel'yanov 
and his co-workers at the Institute of Auto-
matics and Telemechanics, deals mainly with 
switching feedback structures which can 
cause the overall system to operate in the so-
called "sliding mode," i.e., a regime where the 
feedback structure is switched rapidly and 
the system state "slides" toward equilibrium 
along the switching boundary. One of the 
advantageous aspects of such a design is the 
fact that while in the "sliding mode" the over-
all system response is insensitive to variable 
or unknown plant parameters, and is deter-
mined entirely by controllable feedback pa-
rameters. Much of the research on such sys-
tems has been concerned with extending the 
analysis to higher order systems, designing 
the proper switching hyperplanes for such 
systems, and obtaining theoretical conditions 
for the existence of sliding modes. 
In the three sessions devoted to statistical 
methods in control theory there were an un-
usually large number of papers on the prob-
lem of optimal control of stochastic systems 
indicating considerable research activity on 
this very difficult subject in optimal control 
theory. To US observers at the meeting, the 
formulation and approach seemed to be on 
a somewhat more practical statistical design 
basis than the work being done in the US. 
Stochastic control is an extremely impor-
tant subject. It is involved in handling the 
complexities of the control of large systems 
characterized by uncertainties. The theory 
used in approaching such systems realistically 
is the theory of probability, of which the 
theory of stochastic processes is a chapter. 
The uncertainties arise because of errors in 
measurement, in data processing, in control, 
and in formulation. In order to take these 
into account, a theory of stochastic processes 
is required. Although this theory was created 
in the US, the most significant work is now 
being done in the USSR by I. V. Romanovsky, 
L. I. Rozonoev, R. L. Stratonovich, N. N. Kra-
sovsky, and A. A. Fel'dbaum. 
The theory of stochastic processes intro-
duces random variables with known proba-
bility distributions to simulate some of the 
features of uncertainty in actual processes. 
In connection with the interception problem, 
for example, it is necessary to determine a 
number of unknown parameters, e.g., what 
is it?, where did it come from? This can be 
done on the basis of sequential estimation, 
"learning," at the same time decisions are 
made. These are particular cases at the 
juncture of stochastic control theory and 
adaptive processes, to which Fel'dbaum gave 
the name "dual control processes" which have 
great relevance to military operations. 
In addition to the regular sessions of the 
Technical Cybernetics Conference there were 
special discussions devoted to the adjunct 
fields of automata theory, learning systems, 
pattern recognition, and to applications of 
cybernetics to large-scale systems. The gen-
eral impression formed by US attendees was 
that most of the computer control work in 
the Soviet Union is still in the planning stage, 
or in the limited application stage where the 
computer is used as a data processing and 
display unit for the improvement of manual 
control, but not in the closed-loop control 
stage.17 
Following the technical cybernetics confer-
ence by five days was the Second Scientific 
Conference on Neuro-Cybernetics of the 
Schools of Higher Education at Rostov-on-

Don. Cosponsors of this conference with the 
Cybernetics Council were the Ministry of 
Higher and Secondary Specialized Education 
of the USSR; the Ministry of Higher and Sec-
ondary Specialized Education of the RSFSR; 
the Scientific Council on the Problems of 
Physiology, USSR Academy of Sciences; and 
the Rostov State University. 
The bureaucratic stature and multiplicity 
of the conference sponsors, the academic 
stature of many members of its organizing 
committee, and the comprehensiveness of its 
agenda all testify to the rapidly increasing 
significance attached by the Soviets to neuro-
cybernetics. Sections were devoted to the or-
ganization of functional brain systems; elec-
trophysiological correlates of behavior; models 
of psychophysiological structures and behav-
ioral processes; and heuristic programming. 
That there was a section on heuristic pro-
gramming is of significance; the Soviets are 
late-comers to this field. Most of the papers 
dealing with heuristic programming were pre-
sented by personnel of the Laboratory of In-
formation Processes of the Brain, Moscow 
State University (MGU). Since 1959 the 
MGU group has been analyzing those param-
eters that are present in the structure of in-
formational situations and which provide pos-
sibilities for use in the formulation of search 
strategies (algorithms or heuristics) for prob-
lem solving or pattern recognition. The re-
ports reveal that, in general, the Soviet ap-
proaches to heuristic programming are sim-
ilar to and based upon US work. Somewhat 
distinctive is the obvious Soviet attempt to 
identify the neurological and psycho-physio-
logical bases of heuristic modes of behavior. 
Napalkov described the development of 
EPSS (Heuristic Program for Self-Organiza-
tion and Self-Teaching). It consists of a sys-
tem of intercoordinated subroutines of vari-
ous levels, each of which organizes and mon-
itors the program of a lower level. He claims 
that EPSS is well suited to self-organization 
in cases of complex, multilevel bounded en-
vironments where the applicability of other 
programs of different types is shown to be 
impossible. 
In analyzing the heuristics used by man in 
chess playing, 0. K. Tikhomirov and his as-
sociates made movies of players' eye move-
ments and cyclographic recordings of touch-
and-feel movements of blind players. The re-
search indicated that one of these motor func-
tions (eye and hand movements) consists of 
"recall" of particular configuration possibili-
ties at different stages, and that there is a 
direct reflection in motor functions of those 
alternatives which the person has specifically 
studied. Subjects were found to fix attention 
to some "zone of operations" which changes 
constantly in accordance with the game situ-
ation and forecasts of progress based upon 
a heuristic of the player. A comparison with 
a verbal account shows that there is reflected 
in the subjects' motor activity a much larger 
number of playback moves than the subjects' 
verbal account indicates. This suggests two 
interacting levels of play selection based upon 
reducing search possibilities which are un-
duplicated in any existing machine programs 
for chess playing. 
Emotional states were also considered by 
Tikhomirov as a component of heuristics. He 
continuously monitored galvanic skin resist-
ance (GSR) of subjects in problem solving 
situations and found that an abrupt and 
sharply expressed drop in skin resistance oc-
curred when the subject "had a new idea" 
or "found the solution." These emotional re-
sponses precede the conscious evaluation of 
the "idea" which are made afterwards. These 
results suggest that evaluation of the emo-
tional component define and limit the zone of 
the subsequent search and thereby serve as 
heuristics. 
Speakers discussed the problem of defining 
the characteristics of and the relationships 
between conscious and unconscious activity 
in problem solving activity as these relate to 
heuristic programming. The solution to this 
problem according to V. N. Pushkin is con-
nected with neurocybernetics applications of 
the concept of internal or brain models of 
objects and the realities of the external world. 
Man's ideas or images can be examined as 
informational cognitive models of reality, each 
of which represents a complex cognitive sys-
tem that embraces verbal, motor, and graphic

components. Dynamic information models 
of the problem situation are created in man's 
brain during the definition stages of problem-
solving. However, even in this case there re-
mains an unresolved question: why are some 
manifestations of the operation of a dynamic 
model perceived, while others remain unper-
ceivable? This question leads to a wider prob-
lem: just how is man's conscious activity a 
unique psycho-physiological process of the 
brain? Studies of problem-solving and of 
creative activity in science and technology by 
Pushkin lead to his formulation of a cyber-
netic scheme in which intra-gray-matter self-
regulation is considered an internal mech-
anism for such activity. From the viewpoint 
of this scheme, the totality of the information 
models in the brain of man, with their oral, 
visual, and motor components, represents 
control systems, the functioning of which is 
regulated by a control block in the brain 
(a gray-matter regulator). The problem con-
fronting the person is represented in this reg-
ulator from the viewpoint of some existing 
model in the person's brain. There is a basis 
for thinking that the gray-matter regulator 
in turn represents a complex system, and, 
thus, that the control of the problem-solving 
process is carried out at several different 
levels. 
The forward part of the frontal lobe is hy-
pothecated to be a higher-order regulator of 
gray-matter modeling activity. The follow-
ing anatomical and clinical phenomena lend 
support to this proposition: (i) the afferent 
and efferent fibers which connect this portion 
of the brain with the other regions of the 
cortex; (ii) the specific mental aberrations of 
frontal lobe diseases, the essential feature of 
which is an inability to come to grips with a 
problem and the absence of intellectual aware-
ness; (iii) the impairment of control over 
one's thinking processes in schizophrenia and 
the characteristic alterations in the behavior 
of patients after a lobotomy. 
Thus, the cortex, as a regulator for the 
organism and its behavior in the surrounding 
world, can itself be thought of as a unique 
self-controlling system, consisting of a regu-
lator for controlling an object and of feed-
back channels between them. The conscious 
10 
activity of a man in the process of solving a 
creative problem is a function of the inter-
action of the gray-matter regulator with the 
brain's information models. When the proc-
ess of modeling items from the external world 
finds a match in the gray-matter regulator, 
the problem solution is perceived. In those 
cases where the components of the problem 
solution are not perceived, the dynamic mod-
els in the brain function autonomously. 
The vital element of any control process is 
the image of the object in the regulator. 
Therefore, the explication of the structure of 
the language of intra-gray-matter regulation, 
by means of which an image of the informa-
tion control models is maintained in the reg-
ulator, is one of the important tasks facing 
contemporary neurocybernetic research into 
the mechanisms of heuristic activity. It can 
be presumed that this same language is uti-
lized for encoding a problem situation pre-
sented to a person, the resultant solution to 
which is a function of creative (heuristic) 
activity. Another important problem here is 
that of investigating the different levels of 
the regulation process in the major cortical 
hemispheres during problem-solving. 
The experiments of Pushkin's group leads 
them to the conclusion that research on the 
role of the brain's design of informational 
models in effective self-regulation is the path 
to solution of a whole series of practical ques-
tions of heuristic programming which US in-
vestigators have left unanswered.* Abstracts 
of the proceedings of the Neurocybernetics 
Conference reveal that the Soviets left un-
answered the basic problem to which the 
meeting was addressed: how to create "an 
artificial intellect." The proceedings do tes-
tify, however, to the fact that mathema-
ticians, psychologists, engineers, and physi-
cians from major cities of the USSR and from 
Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslo-
vakia, and Yugoslavia are at least talking 
about the problem." 
* M. Gaaze-Rapaport, a member of the Cyber-
netics Council, reported at the Second All-Union 
Symposium on Cybernetics (Tbilisi, 24-27 November 
1965) that the Soviets are trying to construct com-
plex machine modeling units based on Pushkin's 
hypothesis about the formation in the human brain 
of some approximate model of the outside world.

Regular meetings of the Cybernetics Coun-
cil were convened during 1965 on a bi-weekly 
basis. The proceedings of these sessions are 
not published. But accounts of Soviet activi-
ties in specialized fields occasionally refer in 
retrospect to the role of council meetings in 
the development of programs in those research 
areas. An ad hoc council meeting on teach-
ing machines and programmed instruction is 
a case in point. During 1961 when Soviet 
research on these teaching aids was nil, a 
group of Soviet educators and psychologists 
attended a UNESCO meeting on programmed 
instruction and other modern approaches to 
the tutorial process. They came away con-
vinced that adoption of these new method-
ologies was urgently needed by the USSR. 
This conviction was communicated to the 
Psychology Section of the Cybernetics Council 
which then convened a meeting on the matter 
which subsequently passed on its favorable 
recommendations to the Council for Coordi-
nation of Science and Technology. There, 
after additional and broader discussions, a de-
cision was made to adopt the new techniques, 
and the recommendation was passed on to the 
Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized 
Education of the RSFSR. He in turn issued 
a directive to establish research programs to 
provide a scientific basis for improving the 
educational methodology of the USSR. Simi-
lar chronologies could be described for the 
adoption of heuristic programming, PERT, 
and for various other tools of scientific man-
agement about which recommendations were 
transmitted via this channel. 
THEORETICAL CYBERNETICS DEVELOPMENTS 
(PATTERN RECOGNITION)* 
General 
The most significant tendency of the Soviet 
cybernetics program observed during 1965 
was toward collaborative research involving 
some of the best mathematicians, biologists, 
engineers, and psychologists of the USSR. 
Representative of these efforts is research on 
* Because this report is a general survey of events 
in the cybernetics program and not a comprehen-
sive account of Soviet cybernetics research activ-
ities, only one sample of the significant trends ob-
served during the year is discussed. 
pattern recognition, a field in which the in-
terdisciplinary approach has helped the So-
viets to reach a high plane of accomplish-
ment. Soviet work in pattern recognition was 
selected as an exemplar of the interdiscipli-
nary research reviewed during 1965 because 
of its centrality to a number of the cyber-
netics program's facets. The development of 
heuristic programming, adaptive systems, and 
other building blocks for cybernetic systems 
share a common dependence on pattern rec-
ognition. As is true in heuristics, the meth-
ods used to distinguish patterns involve es-
sentially the use of rules of thumb selected 
by a computer over a series of trials on the 
sole basis that they seemed to work; that is, 
they made discriminations of the sort desired 
by the computer programmer. The tie of pat-
tern recognition devices to the design of self-
adaptive control systems is slightly more in-
volved. When unpredictable or excessively 
rapid changes occur in the environment of a 
control system such that ordinary system 
identification (measurement and interpreta-
tion) and subsequent optimal control based 
on it, become difficult, one must resort to sta-
tistical assumptions as to most likely values, 
i.e., a probability distribution. On this basis 
a decision has then to be made on the proper 
control for ,optimization; this indicates that 
a control policy or law has to be set up. "De-
cision-adaptive" is the name given to con-
trollers of this sort by some US scientists. 
Where the probability distribution is not 
known at the outset, the use of a learning 
decision-adaptive controller is invoked. Meas-
urements are classified into a series of control 
situations and suitable control policy is de-
cided on both the immediate control situation 
and also on past control situations. In this 
respect the decision-adaptive control system 
is a pattern recognition device and a control 
situation is a particular pattern of the plant 
environment. It is the aim of the control 
to recognize the pattern and from it to decide 
the control law which will give an optimum. 
Pattern recognition is related also to in-
formation theory. A collection of scientific 
works devoted to this aspect of pattern recog-
11

nition associated with noiseproof coding of 
information and allied problems was published 
during the year by the Institute of Informa-
tion Transmission Problems, Academy of 
Sciences, USSR.19 
The study of man, the archetypical pattern 
recognition system, is at the root of this 
research problem. Even untrained human 
beings are credited with the ability to recog-
nize a person's identity from the pattern of 
his handwriting, of his voice, or of his writing 
or singing style. Early work in pattern rec-
ognition stemmed from an admiration of the 
facility of humans to learn with ease these 
common patterns, and from an admiration of 
their high degree of accuracy in recognizing 
the patterns in different handwriting and 
thereby to identify the authors. 
The scientific field of automatic pattern rec-
ognition grew from the vague notions of look-
ing for the common patterns and from at-
tempts to construct machines that can recog-
nize patterns to approximate, in performance, 
the ability of humans to do the same. Its 
two major problems, namely, "machine learn-
ing" and "recognition" or classification were 
distinguished several years earlier in the US 
than in the Soviet Union. Some scientists 
in pattern recognition argue that if humans 
(or even simple biological systems) can do 
pattern recognition with ease, then one ought 
to model biological systems by a partial simu-
lation of their internal structures and perhaps 
similar performance might result. The term 
"bionics" is applied to work based on this 
premise. 
Another group of pattern recognition work-
ers considers that "learning" and "recogni-
tion" problems of pattern recognition can be 
formulated in mathematical terms as prob-
lems of recognition of membership in classes, 
and that some solutions can be obtained 
through the application of one of the mathe-
matical disciplines such as group theory, set 
theory, Boolean algebra, integral geometry, 
communication theory, statistical decision 
theory, and others. The common starting 
point of each of these methods is to represent 
an input by a set of measurements, variously 
12 
called features, receptors, parameters, coordi-
nate dimensions, clues, properties or attri-
butes. Each input that belongs to a given 
class can be regarded as a vector in a vector 
space and is located at a point defined by the 
set of measurements. A class is a collection 
of points scattered in some manner in the 
vector space (often referred to as observation 
or measurement space). Members of two dif-
ferent classes, A and B, are distributed, in 
general, in different manners in the space. 
Machine learning (or learning what the pat-
tern is) is regarded by all of the above disci-
plines as the problem of determining the best 
shape and location of regions in the vector 
space so that A's and B's should become sep-
arated into regions called A and B. Pattern 
recognition or classification is the act of nam-
ing the region (A or B) in which the meas-
urements made on a new input are contained. 
The three parts of pattern recognition sys-
tems are illustrated by the block diagram in 
figure 1. This shows the observation system 
that represents the input by a set of meas-
urements. The methods used to process in-
puts of known classification to discover their 
common pattern and thus to develop a good 
partition of the vector space is referred to 
as "learning." The act of evaluating a new 
input to decide in which partition of the space 
it is contained is performed by the classifica-
tion or recognition system. In the final anal-
ysis all recognition systems can be regarded 
as table look-ups for they all associate a pre-
viously stored decision with each possible in-
put and for the same input they always render 
the same decision. Of course, there are major 
differences in the manner in which different 
recognition systems store the decisions that 
should be made at any one of an infinite num-
ber of points in the vector space while they 
possess only a finite capacity of information 
storage. The important difference between 
different pattern recognition techniques, how-
ever, is not in the recognition system but in 
the learning system where the way in which 
partitions are obtained from the learning 
samples and where the restrictions on the 
type of obtainable partitions are determined.

A comprehensive discussion of these and 
other fundamental aspects of the theory of 
pattern recognition and its application to the 
design of reading automata was published 
during the year by the Laboratory of Reading 
Automata, Institute of Cybernetics, Academy 
of Sciences, Ukrainian SSR.2� A wide circle 
of problems related to the theory of pattern 
recognition, modeling of various algorithms 
and discriminating systems on electronic com-
puters, and to the design of reading automata 
are examined in this handbook. In addition, 
reading automata and their components 
which were developed and manufactured in 
the Institute of Cybernetics, Academy of Sci-
ences, Ukrainian SSR are discussed. Al-
though this handbook was published during 
1965, it describes work done in the 1963-64 
period by V. A. Kovalevskiy, M. I. Shlezinger, 
L. A. Svyatogor, V. K. Yeliseyev and others. 
Its value lies in its usefulness as a source of 
background data to complement the 1965 re-
search in pattern recognition. 
Psychobiological Approaches 
An algorithm for pattern recognition de-
scribed by A. G. Frantsuz is said to simulate 
certain features of the human pattern recog-
nition system.21 It is made up of minimiza-
tion of the description (reduction to separa-
tion without selection of a subspace which is 
optimal in some sense) , and construction in 
this subspace of a local decision rule. Fran-
tsuz notes that there are some analogies be-
tween this algorithm and the functional al-
gorithm for recognition of shapes by biologi-
cal analyzers. Although the limitations of 
the possible analogies are not established, 
Frantsuz is apparently working along those 
lines; a paper on the subject by him and his 
colleagues at the Military Medical Academy 
imeni S. M. Kirov was presented at a sym-
posium there on cybernetics and clinical med-
icine during 1964. 
Pattern recognition as it relates to problem 
solving by humans has been a concern of 
I. M. Gel'f and, a mathematician, and of M. L. 
Tsetlin, an engineer, since at least 1962. In 
developing mathematical programming meth-
ods for finding a minimum of a function of 
many variables and for searching for min-
ima, they chose to study the way men and 
animals solve such problems. This approach 
was taken for the reason discussed below. 
In general, a perfect model of a complex tech-
nical system which one might wish to control 
is unsatisfactory because it is too complex. 
It is necessary to have some measures of what 
control variables are important and of the 
effectiveness of the system. Animal opera-
tions in natural environments involve a mas-
sive number of variables but only certain ones 
are chosen as being of importance. Gel'fand 
and Tsetlin are trying to model this selection 
procedure in what is tantamount to a general 
model of how the brain finds a local region of 
control in phase space. Although this prob-
lem may be amenable to analysis, solution 
algorithms are too complex. Therefore, 
oblique algorithms are sought such as one for 
finding the minimum of a function of many 
variables. Now the problem of finding the 
extremum of a function of more than five 
variables is probably an impossible task even

on computers unless help is forthcoming from 
insights into the patterns or organization pro-
cedures used by man. Gel'fand, head of the 
research group: Regulatory Mechanisms of 
the Central Nervous System at the Institute 
of Neurosurgery imeni N. N. Burdenko, is try-
ing to gain such insights into physiological 
control mechanisms for subsequent improve-
ment of mathematical programming for use 
in artificial control systems. He also con-
tinues his association with the Mathematics 
Institute of Moscow State University and the 
Institute of Biological Physics of the Academy 
of Sciences, USSR. 
From his analyses of organisms as if they 
were optimizing automata exposed to a 
changeable environment, and from detailed 
investigations of what types of functions of 
available inputs are used for optimization of 
overall criteria, Gel'fand's group is develop-
ing new mathematical programming methods. 
Decision makers in the Soviet economy may 
use these methods in situations such as the 
following: the computation of a global ex-
14 
tremum in nonconvex programming problems 
faced by economists requires a determination 
of all local extrema and a comparison at the 
corresponding values of objective functions. 
Gel'f and's group is contributing approximate 
methods for the computer solution of special 
classes of nonconvex extremal problems as 
a result of their neurocybernetic research. 
That they have not yet developed general 
methods for the computer solution of noncon-
vex nonlinear problems is probably attribut-
able in part to the incompleteness of their 
hypothesis about the computational and pat-
tern recognition systems employed by the 
brain.22-25 
The influence of emotional factors on pat-
tern recognition and other psychic factors was 
incorporated in a model developed at the Kiev 
Institute of Cybernetics.26 It is a simple, sim-
ulated model (see figure 2) for information 
processing based on the interaction of two 
types of programs, "intellectual" and "emo-
tional." The intellectual program is devel-
oped to reflect certain logical principles, and

the emotional program is developed to reflect 
the relation of reality to the needs and mo-
tives underlying emotional behavior. The 
emotional program is based on the behavior 
of a given person. The intellectual program 
of the model under consideration is designed 
to recognize words and phrases, and the emo-
tional program takes into account certain 
features of behavior and memory organiza-
tion. The emotional program on the basis 
of input word analysis, that is, "harmful-use-
ful" or "pleasant-unpleasant," affects or even 
changes the intellectual program, and the 
latter in turn affects emotion development. 
The intellectual program is capable of improv-
ing its solutions on the basis of changes in 
the permanent memory unit. 
Bionics Approaches 
The Cybernetics Council's Bionics Section 
published the first comprehensive Soviet col-
lection of articles on bionics during 1965.27 
The bionics effort as revealed therein is con-
cerned mostly with the construction of ma-
chines which can perform those information 
processing functions which are the bases of 
pattern recognition and related activities in 
a manner analogous to the way living systems 
perform such activities. Interrelated in such 
research are scientists who study natural 
phenomena and mathematicians and engi-
neers who use the results of these studies as 
the bases for the construction of machine 
analogies of the natural information trans-
formation functions. Thus, for example, 
studies of the pattern recognition apparatus 
in living systems become the bases for the 
construction of self-teaching, adaptive ma-
chines. An experimental model of one such 
machine is shown in figure 3. This automa-
ton which learns to recognize visual patterns 
was designed by Ye. K. Aleksandrov and his 
associates. 
In a similar vein, research on natural neu-
rons, neuron nets, receptors, and analyzors 
has been translated into hardware models 
which carry out the information transforma-
tion functions of the living prototypes after 
which the hardware is modeled. To cite a 
few examples of these research and engineer-
ing activities, E. K. Kazimirov has created a 
mathematical model of a neuron and using 
transistors constructed a working hardware 
model on the basis of the mathematical 
scheme. V. G. Totsenko and B. M. Yegorov 
constructed networks from artificial neurons 
and are now concerned with increasing the

reliability of such assemblies. The studies by 
I. B. Gutchin and A. S. Kuzichev on the re-
liability of natural neuron nets are contribut-
ing to efforts to improve the reliability of 
artificial nets. A more ambitious project to 
model the human psyche has arrived at the 
stage at which a rather gross block diagram 
of the information transformation functions 
of the human brain has been formu1ated.28-32 
Mathematical Approaches 
Ya. I. Khurgin and V. I. Loginov have re-
ported on a number of algorithms for divid-
ing objects into classes in a manner analo-
gous to the way the brain learns to process 
a series of representative of these classes. 
They view the problem of division of objects 
into classes as equivalent to the problem of 
selection of a class of functionals like M = (f), 
separating the forms into the corresponding 
space, and subsequent selection in class M of 
the functional f�, which minimizes the defined 
conditions, such as the probability of error. 
The selection of functional f�, is performed on 
the basis of the available data by use of a 
teaching sequence. The problem of form rec-
ognition, from the probability theory point of 
view, therefore amounts to development of a 
deciding rule for differentiation of hypotheses 
under conditions when only the empirical dis-
tribution is known. An algorithm of recog-
nition is presented by Khurgin and Loginov 
which realizes the minimum probability of 
error.33 
The problem of pattern recognition is ex-
pressed by V. A. Kovalevskiy as a statistical 
statement. It is formed in terms of the min-
imization of risk with production of experi-
mental data characterizing unknown param-
eters of some laws of probability distribution. 
This statement of the problem allows produc-
tion of evaluations of the minimal length of 
a teaching sequence. The evaluations pro-
duced for the length of teaching lead to the 
conclusion of the importance of the role of 
a priori limitations applied to the results of 
teaching -before the beginning of the experi-
ment. The use of a hierarchy of rules for 
solution, ordered as to complexity, allows pro-
duction of an algorithm which will provide 
for a certain result with a period of teaching 
16 
as short as needed. Although Kovalevskiy 
agrees that this approach cannot solve the 
problems involved in creating what he calls 
a "universal learning automaton," he believes 
that by integrating his ideas with the per-
ception approach of certain US scientists, a 
practical, applied method for construction of 
teaching and self-teaching machines is feas-
ible." 
Heuristic rules are judged by F. D. Pe-
trovsky to be a good approach to the form 
identification problem. He finds that the 
identification rules based on successive deter-
minations of the membership in some class 
of forms of one of the forms in the set pro-
duced do not allow production of potentially 
effective identification algorithms. He sug-
gests a potentially effective identification rule 
for the set of forms produced with sets of 
forms defined on the basis of learning and 
analyzes heuristic modifications of the op-
timal rule which are convenient for realiza-
tion of identification algorithms on com-
puters.3' 
The use of a pattern recognition system 
as a self-organizing system�a corrector with 
feedback�in systems for the control of multi-
dimensional processes is recommended by 
A. G. Ivakhnenko. In an analysis of the prob-
lem of extremal control of a multidimensional 
object under the influence of perturbation 
matrix it and control action matrix p., the 
quality index sa is measured continuously, but 
can take on only two values�"satisfactory" 
and "control." Technological considerations 
of set-correlation (regressive) analysis can 
produce the optimal astatic characteristic of 
the object, determining the maximum of the 
quality index p. =ck (A) where = cp max'. 
The closed (determined) portion of the sys-
tem is calculated according to this character-
istic. However, due to inexact determination 
of the characteristics of the object and change 
of its parameters in the process of operation, 
it is necessary to join a self-organizing portion 
to the closed portion of the system. For this 
purpose Ivakhnenko suggests a recognition 
system similar to those used for differentia-
tion of letters or speech sounds. The system 
does not require design and is based on very 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
--smeRzz._ 
little initial information on the object. It 
is sufficient to know that there is a single ex-
treme and that the line of the "poles" of the 
recognition system intersects the astatic char-
acteristic. This information is contained 
with an excess in the data produced for de-
sign of the closed portion. 
With the expansion of the matrices into 
lines, the spatial problem is reduced to a prob-
lem on the plane 14.'�x' (generalized regulat-
ing action�generalized perturbation). The 
order of the expansion of the matrices into 
lines is selected so that the astatic character-
istic of the object is produced with a steady 
increase. In the process of operation of the 
object, this type of curve may be disrupted, 
but only to such an extent that the extreme 
peak can still be divided into a series of "situ-
ations" with straight or broken lines. 
Algorithms are used for self-teaching of the 
recognition system after which it functions as 
a self-tuning model of the object for correc-
tion of the characteristics of the closed por-
tion. Ivakhnenko presented results of such 
modeling of processes of self-teaching or rec-
ognition systems at the Third All-Union Con-
ference on Automatic Control: Technical Cy-
bernetics.36 
Like Ivakhnenko,. Yu. N. Chekhovoy and 
I. P. Kerekesner conisder the place of pattern 
recognition systems in control systems. They 
suggest a combined self-teaching automatic 
control system for transient objects consist-
ing of a multidimensional connection with 
perturbing actions Mo = f (I) [*] and teach-
ing feedback, which connects the functional 
dependence [*] in the memory of the system. 
Here M, is the optimal value of the control 
actions vector, T is the perturbing actions 
vector. The formation of the connections 
r] is accomplished by a recognition system 
which learns to divide space L into areas 
within whose limits there is no need to change 
the control actions vector. These areas are 
called situations. 
The algorithm for recognition of situations 
and the algorithms for teaching the system 
suggested by the authors are analyzed. It is 
shown that teaching the recognition of situa-
tions is a simple Markovian process. The 
Markovian process theory apparatus is used 
for analysis of the convergence of the process 
of teaching. The investigations of conver-
gence are illustrated with examples. Experi-
mental dependencies of the probability of 
error in recognition on the number of steps 
in the teaching process and on the param-
eters of the algorithms analyzed are produced 
as a result of the modeling of the suggested 
algorithms. It is shown that the fixed ter-
minal value of probability of error in recogni-
tion does not depend on the initial state of 
the system.37 
A significant result in pattern classification 
was derived in a recent article by Ayzerman, 
Braverman, and Rozonoer.39 The result is es-
sentially as follows. Consider the variables 
xi forming a pattern vector X. The vector X 
can belong to either one of the two classes 
A or B. Let the probability that X belongs 
to A be denoted by D (x) and assume that 
D(x) = C* (x) where the ( x ) are 
1=1 
members of a known orthonormal set of func-
tions. The Ayzerman-Braverman-Rozonoer al-
gorithm says that D (x) can be computed 
recursively by successive approximations 
through the use of the Novikoff training pro-
cedure with a randomized correction feature. 
The application of the method of potential 
functions to the pattern recognition problem 
as first outlined by M. A. Ayzerman is prob-
ably the major mathematical contribution of 
the Soviets to the problem of teaching auto-
mata to separate input situations into classes. 
During 1965, Ya. L. Tsypkin 40 discovered the 
proximity between problems which are solv-
able by the method of potential functions 
and the problems analyzed in the theory of 
stochastic approximations. Ayzerman and 
his coworkers responding to Tsypkin's discov-
ery carried out a detailed analysis of the in-
terconnection between the method of poten-
tial functions and the Robbins-Monro proc-
ess but not the other methods of the theory 
of stochastic approximations. In addition to 
their other results, they found that the 
method of potential functions can be realized 
by means of a computer or a perceptron, while 
ThEfAZZL 17 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
the Robbins-Monro procedure can be realized 
only by a perceptron. From these analyses 
Ayzerman also concluded that Tsypkin's dis-
covery forms a basis for believing that a more 
general theory covering a wide range of such 
problems will be developed.41 
The Soviets have designed pattern recog-
nition devices which embody such form-recog-
nition algorithms. One such special purpose 
computer was noted as an achievement at the 
year-end review of activities of the Depart-
ment of Mechanics and Control Processes, 
Academy of Sciences, USSR. This depart-
ment, administered by B. V. Petrov, also 
head of the Technical Cybernetics Section, Cy-
bernetics Council, is reported to have designed 
a computer capable of recognizing and distin-
guishing squares, circles, and triangles. The 
department announced in a recent broadcast 
that they hope for a machine able to scan 
complex blueprints and then control ma-
chines manufacturing the components set 
out in these blueprints.42 
A second example taken from the many dis-
cussed in a 1965 Soviet book on reading de-
vices 43 is a character reader built by the Vil-
nius Computing Machinery Plant for scan-
ning alphanumeric text. At the beginning of 
1963, the Computer Center of the Lithuanian 
Academy of Sciences commissioned a "BESM-
2M" computer which made possible the elim-
ination of punched cards and the direct 
coupling of the reader with the computer. 
Similar work was performed at the Institute of 
Cybernetics, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, 
where the reader was connected to a "Kiev"-
type computer (a BESM-2M). These ex-
periences suggest that the best method for in-
puting masses of data into a computer is by 
such direct couplings of reader and computer. 
Soviet approaches to the pattern recogni-
tion problem are, therefore, via the mathe-
matical programming of psychological opera-
tions on the one hand and, on the other, the 
simulation of brain structures involved in pat-
tern recognition systems, thereby simulating 
the integrated physical and psychical appa-
ratuses involved in human pattern recogni-
tion activity. Pattern recognition research is 
illustrative of the Soviet trend observed dur-
18 
ing 1965 toward interdisciplinary research. 
But it is only part of a larger program for 
the realization of "universal automata" des-
tined for use in the optimal control of com-
plex, purposeful, and dynamic systems. Fig-
ure 4 illustrates (with broken lines) the prob-
lem which must be resolved if the over-all cy-
bernetics program is to accomplish its goal. 
TECHNICAL CYBERNETICS DEVELOPMENTS 
Computer Technology 
In May 1965 the Soviets revealed their 
largest known computer, the BESM-6. This 
machine has been evaluated as a marked 
advance in the Soviet computer-engineering 
art, incorporating all-solid-state construction, 
speeds more commensurate with special appli-
cation demands than in any previously known 
Soviet machine (up to 1,000,000 opns/sec) , 
input-output units on a par with equivalent 
US equipment which has been available for 6 
years, time sharing design capabilities and 
other interesting features. 
The machine's instruction repertoire in-
cludes a very efficient approach to address se-
lection, some special instructions for handling 
real-time data, facility for doing "significant 
arithmetic" and so on. In addition to being 
a valuable asset for geileral purpose use in 
solving scientific and engineering problems, it 
should be well-suited to specialized applica-
tions requiring a large volume of calculations 
(e.g., in economics, telemetry, tracking, etc.) 
and for work in pattern recognition and pic-
torial-data smoothing.45-48 
The URAL class of computers was expanded 
with the introduction of models with the des-
ignations 11, 12, 14, and 16. These machines 
are members of a series of compatible com-
puters out of Penza. The compatibility fea-
ture and their availability makes these new 
machines suitable for incorporation into the 
networks, parallel systems and in the other 
types of multi-machine configurations under 
consideration by Soviet systems designers. 
Coupled to native Soviet capabilities in com-
puter technology is an intensive program for 
exploitation and publication of Western re-
search and development. This is indicated in

know-how is the section in the Ref erativnyy

This source is replete every month with ref-

theory and technology. Assuming that (1) 
Soviet scientific and technical talents are ex-

above, (2) the intensive program for exploita-
tion of theory and machines produced else-
where is digested by Soviet theorists and engi-
neers; and that (3) an importation program 
of increasing size is underway, leads to the 
conclusion that the present Soviet data proc-
essing and computer weaknesses are due to 
inadequacies in production technology at the 
industry level rather than to a lack of scien-
tific know-how. 
Systems Research and Engineering 
Technological progress involving the utiliz-
ation of computers depends in great measure 
upon the solution of very fundamental prob-
lems in the area of systems science and engi-
neering. The speed, compactness, memory-
size and speed of access to memories and other 
characteristics of computers are increasing 
rapidly in the USSR. The Soviet industrial 
sector will gradually but certainly improve its 
capabilities for producing newer types of ma-
chines which will incorporate advanced char-
acteristics. But a more difficult problem re-
mains: how to employ these machines in in-
formation and control modes in complexly or-
ganized systems? Soviet system scientists, 
during 1965, presented solutions to a number 
of such problems as they are encountered at 
various levels of the production process. In 
a more theoretical manner they have also 
studied larger-scale problems at the level of 
large regions and at the level of the national 
economy as a whole. Addressing themselves

to systems problems of the foregoing types 
have been experts in mathematical modeling 
and programming, systems optimization, sta-
tistics and probability theory and in computer 
theory and engineering. 
The most valuable source of information 
about these activities was published during 
1965 in a compilation of papers presented 
originally in November 1963 at a conference 
on Automatic Operational Management of 
of Production Processes.* This conference 
which typifies the cybernetic approach was 
held to coordinate research on scientific and 
technological problems connected with the de-
velopment of systems irrespective of the 
branch of industry involved and of the indus-
trial manufacturing peculiarities of individual 
production facilities. Such problems involve: 
(a) the construction of mathematical models 
of complexes of production processes on the 
basis of analyses of existing flows of informa-
tion in actual complexes; (b) the study of the 
characteristics both of the individual elements 
and of the connections between those elements 
in systems; (c) methods and algorithms for 
the processing of primary data which assure 
a monitoring of events in a real complex of 
production processes and a refinement of 
their mathematical model; (d) algorithms for 
finding optimal solutions in the form of pro-
duction graphs of the distribution of power 
and material flows according to their quanti-
tative and qualitative indicators among pro-
duction sectors, solutions which satisfy some 
predesignated criteria of optimality; (e) 
methods and programs for finding optimal 
solutions on general purpose and special pur-
pose computers; (f) technical means for the 
collection, transmission and preliminary proc-
essing of information, means of presenting 
generalized information to a human operator 
and means of communication with automatic 
actuating devices; and (g) methods of com-
pilation of technical tasks on special purpose 
control computers and ancillary equipments.

of Technical Cybernetics of the Council on Cyber-
netics, Academy of Sciences, USSR, and the Section 
of Control Systems of Industrial Enterprises of the

The foregoing approaches are the building 
blocks which go to make up what the Soviets 
call the theory of large systems control. In 
its content and methods this research trend 
is connected with mathematics, the theory of 
automatic control, computer technology, eco-
nomics, biology, psychology and a number of 
other scientific disciplines. On account of the 
variety of problems and methods for solving 
them, the theory of large systems control is 
regarded by the Soviets as a division of cy-
bernetics. The structure of the theory of 
large systems control and its basic concepts 
and terminology have not yet been established 
in the USSR, just as systems theory in the 
West remains at an embryonic level." 
Among the systems which the Soviets re-
vealed during the year were the "IMPUL'S" 
System, the PROKAT System, and a rolling 
mill control system. All of these are either 
operational or scheduled to become opera-
tional in the near future in concrete situa-
tions. 
The "IMPUL'S" System was designed by 
the Central Scientific Research Institute for 
Overall Automation for the operative control 
of a section of a metallurgical combine. A 
control computer developed for this purpose 
is made up of components used in the 
RAZDAN-2 computer. Control problems put 
to the system are classified, and methods for 
their solution are developed, according to a 
method based on the principle of optimality 
developed by Richard Bellman of the Rand 
Corporation. An algorithm for control of the 
system is worked out, consisting of a set of 
algorithmic sequences determining the reac-
tion of the system as it moves from one state 
to another. The suggested principles for con-
struction of the system have been investigated 
on a statistical model by the Monte Carlo 
method. Synthesis was performed for the 
control system; its structural plan, informa-
tion flows, functions, and technical data for 
the main parts of the system have been 
worked out; and a control computer has been 
developed to serve as the main link in the 
control system.

At the present time, according to the So-
viets, the "IMPUL'S" System is being intro-
duced at an undesignated metallurgical com-
bine somewhere in the USSR. Due to the 
introduction of this system, the combine it-
self has undergone considerable reconstruc-
tion, including its rail yard, and the instal-
lation of means for electrical centralization 
of signals, locomotive communications, and 
of a control dispatcher point supplied with 
modern communications equipment where the 
control computer will be installed.51 
The PROKAT (rolling mill) computer con-
trol complex was slated to be installed in late 
1965 in another of the large metallurgical 
combines. Structurally, the PROKAT com-
puter control complex consists of three inter-
related automatic subsystems of control which 
are united via a centralized data system and 
by a centralized over-all controlling computer. 
The local automatic systems containing 
STAL-1 and STAL-2 computers control the 
work of individual production sections. The 
centralized data system with its computer, 
possibly a TsUM-1, provides for the collection, 
accumulation and processing of information 
with the issuance of operational and techni-
cal documentation. The centralized controll-
ing computer regulates the interaction of the 
local automatic control systems and monitors 
and records inputs and outputs by the section 
mill. The over-all control computer is a gen-
eral purpose machine with a speed on the 
order of 5,000 operations per second.52 
A comparable system for computer control 
of a "1300" automatic blooming mill provides 
automatic operational planning; automatic 
optimization and realization of the operating 
programs of individual groups of mechanisms; 
optimal automatic tuning of the individual 
controlling devices according to feedback of 
the results of rolling; provision of high-
echelon control and coordination of the mech-
anisms of the mill; introduction of the sets 
of orders; calculation and production of a "no-
waste cutting program;" automation of pro-
duction accounting of the mill; and determi-
nation of the production-economic indicators 
of its operation. These tasks are solved by a 
multi-machine, two-stage hierarchical system 
of VNIIEM-3 control computers which are 
combined into an over-all cybernetic control 
system for direct automatic control of techno-
logical processes and of the subsystem for eco-
nomic planning and operative-dispatcher in-
f ormation.53 
Soviet interest in applying computer con-
trol systems for industrial management was 
highlighted in March 1965 when V. D. 
Lebedev, then Deputy Chairman of the USSR 
Sovnarkhoz, announced plans to modernize 
management techniques by installing com-
puters at 119 plants and combines during 
1965 and 1966. These plans are a natural 
consequence of the recently intensified in-
terest of the Soviet leaders in improving the 
efficiency of operational control of industries. 
At industrial levels above individual shop 
operations there are efforts underway to de-
velop broader-scale systems of control involv-
ing the use of computers. Thus for example, 
one of the most rapidly growing uses of com-
puters in the USSR is in the construction in-
dustry, where they have been tried and found 
effective in the planning and management of 
large-scale industrial and housing construc-
tion projects. The computers are used in 
conjunction with SPU (System of Planning 
and Management) methods, the Soviet coun-
terpart of US-developed PERT (Program Eval-
uation and Review Technique). In Moscow, 
a special communications system is being built 
for the State Committee for Construction 
(Gosstroy, USSR) which will permit direct in-
puts of information on the progress of con-
struction into Gosstroy's computer center, 
where it will be used to process and update 
PERT networks." 
Software Developments 
A computer input language for engineer-
ing calculations is under development by V. M. 
Glushkov and his assistants at the Institute 
of Cybernetics in Kiev." Information is read 
into the machine, element by element, with 
the help of a printed unit (keyboard) provided 
with all the symbols of the input language. 
Depressing a key of this unit inserts one 
symbol into the location of the store, the same 
symbol simultaneously being printed on a 
sheet of paper. Results are read out of the 
21

Approved for Release: 2018/01/31 C00355733 
machine by means of the same printing unit 
and recorded on the same sheet of paper, just 
after the recording of the program previously 
read into the machine. 
Limitations imposed by the size of the stor-
age unit may make it impossible to read in 
the whole program at once. In this case the 
problem has to be divided into sections and 
solved in stages. The results of the initial 
data of preceding stages may be used in the 
next stage. To avoid repeated input of the 
same information it is possible to partially 
renew the programming while preserving the 
results of the preceding stages. The Input 
Language has much in common with ALGOL-
60 but at the same time differs from it in 
having a simple program structure and a 
modified syntax of declarations. Details of 
the semantics and method of writing pro-
grams will be provided soon in a special 
manual for machine users. 
ALGOS, another software development, has 
been described by V. T. Kulik and his associ-
ates from the Institute of Automation and 
the Kiev Polytechnical Institute." ALGOS 
(Algorithmic Description of Industrial Cyber-
netic Systems) is a special programming lan-
guage for automatic formation of computer 
programs for controlling industrial processes. 
ALGOS permits description of information 
on complex industrial processes in a form 
comprehensible to the engineer. The goal of 
analysis of control of the production process 
is written in the same language. If the initial 
data are insufficient for solution of the prob-
lem, the machine will output a list of the in-
formation needed. When a priori data are 
insufficient, a program may be formulated to 
produce the necessary information by experi-
mentation. If the initial information is suffi-
cient, the machine will produce the solution 
and output the data from digital modeling 
of the operation of the production process 
in the desired regime and with the desired 
control machine characteristics. If the ma-
chine is supplied with information on avail-
able series-produced control machines, it will 
automatically select from the possibilities sup-
plied the most suitable machines for per-
22 
forming the control function. Algorithms of 
the system constructed by the heuristic pro-
gramming method have been tested for com-
plex systems in the chemical, metallurgical 
and power industries. Kulik recommends 
ALGOS for use as a unified language oriented 
toward production processes in the CEMA 
countries. 
The quest for Bloc-wide approaches to pro-
gramming languages extends beyond the 
types oriented toward production processes to 
include languages for economic problems. In 
Berlin, during March 1965, two Bloc-wide 
groups on algorithmic languages held meet-
ings: GAMS (Group for the Automation of 
Programming of Intermediate Machines) and 
GAYAPEI (Group for Algorithmic Languages 
for the Processing of Economic Information) . 
GAMS is trying to establish a modified 
ALGOL-60 language (ALGAMS). GAYAPEI 
is considering two languages, KOBOL-
GAYAPEI and ALGEK, for accounting and 
economic decision-making purposes, respec-
tively.57 
CONTRIBUTORY EUROPEAN SATELLITE

Czechoslovakia 
Cybernetic groups in the European Satel-
lites were actively engaged during 1965 with 
programs to develop improved systems for 
the guidance of social processes. In Czecho-
slovakia the Cybernetics Commission of the 
Academy of Sciences completed the first phase 
of a long-range research and development 
program by holding the First Scientific Sym-
posium on Cybernetics at Smolenice.* The 
program's second stage which began in 1965 
calls for establishment of a Czech Cybernetics 
Society; standardization of terminology; in-
clusion of cybernetics projects in the long-
range research and development programs of 
ministries, schools, and institutes; an increase 
in the volume of cybernetic publications; and

Hungary 
The Hungarians established a Cybernetics 
Committee under the Presidium of the Acad-
emy of Sciences and an Inter-institute Com-
plex Committee for Research on Automation 
and for the Advancement of Cybernetics. 
Hungarian emphasis seems to be on the bi-
omedical aspects of cybernetics. A joint cy-
bernetics center was established by Medicor 
Muvek, a medical instrument factory, with 
the Budapest Medical University. The Sci-
entific Society of Measurement Technology 
and Automation devoted a conference to diag-
nostic computers and neurocybernetics. Buda-
pest was chosen by UNESCO for the neuro-
cybernetics conference sponsored in the spring 
of 1965 by the International Brain Research 
Organization. The Hungarian Academy of 
Sciences established a well-equipped neuro-
cybernetics laboratory headed by Kalman Lis-
sak, an active campaigner for interdiscipli-
nary cooperation between the academy's in-
stitutes.* New cybernetics laboratories for 
industrial research also were established dur-
ing 1965 at the Bolyai Institute of Szeged 
University and at the Jozef-Attila University, 
Szeged.58-82 
Some Hungarians began to show interest 
also in the social management aspects of cy-
bernetics during 1965. Concern with "guid-
ance systems for society" became evident with 
the March 1965 issue of Valosag, Hungary's 
sociology journal, which announced the be-
ginning of a debate in that journal concern-
ing such problems. Andras Hegedus, chair-
man of the editorial committee of Valosag, 
came out for a radical recasting of social 
guidance systems along scientific orga-
nizational-management lines. "Almost over-
night," he says, "the social scientists were

tral Physics Research Institute. 
given freedom to examine critically the opera-
tional effectiveness of the state administrative 
system and orders to carry out such investiga-
tions." The aim of empirical social research 
in the view of Hegedus is to develop a guid-
ance system which seeks to optimize social 
and economic decisions at every level of the 
system through the use of information sys-
tems and mathematical techniques in select-
ing those variants most favorable for society. 
Research on techniques for selecting leaders 
trained in modern systems management was 
also listed as a must. 
Poland 
Poland's Cybernetics Commission, directed 
until his death in 1965 by Oskar Lange, has 
been concerned mostly with the introduction 
of computers into the economic and manage-
ment fields. Reports received during 1965 on 
the content of Poland's 1966-70 Plan reveal 
that the larger cities of Poland are to get 27 
computing centers with a total of 57 com-
puters. Educational institutions are to be 
allocated 48 computers to meet scientific, in-
dustrial, and educational requirements. Fifty 
industrial centers for design and production 
control machines are planned, and mining 
and power engineering industries are to be 
assigned 18 computers. Seventy-eight addi-
tional computers are to be assigned to a va-
riety of other, but as yet unspecified, activi-
ties. To lend manpower support to these 
planned establishments, a special center is to 
be created which will train 1,200 people a 
year for electronic data processing, and five 
new technical schools for training service and 
maintenance personnel are to be set up. The 
first of these new technical schools opened 
during 1965.83 64 
The National Management Development 
Center in Warsaw is the key organization for 
developing techniques for using the computer 
centers as part of a cybernetic system of na-
tional economic management. This interna-
tionally-subsidized center is involved in the 
cybernetics of planning according to Greniew-
ski in a primer on the subject for Western 
readers.85

East Germany 
While continuing to emphasize cybernetics 
as the basis of modern technology, the East 
German Cybernetics Commission also began 
during 1965 to concern itself with problems 
of social management. The author of one 
article in Einheit emphasized the hope that 
cybernetics will be able to overcome bureauc-
racy in East Germany if the social scientists 
improve their qualifications in cybernetics, 
mathematics, and mathematical logic enough 
to help the new economic system of planning 
and management of the social system to suc-
ceed. The leadership of the SED (Sozio-
listische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) hopes, 
according to one source, to develop cybernetics 
as "the theoretical basis for scientific man-
agement and organization of production and 
of the whole comprehensive socialist recon-
structions." 66 67 
Some cyberneticians seem to be fostering 
this movement in East Germany and in the 
other Satellites. Soviet articles in the East 
German publications, for example, extol the 
social science which is resulting from the 
merging of hitherto separate disciplines and 
involving the application of cybernetics to the 
management of social development systems. 
The most recent article of this type entitled 
"The Control of Social Processes and Cyber-
netics" was written by the Soviets L. B. Khal-
perin and P. N. Lebedev and published in the 
East German journal, Statt und Recht (State 
and Law) .68 
Parenthetically, it is worth noting that one 
Chinese Communist showed signs during 1965 
that he was openly espousing cybernetics. 
The author of what is probably the first re-
port received in the West from China on 
the development of cybernetics, claims that 
the course of this new science has followed 
the pattern described by Mao Tse-Tung for 
the progress of human knowledge. Only the 
philosophy of Marx, Lenin, and, especially, of 
Mao Tse-Tung is able, the author claims, to 
properly guide the future course of progress 
in cybernetics. Contrasted to the somewhat 
ludicrous and largely historical and tutorial 
content of this article is an account of the 
24 
contribution of H. S. Ch'ien* to the establish-
ment of engineering cybernetics as a discipline 
likely to result in practical applications of the 
science of information and control." 
PHILOSOPHICAL ACTIVITIES 
"Large Systems" and Social Guidance 
The marked increase during 1965 in Soviet 
interest in optimal control procedures for use 
in the management of multidimensional, 
multilevel, man-machine systems as such sys-
tems interact with complicated environments 
has found expression as a separate discipline 
devoted to "large systems." ** Members of 
such classes of systems are made up of the 
totality of interconnected controlled subsys-
tems united by a common control system. 
One example, which is the most comprehen-
sive system of this class known to be under 
construction in the USSR, is the so-called 
Unified Information Network which is des-
tined to become the "nervous system" of the 
Soviet Government. The number of identified 
computer centers which might become nodes 
in this network when it eventually is tied 
together, increased during 1965 from 240 to 
350. *** 
During the same period, Soviet concern 
with the problem of "social guidance systems" 
became as evident in Soviet literature as it 
was in that of the Satellites. Furthermore, 
measures were taken to reify some of these 
ideas in practical terms. An example of an 
organizational measure was the creation at 
mid-year by the Academy of Sciences of a 
social science information group to furnish 
*In 1954 while he was working at the Jet Pro-
pulsion Center of the California Institute of Tech-
nology, H. S. Ch'ien was the author of the first book 
published on engineering cybernetics. This book 
was translated into Chinese in 1958. Ch'ien re-
turned to Communist China in the late 1950's and 
became a key figure in a number of important sci-
entific projects. 
** The subject of "large systems" is being devel-
oped especially by the Division for Large Systems of 
the Institute of Automatics and Telemechanics 
(Technical Cybernetics) and it is not elaborated 
on in this report. A separate report on this subject 
is in preparation.

December 1964; the higher figure is the count for 
December 1965. Thus the number of computer 
centers built or identified during 1965 is 110.

the inputs necessary for the design of control 
processes for social systems. Its tasks include 
determination of social science information 
requirements and formats; coordination of 
social science information activities through-
out the USSR; methodological and technical 
assistance to social science organizations deal-
ing with information; and development of in-
ternational contacts with social science in-
stitutions involved in the collection, storage, 
processing, and transmission of information. 
Of the many research projects underway, 
the experimental mathematical model of a 
city-scale development plan for Tallin is an 
interesting illustration completed by the Kiev 
Institute of Cybernetics.* This comprehen-
sive model of the reconstruction process for 
the capital city of Estonia offers solutions, ac-
cording to the Soviets, of the economic, social, 
architectural and other interrelated problems 
involved in engineering the transformation of 
a societal system of city dimensions which has 
been growing in random fashion since the 
year 1219.7� 71 
The Communist Party is supporting�if not 
fostering�such developments involving the 
application of exact mathematical methods to 
social phenomena. Part of the Party's con-
cern is with the long-range need for develop-
ment of a new generation of cybernetics-
oriented social science students. To meet this 
need, social science teachers are being exposed 
to cybernetics. A discussion of the role of 
cybernetics in modern social science is the 
lead article in a collection of materials for use 
in teaching dialectical materialism. It was 
originally presented by A. I. Berg, Chairman 
of the Cybernetics Council to the Pan-Russian 
Seminar of Social Science Teachers on the 
Philosophical Problems of Contemporary Nat-
ural History.72 
There is some evidence that the Party is 
also concerned about the apparent reluctance 
of social scientists to adopt cybernetic meth-

ods either for reasons of inability or of fear 
based on the earlier negative official view of 
cybernetics. A recent article in the Party's 
journal, Kommunist, was aimed at reduction 
of the latter factor." Entitled "Cybernetic 
Methods in Sociology," the article rejects as 
incorrect the earlier Soviet position which held 
that there existed some sort of division be-
tween the natural sciences and the social sci-
ences because the latter "could only roughly 
evaluate social phenomena which were not 
subject to control." But now, the article 
continues, social scientists are applying exact 
mathematical methods mainly in the field of 
mathematical modeling of social phenomena. 
In order to apply the science of information 
transmission and processing and control (cy-
bernetics) the author believes that it is neces-
sary to define the many channels through 
which information is passed in a society, and 
to define the quantity of information (not the 
number of words) contained in such "mes-
sages." The development of methods of ana-
lyzing the quantity of information in mes-
sages and the impact (in the cybernetic sense) 
of these messages on the social phenomena 
under study is a primary problem in contem-
porary application of cybernetic methods to 
sociological study. Looking upon society as a 
whole, a unified structure, and the process of 
control of the social "organism" as that of 
transfer of information directed at subordina-
tion of the individual sectors, when necessary, 
for the good of the whole (society) , it is pos-
sible to apply cybernetic methods to study and 
control of sociological phenomena. For ex-
ample, the "foresight" of certain information 
processes, the degree to which they serve the 
long range needs of the society, can be deter-
mined. The author states, however, that the 
Soviet goal is to use the regularities learned 
from such a study not to "control" the lives of 
citizens with a centralized "super-brain" but 
to use the information to produce effects on 
the motivation and sociological phenomena 
concerning its citizens so that scientific plan-
ning of their activity (on the basis of what the 
theory says they will do, not on the basis of 
interference with the functioning of the in-
formation channels to make them act as de-
sired) can be more efficient.

This Kommunist article is excerpted to 
further illustrate a point, i.e., that the changes 
in the Soviet Bloc observed during 1965 were 
not confined to the scientific and technological 
aspects of cybernetics. These together con-
stitute but one dimension of a transition proc-
ess in which new social institutions are also 
going to be produced in response to the new 
technology. The social institutions to be 
created in the future will in turn produce 
further changes in technology. Soviet plan-
ners, aware of the enormous complexity in-
volved in these social interrelations and of the 
difficulties entailed in interrelating changes 
in both of these aspects of human life, are 
looking to social cybernetics for techniques for 
the conscious control of social development:74 
The most significant development during 
1965 involving the Party's role in the applica-
tion of cybernetics to social guidance was the 
creation of a Council for Problems of Manage-
ment of Economic and Social Processes in the 
Academy of Social Sciences of the Central 
Committee, CPSU. Because of the intimate 
relationship of social development processes 
and the maintenance of security in the con-
temporary world, the facilitation by the Coun-
cil of the application of cybernetics to the 
management of society could enhance the in-
ternal security stature and the capabilities of 
the USSR for influencing the developmental 
paths of the emerging nations. 
The new Council resulted from a meeting 
of representatives of the Cybernetics Coun-
cil, the philosophy departments of universities 
and of other organizations which took place 
at the Academy of Social Sciences probably 
sometime late in 1965. The initiators of the 
meeting�the chairs of "scientific commu-
nism" and economic sciences�tabled for dis-
cussion an illustrative set of topics on the 
theoretical problems of the scientific manage-
ment of society. Speakers at the meeting 
included 0. Deyneko (Section for Theoretical 
Problems of Organization of the Scientific 
Council for the Complex Problem "Cyber-
netics," AS USSR) ; G. Bryanskiy (Moscow 
Engineering-Economics Institute) ; G. Sle-
zinger (Scientific Research Institute of La-
bor) ; and others. 
26 
They described the scientific work in the 
field of organization of management of society 
being done in their respective establishments, 
made a number of suggestions for improving 
this work, and emphasized the necessity for 
uniting the efforts of scientists and practi-
cal workers concerned with the guidance of 
society. 
The new Council is the answer of the Acad-
emy of Social Sciences and of its parent or-
ganization, the Central Committee, CPSU, to 
this recognized need. The following scientific 
research topics have been approved for investi-
gation by the Council: general problems of 
scientific management; structure and func-
tion of management systems; management 
technology; information systems in manage-
ment; and other aspects of cybernetics along 
with the development of means by which 
workers may participate in social control 
practices.75 
The Theory of Development 
The observed trends in technical and ap-
plied cybernetics involving the management 
of large systems and social guidance, respec-
tively, came together this year in a number 
of publications that discussed various ele-
ments of a philosophical construct which is 
called the "theory of development." This 
literary bridge between technology and the 
social sciences has been in the process of 
formulation since, at least, 1958, but still only 
its silhouette was observable during 1965. 
Formulation of this theory began with an 
article during 1958 entitled "Applications of 
Cybernetics in the Social Sciences." The au-
thor presented a somewhat naive argument 
in support of the thesis that cybernetics can 
be a boon to applied sociology in socialistically 
organized societies but a bane to sociologists 
in the capitalistic world. The manner of pres-
entation suggested that this position was ad-
vanced merely as a necessary accompaniment 
to the real message the author wished to con-
vey, i.e., that Soviet planners had a crying 
need for the development of a quantitative 
sociology and that computers and their as-
sociated methodologies were indispensable for 
meeting that requirement."

A brochure giving clearer outlines of the 
evolving theory of development was published 
in Poland by Oskar Lange in 1960 under the 
title "Totality, Development, and Dialectics 
in the Light of Cybernetics." Three years 
later, the State Publishing House for Politi-
cal Literature, Moscow, released the first So-
viet brochure on the subject: "Cybernetics: 
Philosophical and Sociological Problems" by 
I. Nova. Also during 1963 a number of arti-
cles by Soviet authors outlined their views on 
the relationship of cybernetics to social prog-
ress. This collection, authored by Academi-
cians, S. G. Strumilin, V. A. Trapeznikov, and 
V. S. Nemchinov, reiterated much of what 
had been said by them in many places: (1) 
An essentially new type of social organization 
will result from the application of science to 
society and cybernetics. This will be the best 
illustration of the relationship between science 
and the activity of people, a relationship to 
which the future belongs; (2) the industry of 
the future will undoubtedly be a complex of 
production processes united by a single auto-
matic control and guidance system with cy-
bernated devices doing most of the work for 
man; and (3) when society passes over from 
the basically primitive forms of control to 
automated systems based on scientific meth-
ods of research and electronic techniques, 
definite changes will result in the socio-eco-
nomic structure of society. These phrases 
have a familiar ring but are significant, never-
theless, because of their publication for the 
first time in an international Communist 
journal. In retrospect, it seems that the pur-
pose of the authors of this collection was to 
furnish approbation for creative, mathemati-
cally oriented social scientists." 
Also, during 1963, two relatively unknown 
Leningrad authors published a brochure, 
"Miracle of Our Time�Cybernetics and Prob-
lems of Development," which closely parallels 
the work of Lange which had been published 
three years earlier. The authors, B. V. Akhli-
bininskiy and N. I. Khralenko, analyze the 
reasons for the appearance of cybernetics as 
an independent branch of science; the role of 
cybernetics in the creation of the material-
technical base of communism; and the con-
tributions of cybernetics to understanding the 
essence of life and especially of social dynam-
ics. These threads are woven together in a 
popular style into what they and other Soviet 
writers designate as the "theory of develop-
ment or progress." 
In the spring of 1964 at the Novosti Press 
Agency in Moscow the first large-scale, public 
discussion of cybernetics which had implica-
tions for the problem of development was held. 
It was a conference on Cybernetics, Planning 
and Social Progress sponsored by the editors 
of USSR, Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, and Vo-
prosy Ekonomiki. The participants included 
leading Soviet mathematicians; philosphers; 
economists, chairmen of State committees, 
departments, and planning and statistical 
bodies; directors of research institutes; and 
heads of educational instiutions. The theme 
of the meeting was that a socialist society can 
make use of cybernetics in ways "inconceiv-
able" under other types of systems, and the 
result of the conference was to remove ide-
ological bars to the application of some ele-
ments of cybernetics to the guidance of social 
processes. Foremost among the participants 
were V. M. Glushkov, Trapeznikov, Nemchinov 
and other scientists intimately associated with 
the Cybernetics Council." 
Concurrent with the publication and meet-
ing activity seminars were initiated to develop 
cybernetic methodologies for the social sci-
ences based on computer-based models of 
socio-economic processes. One such seminar 
was created in conjunction with the Cyber-
netic Council at the Department of Dialectical 
and Historical Materialism of Moscow Uni-
versity. The latest contribution in this chro-
nology of the genesis of the cybernetics-related 
theory of development is the book Kybernetika 
ye Spolesenskych Vedach (Cybernetics in So-
ciology Research) published by the Czech 
Academy of Sciences. Among its authors are 
Arab-Ogly who wrote the first Soviet article 
dealing with cybernetics and society and 
others from the Soviet Bloc and Western Eu-
rope who pioneered the movement to relate 
cybernetics and social dynamics. At least in 
Arab-Ogly's case this effort has been going 
on quietly for at least eight years.

The following summary of the basic as-
sumptions of the theory of development is 
derived from the previously cited sources: 
1. Social change can be described in terms 
of biological evolution, a process which en-
tailed the reorganization of successful species 
in adaptively responding to environmental 
changes. The mechanisms by which biological 
species so maintain levels of "dynamic stabil-
ity" can be explained by cybernetics. Because 
biological evolution and the transition processes 
of social systems are analogous, cybernetics is 
also the key to understanding social change. 
2. Biological evolution is the predominant tend-
ency toward increased levels of systems' com-
plexity made possible by the adaptive occurrence 
of automatic physiological feedback systems. As 
in biological evolution, each succeeding state in 
the progressive development of social systems 
is characterized by a more complex form of or-
ganization and commensurate automatic con-
trol resulting in the increased orderliness and 
decreased chaos of societies which adapt "to 
the times." 
3. The development of man and social systems 
Is not through the simple processes of adapta-
tion to external conditions but through the crea-
tion by science and technology of new forms of 
external conditions which are more propitious 
for survival. Man and society must adapt there-
fore, not to nature directly but to nature as it 
Is being transformed by science and technology, 
i.e., by making his ideas and social institutions 
harmonious with the man-made environment. 
4. The process of development, the complication 
of organizational forms, which permits the 
maintenance of system-environment stability is 
explicable in terms of game theory, a tool of 
cybernetics. Stability is achieved if a system 
can counter each strategy of the environment 
(opponent) with a new and more appropriate 
corresponding strategy. The responses of men 
and advanced societies to the environment are 
qualitative. Quantitative responses character-
ize lower animal forms and primitive societies. 
The struggle for stability will be successful, 
therefore, in direct proportion to the number of 
different strategies that the transition system 
has at its disposal. Those systems which possess 
the greater variety of methods of behaving in 
response to varied natural and man-made en-
vironmental influences are thusly preserved. 
5. The variety of methods of behaving is equal 
to the system's store of information or negen-
tropy. In this manner the process of devel-
opment is linked in Soviet theory to the con-
cept of organization, information, and negen-
tropy. The theory says that for a system to 
possess a variety of strategies (a greater choice 
of possible responses to opponents) and thus 
to develop it must have a complex inner struc-
ture; that is, a high level of organization. The 
more complex the system, the greater the choice 
of possible responses to external influences it 
has at its disposal. There are no upper limits 
to the level of complexity a system of organiza-
tion may attain�as shown in the history of the 
development of living systems and of societies�
if the process of complication is accompanied 
by the development of mechanisms that sim-
plify or "automate" its operations. Automation, 
which creates that simplification without which 
further development would be impossible, is, 
therefore, a universal law of development. Be-
cause the problem of automatic control in its 
most general sense is one of the central prob-
lems of cybernetics, it is the key to the progres-
sive development of society. 
The foregoing paragraphs approximate as 
much as is possible at the present time the 
evolving theory of development. From this 
outline it is clear why mathematicians, engi-
neers, mathematical economists, biologists, 
and other specialists and a new breed of social 
philosophers are interacting in the Soviet cy-
bernetics program. Such interactions are 
viewed as a necessary condition for the auto-
mation of control systems and such automa-
tion is requisite in the theory of development 
for the progress of the USSR toward a higher 
stage of social organization. Cybernetics, as 
suggested by I. V. Novik, is, therefore, a van-
tage point around which scientists can gen-
eralize their activities and social philosophers 
can make their ideas more concrete." 
That cybernetics is playing such a role is 
evident in publications in which, on one hand, 
for example, a study of ergodic development 
processes is used by a mathematician to illu-
strate the universality of control laws as evi-
denced by a characteristic property common 
to biological, physical, social, and economic 
processes and computing machines. Philoso-
phers, on the other hand, are not just talking 
about "dialectic development"; under the im-
petus of cybernetics they are discussing the 
necessity for clarification of the "purpose" of 
social systems; the creation of probabilistic 
models of social dynamics; and the need for 
computer-based information models as an aid 
to management. The evidence about the cy-
bernetics program collected during 1965 in-

dicates that at least some elements of the 
theory of development are the bases for the 
policies of current leaders. However, there is 
no evidence that all elements of the theory of 
development have been accepted by the lead-
ership as the basis for all socio-economic 
policies.8" 
International Ramifications 
Although applications of Soviet ideas about 
societal cybernetics and the theory of develop-
ment were described by one author as decisive 
factors in the world revolution, they found ex-
pression during 1965 in only one major collec-
tion of papers authored by representatives of 
the scientific communities of the USSR, the 
Satellites, Israel, and of Western Europe. It 
was a compilation of articles on cybernetics 
and the social sciences and was dedicated 
to the memory of Norbert Wiener. Other 
more ambitious plans for promulgating Soviet 
notions about cybernetics and social progress 
during 1965 did not materialize. Some of 
those plans were included in the USSR Na-
tional Commission recommendations for the 
1965-66 Program for UNESCO to provide 
means for a "great study" on teaching meth-
ods based on cybernetics; a brain research pro-
gram with special emphasis on neurocyber-
netics; and, of special significance, an inter-
national meeting on "Cybernetics and Com-
puters in the Service of Social Progress.,, 85-87
