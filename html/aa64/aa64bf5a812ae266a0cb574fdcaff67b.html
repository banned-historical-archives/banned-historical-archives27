Congressional Record 
PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE Q 09th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION 
Vol. 112 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1966 
No. 40 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 12 o'clock noon. 
Reverend Father Michael Urbana-
wich, Marianapolis Preparatory School, 
Thompson, Conn., offered the following 
prayer: 
Let us pray in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. 
Almighty God, the Lord and Ruler of 
all nations, today in this glorious House 
of Representatives of the United States 
of America we glorify Thee on behalf of 
the people who, led by Thy providential 
hand, came to this country from Byelo-
russia. 
We thank Thee for the blessings Thou 
hast bestowed upon America. 
Bless, 0 Lord, our President, our 
Speaker, our legislators, our clergy, and 
the Armed Forces of this land of free-
dom. 
Bless the freedom-loving people of 
Byelorussia who 48 years ago on March 
25, 1918, proclaimed the independence of 
their Byelorussian Democratic Republic. 
Freedom and democracy were short-
lived in Byelorussia, because the Red 
army drove them out. Still., the Byel-
orussian people never lost their hopes 
for national independence and each year 
commemorate proclamation of independ-
ence-the historic March 25. 
As we once more commemorate Byel-
orussian Independence Day here in these 
glorious United States, we pray Thee, 0 
loving Father, to give the entire Byel-
orussian people spiritual strength to re-
sist godless communism and preserve 
their ideals of liberty. Look down with 
favor, 0 Lord, upon Thy children who cry 
out to Thee in anguish for their deliver-
ance. 
We humbly beg Thee to grant that 
they may soon see the dawn of a better 
day, when together with all free men 
they might live in peace and prosperity, 
worshiping Thee, their only true God and 
Redeemer, with dignity and honor. 
Amen.

Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, be-
cause of illness last week I was not pres-
ent during the vote on S. 1666, which 
provides for the appointment of addi-
tional circuit and district Judges. Had 
I been present, I would have answered 
"yea" to roll No. 28, which was taken on 
the passage of this legislation. 
was also not present during the vote 
on H.R. 12889, the supplemental defense 
authorization, Had I been present last

sage of this bill. 
I would like the R,Ecora) to show my 
Position on these measures.

PEDERAL LAKES AND RESERVOIRS 
STIOULT) REMAIN FREE TO THE 
P (TEEM 
Mr. EDMONDSON asked and was 
riven permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr Speaker, I 
have today introduced a bill to repeal all 
authority for Federal entrance and ad-
mission feca at virtually all Government 
lakes and reservoirs. 
am convinced the imposition of such 
fees at reservoirs primarily built for 
flood control, navigation or power, is 
neither justified nor necessary. 
ieurthermore, such fees constitute a 
bieiach of contract with the people, whose 
Lax money has been used to acquire the 
lands and build the dams which make 
the reservoirs possible. 
In ninny instances, construction of 
these reservoirs was approved and sup-
ported by local people with the definite 
understanding that no Federal interfer-
ence of any kind would take place with 
tl ie time-honored rights to fish and boat 
on the waters impounded. In the case 
of our Indian people, many of whom were 
guaranteed perpetual rights to hunt and 
fah without interference under treaties 
many years ago, the new fees are a fla-
grant violation of traditional, historic 
rights?and are totally indefensible. 
it is one thing to collect a user fee 
from an individual using a facility like 
a bathhouse or a special campsite with 
utilities?both requiring continual main-
tenance and personnel in attendance. It 
is entirely a different matter to charge 
for access to the land and the water 
which belong to the people in the first 
place, and have long been used by them 
tor recreational purposes. Especially is 
this so at reservoirs where recreational 
.facilities are largely incidental to other 
major reservoir purposes. 
These fees, Mr. Speaker, should be pro-
hibited by the Congress, without further 
delay. 
VIETNAM 
l(vIr. DOW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
mark;.) 
Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, in the last 
few clays, we should all he concerned 
about the indications that our side is 
escalating the war in Vietnam. How 
long can we continue to talk peace on the 
one hand and raise the level of bombing 
on the other? They say our bombing 
in Vietnam is now comparable to any in 
World War II or in Korea 
Yes eirday the paper reported that we 
were bombing rail lines near China. 
Also, it said that at least one of our 
military leaders proposed tr e mining of 
Haiphong Harbor. It may not be too 
long before the Chinese ,.1),row their 
horde; of infantry into Vieta am, as they 
did into Korea. If we mine the harbor 
at Haiphong, and interfere with Russian 
shippi ion then we have put tl,eir national 
pride on the line, and they have to react 
somehow whether they want to or not. 
nne Epeaker, none of w should be 
afraid to face either China or Russia in a 
clear situation of our own telf -defense. 
But, I fail to see how a foothold in Viet-
f as any value in our e'en self-de-
fense. How does our fight in that one 
place .i.ssure that insurgency will disap-
pear in every other place on earth? 
Until elections are held in Vietnam, 
we cannot even be sure that we are fight-
ing for what these people want. 
Considering all these uncertainties, Mr. 
Speaker, how can the United States pro-
ceed w th such assurance and coolness to 
tempt the gods of world war III? 
I must strongly protest the steps of 
escalation that we are taking. These 
mean danger to every family in Amer-
ica?and yet they are based on reasons 
that ale not quite good enoue h. 
PERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. Speaker, I regret 
that illness last week prevented me from 
voting on the bill HR. 12889, providing 
necessary funds for our military opera-
tions in Vietnam. If I had been present, 
I would have voted for the hill without 
reserve ion. 
THE NEW GI Buz, 
(Mr. 1,'EIGHAN asked and was given 
permission to addresS the Haase for 1 
minute mci to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, the new 
GI bill signed into law by President 
Johnson will benefit large numbers of 
young Americans who have served in the 
Armed Forces of our country'. In my 
district alone it is estimated that ap-
proximately 10,300 veterans are poten-
tially eligible for the benefits and serv-
ices under the new bill. 
This ,.ncludes education and training 
programs generally patterned after the 
highly successful GI bills of World War 
II and the Korean conflict. 
The educational provisions el the bill 
are expected to provide veterans in the 
28th District of Ohio almost $828,000 in 
direct benefits in the first year. Vet-
erans' Administration guaranteed loans 
totaling $2,876,000 to some 190 veterans 
are also expected in the first year. New 
hospital benefits made available to these 
veterans are expected to total $42,000 in 
the first year. 
Mr. Speaker, the education and train-
ing provisions of this program will help 
a great deal to prepare more of our young 
men and women to realize their full po-
tential in life. I know they are wel-
comed by the veterans in my district. 
HALL URGES RETENTION OF 
SCHOOL. MILK PROGRAM 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I have today 
introduced legislation to insure that the 
school milk program is extended with 
adequate appropriations to assure the 
continued availability of milk at mod-
erate prices in the Nation's schools. 
There is growing concern with the ad-
ministration's actions in refusing to re-
lease $3 million for the special school 
milk program this year. I cannot agree 
with the President's proposal to cut funds 
for the school lunch program by 12 per-
cent and the special milk program by 
almost 80 percent for the coining fiscal 
year, while flaunting other areas of do-
mestic fiscal responsibility. 
These cutbacks, coming at the same 
time that "poverty warrior" salaries are 
being escalated and foreign aid ex-
panded, make no sense to either our dairy 
farmers or to our schoolchildren and 
their parents. 
These programs have, through the 
years, proven to be especially effective 
means of assisting schools in providing 
nutritionally desirable diets to grade and 
high school students at moderate prices. 
They have contributed to the health and 
development of the Nation's future gen-
eration. As a "doctor in the House," I am 
certainly for these efforts, under local 
school board control. 
During fiscal year 1965, 61.7 million ad-
ditional half-pints of milk were served 
to students in the State of Missouri, 
alone, under these extremely successful 
programs. Under the administration's 
proposed program, this would be drasti-
cally curtailed. If under the new pro-
gram, a school district determines that 
$3,000 income is the difference between 
a needy family and a prosperous family, 
then, the child of a family with $2,999.99 
income will pay nothing for a half-pint 
of milk. How utterly foolish. 
I would much rather see a cut in Mrs. 
Johnson's so-called beautification pro-
gram, Or in the poverty program, than 
the $80 million cut in this vital and im-
portant program for our schools, and 
leaders of tomorrow. 
(Mr. FINDLEY asked and was given 
Permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD.) 
[Mr. FINDLEY'S remarks will appear 
hereafter in the Appendix.]

March 7, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 4853 
countries around the world will breathe a 
high of relief and be glad that it has come 
out that way. 
Mr. BOGGS. Would you mind in that con-
nection talking about?and I know this has 
military implications?but the dieffrent posi-
tion today in Vietnam today, both military 
and economic and politically, as compared to 
just 8 months ago. 
Mr. Russ. Well, I think in the first place, 
for the past 3 or 4 months the South Viet-
namese and allied forces have clearly been 
on the initiative. If you follow the opera-
tional reports as closely as Mr. BOGGS does, 
you will notice that most of the larger opera-
tions are on the initiative of the South Viet-
namese and allied groups?some 25 to 30 of 
those separate operations every day. Of 
course, now, our own newspapermen out 
there concentrate on the American forces and 
we lose eight of the fact that about two-
thirds of those operations are conducted by 
the South Vietnamese themselves?and it 
remains their war. It has not become an 
American war. We are supporting them. 
But the initiative is clearly with the 
South Vietnamese and the allies. The other 
side has been taking very serious punish-
ment. During 1965, for example, the Viet-
cong suffered in numbers killed as many as 
the United States had killed throughout the 
entire Korean war, and, since the first of this 
year, those casualty rates have gone up?so 
they are running into serious trouble not 
only in the effectiveness of their operations, 
but also in morale and supply. Now I think 
another important phase of the battle is the 
one we discussed in Honolulu in great de-
tail?that is to get on with the economic and 
social development of the country. That has 
been given new impetus?the Vietcong still 
try to disrupt it by attacks on local officials 
and by disrupting lines of communication 
and these are tough problems they have 
there, but the present government, and cer-
tainly our Government, are committing 
themselves fully to it and I would expect in-
creasing rapid change in that field as well. 
Mr. BOGGS. Now Mr. Secretary, we just have 
time for one or two other questions. The 
suggestion has been made by some that we, in 
our efforts to go to the bargaining table and 
negotiating table with a peaceful conference 
that we include the Vietcong. Would you 
mind disposing of that contention? 
Mr. Rusx. Well, in the first place the other 
side has made it quite clear that their condi-
tion is that the Vietcong be accepted as the 
sole representatives of the Senth Vietnamese 
people. They haven't been qualifying this 
demand. Secondly, the Vietcong is an arm 
of Hanoi. Their views can be ascertained, 
but we shan't impose upon the people of 
South Vietnam this outfit, which has not 
been chose by the people of South Vietnam 
and which represents somebody else. 
Mr. BOGGS. It's a front, pure and simple. 
Mr. Rusx. Now, if the South Vietnamese 
have some peace and can have their elections, 
they can choose whatever government they 
want. I'm eonvinced myself that the South 
Vietnamese people are not going to choose a 
liberation front or the representatives of 
Hanoi?a million people, you remember, hale, 
left Hanoi after the division of Vietnam in 
order to escape this Communist regime. 
Mr. BOGGS. Right, Mr. Secretary, do you 
feel we are making progress in an orderly 
fashion?would you venture a prediction on 
how long military operations may have to 
continue? I know that this is a difficult 
thing. 
Mr. RUSK. No; it's hard to predict. There 
is a long, hard job ahead, even if the main 
military operations were to be brought to a 
conclusion, you'd still have a considerable 
guerrilla problem and sabotage in the country 
for the South Vietnamese to dispose of, but 
in these crises we have had since 1945, the 
end comes rather quickly and unexpectedly. 
I am thinking now about the Greek guerrillas 
and about the Berlin blockade, even the 
Korean/war?so it is a little hard to know 
just when it will come. I think it will come 
when Hanoi fully realizes they are not going 
to have South Vietnam by force, and then 
we will see a break in the situation. 
Mr. BOGGS. One final question?Do you 
think the vote in Congress this week was 
helpful? 
Mr. Rusx. It was indeed and I think that 
very strong vote in support of what is going 
is going on in South Vietnam will be helpful 
not only in the housekeeping aspect of it but 
as a demonstration of determination to the 
South Vietnamese and indeed to Hanoi, and I 
must say I was deeply grateful for the over-
whelming vote that you gentlemen down 
here gave us on that bill. 
Mr. Boacs. Well, Mr. Secretary, I know we 
could go on for a much longer period, but our 
time has expired. Thank you very much for 
joining with us this morning in this report 
to our people in south Louisiana. 
Mr. Rusx. It is a great pleasure to bei e e. 
Mr. Boacs. Thank you, sir. 
THE U.S. LEGAL RIGHT TO BE IN 
VIETNAM?THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION'S HOUSE OF DELE-
GATES SPEAKS 
(Mr. BOGGS (at the request of Mr. 
DE LA GARZA) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker there has 
been debate in the our country about the 
U.S. legal right to be in Vietnam. 
The American Bar Association's House 
of Delegates spoke loud and clear on this 
issue at its midwinter meeting in Chi-
cago February 21, 1966. 
That body unanimously adopted a res-
olution and report supporting the posi-
tion of the United States. The resolu-
tion should put to rest any doubts about 
our position. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that 
the resolution was the work of one of my 
constituents, Eberhard P. Deutsch, 
chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Peace and Law through United Nations. 
Mr. Deutsch is a world renowned at-
torney who has given of himself for the 
past 41 ye-ars in perfecting the American 
system of justice, both in the practice of 
civil and military law. 
All Americans owe a debt of gratitude 
to Mr. Deutsch. May we all continue to 
deserve his efforts. 
Following is the resolution and report 
adopted by the American Bar Association 
in addition to a brief biographical sketch 
of Mr. Deutsch: 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION SPECIAL JOINT RE-
PORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON PEACE 
AND LAW THROUGH UNIIT,L) NATIONS AND THE 
SECTION OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARA-
TIVE LAW 
RECOMMENDATION 
Whereas in recent hearings before the For-
eign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate, 
it has been stated that international lawyers 
are agreed that the U.S. position in Vietnam 
is illegal and in violation of the charter of 
the United Nations; and 
Whereas articles 51 and 52 of the charter 
sanction steps for self-defense and collective 
and regional security arrangements such as 
the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to 
which the United States is a party; and 
Whereas in the course of these hearings, it 
has been suggested that an expression on 
this subject by the American Bax Association 
would be appropriate; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the American Bar Association, 
That the position of the United States in 
Vietnam is legal under international law, and 
Is in accordance with the charter of the 
United Nations and the Southeast Asia 
Treaty; and be it further 
Resolved, That the secretary of this asso-
ciation be, and he is hereby, authorized and 
directed to transmit a copy of this resolution 
immediately to the chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate. 
REPORT 
The attention of the committee and the 
council has been called to the recent widely 
publicized hearings on appropriations for 
support of the U.S. forces in Vietnam before 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. 
Senate. 
At these hearings, it has been suggested 
that international lawyers are agreed that 
the U.S. position in Vietnam is illegal and 
in violation of the United Nations Charter. 
Articles 51 and 52 of the charter expressly 
provide that nothing contained therein 
"shall impair the inherent right of individ-
ual or collective self-defense," nor preclude 
"the existence of regional arrangements or 
agencies for dealing with such matters re-
lating to the maintenance of international 
peace and security as are appropriate for 
regional action." The Southeast Asia Treaty 
Organization is such an arrangement or 
agency. 
Professors of international law of some 31 
law schools have expressed their opinion, and 
it is the opinion of the members of this as-
sociation's Standing Committee on Peace 
and Law Through United Nations and of the 
members of the Council of the Section of 
International and Comparative Law, that the 
position of the United States in Vietnam is 
legal, and is not in violation of the Charter 
of the United Nations. 
During the course of the Senate commit-
tee hearings, it was suggested that it would 
be desirable to have an expression on this 
subject by the American Bar Association. 
The matter was taken up at a joint ses-
sion of the committee and the council of 
the section which now jointly recommend 
adoption by the house of delegates of the 
resolution herein above set forth to the 
effect that it is the position of the American 
Bar Association that the presence of U.S. 
forces in Vietnam is legal under international 
law, and in accord with the charter of the 
United Nations and the Southeast Asia 
Treaty.

ITE SNIFFING 
(Mr. ARBSTEIN (at, the request of 
Mr. DE LA (iARZA) was granted permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
t)'r.) 
Mr. PARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, for a 
number of years the subject of glue 
sniffing has occupied the time and energy 
of many local governments and has been 
studied at the National level. Many 
municipalities and States have enacted 
statutes aimed at either promiscuous uses 
of these so' vents or at restrici:Mg the sale 
of products containing- toxic !:iolvents, as 
in the case of the New Yor City ordi-
nance. However, no concrete action on 
iNatianal scale has been sts 'ted to dis-
courage and prevent glue smiting. 
The problem is not abatine but rather 
Is increasing. Reports contanie to pour 
in from my district telling if teenagers 
drunk, dizzy, and euphoric fr-an inhaling 
fumes of plastic cements an other or-
ganic solvents. Similar even .:s have been 
reported in Memphis, Boston, Hawaii, 
and other areas throughout tlie Nation. 
It is clear from existing rc-;c:arch that 
this form of aberrant beh.avioy among our 
teen and preteenagers can-es a syn-
drome resembling acute alcoholic intoxi-
iiation. Apart from the incalculable 
harm none while ch'ildren a re under its 
iminence, inhaling the solvents from 
glues and other substancss produces 
physical injury. It is appall: it from the 
many ,irticles and clinical e; dence that 
yours.i.- body can be seriously damaged 
from uhalation of certain solvents. I do 
not be Sieve we need wait any longer for 
additicsail evidence and more substanti-
atilig eases attesting to damage of the 
human body. It is time to irati ate a pro-
gram to deter and prevent Vie practice. 
Mr. Si,eaker, it is my intent" in to intro-
duce legislation amending ..he Federal 
Hazardoas Substances Labcnng Act to 
regain manufacturers of glues and other 
substmices containing toxic solvents to 
label their product with a skull and 
crossbones and the word "poison." In 
additicia. the tube or bottle containing 
the product should bear a laaxil warning 
that the vapor may be harmful and that 
the product should be used Only in a well-
ventilated area. 
The legislation will apply to glues 
and other substances containing the 
organic solvents most frequently pro-
ducing the intoxicating effect, such as 
toluene, xylene, methyl isobutylketone, 
methyl cellasolve acetate isopropyl 
alcohol, methylethyl ketoiaa acetone, 
ethyl saietate, or their combii ations. 
lu addition, it will also require that 
products containing these is manic sol-
vents be removed from the vieD serve-
yourse, I shelves of stores. 
Mr, Speaker, I do not deiade myself 
that this legislation will refol:m existing 
sniffers, but it may deter any new con-
verts so this dangerous practice. We 
must direct efforts aimed at correcting 
the underlying emotional disorders to 
make any real headway with the hard 
core toxic solvent sniffer. These young 
People are potential drug addicts of 
tomorrow. Let us take steps ro nip many 
of these, at an early stage when the 
job of rehabilitation is not so difficult 
it task. 
might add that I believe the Con-
gress should push vigorously ahead with 
pending legislation covering civil com-
mitment for drug addicts and a Federal 
aid program for drug treatment centers. 
We must realize the seriousness of the 
problem and take creative steps to aid 
those human creatures lost in a world 
of opiate dreams to find a pl,ace in lhe 
real world. 
A FATHER AND HIS SOXT SPEAK 
ABOUT VIETNAM 
(Mr. RODIN() (at the request of Mr. 
DE LA GARzA) was granted permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in 
the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. RODIN?. Mr. Speaker, when we-
talk about Vietnam, no one is more de-
serving of being heard than the young 
men who are there fighting for us all 
and the families of those men here 
awaiting their return. 
A few days ago, I received a ,elter Iroit 
the father of one of those young men, 
one who though wounded is still there 
in Vietnam engaged against ale enclay. 
Nothing that I can say can add to the 
courage and determination manliesied 
by the words of this father and his son. 
I am sure that all my colleagues, all 
Americans will share my heartfelt grati-
tude to these two great men and the 
pride that they are of us. And, above 
all, like our President and all Americans, 
I pray that a just and honorable way 
may soon be found to end this conflict, so 
that Jack and all his comrades may be 
home again with their families. 
The text of the letter follows:

DEAR PETER: That was very nice oi you, 
PE1E, to drop roe a little note commenting 
on our son Jack being wounded in Vietnam. 
This is typical of the thoughtlulness and 
consideration you have for your oinstititents, 
regardless of their party affiliation, which 
has endeared you to so many tl ousands 01 
people in the district. 
As a Member of Congress you may seen be 
called upon to express an opinion either in 
support of or opposed to the administra-
tion's policy in Vietnam. You may there-
fore be interested in this excerpt from a 
letter we recently received from Jack: 
"I was very lucky previously and there is 
a chance I won't be so lucky next tion-. If 
anything should happen I don't- want any 
big moping going on. I chose to ')?, here and 
I am proud to do my job." 
As President Johnson said kit L night- on. 
the television, the boys who are doing a 
job like our son Jack have no di iubts at all 
whether they are doing the right thing for 
our country and our freedom. From your 
letter, as well as the fact that y(Ik k have twen 
over there personally, I know that, you under-
stand this too. Thus, I know you 'won't be 
sidetracked by the strange views of sonar' 01 
your colleagues in the Senate whose motives 
are so hard to understand. 
Thank you again for your letler. I hope 
you will take every opportunity to become 
as vocal as possible in sunputing our 
mission in Vietnam. 
With kindest regards,.

TWICE AS MANY SUKARNOS? 
Each generation faces its own crisis. In 
the thirties and forties it was the rise of 
fascism. In the fifties and sixties it has been 
communism. In the seventies and eighties 
it's likely to be an even more virulent threat: 
Hunger. Americans probably won't go hun-
gry, but most of the rest of the world will, 
and we won't be able to escape the conse-
quencies. 
On pages 19 through 26 of this issue, the 
editors of Forbes examine the economic im-
plications of population growth pressing 
against an inflexible food supply. The work 
of a six-man Forbes team, the report takes 
a generally optimistic view about what U.S. 
business can do about the situation-and 
how it can benefit from it. 
But not everybody is optimistic, and we 
think it only fair to expose our readers to 
the views of an extremely well-informed 
businessman who thinks the prospects for 
feeding the world over the next few decades 
are dim, 
He's Thomas M. Ware, 47-year-o1d chair-
man of International Minerals & Chemical. 
Under Tom Ware's brilliant direction IMC 
has been extremely aggressive in expanding 
in the fertilizer field. But that isn't Tom 
Ware's only credential. He is chairman of 
the Freedom From Hunger Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization that promotes sup-
port among businessmen for the food pro-
grams of the United Nations. Most im-
portant of all, Tom Ware is an engaged and 
aroused citizen. 
''Hope always springs eternal," he told 
Forbes late last month. "But I don't see 
how on earth it's possible for the world to 
feed itself in the years ahead." 
UNDERUSED TOOLS 
It isn't a shortage of fertilizer, he em-
phasizes, of implements, of seeds, or even of 
land. The trouble is even more basic: It 
lies in the human mind. "Intelligence," he 
says, "is capital. We've spent billions on 
education in this country to get the amount 
of intelligence we have today. The under-
developed countries haven't, and they aren't 
going to be able to catch up overnight. 
"We've got the tools," he goes on. "TV 
is a great tool for mass education. Com-
puters and jet planes give seven-league boots 
to brilliant men. Satellite communications 
can spread ideas instantaneously. 
"But, because of a lack of education, of 
intelligence, many of our tools are not being 
used properly. Atomic power cannot be used 
for digging irrigation projects because of 
politics. Population control cannot always 
be used effectively because of religious ethic. 
And remember that the sword we give some-
Estimates. 
Plus stock.

3 Deficit. 
one to cut food can also be used to slay 
somebody else." 
Ware believes that hunger itself breeds 
ignorance. "If half the people in the world 
are starving," he says, "then half the world's 
minds are permanently maimed. They just 
don't have the voltage between the ears to 
get any work done. How can a mental dwarf 
who has no energy grow more food?" 
TO THE SKY? 
In his own field of fertilizer, Ware says, 
proper use takes intelligence and education. 
"Every soil is different, and needs different 
treatment," he says. "An American farmer 
knows just what he needs, and has the 
capital to pay for it. But a man who can't 
read might put fertilizer on a plant a foot 
thick and expect it to grow to the sky. In-
stead the plant would grow at all." 
Ware is concerned too that Americans 
aren't sufficiently aroused and may wait too 
long to take really effective action. He 
points out that it took 15 years to open up 
his company's big new potash mine in Sas-
katchewan. "For the first 5 years, we had 
to sit and assay the market. The next 5 were 
taken up with design and planning. The 
third 5 were spent actually digging the hole. 
In addition to all that time, there was the 
$60 million we spent. That experience has 
made me very respectful of the meaning of 
a doubled population in just 35 years." 
SCORCHED EARTH 
Finally, he speaks about the scarcity of 
arable soil in the world, and of the fact that 
world hunger will create turmoil that de-
stroys soil. "The soil was destroyed by war 
in the Nile Valley and the Mediterranean 
Basin, and now it's being scorched in Viet-
nam," he says. "When you double the 
population, you're going to double the num-
ber of Sukarnos, Cubas, Vietnams, library 
burnings, and the like. More accurately, 
you're probably going to get eight times as 
much trouble." 
We hope Tom Ware is wrong in his pessi-
mistic view. In fact, he hopes so, too. But 
unless the American people and American 
business make a mighty effort, and 
soon ? ? * well, Ware knows what he i 
talking about, if any man does. 
CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF DO S-
TIC PROGRAM EXPENDITURES 
URGED 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, for some-
time I have been convinced that we 
must assess very carefully and wisely 
the expenditures for our domestic pro-
grams in light of the needs to win the 
war in Vietnam. 
If we are to have a "win" policy in 
Vietnam, we must look at the domestic 
programs to determine where cuts should 
be made. These cuts rightly should 
be channeled into our military effort so 
that we may be able to win the war at 
the earliest opportunity. 
I believe the editor of the Farm Jour-
nal in the March 1966 issue made a very 
valid point when he asked: 
Isn't it about time we all got into this 
war, all made some sacrifice? Should we 
just leave all the sacrificing to 200,000 or 
more American boys in Vietnam? 
The editor is convinced that we can-
not continue full speed ahead on both 
the domestic and Vietnam areas without 
a necessary trimming back on the do-
mestic front. 
This editorial should be required read-
ing for those who believe we can do both, 
I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
torial, "It's Our War," be placed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
IT'S OUR WAR 
Isn't it about time we all got into this 
war, all made some sacrifice? Should we 
just leave all the sacrificing to 200,000 or 
more Americans boys in Vietnam? 
We may as well admit it: For the most 
of us except those boys and their families 
back home, life has been going on pretty 
cozily. We've followed the news of the war, 
but then have gone on about our affairs 
undisturbed. Most Americans have been 
doing pretty well financially. They've en-
joyed all the usual pleasures and some extra 
ones, kept comfortable and snug. 
Partly this was because we hoped that this 
war which we drifted into would soon end, 
and that the Vietnam nightmare would 
somehow go away. But we see now that 
likely we are in for a long and dirty fight 
and that the cost in men and money will 
probably go up, not down. 
What can we noncombatants do? 
Well, for one thing, we can realize we are 
'in a war and act like it. We can ask our 
Government to do the same. 
In his annual budget message the Presi-
dent called on us to "support the struggle 
in Vietnam" but then added that "the strug-
gle for a Great Society must go on una-
bated." Unabated, with a war going on?

We doubt that he really meant it, for already 
some spending programs have been cut back. 
But they need to be trimmed a lot more 
and the effort turned to the military struggle 
and the prevention of more inflation. Those 
are the two big jobs on our hands now. 
That's plenty: other things can surely wait. 
We can make the draft more fair. It can 
never be fully fair, but so far it has been 
falling too heavily on the boys not shielded 
by the sanctuary of college. 
ft we need more taxes to curtail Govern-
ment deficits let's have thern, unpleasant 
though taxes are. But not unless or until 
we've cut out spending for things we can 
forgo or at least postpone. Let's try that 
liret. 
lIi today's world we need allies. World 
opinion is a powerful force. But how many 
American boys should we sacrifice for fear 
of offending "allies" who are sending food 
one materiel to a shooting enemy? 
ft seamen to us that the bombing lull, 
the dispatch of our emissaries to all parts 
of the WOEld, the appeal to the United Na-
tions, futile as that organization is, were all 
worth trying. We favor making every other 
possible attempt at peace. The President 
has tried hard. 
What we are asking now is that he first 
consult fully with Congress, which he hasn't 
done, then have the courage to tell us what 
is necessary and when. In brief, let's all of 
us begin to share this war, so far as possible, 
with the boys doing the fighting. It will be 
mighty uneven sharing at best, but at least 
we can start acting like this is our war, not 
their. 
OUR NATION'S CAPITAL COLORING 
BOOK 
Mr. M.ILLF:R. Mr. President, in digni-
fied impressive ceremonies at Valley 
Forge, Pa_ on February 22,1966, the U.S. 
Capitol Historical Society was presented 
with its second Freedoms Foundation 
award. Honored with a 1964 citation 
for we, the people, the society was rec-
ognized again for its 1965 publication, 
Our Nation's Capital Coloring Book. 
The principal Americana Award was 
presented to the U.S. Capitol Historical 
Society of Washington, D.C. 
Honoring, our Nation's Capital Coloring 
Hook, using the historic and scenic monu-
ments of the Capital City, re-created our 
heritage in story and picture and included a 
recommended reading list, a full oolor page 
of State flags, a tour map of the city and note 
pages. 
Representing the society at Valley 
Forge was tire driving force founder, 
acal first lavsident of the society Fred 
Schwerigel of Davenport former Con-
gressman frorn the First District of 
low a. 
Ti presenting, the George Washington 
Honor Medal, Dr. Kenneth D. Wells, 
pm;ident of the Freedoms Foundation at 
'Valley Forge. made the following re-
marks: 
This next award goes to show what can be 
done with an idea in this great free society of 
ours. The stair of the U.S. Capitol Historical 
Society, ever mindful of the importance of 
history to the impressionable young, decided 
Ilona in order to meet the minds of our youth 
it must bend to the child's own media. The 
result was a combination history-coloring 
book that is now being used in classrooms 
all over America. It is one thing to produce 
a coloring book, but another to rank among 
the top echelon of Freedoms Foundation 
awards. Our jury felt that this was a great 
thing being done for millions of young Amer-
leans and we are proud to present this medal 
to the society. Our most sincere ongratula-
Vona. 
Mr. President, I am sure this is an 
honor with which all Members of Con-
gress and millions of other pet ole are in 
full agreement. All of us know of the 
outstanding job that the United States 
Capitol Historical Society has been doing 
to make our people more acquainted 
'with the facts and traditions of the 
U.S. Cap itol. 
I believe that the untiring work of 
Mr. Schwengel should sharc in this 
recognition because I know liow long 
and how hard he has labored so that 
the United. States Capitol Historical So-
ciety will fulfill the dreams of As f

WETNAM: CONTAINMEIT OR 
ICCOMIVIODATION 
Mr. MeGEE. M. Presid the 
Washington Sunday Star, in its lengthy 
and well-put lead editorial :,,estexday, 
examined the crux of the cum at debate 
over America's Vietnam pc hey, cut 
through the entangling maze of ques-
tions and answers and reached a conclu-
sion. That conclusion was thi t, "Given 
the importance that Vietnam has as-
sumed as a test case for Mao's doctrines 
of revolutionary conquest, th is, at 
present no realistic alternativi. to mili-
tary containment" of Red China. 
The Star's editorial com.mards atten-
tion, Mr. President, and I ask ulanimous 
consent that it be printed in th,! RJ:COMe. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in tin: RECORD, 
as follows: 
Luroz., the Washington (D.C.. Star, 
Mar. 6, 19661 
CRT ISSTJE : CO FITATNME: r OR 
ACCOATMODNTION 
The no tinning debate on Vig nam has 
not produced a solution to our mioblem in 
that part of the world. But it has succeeded 
to an erica meaging degree in gettine the prob-
lem down to its essentials. 
More and more, In recent clays, :.he debate 
has begen to transcend the ambiguities a 
Vietnam [self and center on the problem 
of the containment of Communst China. 
More and more, both those who defend our 
policies iv Vietnam and those who criticize 
them bave east their arguments terms of 
a tient ne dation between Ameri( an power 
and that of the vast nation which has taken 
over as the primary global ante gonist of 
the Unite ,1 States. 
Most serious critics c-f the adm eistration 
now admit that the containment (--tf China, 
is: soothe vitt Asia nod elsewhere is a vital 
interest iS the United States. Ti' question 
is simply ',whether or not the war c Vietnam 
serves this purpose. Are we containing or 
provoking China in Vietnam? Are we de-
creasing or increasing the risk of all-out con-
-eV-it9 IT. i' we the means of mitt: Vning our 
Objectives? I: there, in fact, a practical 
alternativii to the military conta mnent of 
Chinese expansionism in Viet ,ern and 
elsewhere'-
This an; wers to ail of these quo -tions de-
pend finally on an assessment of 0. ii capaci-
ties and an bitions of the regime to Peiping. 
It as the critics fear, the capacities of Red 
China are virtnally unlimited, military con-
tainment is indeed a dubious proposition. 
And if, E.:3 they hope, its ambi Lions are 
modest, an alternative :might be found. 
The alternative suggested, most explicitly 
by Chairman FULBRIGHT of the Stivate For-
eign Relations Committee, is what he cells 
an "accommodation" with China on a large 
scale. Peiping, he believes, can be induced 
to settle for the neutralization of southeast 
Asia in return for the withdrawal of Ameri-
can power from the area. If this were done, 
he implies, the aggressive nature of the Com-
munist regime would change and stability 
would return along China's borders. 
In our view the main trouble with this 
analysis is the fact that it Is refuted by 
virtually every scrap of available evidence 
about the capacities and ambitions of the 
regime in Peiping?which, incidentally, 
greeted Senator Fimanniceir's suggestion with 
the revelation that he and his feliow doves 
are as big "fools" in Peiping's book as are 
the American hawks. It is also in contradic-
tion with the major conclusion based on this 
evidence: That today the ambitions of the 
leaders in Peiping far exceed their material 
capabilities and that the military contain-
ment of China has been an established fact 
for 15 years. 
Those who would seek to assuage China's 
aggressive expansionism by any sort of a deal 
In southeast Asia must first close their eyes 
firmly to the dimensions of Pelping's terri-
torial appetite. The neutralization, or even 
-the outright surrender of Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia would amount to a drop in the 
bucket to a regime which loudly asserts 
traditional claims to hundreds of thousands 
of square miles on its periphery. 
The presence of American power in Viet-
nam is a minor irritant compared to the 
presence of American power in South Korea 
or Nationalist Chinese power on Taiwan. 
Appeasement in any form is hardly a realistic 
solution for a. country whose list of 
demands also includes large parts of 
Siberia, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, Thai-
land, and Malaysia. 
These territorial claims, combined with 
the militant spirit of the regime in 
Peiping, have in fact forced a policy of 
military containment on most of China's 
neighbors since the consolidation of com-
munism on the mainland in 1949. 
The Chinese have contested this con-
tainment many times in nanny places, 
sometimes with success. Tibet has been 
invaded and occupied. Direct negressien 
has been fostered against South Korea... 
Many clashes have occurred riling the 
Chinese-Russian border. Probing attacks 
have been made on India. The Nationalist 
Chinese islands of Quemoy and 11Io TJ111 in the 
Formosa Straits have come under bombard.-
ment and the threat of invasion from the 
mainland. 
Yet, with the exception of Tibet which lead 
no means of military defense and India 
where the Chinese still occupy some con-
tested border territory, the lines of con-
tainment have held. Today, the encircle-
ment of China about which the loaders in 
Peiping constantly complain is very real 
Indeed. And the pressure of American 
power from northern Japan to Theiland on 
which a major sector of the ring of contain-
ment depends has grown to formidable 
proportions. 
Since Korea, the leadership in Peiping has 
carefully avoided the risk of a direct con-
frontation with this American power. Fur 
all the bluster about paper tigers they 
have backed away from every situation which 
threatened to involve American an-power 
against Chinese territory. Confident as they 
ma.y be of their ability to defeat any actual 
invasion of the mainland, the healers in 
Peiping are thoroughly aware of Chinies 
vulnerability, even in terms of :nonnuclear 
weapons that could be brought to Pear. 
The formula of conquest by proxy, de-
veloped from Mao Tse-tung's doctrines of 
"peoples' wars of national liberation," has in 
recent years provided an ingenious solution 
to the dilemma which has confronted 
China. Without risk of direct involvement,

the encouragement and support of indigenous 
rebellions in areas marked for conquest have 
promised to provide the key to unlo6k the 
wall of containment and satisfy at least 
some of Peiping's territorial ambitions. 
Vietnam offered the ideal terrain. Since 
the French occupation, all the apparatus for 
successful subversive warfare had been at, 
hand. A successful "war of national libera-
tion" in Vietnam?particularly one which 
ended in the withdrawal of American power 
from southeast Asia?would open up in-
numerable opportunities for the expansion 
of Chinese domination in southeast Asia. 
Above all, perhaps, in the struggle with Rus-
sia for domination of the world Communist 
movement, success in Vietnam would provide 
the vindication of the Peiping's militant 
doctrines. 
On the other hand, if Chinese ambitions 
should fail in Vietnam the outlook from 
Peiping's point of view would be a good deal 
less encouraging. If the result of the war 
there turned out to be a massive new injec-
tion of American power, the containment 
of the rebellion and the strengthening of re-
sistance to subversion in other less vulnera-
ble areas, the leaders in Peiping might be 
induced to modify some of their most 
cherished hopes. 
Indeed, there is good reason to believe 
that this result is well on its way to being 
achieved. In Laos and Thailand, the Amer-
ican buildup in Vietnam has brought about 
a remarkable stiffening of resistance to Com-
munist pressures. In Indonesia, the hope of 
the Communists of turning the American 
position by seizing power has ended in stun-
ning disaster. In Ghana and Cuba, Mao's 
theories of the exportability of world revolu-
tion have suffered serious reverses. 
The fact which emerges, and which should 
impress itself on American doubters, is that 
the very survival of neutralism today in 
Asia?in Burma, Cambodia, and Indonesia, 
for instance?depends very much on the suc-
cess of the containment effort in Vietnam. 
The leaders in Peiping have been impressed 
enough by the difficulties which they are en-
countering everywhere to warn their people 
that they must expect temporary reverses 
and retreats along the road to ultimate vic-
tory. 
Given the importance that Vietnam has 
assumed as a test case for Mao's doctrines of 
revolutionary conquest, there is, at present, 
no realistic alternative to military contain-
ment. The time to begin talking about ac-
commodations will come when the door to 
aggressive Chinese expansion has been firmly 
closed once and for all. Under these condi-
tions, a genuine accommodation would take 
the form of opening the door to China's entry 
into the community of responsible nations. 
And this is the ultimate objective to which 
American policy in Asia should be unswerv-
ingly directed. 
COOPERATIVE WEATHER 
OBSERVERS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, for 
more than a hundred years in this coun-
try devoted public servants have been 
daily performing a public service of 
which most Americans are not aware. 
These men are the cooperative weather 
observers of the U.S. Department of 
Commerce Weather Bureau. 
Under this program, the observer is 
furnished the necessary instruments and 
without compensation he takes and 
records daily observations of the weather. 
Today in the United States there are 
over 12,000 of these observers, and it is 
estimated that these volunteers give to 
the Government about 1 million hours 
yearly. 
Mr. President, recently the Commerce 
Department published a book saluting 
the fine record of those who have been 
making weather observations for 30 or 
more years. In my own State of Cali-
fornia, there are more than 900 coopera-
tive weather stations in operation and 
13 of the men who man these stations 
have given over 30 years of service to the 
Weather Bureau. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the information from "The 
Cooperative Weather Observer," salut-
ing the efforts of the California volun-
teers, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the excerpt 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CALIFORNIA 
A natural resource of first importance to 
California is the diversity of its climates. 
Found within her boundaries are the dry 
desert climate of the southeast and the 
humid region of the northern coastal moun-
tains. Temperatures range from the searing 
heat of the desert and the interior valleys 
to the usually cool pattern of the north 
coast and the cold winter of the high Sierra 
Nevadas. It is the cooperative observer who 
has documented these several climates 
through the years so that we can tell what 
they are. The records have many applica-
tions. 
Consider, for example, the western portion 
of the San Joaquin Valley. This is an area 
with a desert-like climate. Few people live 
here, but for 50 years the operator of an 
oil company pumping plant maintained a 
cooperative weather record. Today plans 
are being made to bring in irrigation water, 
and the long and complete record from 
Middlewater forms a basis for estimating the 
climate of the rest of that area so that 
growers will be able to make effective use 
of the newly opened agricultural area. 
Form time to time flooding has occurred 
in one part of the State or another, and the 
records of the cooperative observers are of 
vital signiflance in an analysis of these 
floods. Not only is it important to know 
What rain fell during the flood situation, but 
long records of more normal conditions are 
necessary if users are to evaluate properly 
the significance of the periods of iligh rain-
fall. Damage suits in some flood damage 
cases amount to several millions of dollars. 
Of interest in delineating the climate of 
an area are the infrequent extremes that 
suggest the outside limits of weather that 
can be expected. Typical is the high tem-
perature of 134 degrees F. observed at Green-
land Ranch on July 10, 1913. Snowfall 
amounting to 60 inches was reported in a 
24-hour period on January 18 and 19, 1933, 
at Giant Forest. The total for a season was 
884 inches at Tamarack in 1906-07. Some 
of the hee,veist precipitation rates are 1.03 
inches in 1 minute at Opids Camp on April 
5, 1926, 11.50 inches in 80 minutes at Campo 
on August 12, 1891, and 26.12 inches in 24 
hours at Hoegees on January 22, 1943. 
Without the help of the cooperative ob-
servers who make their readings regularly 
each day we would have no information on 
which to base an estimate of these extremes. 
HOWARD It, ALLARD, WILLOWS 
Mr. Allard has been the official observer in 
Willows since 1926, continuing a record 
started in 1878. For 36 years he was with 
the irrigation district until his retirement 
in 1956, and since that time he has served 
as a city official in Willows. He has taken an 
active position of leadership in the com-
munity, in his church, and in the several 
branches of the Masonic lodge. At Willows, 
as at many stations, the weather observa-
tions have been a family project. 
ERNEST J. ANDERSON, ORLEANS 
Mr. Anderson became the observer at Or-
leans in 1932, continuing a record that 
started in 1885. For his outstanding work 
he was given the John Carnpanius Holm 
award in 1964. 
ROBERT E. BURTON, SANTA CRUZ 
Mr. Burton has operated this station since 
1931, except for the war years when he was 
on duty in the Pacific with the U.S. Navy. 
During that time he served on Ponape and 
operated a weather station there. His wife, 
son, and a neighbor operated the Santa Cruz 
weather station during that period. 
As a special project Mr. Burton has devised 
equipment for estimating the amount of dew 
deposited on redwood trees and has found as 
much as 40 to 60 gallons of water per acre 
on some nights. He received the John Cam-
pa,nius Holm award in 1964. 
At the present time Mr. Burton is a county 
supervisor for Santa Cruz County, 
CARLOS A. CALL, FORT ROSS 
In 1907 Mr. Call succeeded his father, who 
had been observing precipitation at Fort 
Ross since 1874. A storm in November of 
1874 gave a measured total of 18.06 inches 
of precipitation in 24 hours, and probably 
the amount was more than 20 inches. The 
gage ran over at one time during the storm. 
Mr. Call has sent us copies of data extracted 
from the records of the Russian colony that 
manned Fort Ross as early as 1810. 
The 91-year record within the family and 
the 58-year record by Carlos Call are out-
standing not only for their length but also for 
their quality. Mr. Call was chosen in 1960 to 
receive the John Campanius Holm award and 
in 1965 the, Jefferson award for outstanding 
service as a cooperative observer. 
WALTER CANTRALL, JESS VALLEY 
Mr. Cantrell was born in Jess Valley and 
he continued to live there to the present 
time. He has been the sole observer at this 
station since its establishment in 1929, and 
the record is not worthy for the total lack of 
missing data. 
Shortly after this station was established 
Mr. Cantrall assisted water resource officials 
In the selection, measurement, and marking 
of a new snow course that is still in use more 
than 30 years later. 
EDWARD C. GERLACH, LONE TREE CANYON 
Mr. Gerlach has been the 'observer ever 
since this station was established in 1933. 
It is in an area of precious little rainfall, 
where an accurate measurement of what 
little does fall is of vital importance. He is 
interested in community activities and has 
donated land to the Rod and Gun Club for 
their rifle range. 
LEROY KEMP, SQUIRREL INN NO, 2 
Mr. Kemp was first appointed as the offi-
cial observer in 1929, although he had in fact 
been taking observations for several years 
prior to this, both at Squirrel Inn No. 1 and 
No. 2. He visited the San Bernardino Moun-
tains for a summer vacation in 1924 and has 
remained there for 40 years. During that 
time he has worked for the Squirrel Inn, the 
school district, and the fire protection dis-
trict, among others, retiring in 1960. For 
many years he has sent in special weekly 
snow reports during the winter for the Na-
tional Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin. 
ARCHIE C. LEACH, CAMPO 
Mr. Leach is a rancher who was formerly 
with the engineering department of the city 
of San Francisco. His engineering back-
ground and his present interests lead to close 
attention to the accuracy of his precipitation 
records. He has operated the Campo weather 
station since January 1926. 
This station experienced a cloudburst on 
August 12, 1891, that produced 11.50 inches 
of precipitation in 80 minutes. . The-intensity 
of the storm is documented by newspaper 
accounts of the damage done.

MARINE POLICY 
Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, the

Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Repre-
aitative EDWARD A. GARMATZ, of Mary-
hind, recently spoke before the Maritime 
Administrative Bar Association on the 
subject of American merchant marine 
policy. 
I ailing his 18 years in Congress, Rep-
re;entative GARMATZ has acquired an ex-
pert knowledge of the problems facing 
our merchant marine. He is eminently 
tit:alined to speak on maritime matters. 
1.,?:enresentative GARMATZ, in his speech, 
calls for an end of the proliferation of 
studies of merchant marine problems 
and a beginning of effective remedial ac-
tion. He points especially to the con-
st.aiction of nuclear propelled merchant 
vessels as a stimulus to reverse the de-
ne of the merchant marine. 
F am in complete agreement with Rep-
ic!;entative GArincourz' plea to end the 
i:revailing in our maritime 
program. 
Mr. Pi, ?tient, I ask unanimous con-
sent that; die speech of Representative 
GiaRMATz to the Maritime Administrative 
liar Association on February 10, 1966, be 
printed in the RECORD. 
The being no objection, the speech was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 
Its.mARE a OF HON. EDWARD A. GARMATZ, CHAIR-
MAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON MERCHANT 
MARINE AND FISHERIES, BEFORE THE MARI-
TLY1E ADMINISTRATIVE BAR ASSOCIATION, 
Lawysas CLUB, WASIIINGToN, D.C., FEBRU-
ARY 10, 1966 
We have all been reading and nearing that 
the immediate months ahead are critical ones 
for the .American merchant marine and ship-
building industry. PerhapS they will be, but 
T suspei that the important matters for ad-
Ministrati ve, executive, and legislative deci-
sion, will be of a different nature than many 
people are thinking. 
do not expect that 'vie will be ectively con-
cerned iluring this session of Congress with 
any drastic or revolutionary overhaul of our 
:national maritime policy or programs. 
Whatever else might be said about the 
American merchant marine, it has hardly 
been the subject of insufficient study. 
Since I was first elected to Congress 18 
years ago, there has scarcely been a year when 
sonic governmental committee or quasi-
governmental committee, was not analyzing 
or dissecting the American merchant marine. 
During those years, we have witnessed at 
least 25 major studies of varying descriptions 
by the executive and legislative branches of 
our Goy ernment?not to mention countless 
minor studies. 
In more recent years, we have had the 
project Walrus report of the National Acad-
emy of science, the report of the Maritime 
Evaluation Committee of the Department of 
Commerce, the Interagency Maritime Task 
Force Report, and the report or the Presi-
dent's Maritime Advisory Committee. 
I am ready to make one prediction?that 
WO are reaching inevitably the end of an 
ern?the time is approaching when there 
must be a. halt to this proliferation of studies. 
Either we will find a way to follow through 
with ths effective execution of our mari-
time poliny and programs, as enacted by 
Congress, or there will no longer be a sub-
ject available for study. I am confident that 
the way for promoting and sustaining a 
healthy American merchant marine and ship 
Minding industry, will be found. 
in 111 y (minion, the difficulties which now 
beset our maritime industry are largely at-
tributable to the ineffective, and half-hearted 
adminisiration of the statutory programs, 
rather than to any basic deficiencies in the 
programs themselves. Indeed, all of the 
maritime studies, except one-- the Inter-
agency Meritime Task Force Report?seem 
to agree with that conclusion. 
in any hearings which our committee may 
hold on this subject, I intend to investigate 
se fully as possible the underlying reasons 
tor the persirtent and continual Administra-
tive that has, ianforturintely, char-
acterized our maritime programs_ 
Recently the thought has been advanced 
that the revclutionary ideas proposed by the 
present :Mt Mime Administrator have accom-
plisned um very worthwhile and beneficial 
purpose- elf nothing else?they have caused 
the Ic fit; -try -7,o think. 
Obyk.raly, I must agree, as I iiixpect any-
one would, that thought is giiod. Such 
platitud( a, however, do not alley my con-
cern for those who would seek to deviate 
from or to destroy our basic maritime legis-
lative pr,l.graM. 
Thougat without action in a commercial 
HEllistry is merely stultifying. Se are not 
attempting to develop a group of philoso-
phers. 
A diagnosis without a cure or continuous 
aeliberation without a decision eventually 
will pro ince stagnation and pc-vent any 
progress. 
T am f earful that the present chaotic and 
frenzied state of affairs has produced harm-
ful rather than beneficial results. 
Announced confusion over the administra.-
tion of our maritime programs has created 
uncertainty. 
A prospect that domestic operators may be 
allowed to construct vessels abroad certainly 
discourages new construction by ,iuch opera-
tors in domestic shipyards. 
The threat that our cargo preference laws 
may be repealed hinders new construction 
by operators of bulk carrier vessels. 
These vagaries in our own maritime pro-
gram have impeded the development of the 
American merchant marine and have un-
wittingly given encouragement tri the mer-
chant marines of other nations. 
The Maritime Administrator keeps calling 
for something new?the miracle that will 
solve all of our problems. I see many new 
developments, especially in the area of nu-
clear propulsion and containerization?but I 
see virtually no action by the AT:datum Ad-
ministration. " 
Six years ago I introduced a bill, to en-
courage the construction of nuclear merchant 
vessels, as the second phase of our nuclear 
ship program, but I have heard of little in-
terest in this field by the Maritime Admin-
istration. 
How new must something be to whet the 
whistle of those who chase the rainbow? 
Perhaps even nuclear propulsion is now too 
antedated for them and some more exotic 
technological change is sought. 
Let us return to reality. 
The United States has spent a lm-re amount 
of money to develop what is still the world's 
only Commercial nuclear vessel ..- the N.S. 
Savannah. 
That vessel is now outmoded, 15 we knew 
It soon would be. 
Yet the money has been wisely spent, ir we 
move ahead promptly in the second phase of 
our nuclear ship program which will be far 
less expensive than the first. If we do not 
move ahead, the substantial moneys that 
have been expended will have been wasted. 
I believe that we are now on the verge of 
a technological breakthrough, in the con-
struction of nuclear propelled merchant 
vessels. Nuclear propulsion is n 1 longer a 
fanciful dream, or something that is not firm-
ionic-ally feasible. 
We have the present ability ti cres to a 
fleet of large, fast, nuclear-pow red ships, 
which by their size, speed and ability to load 
and discharge, could, in a comparatively 
short time, dominate the point-to-point com-
mon carrier movement of the world's com-
merce. 
I believe that a program designed to pro-
vide support for a minimum r umber of 
nuclear-propelled vessels must be com-
mended immediately in American shipyards. 
There is at least one American-flag operator 
ready and willing to pursue such a progrern, 
and ham confident that others will follow. 
At the present time, the United States has 
a temporary advantage in the field of nuclear 
propulsion, but the real advantage will be 
ours, only if we capitalize on it. 
Eoreign operators are not emir ebered by 
the type of inertia that prevails in our 
time program and they will eventually move 
forward. The Germans are now building the 
Otto Hahn, a nuclear bulk carries, and the 
Japanese are contracting for a nuelear pro-
pelled oceanographic vessel. The Russians 
have the Lcnin, a large nuclear icebreaker. 
These are the foreign equivalents of the NS 
Savannah, except, that at least in 0 of these 
foreign nuclear vessels already incorporate 
reactor designs that I am informed are 
superior to the Savannah. 
Ironically enough, these foreif a reactor 
designs were derived directly from our own 
maritime reactor program. 
If we are to maintain our lean in nniri-
time nuclear power, and simultaneously to 
capitalize upon current developments in 
ocean transportation, we must make a deci-
sion now?thinking about it is not enough.

without a country to indulge in sneaky 
tricks. 
The crux of the matter is that Nkrumah 
condemned Prof. Kofi Abrefa Busia, one of 
the most brilliant Africans, Komla Agbeli 
Gbedemah, our most able politician, and 
other Ghanaians to the same fate he faces 
now and does not like the idea in the least. 
He is, in effect, tasting his own medicine and 
feels the tang of the bitterness of it. 
What does Sekou Toure hope to achieve by 
acceding to such a preposterous idea and step 
down as President? This is obvious if the 
situation of Africa is known. 
Sekou Toure, like many other African lead-
ers, is not secure in his own country. It is 
a fact which is well-guarded. His fear is to 
avoid the fate which befalls all ambitious 
people?overthrow; the fate which Nkrumah 
has suffered. 
Besides, Sekou Toure, Modibo Keita of Mali 
as well as many other African leaders, are not 
very sure of their footing in the world poli-
tics without Nkrumah's guidance. (This is 
the reason for Nkrumah having little regard 
for their intelligence.) They follow in 
Nkrumah's footsteps like faithful dogs. 
Without Nkrumah to dictate and direct their 
affairs, they are like toddlers who do not 
understand the world about them and are 
therefore unable to decide things for them-
selves. 
Sekou Toure wants Nkrumah .in power?. 
in Ghana, that is?to continue following 
him like the faithful dog he is. It is at once 
selfish and uninspired. 
If Sekou Toure fails?as he is bound to?
in this strategy, what does he expect to do? 
Nothing much as far as can be seen. While 
desperation may force both Nkrumah and 
Sekou Toure to some rash action, war with 
Ghana has to be ruled out. Apart from the 
inferior equipment and ill-training of the 
Guinean Army as compared to that of Ghana, 
an army from Guinea will have to cross the 
Ivory Coast which divides the two countries. 
This is something too farfetched to be be-
lieved since Nkrumah and Houphouet-
Boigny, President of the Ivory Coast, never 
saw eye to eye. Besides, war is the last thing 
any African leader thinks about. 
What may not be ruled out is harrassment 
by Sekou Toure, Modibo Keita and Nyerere 
of Tanzania of the Ghana Revolutionary 
Council on international platforms. What 
the council needs therefore, is the quick rec-
ognition due it from governments of the rest 
of the world?especially Western countries. 
This will stymie the attempts not only of 
Eastern countries but also of eastern-inspired 
and eastern-leaning countries which might 
want to involve themselves in the affairs of 
Ghana. 
We are rid of a dictator and tyrant. We 
are rid of a regime which took us from one 
form of oppression to another more oppres-
sive, more cruel and more exploiting. We 
are rid of a regime which was filled with liars 
and self-aggrandizing neosocialists. 
The wish of every Ghanaian in these mo-
ments is to see a new government comprised 
of young, intelligent, honest and sincere peo-
ple who will bring to our people the happi-
ness and prosperity to which they are rightly 
entitled. 
Our wish is to see a government devoted to 
removing the cancer of ignorance, disease 
and poverty which has riddled Africa for 
centuries and introduce the economic, polit-
ical, and social possibilities which will make 
it possible for us to forge ahead in the world. 
And, by Jove, we are going to get it?in spite 
of the designs by other African leaders who 
seek to further their political ambitions at 
the expense of Ghana and Ghanians.

SSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX A1217 
The Insight of Carl T. Rowan 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE A. SMATHERS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE SENATE OF' THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, Carl 
T. Rowan is one of the newer nationally 
syndicated columnists now commenting 
on national and international affairs. 
In my judgment, he has demonstrated 
over the past few months that he has 
sound judgments and superior writing 
skills. His exposition of difficult prob-
lems is always lucid, calm, and thought-
ful. 
In my opinion, Mr. Rowan brings 
some special qualifications to the com-
mentator's art because, unlike a num-
ber of his contemporaries, Carl Rowan 
has rendered distinguished service to the 
Federal Government?as an ambassador 
and later as director of the U.S. Infor-
mation Agency. 
In short, having seen government both 
as a journalist and as a public official, 
Mr. Rowan seems to be happily free 
from the "beast theory" of the conduct 
of public affairs and in my opinion writes 
about men and events in terms of actu-
ality, rather than some vague or ima-
gined conspiracy. 
I find his columns refreshing and al-
ways interesting. I call attention to his 
column of March 4, 1966, which appeared 
in the Washington Evening Star, and 
ask unanimous consent that the column 
by Carl T. Rowan be inserted in the 
Appendix of the RECORD. 
There- being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE REASON HUMPHREY EXPLODED 
(By Carl T. Rowan) 
To understand the vigor of Vice President 
HUBERT HUMPHREY'S disagreement with Sen-
ator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, Democrat, of New 
York, on Vietnam, you have to understand 
the nuances of what HUMPHREY was doing on 
his par East trip. 
HUMPHREY exploded when he heard of 
KENNEDY'S proposal that the United States 
promised the Vietcong a role in a future gov-
ernment of South Vietnam because he felt 
KENNEDY had undercut the major achieve-
ment of his journey. 
During the summit meeting in Honolulu, 
President Johnson had become concerned 
about the delicate political situation in 
Saigon. 4e had been impressed by argu-
ments that the talk of negotiations had 
freightened some powerful forces in the 
south. There was some danger that the gov-
ernment of Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky 
would collapse if it were not made clear that 
there was no scheme afoot to abandon South 
Vietnam to the Reds. 
SO HUMPHREY'S first job was simple?to 
convince leading South Vietnamese that the 
United States was not going to surrender the 
south to Hanoi?but that neither United 
States nor world opinion would permit 
Saigon to take the truculent attitude of op-
posing negotiations. 
Hunarrumy left Saigon feeling that he had 
calmed South Vietnamese anxieties and con-
vinced Saigon of the desirability of a peaceful 
settlement. Then, in New Zealand, he saw 
KENNEDY'S proposal for a coalition. 
"Oh, no," he reportedly exclaimed, "this 
will frighten the South Vietnamese to death." 
Without waiting for instructions from 
Washington, he denounced the idea of put-
ting Communists in the Saigon government 
as like "putting a fox in a chicken coop." 
Back home, the Vice President has told in-
timates that he wants to avoid a fight with 
KENNEDY "but I can't remain silent in the 
face of talk that is so stupid. No labor or-
ganizer in his right mind would announce 
before negotiations what he was prepared to 
give up. It's like saying publicly that you 
don't really want a strong organization to 
represent the workers but you'd be satisfied 
with just a little company union." 
Johnson also is eager to avoid an open 
fight with KENNEDY, which is why so many 
people spent so many hours trying to gloss 
over KENNEDY'S initial break with the ad-
ministration. 
But in private, top members of the Johnson 
team express their irritation with KENNEDY 
by asserting that he is "only after the head-
lines." 
They point out that KENNEDY had access 
to the most sensitive intelligence informa-
tion and knows that the Vietcong is simply 
the instrument through which Hanoi set out 
to conquer South Vietnam. 
Administration spokesmen show particular 
irritation when they ask, "Why didn't KEN-
NEDY propose the coalition 3 years ago when 
he could have shared the responsibility for 
It?" 
As for other aspects of the Vice President's 
travels, I reported on January 7, after his 
early trip, that he had arranged for greater 
Asian involvement in the war?if the peace 
offensive failed. The Koreans have just an-
nounced that 25,000 more troops are going to 
Vietnam. And Philippines President Ferdi-
non E. Marcos, who a year ago opposed in-
volvement of even a Filipino engineers unit 
in Vietnam, has disclosed that HUMPHREY 
convinced him he ought to send Filipino 
troops to South Vietnam. 
One of the most important and unpubli-
cized achievements of the Vice President's 
recent mission was to arrange to keep chan-
nels of communications open to Hanoi, 
Peiping, and Moscow. 
The war plans are being stepped up but the 
Vice President arranged that?through the 
Pakistanis to the Chinese, through the In-
dians to the Russians, and through some 
delicate channels directly to Hanoi?the olive 
branch is to be constantly dangled. 
If a peaceful settlement of this wretched 
war is achieved, it very likely will be because 
of communications through these channels?
but surely not because of any widely debated 
proposals and gestures on the American 
political scene.

ten Lion is focused upon assisting hungry 
nations, the outstanding editorial which 
appeared in the Kansas City Star just 
yesterday. March 6, is of particular in-
terest. The editorial by Rod Turnbull, 
the Star's agricultural editor, discusses 
world food needs and the possible effect 
on domestic farm plans. As he states, 
'Once a commitment has been made, it 
will be difficult to turn back." 
Mr. Turnbull is widely recognized for 
his knowledge of agriculture and, with-
out question, one of the Nation's top 
agricultural editors. I believe everyone 
will agree his editorial is an exceptional 
one. 
Panw SuRFLUSES FALL AS A VICTIM OF DEMAND 
ItPee00r an executive of a wheaterower 
organization wrote to his members: "If some-
one had said to me 2 years ago 'your excess 
supplies of wheat would be gone by July 1, 
1966; I would have said, 'listen Bud, you 
have your bead in the clouds.' " 
'ibis comment illustrates tam national sur-
prise over the apparent disappearance of the 
U.S. farm surplus problem. No doubt it has 
crone as a surprise--if in fact we can say 
that the surpluses are gone. 
Actually, it does seem as if all at once au-
thorities are speaking of our farm surpluses 
as something in the past and are referring 
to stockpiles as reserves, rather than prob-
lems. Certainly this wasn't the attitude 
even less than a year ago, when the 1965 
farm act was passed by Congress. The new 
law provided for still greater reductions in 
acreages to control production. 
Now, in contrast, the Department ol Agri-
culture is ever so slightly loosening some of 
the reins on production in 1966. Also there 
are people who propose that this country had 
better hurriedly return to using its idle acres 
before we run into serious worldwide food 
problems. 
What happened? How could the change 
come so fest as between surplus piles and re-
serves, or even shortages? 
it is'., long story, difficult to explain in all 
its details. But in the main, the big change 
that has come faster than most people antic-
ipated her been in demand, both domestic 
aid worldwide, and in both the dollar mar-
kets and our giveaway programs. 
A second major shift has been in attitude, 
perhaps induced by the rapidly expanding 
demand. Surpluses are not measured en-
tirely in pounds or bushels alone, we are 
learning. Another factor is whether the 
public or the market regards a certain quan-
ti ty as a surplus or a. reserve. 
leer any valid assessment of the current 
situation as to surpluses versus reserves, it 
should be kept in mind that this country has 
substantial stocks of grains on hand. Esti-
mates are being made that as of July 1 this 
year the wheat surplus may be down to 600 
million bushels. Tins would be the carry-
over of wheat on hand as the new harvest 
began. incidentally, that 600-million figure 
is one often proposed as the amount this 
country always should have in reserve--it is 
approximately what we use annually at 
home for food and seed. 
'the United States never had a carryover 
or 600 million bushels until 1940. This 
ISOUIlt was depleted during the war years 
and the total did not get back up to the 600-
million figure again 'until 1953. We will also 
have more than a billion bushels in corn on 
hand next October 1. Again, the carryover 
f8 this feed grain never in all history reached 
a billion bushels until 1955. So we're not 
yet scratching the bottom of the barrel when 
it comes to supplies of these grains. That cir-
cumstance, indeed, is one thing that has the 
administration worried. It fears that de-
mand for increasing production will break 
tee dike again and bring about a return of 
surplus piles before an absolute outlet for all 
can be assured. 
the urplus piles, which have impressed 
themselms ?0 much upon the Nation, grew 
in the late 1950's. The decisive jump in 
carryover wheat stocks came after the huge 
1958 crop of 1,457,435,000 bushels. Inciden-
tally. the average per-acre yield that year was 
27.5 buithels, a figure never achieved before 
nor since. The wheat carryover continued to 
grow urell 1961 when it peaked at 1,411 mil-
lion bushels. As mentioned, predictions are 
that it will be at around 600 million bushels 
this Jule I. 
The feed emmr'. surplus likewise grew in the 
1950's, reselling a top of 4,700.000 tons in 
1961. IL is expected to be at ar tund 6 mil-
li, in tons this next October. Strangely 
enough, while the feed grain yields were 
Large in the 1950's, they have been even 
huger in the 1960's, with alltime records set 
in 1965 on corn, eats, barley and grain 
sorghun 
The surpluses accumulated, obviously, be-
cause production was greater than consump-
tion. In turn, the surplus piles are growing 
smaller now for the simple reason that larger 
amounts of 'rhe grain are being consumed. 
The reasons why are impressioe and their 
development, which seems to have caught so 
many by surprise, is interesting 
The one word that describes tile situation 
still is demand. 
Demean has skyrocketed because of, 
among other things: 
Prosperity in the advanced nations of the 
world. 
Hugh needs in the less-advanced nations 
of the w arid. 
The rapidly increasing world population. 
On the opposite side of demand significant 
developments have included short wheat 
crops in both Australia and Argentina, tradi-
tionally important exporting nations. 
Not to be overlooked is the shock that 
came to the world when the Soviet Union, a 
former exporter, had to buy wheat in huge 
quantities. 
iiirdareied against all the indications of in-
creasing demand is the realization that the 
only major grain surplus-produeing area in 
the woied is North America-- the United 
States and Canada. 
All these factors together have changed 
attitudes in just what constitutes a surplus. 
In otIng words, a given quantity of wheat 
or corn dosen't appear so big or market-
frightening as it did some year: ago. 
Now as For these forces that are skyrocket-
ing demand. It will be observed that many 
are interrelated. 
First, world prosperity, which affects the 
United States and most of the other 
advanced nations. 
In this country the utilization of feed 
grains, 85 percent of which go I or livestock 
.end poultry feed, has been rising markedly 
since the middle 1950's. Both population 
growth and prosperity have con tributed to 
such expanding use. In the marketing year 
1954-55, the United States required 89,700-
000 tons of feed grains to feed its livestock. 
This year art estimate is that the correspond-
ing utilzation will be 119,100,000 tons. 
But even more dramatic--and greater in 
percentage--has been the increase of feed 
grain exports. Th.ey, too, began to rise in 
tIre middle 1.950's. The total in 195.1-55 was 
fj, million, tons. Without an exception 
there has been an increase each year since 
then. And in 1966 the total should reach 
an amusing 25 million tons. 
The major feed grain is corn. A 3-billion-
bushel crop used to be considered a big one 
for the united States. All through the 
1950's, when surpluses were building up, the 
corn crops were running above 3 billion and 
approaching 4 billion.. Our first 4-billion-
bushel crop was harvested in 1963, 
Last year, an alltime record was set with 
4,171 million bushels. The significant point 
Is that we apparently are going to use it all 
this year, domestically and in exports. The 
carryover next October 1 will be approxi-
mately 1,200 million bushels, or just about 
the same as it was on the same date a year 
ago. A record crop, but no increase in 
surplus. 
More poultry, more livestock in Europe 
and Japan spell big business for U.S. .feed 
grain exporters. People in the countries are, 
as we say in the United States, eating higher 
on the hog. The first part of this year, for 
example, combined exports of grain sor-
ghums and corn to Italy were up 70 percent 
over the same period in the previous year. 
Japan is the No. 1 importer of liL, corn and 
and soybeans and its take of these two 
grains was up 61) percent the first quarter of 
this year. Spain, West Germany, the Neth-
erlands, and Belgium all are taking more and 
more. American salesmanship has some-
thing to do with this boost in trade, j ut 
general prosperity can't be discounted 
Hardly anybody back in 1955 would have 
predicted totals in exports that are being 
experienced today. There were authorities 
at that time, however, who were contending. 
that the way to get rid of surpluses was 
to get out and sell them. 
The feed grain exports go mostly for 
dollars. It is a different story with wheat. 
But the effect on the surplus pile is the 
same. The United States has been sending 
more and more wheat abroad since 1955. 
Here poverty and famine in the world are 
dominating factors. In the current year 
the total may reach 900 million bushels. A 
major part of this will be under the Public 
Law 480 program, even though our dollar 
exports have been increasing also. Domestic 
consumption, plus exports, will require some 
200 million more bushels of wheat than the 
United States raised last year. 
It will be observed from the foregoing 
data that the utilization of grain produced 
in this country took an appreciable upward 
trend in the middle 1950's which not only 
has continued to this day, but appears to 
be accelerating. At the same time we have 
had a farm program which has taken some 
50 to 60 million acres out of production. 
This decrease must have had some effect 
on production, even when record yields were 
being experienced. Farmers in the Corn Belt, 
it has been estimated, have almost doubled 
their use of fertilizer since 1960. 
To whatever extent the farm program has 
checked total yields, it has helped, along 
with greater utilization, to reduce the surplus 
piles. 
Thus we find ourselves today with sur-
pluses in smaller quantities than was the 
case a few years ago. Plus the fact that 
because of current and pending demand, a 
given quantity of surplus doesn't frighten 
us as much as before. With this new situa-
tion in regard to surpluses, we face new 
decisions on how to proceed in agriculture. 
One major decision must be on how much 
we intend to commit to the hungry nations 
of tile world. The result will have its effect 
on all farm plans. Once a commitment has 
been made, it will be difficult to turn back. 
After deciding what we intend to supply 
to the hungry nations then, since we have 
a Government-planned agriculture, it will be 
up to the administration to determine what 
the production acreage should be and what 
reserves should be maintained. Thc assump-
tion now is that acreage controls will be re-
laxed to some extent, with possibly all re-
strictions on plantings removed by 1975. 
The weather remains an unknown factor. 
We have experienced in recent years perhaps 
the best crop-growing period in recent his-
tory. Suppose there is a trend the other 
way? 
It will take a master hand on the con-
trols lever to determine just what acreage 
Is needed in the various crops which have 
been under Government guidance but which

Greek Lesson Applies to Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, Seymour 
Freidin has pointed out in the following 
article from the February 26, 1966, edi-
tion of the New York Herald Tribune 
that the situation we face in Vietnam 
today is directly analogous to that we 
faced in postwar Greece when the 
Truman doctrine saved that nation from 
certain Communist takeover. 
Mr. Freidin's article is very much to 
the point and I commend it to the at-
tention of our colleagues: 
OITR GREEK LESSONS APPLY TO VIETNAM 
(By Seymour Freidin) 
SAIGON.?This is a war the Vietnamese 
must fight and win, with help, but none of 
the choleric critics and self-appointed peace-
makers abroad really consider them. 
After 20 years of bloodletting and terror 
there is a pronounced battle fatigue. But 
the people of South Vietnam show no sign 
that they are ready to yield. Indeed, if 
they didn't have the will to persist, all Viet-
nam. would by now have been in Communist 
hands. 
This fact has been ignored by the critics 
as they search for methods of bypassing 
the South Vietnamese. 
The determination to 'assure social re-
form, the vast military operation?which 
confounds the Communists?and the proj-
ects for pacifying South Vietnam are really 
just beginning. Their successful comple-
tion requires time, stamina, and compre-
hension. 
T.J.S. forces speak with assurance and ad-
miration of the Vietnamese and the future 
of their country. The Americans here are 
quite a new breed from those we knew in 
World War IL They are, in the main, knowl-
edgeable and compassionate. Moreover, they 
know why they are here. 
A realization, therefore, has grown rapid-
ly that the nearest parallel to South Viet-
nam in contemporary history is that of post-
war Greece. There, Communist guerrillas 
included combat forces and highly organ-
ized, tightly discipline political activists. 
Desperately poor, the country depended on 
its tough-willed but have-not rural popula-
tion to power the economy. By the time the 
Truman. doctrine was promulgated nearly 20 
years ago, the Greek Government was most 
unpopular and inept. 
Haying been short circuited immediately 
after the war by the direct role of Win-
ston Churchill, Communist cadres cached 
Weapons and munitions. They had a huge 
frontier sanctuary across the Albanian, Yugo-
slav, and Bulgar borders. Soon they were 
falling upon mountain villages, exacting 
bloody reprisals and exorting taxes and ran-
som. Government forces were riddled with 
intrigue and bad leadership. The nation 
had avaricious politicians to match. 
When we came to Greece, after Britain 
bowed out due to exhausted resources, Com-
munist guerrillas were at the gates of Athens. 
Our first move was to try and pour tangible 
aid into the country. ? Profiteering com-
menced and corruption spread. 
Sound familiar? There were the critics 
of the "Truman intervention" who said 
Greece was too far gone and that we didn't 
belong there anyway. Gradually, the whole 
program was upgraded, emphasizing security 
and social reform. 
With the rejuvenation came a govern-
mental and military shakeup. Marshal 
Papagos became the take-charge man for 
Greece. We sent in skilled officers, who 
worked down to the company level with a 
refitted Greek Army that went out to seek 
and destroy the guerrillas and their nation-
wide network. 
In mid-civil war, Tito, having broken with 
Stalin, closed his borders to the Greek 
guerrillas, sealing their doom. But before 
that, assistance teams went out to the re-
motest, most wretched hamlets and worked 
at reform, which the Communists always 
tried to prevent. 
The lamenters and the cynics declared that 
the Greek-American plan couldn't possibly 
work; that the Communists were riding the 
wave of revolution. Moreover, they worried, 
the Soviet Union could not stand by idly 
and see our presence so near. 
What happened in Greece is history. Lots 
of the same treatment?curing social in-
justice and, above all, providing security?
is on the way to Vietnam now. 
The Government has a chance under 
Nguyen Cao Ky. He is young and impatient 
but intelligent. Ky knows that the real 
battlefront is reform and development. To 
win takes time. The Vietnamese know it. 
So should we. Greece is our shining ex-
ample. 
"Job Center To Be Reality" 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. SAM GIBBONS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, busi-
nessmen the country over are taking an 
increasingly active role in the War on 
Poverty. As an example of this fact, I 
cite an article appearing in the Omaha, 
Nebr., Woild-Herald of February 20, 
dealing with the efforts of one Omaha 
businessman, J. 0. Grantham, director 
of long-range manpower planning for 
the Northern Natural Gas Co., to help 
secure a men's Job Corps center at the 
Lincoln, Nebr., Air Force Base. 
I commend this article to my col-
leagues: 
JOB CENTER To BE REALITY?OIVLAHAN SAYS 
LINCOLN WILL GET APPROVAL 
The Omahan spearheading a drive to cre-
ate a men's Job Corps center at the Lincoln 
Air Force Base said Saturday he is confident 
the center will be approved. 
J. 0. Grantham, director of long-range 
man power planning for the Northern Natu-
ral Gas Co., said he hopes the remaining 
hurdles can be cleared Tuesday when two 
Federal Job Corps officials from Washington 
spend the day in Ornaha and Lincoln. 
Mr. Grantham said he feels the Federal 
Government no longer questions the capabil-
ity of Northern and the University of Ne-
braska to start and successful operate the 
center. 
But Federal officials aren't satisfied with 
the proposed educational program, he said, 
specifically in these areas: 
How the basic education of the corpsmen 
will fit into their vocational training. 
How their 24-hour living schedule will fit 
into the vocational training. 
How Northern and NU will train ,the staff 
to work with corpsmen, most of whom are 
school dropouts. 
How Northern and NU plan to improve the 
program as it goes along. 
If the Federal Government wasn't in-
terested in creating the center, it wouldn't 
send Drs. Ray Keating and Chester Hall here 
Tuesday for further talks after days of dis-
cussions in Washington last week, Mr. 
Grantham said. 
The Office of Economic Opportunity is 
proceeding slowly in creating new centers, 
he said. It has had time to evaluate weak-
nesses in its first centers and is eliminating 
them before opening new ones, he said. 
Mr. Grantham said the proposed center, 
which would open next summer, has more 
potential significance to Nebraska than just 
Its economic impact on Lincoln. 
The number of top staff personnel it 
would attract and trained corpsmen it 
would produce could be a significant factor 
in attracting new industry to the State, he 
said. 
Jets Broaden Markets 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. FRANK HORTON 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
,Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, Marion 
Sadler, president of American Air-
lines, addressed the Rotary Club of 
Rochester, N.Y., on March 1. In 
reporting this important talk, both the 
Rochester Times-Union and the Demo-
crat and Chronicle emphasized the im-
portance of direct air service in expand-
ing domestic markets and developing for-
eign markets. Particular emphasis was 
focused on the expanding markets in the 
Far East. 
The airline president told members of 
the Rotary Club that American, along 
with most other air carriers was receiv-
ing a great many new jet aircraft, mak-
ing it possible for American to improve 
service to Chicago, New York, and other 
cities. 
Mr. Speaker, because of its interest to 
my colleagues, especially those serving 
communities having similar industrial 
and commercial roles to those of Roch-
ester, I am pleased to have Mr. Sadler's 
excellent speech published in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD: 
ROCHESTER AND THE SUPERSONIC AGE 
(By Marion Sadler, president, American Air-
lines, Inc., before the Rotary Club, Roches-
ter, N.Y., Mar. 1, 1966) 
I thank you for inviting me to be with you 
today. It is good to be in Rochester, and it 
is good to be at Rotary. 
For 5 years, I was an active member of 
Rotary in Buffalo, and my father was an 
early president of the Rotary Club in Clarks-
ville, Tenn., soon after World War I. I sort 
of grew up with Rotary, and I regard it as a 
privilege to be able to break bread and talk 
with you Rochester Rotarians today.

for other policies where our leadership is still 
in dispute. 
The formula program has made agricul-
tural research in the States most successfulo 
This is because it provided a continuity of 
research support and therefore made it pos-
sible to keep highly qualified personnel. 
Genetic research such as you describe in your 
letter would have found less success if carried 
on with grant fonds rather than formula 
funds because of the long-term nature of the 
research. It is an example of research mains 
tained successfully by a station only be-
cause of the confidence in the ability to 
fond long-term research. This confidence 
was based largely upon our history of formu-
la binding. The continuing aspect of this 
program is a principal source of its strength. 
We feel that any attempt to trade formula 
funds for grant binds would be a violation 
at the original philosophy contained in the 
Hatch appropriation and would jeopardize 
he continuity which has made the Hatch 
program so effective. 
Turning to specifics defined in your letter, 
we are prompted to remind you of the long 
history of the Minnesota Experiment Station 
in water research, toxicoses, and our current 
heavy involvement in studies involving vari-
IMS mycotoxins as they affect livestock and 
humans. This important work has been car-
led on with the assistance of Hatch funds 
and, as you indicate, deserves continued at-
tention and support. In addition, Minne-
sota has had a long history of State support 
for plant protein research. We fear that 
a reduction in experiment station funds 
might shift priorities and threaten this vital 
and ongoing research. 
We are cognizant of increasing national In-
'west in the area of resource development. 
Worestry is obviously an important portion 
of this field of study. We feel it important 
that McIntire-Stennis funds be increased to 
now additional work in this area. 
While we recognizo that at a Federal level 
priorities can be addressed to agricultural re-
search, we would hope that it be recognized 
that the same process operates at a State 
level. We would hope, too, that it would be 
apparent that the tradition of research in 
the State, the strengths of research staff, and 
the needs and desiras of the people of 
a specific State are strong directives in for-
mulating these priorities. We like to feel 
that our 15- to 20-percent adjustment in pro-
gram each year, arrived at in consultation 
with USDA, represents a diligent and respon-
sible effort to address ourselves to tasks of 
aurrent importance. 
We hope that our concern for the proposed 
ants in USDA research expenditures has been 
made clear. Further, we hope that possible 
shifts in the method of deployment of these 
osuds will be reconsidered. We strongly urge 
that the serious concerns of this institution 
and our sister institutions throughout the 
country will prompt a restoration of a budget 
!;hat makes possible the research in State 
universities and colleges that is so obviously 
important to the health of the Nation.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 
WaShington, D.C., January 26, 1966. 
President 0. MEREDrm Ws:Isom, 
iininersity of Minsesota, 
Sfinnaapolis, Minn. 
DEAR PRESIDENT WrisoN: This letter is to 
banner you about this Department's 1967 
;midget proposals. These include funds for 
support of research in the State agriculture 
oxperiment stations, cooperative State for-
estry schools, and funds for project grants ad-
ministered by the Cooperative State Research 
Service. 
We are asking for increased project grant 
funds to support research on problems of 
highest priority in States where such sup-
port can be gotten most effectively. Specific 
areas for new research emphasis will include 
more efficient use of water, ways of elimi-
nating food poisoning and toxin-producing 
organisms from our food supply and other 
issues of press mg importance. 
Increased support is proposed for ret, arch 
on plant proteins, including soybeans, to help 
expand markets and to contribute to world 
protein food needs. Some new funds are re-
quested to accelerate research on the role of 
cooperatives in farm marketing systems 
Funds are included to continue project 
grant support for research to find ways of 
reducing the costs of prod uMng and market-
ing cotton. 
This new reeearch will all contribu te to 
achieving the missions and goals that this 
Nation has set out. 
Of especial importance to one of these 
goals, about $1 million are requested for the 
first time to support research in the 16 
former Negro land-grant colleges. They now 
have little research support from any source. 
They provide training for a rapidly increasing 
number of students, presently about 40.000. 
Provision of research support for their facul-
ties is essential to their further growth in 
excellence. The research to be supported 
will be responsive to the needs of the rural 
communities from which their students 
come. 
Support for forestry research under the 
McIntire-Stennis Act complements that of 
the Forest Service. This new research pro-
gram is off to a very good start. It will pro-
vide a much-needed increase in the supply 
of trained research people for all our forest-
related activities. It will speed the research 
results needed di the several States. Fends 
asked for this area of research are continued 
at the 1966 level, $2.5 million. 
We are deterrained to continue support to 
the research in the State agricultural experi-
ment stations. We will continue to work 
with them to make that research even more 
productive, to further improve its quality, 
and to assure its concentration on research 
of highest prionty. 
The research at the State agricultural ex-
periment stations which is supported by 
funds appropriated under the Hatch Act and 
by State appropriated funds continues to 
make outstanding contributions to the solu-
tion of agriculture's problems. For example, 
is recent discovery has been made at the 
Indiana Agricultural Experiment Station at 
Purdue. Genetic research there has devel-
oped corn breecing lines and hybrids which 
are high In. protein. This discovery may be 
epochial not on..y for the feeding of pigs and 
poultry, but for people for whom corn is an 
important food, too. 
Adjustments proposed in the 1967 esti-
mates will permit continuation of research 
on such urgent problems as pesticides for 
which the Congress provided special funds in 
1965 and on other problems of high priority. 
We have always emphasized the neceesity 
for elimination of research of low priority. 
About 20 percent of all projects terminate 
each year. Many of these are replaced by 
projects in new areas. This year's budget 
proposals for fonds Ander the Hatch Act 
select this continuing policy by a proposed 
reduction of $1s5 million. This reduction 
amounts to only about 4 percent of funds 
from all sources available to the State agri-
cultural experiment stations. 
While it will necessitate elimination of 
low-priority research, remaining funds and 
the new grant research funds can accelerate 
needed concentration on high-priority prob-
lems. 
? The long-range study of research needs 
now underway will more clearly identify 
areas of greatest urgency for future budgetary 
consideration. 
The administration is determined to sup-
port research needed for economic growth 
and for human welfare. We will find within 
our current funds as much of that needed for 
research as we can. Pruning out low-priority 
research will make the new growth snore 
fruitful. 
Sincerely yours, 
Osivn,LE L. FREEMAN. 
The School Lunch and Special Milk Pro-
grams Are Vital to the Continuing Good 
Health and Proper Education of Ameri-
can Children 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OP 
HON. HAROLD D. DONOHUE 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. DONOHUE. Mr. Speaker, liko a 
good many colleagues here I am very 
deeply concerned about and very deeply 
and earnestly question the economic 
urgency and wisdom of the Administra-
tion's request for apparent major reduc-
tions in the appropriations for federally 
impacted areas and the school lunch and 
special milk programs that have, over 
these past several years, been so health-
fully enjoyed by hundreds of thousands 
of American children. 
The President himself has said that, "a 
poor diet is a root cause of disease." I am 
sure that every American agrees with him 
in that statement. 
The school milk program is of vital im-
portance for our school youngsters be-
cause, according to all of the authorities, 
milk contains nutrients essential for good 
health. They further tell us that milk 
is a basic factor in building proper diet 
habits. And even further, we all know 
that a well-nourished child learns better 
than an undernourished child. 
The school officials themselves testify 
to us that the proposal to distribute the 
milk and limit the program on the basis 
of need is both impractical and unwork-
able. Under this proposal it would seem 
that school administrators would be 
asked to separate the students whose 
parents have a low level of income from 
those who are assumed to be able to 
afford to buy the milk. This certainly 
appears to be inducing school officials to 
do something our schools are not set up 
to do and it is also quite likely to create 
an artificial barrier between and among 
the students. 
Mr. Speaker, in my opinion our school-
lunch and milk program is basically and 
primarily a health program, not a welfare 
program. The savings projected in the 
proposed appropriation reductions are so 
small in comparison with some of our 
overly generous expenditures for projects 
ahd programs in other countries and 
other people all over the world that they 
appear unjustifiable on any normal, eco-
nomic or practical standards. 
Whatever the need, and I think there 
is real need, to sensibly restrict Govern-
ment expenditures, I would hope we can

This is representative of several sim-
ilar news articles that have appeared 
throughout the 19 counties in the Sev-
enth Iowa District. It indicates a strong 
support by the farmers in our area of this 
program. 
I feel it is important to get this infor-
mation before my colleagues so they will 
not be misled by uninformed news media. 
The article follows: 
SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE SIGNED TJP 
FOR FEED GRAIN PLAN 
(By Donald H. Severin) 
A total of 633 farmers have signed up for 
the 1966 feed grain program. This com-
pares favorably with last year so far. The 
signup by township in past years got about 
half the signers and 2 or 3 weeks before the 
deadline another 600 or 700 sign .up. The 
signup period this year ends on April 1. 
Many farmers have mentioned they like 
the feed grain program this year because it 
is more flexible. It is designed so farmers 
can plant whole fields of corn or divert whole 
fields. Last year farmers had to plant all 
of the permitted corn acres or take a reduc-
tion in payment. This year farmers can sub-
stitute soybeans fcr corn on all of the per-
mitted corn acres. For example a farmer 
with a 100-acre corn base could divert 20 
acres and grow 80 acres of soybeans with no 
reduction in feed grain payments. 
This year farmers can divert from 20 to 
50 percent of the corn base. Since the pay-
ment for diverting more than 20 percent is 
high many farmers have diverted more than 
20 percent. For example, a farmer with a 
100-acre corn base might have a 25-acre field 
to divert. This extra 5 acres above the 
first 20 percent would earn about $60 per 
acre. Farmers wanting more details can talk 
to a township committeeman or call at the 
ASCS office. 
Farmers have signed up for a number of 
ACP practices they plan to start this spring 
including tile, terraces, ponds, and wind-
breaks. With the open winter, a number of 
farmers have already spread lime. For lime 
the payment is 50 percent of the cost or no 
more than $8 per acre. The field limed must 
be seeded down for two consecutive years. 
Several farmers have signed up for wind-
break practice around farm buildings. Prob-
ably due to the rather mild weather and 
little snow farmers haven't felt the need 
for a good windbreak around the farm. 
This practice has a good payment rate. The 
trees and shrubs must be ordered from a 
commercial nursery. 
Democracy: What It Means to Me 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOE SKUBITZ 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. SKUBITZ. Mr. Speaker, the voice 
of democracy contest sponsored by the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United 
States and its ladies' auxiliary is one of 
the finest programs offered the youth 
of this Nation. 
I am especially proud that the win-
ning speech from Kansas this year was 
delivered by one of my constitutents, 
Mr. Bill Ray Hutchison, of Chanute, 
Kans. 
Reading his oration reinforces my 
faith in the teenage generation of Amer-
ica. We often read the headlines about 
the young anti-Vietnam demonstrators 
whose militant individualism leads to a 
general rejection of traditional morality. 
However, I am convinced these are a 
small minority who blacken the name of 
the dedicated, hardworking, clear-
thinking majority. 
I suggest that anyone who has doubts 
as to the direction our younger gen-
eration is headed should read this young 
man's speech. Listen to what he says 
about democracy and what it means to 
him; see how he feels to be an American. 
It may not make the headlines, but 
you can be sure it is a much truer re-
flection of the pulse of young America 
than that you read in the morning paper. 
The speech follows: 
DEMOCRACY: WHAT IT MEANS TO ME 
(By Bill Ray Hutchison, Chanute, Kans.) 
A 17-year-old American girl brings honor 
to her country by her victories in Olympic 
swimming competition. An 18-year-old 
chemistry student gives the patent rights of 
his new process to the Government. An out-
standing high school leader inspires the Na-
tion by voicing his views of democracy. 
Freedom means a lot to these young people, 
and they dedicate their superior talents to 
make that freedom better because of their 
sacrifices. I feel that same desire to make 
America stronger, and I have a job to do in 
this democracy. 
I don't have a vote, so my part is to en-
courage others to vote, both by words and by 
action. I am willing to give rides or baby-
sit to allow others to vote. This is not being 
entirely selfless. After all, people are squan-
dering my freedom, too, when they "take 
the liberty," as it were, to stay home on elec-
tion day. I cannot live in my own one-man 
democracy, so I must encourage others to 
help preserve the freedom we live in. 
So even as a high school student. I have 
a place to fill in democracy to keep it alive 
and working. I am studying to gain an ap-
preciation for my heritage, to learn of the 
Government's institutions and methods, to 
gain an understanding of my duties and 
privileges as a, citizen, and to become a pro-
ductive member of our free society. In short, 
I am learning about the freedom I have. 
After all, I really don't have total freedom 
until I know all the things I am free to do. 
A football player who is not sure about all 
the rules severely limits his actions to avoid 
'breaking a role. And he can't contribute 
much to the game, just as I can't contribute 
much to our democracy if I don't know all of 
its rules. 
Book-learning, however, is not enough by 
itself. The nature of democracy calls for 
action. I belong to the school service club, 
which builds character and serves the com-
munity and Nation by its projects. I repre-
sent a class of students on the student coun-
cil, our own democratic system. In this 
position of trust, I work to change proce-
dures or policies when they are not in line 
with democratic principles or when the 
change would benefit the group, for we pro-
tect our democracy by using it fully. If we 
practice only following the directions of 
teachers and administrators, we cannot ex-
pect to step out into the world ready to live 
in a democratic community. 
If our generation is to keep America strong 
and free, we must be willing to participate 
in our Government. Of course, everyone 
can't be in public office, but we all play a 
part in Government. That's what makes 
this a democracy. Each of our representa-
tives in the governing body needs an indica-
tion of his area's thinking. Letters from 
electors do not give an accurate concensus, 
because most Americans of this era seldom 
write their leaders unless they have definite 
feelings against an issue. Lord Bryce, in 
his "American Commonwealth," said Amer-
icans were concerned when opposing a piece 
of legislation, but were, as he put it, "timid 
in advocacy as well as infantile in sugges-
tion." " 
What we need in more consciousness of 
' our freedom in our everyday lives. Democracy 
isn't limited to politics. Real freedom man-
ifests itself, in for example, staying within 
even the unreasonable speed limit, dropping 
papers n a trash can instead of on the street, 
and choosing to put savings in Government 
bonds instead of a bank account. Then 
democracy begins to mean more. We begin 
to thank God for our America and pray for 
guidance for its leaders. We might join the 
organization, people-to-people, to make an-
other friend for ourselves and our country 
through the mail. When the flag goes by in 
a parade, we will salute it and show every-
one we are proud of our country. There 
are many ways of practicing our freedom if 
we will become aware of them. 
Our America can become the country whose 
leaders know what the electors want, a coun-
try whose flag passes with the saluations of 
its proud and free people, a country whose 
citizens are vigorous in advocacy as well as 
aggressive in suggestion. Our generation 
will become the freest people in the world if 
we take another look at the freedom we 
ha

OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 1966 
Mr. MACHEN. Mr. Speaker, in a 
February 28 editorial the Baltimore Su* 
points out that President Johnson can 
help to keep the war in Vietnam in per-
spective by reiterating what he said dur-
ing a recent press conference that "now 
we will have a long and hard road," in 
Vietnam. 
The Sun editorial quotes the President 
to the effect that the war in Vietnam is 
not going to be easy or short; it is going 
to be difficult and it is going to require 
sacrifices. 
The Sun points out: 
A necessary part of this summing up is 
Mr. Johnson's emphasis on the point that 
the United States' objectives are limited?
to defeat the act of aggression against South 
Vietnam, to search for an honorable and just 
peace and to try to establish a stable, demo-
cratic government. 
In the conviction that others will find 
the Sun's lucid editorial a clarification of 
the issues facing us, I am offering it to 
the RECORD, where the article may be 
read in its entirety: 
LONG, HARD ROAD 
President Johnson can also help to keep 
the war in Vietnam in perspective, and he 
can expect firm and steady support from the 
American people, by reiterating what he said 
during his Saturday press conference: "Now 
we will have a long and hard road." 
As the President said further, it is not 
going to be easy or short; it is going to be 
difficult and it is going to require sacrifices.

Inequities of the Draft 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. F. BRADFORD MORSE 
MASSACHUSETTS 
EN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
growing concern in the country about the 
efficiency and adequacy of our present 
system of obtaining necessary military 
manpower. We have seen too many ex-
amples of inequities and inefficiencies; 
we have seen too many instances of poor 
planning and lack of priorities in our 
draft calls. 
Last week I was proud to join with a 
number of my Republican colleagues in 
pointing out some of the present short-
comings and in calling for a thorough 
congressional investigation of the Selec-
tive Service System. I am pleased that 
the House Armed Services Committee 
will give its attention to this subject 
within the near future. 
On Sunday, Martin F. Nolan, of the 
Boston Globe Washington bureau, sum-
marized the recent comments on the 
draft and discussed a number of pro-
posals that have been made for its im-
provement. 
Under unanimous consent, I include 
his article in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
following my remarks: 
NEw FACTOR IN VIETNAM DEEATE: INEQUITIES 
TIIli DRAFT 
(By Martin F. Nolan) 
WassuNcToN.--Shortly after Gen. Matthew 
IS. Ridgeway took command of U.S. troops in 
Korea in 1951, he said: "In my brief period 
of command duty here I have heard from 
several sources, chiefly from the members of 
combat units, the questions 'Why are we 
II ere?' are we fighting fort" 
"The answer to the first question," Ridge-
way said, "is conclusive because the loyalty we 
giVe, and expect, precludes any slightest 
questioning. 
"The second question is of much greater 
significance," he added. "The real issues are 
whether or not the power of Western civiliza-
tion, as God has permitted it to Rower in our 
own beloved lands, shall defy and defeat 
communism." 
in Vietnam and over here, the same ques-
tions are being asked today. 
'a seems unlikely that Gen. William C. 
Westmorela.nd, however much he would agree 
wien Ridgeway's first answer, would adopt 
the apocalyptic view of the second. 
A changing American attitude toward the 
infallibility of American foreign policy, new 
appraisals of the supposedly monolithic 
menace of conspiratorial communism?many 
factors have changed the Nation's attitude 
toward its goals of war. 
None, however, nas been as profound or as 
symptomatic as the changing American atti-
tude toward the military draft. 
Debate on the draft provides a curious 
counterpoint to debate on the war in Viet-
natn. Sometimes the discussions coincide, 
sometimes not. In either case, the draft 
remains a key political issue, at least in living 
rooms where teenage sons reside. 
Nffit week, 30 Republican Congressmen?
some liberal members of the Wednesday Club, 
some not so liberal?urged an investigation 
of the Nation's 25-year-old system of pro-
curing military manpower. In doing so, they 
enraged neither hawks nor doves. 
One of the least-noticed comments of Sen-
ator ROBERT F. KENNEDY in his celebrated 
February 19 statement on Vietnam was his 
reference to inequities in the draft. 
"The war perpetuates discrimination," 
KENNEDY said, "for the :poor and the less for-
tunate serve in Vietnam out of all proportion 
to their numbers in the United States as a 
whole." 
Negroes, who comprise about 10 percent of 
the Nation's ??opulation, provide 14 percent of 
the Army's total manpower, according to 
Pentagon statistics. But Negroes make up 
but 3.5 percent of the Army's officers. 
Self-evident flaws anti subtle ones, glaring 
Injustices and petty mistakes?Lt. Gen. Lewis 
B. Hershey dismisses them all with charac-
teristic bluntness: "Absolute equity has 
never been attained." The father of the 
draft, its custodian and most vigorous de-
fender, thus hurls an implicit challenge at 
his critics: to something better. 
One at them has. John U. Monro, dean of 
Harvard College, suggests a national lottery 
to choose draftees. Dean Monro sees I tick as 
a more suitable standard for his students 
than the present Selective Service plan of 
making the bottom half of freshman stu-
dents available for the draft. 
The lottery- has all the statistical logic of 
and automobile accident. But its prestigous 
sponsorship alone will bring discussion of 
the draft into clearer focus, as well as pro-
vide a clear-ever view of the war in Vietnam. 
A lottery does not ask the question: Which 
is more iimiortant, education or war? A 
lottery is indiscriminate, but so is the war. 
The Selective Service System, in Beer Rabbit 
fashion, has been hitting away at that tar 
baby mass of fluctuating needs, standards 
and deferments until it has become hope-
lessly entangled. The analogy of American 
involvement in Vietnam to the moral of this 
Uncle Remus tale is clear. 
General Hershey, who has not gone out of 
his way to please professors, may find his 
academie adnersaries more formidaWe now 
than every before. During the Koren war 
domestic hysteria made professors suspect; no 
billboards proclaimed then that; "College Is 
America's Best Friend." Now, they do and 
it is. 
The drafting of college students may have 
an ultimate knelt of curing this problem of 
civilian morale and fitting conscription?as 
well as its cause --into the philosophy (.4 mod-
ern Ameriea. Serious thought on the legal 
and moral aspects of the draft can do noth-
ing but good. 
The resources of Academe, never really used 
on behalf of selective service before, may 
help the draft law live up to its claim that 
"in a free society the Obligations and priv-
ileges of serving in the Armed Forces and 
the Reserve components thereof. should be 
shared generally:' 
Legal Help Is Poverty Item 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
PION. SAM GIBBONS 
CF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATI VES 
Moisday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, we con-
tinue to read and hear a ;?;reat deal about 
legal help for the Nation's poor. I 
noticed ah interesting story in the 
Escanaba Daily Press, Escanaba, Mich., 
of January 31 describing some action 
taken by the Community Action Com-
mittee of the Michigan State Bar Asso-
ciation to help provide such services. I 
commend it to my colleagues: 
41247 ? 
LEGAL HELP Is POVERTY ITEM 
When the community action committee 
of the Star bar met in Lansing recently to 
consider a pilot project for providing legal 
services to the rural indigent, six of the 
seven members of the committee were urban 
lawyers and Walter T. Hartland of Houghton 
was the sole attorney from a rural area. 
According to Hartland, the program would 
cover education on legal services to the rural 
indigent and provision for legal consultation 
and representation. 
To date, especially in the Houghton-
Barage-Keweenaw area, the means of provid-
ing legal services to the rural poor has not 
been developed past the level of largely 
gratuitous services by private attorneys act-
ing voluntarily through the Copper Country 
Bar Association. This results, Hartland said, 
in a sporadic contact between the poor and 
the lawyer which results in an insufficient 
use by the rural poor of the services of an 
attorney. 
An initial hypothesis of the project, is that 
such services can be provided best by pri-
vately practicing attorneys within the com-
munity. It is based upon such factors as 
the knowledge of such attorneys of the rural 
community, the position they hold in the 
community, their geographic availability to 
the rural resident and their ability to resolve 
problems of the rural poor within the rural 
community. 
It is expected that the Michigan Bar As-
sociation would propose that one attorney be 
assigned to the Upper Peninsula through 
UPCAP. His responsibility would be to co-
ordinate, educate, and develop the program 
through the six functioning community ac-
tion agencies. Each CAA would in turn re-
quest one legal social worker who would work 
in conjunction with the area representativ-es. 
Referrals would be made by the legal social 
worker to local attorneys who would be re-
imbursed for their services using the State 
bar minimum schedule and billing through 
UPCAP. 
Research and evaluation of means of pro-
viding timely representation in misdemeanor 
cases will be conducted and various methods 
attempted to provide representation. Also 
included in this study will be a bail project 
for the purpose of obtaining release on per-
sonal bond for indigent defendants. 
Six Hundred and Thirty-three Signed Up 
for Feed Grain Plan 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
(IF 
HON. JOHN R. HANSEN 
OF IOWA 
Monday, February 28, 1966 
Mr. HANSEN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, 
there has been a clamor in the eastern 
press recently about a lack of enthusiasm 
in the Midwest for the 1966 feed grain 
program. This misinterpretation of the 
situation in my area needs to be corrected 
so that it will not damage the excellent 
program passed by Congress last year. 
The tardiness of farmers to sign up for 
this year's program has nothing to do 
with a lack of support. A recent story 
in the Carroll Daily Times Herald by 
Donald H. Severin, manager of the Car-
roll County ASCS office, indicates that 
the number of farmers signing up for the 
1966 program compares quite favorably 
with the number signed up at this time 
In 1965.

peace, and to try to establish a stable, demo-
cratic government, This, as he said, will take 
time. 
If we look back for a moment, we can see 
that one of the worst errors in our policy in 
Vietnam has been the all too frequent out-
burst of easy optimism that has been shat-
tered by subsequent developments. State 
Department reporters can remember a brief-
ing, some 12 years ago, in which it was pre-
dicted that with increasing help from the 
United States the French soon would be able 
to put down the Vietminh. Not long there-
after the ,series of setbacks began which led 
to the defeat at Dienbienphu and the French 
withdrawal. 
In the years since, each measure of increas-
ing involvement by the United States has 
usually been accompanied by forecasts of 
early success. It is small wonder that our 
words have been questioned. Now, at last, 
our policy is beginning to show signs of for-
ward movement. The Senate debate has 
pointed up the inadequacy of quick or inex-
pensive solutions. Emphasis on our willing-
ness to follow a long, hard road is an essential 
step toward a settlement?so essential that it 
bears repeating many times. 
The Traditional American; Probate Judge 
Carl E. Wahlstrom of Worcester, 
Mass. 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HAROLD D. DONOHUE 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 1966 
Mr. DONOHUE. Mr. Speaker, on 
Sunday, February 27, last, with an ap-
propriate ceremony in the Beth Israel 
Synagogue Hall at Worcester, Mass., 
Worcester County Probate Court Judge 
Carl E. Wahlstrom, became the fourth 
recipient of the Beth Israel Brother-
hood's Good Neighbor Award for his 
"betterment of understanding among 
men of all faiths." 
Several hundred men and women from 
the city's major faiths gathered in the 
congregation's social hall to honor Judge 
Wahlstrom who was chosen for this par-
ticular distinction by a committee made 
up of the past recipients, A. Alfred Mar-
cello, day city editor of the Worcester 
Telegram, 1963; Very Rev. Armand H. 
Desautels, A.A., 1964, then president of 
Assumption College and now provincial 
superior of the Assumptionist Fathers in 
North America; and Rev. Kenneth E. 
Bath, minister of Greendale People's 
Community Church, 1965. 
A unique silver bowl signifying the 
Good Neighbor Award was presented to 
Judge Wahlstrom by Melvin Merten of 
the brotherhood. 
Multitudinous past distinctions have 
been bestowed upon Judge Wahlstrom in 
recognition of his most unselfish and 
effective civic leadership and only last 
November he was specially honored at a 
great public testimonial upon the com-
pletion of 25 years as probate judge in 
our area. 
He is a graduate of Worcester, Mass., 
Commerce High School; Clark University 
in Worcester; and Boston University Law 
School. Also, he is an acknowledged ex-
pert on Lincoln lore, a director of col-
leges, businesses and associations, and 
an honorary 33d degree Scottish Rite 
Mason. 
Mr. Speaker, it was my special pleasure 
and privilege to sum up the tributes to 
Judge Wahlstrom that were given by 
various city officials, educational direc-
tors, prominent judges, and spiritual 
leaders on this occasion. 
I emphasized that in the torturous 
pursuit of solutions for the tremendous 
problems plaguing ourselves and the 
world today it is imperative, if we are 
to be successful, for all of us to per-
severingly follow the inspiring example 
of the life and conduct of Judge Carl E. 
Wahlstrom so truly representative of the 
traditional American virtues upon which 
this country was founded and only upon 
which it can endure and will prevail. 
The text of my summation follows: 
SPEECH OF CONGRESSMAN HAROLD D. DONOHUE 
AT BETH ISRAEL ANNUAL GOOD NEIGHBOR 
AWARD TO JUDGE CARL WAHLSTROM, BETH 
ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE, FEBRUARY 27, 1966 
Rabbi Kazis, other members of the clergy, 
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen 
of Beth Israel Congregation, it is a par-
ticular pleasure for me to take part in this 
well-deserved public tribute to my dear 
friend and our good neighbor, Judge Carl 
E. Wahlstrom. 
On the basis of distinguished judicial 
stewardship alone, Judge Wahlstrom pre-
eminently merits the special honor you are 
conferring upon him this morning. 
In his court, the probate court, legal issues 
and disputes embrace the most intimate ac-
tions and vital interests of human beings 
at their best and at their worst. Their 
settlement demands the most searching 
analysis and the most equitable judgment. 
To successfully preside over and decide 
upon these most stirring judicial challenges 
very truly requires possession of the per-
sistence of Diogenes, the patience of Job, and 
the wisdom of Solomon; yes, requiring the 
exercise of the fullest understanding, the 
deepest compassion, the utmost tolerance, 
and the kindliest firmness. 
Judge Wahlstrom possesses these rare 
qualities and that is Why he is an excep-
tional judge. 
Judge Wahlstrom applies these attributes 
in all his actions and that is why he is an 
extraordinary person. 
Together with his acclaimed leadership in 
multitudinous community objectives, at 
great sacrifice, it is the practice of these com-
bined virtues in all his daily associations that 
makes Judge Wahlstrom our good neighbor. 
Perhaps not too many know that he was 
a student leader and outstanding athlete at 
Clark University in his college days and 
served his country as an infantry lieutenant 
in World War I. 
Judge Wahlstrom's career reveals a prime 
example of the full, wholesome, balanced 
life. 
Besides all this, he is an outstanding 
scholar and is recognized as one of the Na-
tion's authorities on the life and works of 
our revered 16th President of the United 
States, Abraham Lincoln. 
It is significantly indicative of the charac-
ter and disposition of our honored guest 
that he would be so vitally interested in the 
life of one of the greatest men of our history 
whose stalwart qualities and attributes are 
so well mirrored in his own personal and 
professional career. 
Judge Wahlstrom's distinction in connec-
tion with this great American patriot 
prompts the reflection that perhaps we might 
suitably and profitably dwell, this morning, 
on a comparison of the problems that con-
fronted President Lincoln and the country 
with the crucial challenges facing us in this 
nuclear age. 
Of course, our problems today are tech-
nically different and our challenges are now 
expanded beyond and above the horizon. 
But there is a similar height of urgency 
In our affairs today. We are at a similar 
crossroad of our destiny, a destiny involving 
the world's future. 
The various problems bedeviling us today 
comprise a lengthy and fulsome list. Their 
broad recitation would include such soul-
searching questions as: 
How shall we exercise our traditional right 
to differ while we carry out our patriotic 
obligation of unity in purpose? 
How can we effectuate the guarantees of 
Civil rights while we fulfill our duty of civil 
obedience? 
How shall we apply the restraint of 
recommended guidelines without suffocating 
the fruitful energy of personal effort and 
private enterprise? 
How shall we extend our spending while we 
contain inflation? 
How shall we share in the privations of 
our servicemen fighting overseas while we 
enjoy the extravagances of domestic plenty? 
And finally?How can we negotiate an end 
of agonizing war without yielding to dis-
honorable peace terms? 
These are a few of what we might term the 
umbrella challenges, 
It would take a hundred mornings and a 
hundred nights to itemize all the problems 
that would come under them. And although 
I receive in my daily mail about 50 earnest 
and thoughtful suggestions for their settle-
ment, I don't think anyone yet possesses the 
full answer to each different problem. 
It is my opinion the proper answers and 
full solutions will have to come out of a 
nationally unified character and-atmosphere 
of moral responsibility, patriotic sacrifice, 
and dedicated unselfishness that was urged 
by the voice, and personified in the life and 
death of Abraham Lincoln. 
In this country today we have the great 
wealth and the highest standard of living 
of any people in the history of the earth 
and there is even mare in sight on the nu-
clear energy horizon ahead. 
If Lincoln were alive we fear that he would 
have to question the existence of that moral 
character and atmosphere in our country to-
day. We fear Lincoln would join with many 
authorities today who express the deepest 
doubts that proper solutions to our problems 
will not be found until substantial turn-
about changes are made in a great many cur-
rent attitudes and practices that seem to be 
corrupting the core of our modern society. 
But, as we look about us today, I think 
you might agree there are far too many re-
gettable signs of widespread immorality 
in conduct, indifference to recognized ethical 
standards, defiance of legitimate authority, 
disrespect for hallowed traditions, disregard 
of our historical ideals, and even some 
thoughtless ridicule of the heroic sacrifices 
of our servicemen abroad. 
These unhappy signs of dangerous weak-
nesses in our prosperous society emphasize 
the wisdom of the warning advice contained 
In the question President Lincoln asked of 
the people during a speech in Illinois back 
in 1858. 
This was his question?"What constitutes 
the bulwark of our own liberty and inde-
pendence? It is not our frowning battle-
ments, our bristling sea coasts, our Army, 
and our Navy. These are not our reliance 
against tyranny. All of those may be turned 
against us without making us weaker for 
the struggle. Our reliance is in the love of 
liberty which God has planted in us. Our 
defense is in the spirit which prized liberty 
as the heritage of all men, in all lands every-
where. Destroy this spirit and you have 
planted the seeds of despotism at your own 
doors."

It would appear that this question by

anci finaily his father, in desperation, picked 
pp a map of 1.11e United States from a table 
beside his chair, tore it into many dozens of 
pieces, and said: "Here, son, take this and 
out the country back together again." 
'the boy happily went to work on the 
homemade jigsaw puzzle. His father again 
mottled back with the newspaper?but be-
fore he had read as far as the sports page 
the child tugged at his arm and proudly 
oointed to a perfectly put together United

Pleased arid Junazed by the lad's knowledge 
of geography and his speed in applying it, 
the father said: "That's really wonderful.

remeninered," the boy explained, "that 
on the back side of that map was a picture 
of a man. And I figured that if I just put 
man together right, the country would come 
'int in. pretty good shape." 
Don't you think it is about time for you 
and for me and for each American to start 
patting ourselves to right and the country 
back in good shape? 
Isn't it high time for us to get to work 
to restore proper reverence of our churches, 
decency in tannic conduct, ethical, standards 
in business, recognized discipline its educa-

acceptance of parental authority in the home 
and a mature, moral example for the proper 
encouragement of our youth? 
Aad while we proceed with the develop-
ment of a (treat Society let us wisely insure 
the construction of a, good society. 
Tnis. I think. was what President Lineoln 
was urging when, speaking in Milwaukee, on 
SepLember In, 1859, he said: "Let us hope 
USD I. by the best cultivation of the physical 
world beneath and. around us, and the best 
intellectual and moral world within us, we 
rmlsali secure an individual, social, and polit-
ical prosperity, and hapiness whose course 
shall be onward and upward and which, 
while the earth endures, shall not pass 
Above all, then, let us remember the true 
mission of all mankind is not for nations to 
war with each other unto death but to live 
with, each, other in a brotherhood of good 
will and under a peace of honor forever last-
ing. 
That, I believe, is the true significance 
and the true meaning of our meeting and 
ceremony here this morning in this hall, 
adjacent to your temple of prayer. 
That is the true worth of Carl Wahlstrom's 
contribution of virtues and talents as a good. 
man and a good neighbor. 
That, I think, is the true value of your 
exercise here this morning, in the encourage-
merit of fellow citizens to emulate the, 
example of a good neighbor, for the better-
ment of their community, for the progress 
of their country, and for the peace of the 
world. 
If then, we and our fellow Americans will 
unite in our faiths and, consolidate our moral 
spirits in patriotic sacrifice to preserve our 
liberty arid repel tyranny I am supremely 
confident we will not just survive?we will 
prevail. 
Statement on Electoral College 
-----
PIXTENSION OF REMA' ?ICS 
HON. BERT BANDSTRA 
OE IOWA 
IN THE ROUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 22, 1966 
Mr. BANDSTRA. Mr. Spealzer, today 
I testified on the subject of "Electoral 
College Reform" before the Su!,,commit-
tee on Constitutional Amendments of the 
Senate Committee on the judiciary. 
On twp occasions, first on February 1, 
1905, and again an January 20, 1966, 
President ,Johnson urged the Congress to 
approve a constitutional amendment 
abolishir g the electoral college. 
The draft of a proposed electoral re-
form amendment, which the President 
sent to the Congress last year, has been 
introduced in the Senate as Senate Joint 
Resolution 53 and in the House of Rep-
resentatives as House Joint Resolution 
278. 
The Senate subcommittee began hear-
ings a week ago but, as it happens, I was 
the first witness to testify in support of 
the basic approach to electrol college re-
form as incorporated in the President's 
proposal. 
In moat respects, I think this proposal 
is a sound a:nd kealistic one. However, 
as I pointed out in my prepared state-
ment to the Senate subcommittee, I feel 
that there is room for improvement. 
Since electoral college reforin should 
be a mat`,er ef great concern, n> it only to 
the Congress but to all Americans, I am 
including the text of my prepared state-
ment in the Rucosu: 
STATEIVIEN' ON ELECTORAL COLLEGE, BY BERT 
BASSI-1.9711A, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE F1I0M IOWA; 
STTEMIT7 ED MARCH 7, 1966, To SUBCOM-
MITTEE ON CONSTTTUTIONAL AIVLOSDMENTG, 
COMMITTEE ON THE .ItTGICIARY, U S. SENATE 
Mr. Chairman., members of the su.bcom. 
mittee, I am here today -to express my con-
viction that a constitutional amendment is 
urgently r.eeded to abolish the electoral col-
lege and to further modernize our presiden-
tial and vice-presidential election process. I 
am also appearing to place myself on record 
In support of the basic approach to electoral 
reform as Incorporated in Senate Joint Reso-
lution 58 and, at the same time. 1.0 suggest 
some possible improvements to this proposal, 
The electoral college, in my view, is a seri-
ous threat to orderly and democratic govern-
ment. This opinion is based in part on per-
sonal experience. Nearly 2 years ago, I 
served as a presidential elector for my home 
State of Iowa and, in that capacity, I had the 
snore or less anonymous distinction of being 
one of the 538 citizens who in 1964 actually 
cast ballots for the President and Vice Pres-
ident of the United States. Having partici-
pated myself in the workings of the electoral 
college, I can say with some authority that 
the institution is not only useless but dan-
gerous. I have also given some close study 
to the way in which the electoral college 
system has operated in the past, and this has 
further convinced me that our Constitution 
today contains serious defects which could 
at some future date turn a presidential elec-
tion into a national calamity. 
DIX March 7, 'I 9 6* 
Consequently, I am hopeful that this ses-
sion of the Congress will approve and send 
to the States for ratification a constitutional 
amendment to remove the long-existing 
flaws in our presidential and vice-presiden-
tial election process. My feeling is that such 
an amendment should be confined to making 
limited reforms, as is the case wit Ii Senate 
Joint Resolution 58, and that efforts to 
fundamentally alter the baste operation of 
our electoral system should, for the time 
being at least, be put to one side. An 
amendment aimed at limited reform would, 
I think, be most beneficial if it were drafted 
so as to (1) abolish the electoral college and 
automatically award a State's total electoral 
vote to the presidential and vice-presidential 
candidates who carry the State and (2) re-
duce to the very minimum the chances of a 
presidential election being thrown into the 
House of Representatives, as now provided by 
the Constitution, or into a joint i'ession of 
the Congress, as proposed by Senate Joint 
Resolution 58. 
The electoral college and 'the contingent 
election, as the provision for choosing the 
President in the House is often called, are 
'the two major defects in the Constitution as 
it relates to the selection of the Chief Execu-
tive. Both these flaws can be removed by an 
amendment which would in no way en-
danger our present two-party sysaem, and 
which would simply give the constitutional 
seal of approval to our presidential election 
process as it is expected to operate today. 
And I firmly believe a limited reform amend-
ment of this sort is critically needed in order 
to place our constitutional provisions for the 
presidential election on a secure and demo-
cratic footing. Accordingly, last year I in-
troduced such a proposed amendment, House 
Joint Resolution 327, in the House of Repre-
sentatives. Since then, in order to make two 
technical but necessary revisions, I have re-
introduced it in the form of House Joint 
Resolution 819. 
This proposal, in agreement with Senate 
Joint Resolution 58 would make no sweeping 
changes in our presidential election system. 
By contrast other approaches to the electoral 
college problem would make fundamental, 
and perhaps even revolutionary, changes in 
our existing election process. These alter-
native proposals, of which there are basically 
three, are all aimed at abolishing the gen-
eral ticket system, under which a State 
awards all its electoral votes to the presiden-
tial and vice-presidential candidates who 
carry the State. 
There is, to begin with, the proposal for 
the direct popular election of the President, 
thereby eliminating the electoral college, 
electoral votes, and States lines as voting 
factors. This plan has the merit of insur-
ing that the candidate with the most pop-
ular votes will automatically become Presi-
dent. It is, in fact, the only proposal that 
would do so. However, the blunt truth is 
that this proposal, whatever its virtues, has 
almost no chance of adoption. Electoral 
votes, as the Constitution has always pro-
vided, are awarded to States on the basis of 
their representation in both the House and 
the Senate. Thus, no matter how small 
a state's population, it is assured of at least 
three electoral votes. And it is hardly likely 
that the smaller States would ratify an 
amendment abolishing a voting system 
weighted in their favor. 
Secondly, there is the district system pro-
posal. Under this, the electoral college 
would be retained, but with the express re-
quirement that electors credited to a State 
on the basis of its representation in the 
House be elected from single-member dis-
tricts. Another two electors, like U.S. Sen-
ators, would be chosen in a statewide vote. 
One drawback to this proposal is that it 
would open the door to possible gerryman-
dering of electoral districts. It would also 
divide the Nation into 481 separate presi-

200 miles out from shore. Besides, it is not 
just coastal overfishing that threatens the 
sportsmen. The pelagic fish he most esteems 
are far-ranging wanderers, and it matters 
not a whit whether they are destroyed 5 miles 
out or 500. 
Since no practical means of controlling 
the long-liners has yet been devised, or even 
proposed, a few frustrated sport fishermen 
have been taking matters into their own 
hands. Long-line sets have been destroyed 
In the Atlantic. Off Adapulco, sport fisher-
men, persistently wreaking havoc on long-
lines off their coast, forced one Japanese ves-
sel to abandon the area as too expensive. 
U.S. sport-fishing boats sailing off the shores 
of Baja California play a game called "ocean 
skeet." They shatter the long-liners' glass 
buoys with shotguns. 
The damage inflicted by such means is, of 
course, a mere nuisance and will have little 
or no effect on tht enormous enterprise that 
long-lining has become. But when a Japa-
nese long-liner ran aground last September 
on the southernmost tip of Baja California 
gleeful Mexican fishermen indulged in soul-
satisfying fantasies to account for the wreck 
and take credit for it. 
The 350-ton vessel crashed onto a reef at 
about 2 a.m. The 18 men aboard all got 
ashore safely. Some commercial and sport 
fishermen went aboard and found the boat 
equipped with the very latest in navigational 
and fish-finding equipment, from radar to 
sonar. Stacked in her freezer locker below 
decks were an estimated 140 tons of tuna, 
40 tons of marlin and an unknown quantity 
of shark meat, in addition to dolphin, wahoo 
and sailfish. 
How to account for the wreck? The Mexi-
cans wink and tell any of a number of sto-
ries: 
1. Mexican fishermen turned off the light 
In the lighthouse. (Ah, but with all that 
electronic gear a modern vessel does not 
bother with lighthouses.) 
2. They turned off the light and set up 
another light atop a high cliff to lead the 
Japanese astray. (But the radar would have 
indicated the huge land mass?cliffs several 
hundred feet high on the beach?behind the 
Judas light.) 
3. Long-line sets are equipped with tran-
sistorized homing buoys that send out a 
signal to guide the fishing boat to where the 
sets have drifted. The Mexicans took one 
such buoy and put it on the beach. (This 
one is more ingenious than plausible. The 
Japanese navigational gear again would have 
foiled the plot.) 
What hope is there, since even the wishful 
cleverness of Mexican wreckers is no match 
for the vast Japanese fleet. One theory, not 
very attractive, is that overflshing will solve 
Itself. 
"In some ways long-lining may be con-
sidered self-limiting," says Frank J. Mather 
III, associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceano-
graphic Institution and himself a sport fish-
erman. "When the catch declines enough it 
becomes unprofitable. I think there is cause 
for concern but don't know what can be done. 
Agreement among all the nations involved 
would be very difficult." 
"We know the extest of long-lining," 
Mather says, "but we have no idea of the 
size of fish populations." Such knowledge 
would be essential to the establishment of 
meaningful international controls, but it 
simply is not there to be laid on the bar-
gaining table. 
There is unanimity among marine scien-
tists that research is a sine qua non of in-
ternational controls. 
"We are getting more and more letters 
from Congressmen inquiring about long-
lining," says Albert H. Swartz, assistant chief 
of the Division of Fishery Research of the 
U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. 
"Some people are advocating an extensive re-
search program. Others are talking about an 
international convention?but there are no 
facts to bring to it. A research program 
would take about 5 years before we could go 
to the Japanese regarding conservation 
measures." 
Swartz made a point that sport fishermen 
and their associations might consider. 
"Until now," he said, "international con-
ventions have always been on food fish. The 
sport fishery has never been represented. 
Now sport fishing should be represented. The 
International Game Fishing Association 
should have a voice." 
It should indeed. And so should Ml sport 
fishermen, organized or unorganized, who 
know the names and addresses of their Con-
gressmen, who, in turn, might well be per-
suaded to initiate preliminary negotiations 
with the Japanese while a crash research pro-
gram is underway. The extent of this crisis 
cannot wait for precise scientific determina-
tion. The commonsense evidence is plentiful 
now. At this juncture the need for con-
trols is clear. In the long run, controls need 
not deprive the Japanese of their protein 
supply. They could, in fact, preserve it. 
Edward W. Allen recently was chairman 
of an international meeting which sought, 
unsuccessfully, to institute new controls on 
fishing in the North Pacific. Though he 
spoke in another context, in a statement to 
the conference he may have suggested the 
theme for a preliminary meeting of world 
sport fishing associations and the leading 
fishing nations. He put it this way: 
"Ocean fisheries should not be deemed to 
exist merely for the benefit of [commercial] 
fishermen and cannery operators, but should 
be considered to be a great trust for the ben-
efit of humanity." 
Southeast Asia 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DONALD J. IRWIN 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 23, 1966 
Mr. IRWIN. Mr. Speaker, a day does 
not pass but that I receive mall from 
people in my district who are concerned 
about the war in Vietnam. By far, most 
of it expresses firm support for Presi-
dent Johnson and the policies the ad-
ministration are following in southeast 
Asia. 
A few days ago my mail included a 
letter from a close personal friend not 
in my district but in Thailand, where 
the Government is already faced with 
the all too familiar tactics of Commu-
nist aggression in its northern Prov-
inces. 
His letter, a portion of which I have 
, unanimous consent to include at this 
point in the RECORD, is illuminating. It 
is the result of careful observation and 
evaluation by a man who is living and 
working in southeast Asia. Along with 
his letter, he sent a copy of a letter writ-
ten to the editor of the Bangkok Post 
by a group of American scholars who are 
specialists in Asian affairs. It too is an 
illuminating commentary and I insert it, 
too, in the RECORD at this point. 
The letters follow: 
DEAR DON: It Was very good hearing from 
you. My faith in the American political 
process is always made stronger by the 
knowledge that such people as yourself are 
representing the American public. 
I like to think that in a private capacity, 
I am making a contribution to a better life 
for a small segment of Asia in a socially stable 
but progressive context. The work is reward-
ing?if exhausting?I travel a great deal, 
particularly to Laos. I am still the "last of 
the New Deal Democrats" domestically, Don, 
but I am perturbed that the liberal Democrat 
is becoming identified with the Lippman-
Morganthau-Fulbright position. I feel it is 
essential to pursue the objective of peaceful 
negotiations to the best of our ability. I also 
feel that the ultimate battle for Vietnam will 
be won by achieving a social revolution that 
entails such things as land reform, local 
democracy, community development pro-
graming, etc. 
At the same time, however, it seems to me 
absolutely essential to stand fast in military 
terms while pursuing the other objectives 
noted above. We must not allow the Com-
munists to feel that their "wars of libera-
tion" subversion and infiltration doctrines 
will prevail and represent the wave of the 
future. The Communist goals are outlined 
plainly and their objectives and methods are 
stated boldly. They believe their hegemony 
will hold sway over all Asia and by ideological 
imperative of their doctrine wars of aggres-
sion and infiltration are justified. We can-
not abandon Asia to such a doctrine either 
in our interests or in the interests of the free 
Asian nations. 
The domino theory has an element of 
truth. The pressures on Laos and conse-
quently on Thailand will be overpowering if 
the Vietcong and Hanoi and Peiping gain 
control over South Vietnam through their 
aggression. There is no doubt the subversion 
In northeast Thailand is directed by and sup-
ported by personnel trained in Commu-
nist-controlled areas outside of Thailand. 
This is clear and certain and if our resolve 
is weakened and our position compromised 
in Vietnam, such subversion and infiltration 
will be increased and the resolve of the Thais 
and others to combat such subversion will be 
weakened. 
I am enclosing a letter for the editor 
written to the Bangkok Post by eminent and 
respected scholars in the field of Asian 
studies. You may have already seen this 
letter. I know most of the signatories per-
sonally. They have all traveled widely in 
Asia and have an intimate knowledge of Asia, 
of Communist objectives, of the Vietnam sit-
uation. Their views are sound and well 
reasoned. I agree with their conclusions. If 
this statement has not already appeared in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD?it should. 
Please forgive me for rambling on. We who 
are working in the field are involved and 
committed to seeing a better world created in 
Asia. I hope it will be achieved. But it will 
not be easy. 
[From the Bangkok Post, Jan. 29, 19661 
U.S. GROTJP SUPPORTS VIETNAM WAR 
To the EDITOR: 
We, the undersigned, write as scholars and 
specialists most of whom have devoted much 
of their adult lives to study and work in 
south and east Asian affairs. Included in 
our number are most of this Nation's small 
nucleus of specialists on Vietnam. Many of 
us have lived in Vietnam itself. . 
We feel compelled to write in response to 
what we consider the distortions of fact and 
the emotional allegations of a small but 
viciferous group of fellow university teachers 
regarding the war in Vietnam. We must 
first observe that those who have signed ad-
vertisements and petitions represent a very 
small proportion of all university professors. 
Further the petition signers include dispro-
portionally fewer schools in the fields of gov-
ernment, international relations, and Asian 
studies. To our knowledge, no acknowledged 
expert on Vietnam itself has signed the ad-
vertisements appearing in the New York 
Times protesting U.S. policy in Vietnam. A

A1270 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-- APPENDIX March 7, 1966 
mere handful of scholars with Far East 
credentials identified themselves with these 
irotests. 
Quite apart from the merits of American 
policy?past or present?we believe the man-
ner in which the petition and many "teach-
ins" have been presented is a discredit to 
those who would call themselves scholars. 
The Vietnamese war and its related political 
context are enormously complex. Even the 
most qualified experts disagree on important 
facts or the meaning of those facts., It is no 
eurprise that they also disagree on alterna-
tive courses of action. 
It serves no useful purpose, therefore, to 
engage in name-calling, distortion, emotion-
alism and gross oversimplification. Many of 
our fellow scholars, no doubt eminently 
eualified in their own fields, arc in our view 
guilty of unacademic behaviour in their pro-
teats of Vietnam policy. 
Poe the record, therefore, we feel compelled 
to make the following assertions of fact: 
L The Vietcong initiated the present war 
in South Vietnam. They did so in gradual 
stages, beginning with assassination, terror, 
and bellicose propaganda. This was followed 
by sabotage, subversion, and small-scale 
guerrilla attacks; in later stages, large-scale 
Frontal assaults were employed. Only in the 
last stage did the U.S. Government feel com-
pelled to increase its military involvement 
substantially. 
'2. The Vietcong is a Communist-led and 
Communist-controlled political movement, 
Its aim is to establish, by any available 
means, a Communist rule in South Vietnam, 
3. It is false to compare the war :now being 
fought in Vietnam with that which was 
Fought by the French between 1946 and 1951. 
That was a colonial war, fought by Vietna-
mese of every variety of political complexions 
to achieve national independence. The Gov-
ernment of Vietnam since 1954 has been 
is truly Vietnamese national regime, end it is 
lighting now to maintain its independence.. 
That it is not without faults goes without 
saying. This, however, is not the issue. 
surety, it is of some significance that not 
one prominent nationalist of all the thou-
sands of such men in South Vietnam has 
defected to the Communist since 1954. 
4. The People's Revolutionary Party, which 
leads the Vietcong, is a segment of the Lao 
1)ong (Communist) Party of North. Vietnam. 
The Vietcong itself was organized by the 
North Vietnamese, armed by the North Viet-
namese, and trained by the North Vietnamese. 
'teils is not to deny the fact that many of its 
cadres were originally born in South Vietnam, 
and later trained or indoctrinated in the 
north. Nor is it to deny that thousands of 
zeroth Vietnamese were persuaded or forced; 
to join the Vietcong in the south. 
e. The Vietcong have employed methods 
of terror, torture, and outright murder that? 
nit a smaller scale, rival the atrocities of the 
Axis Powers in World War II. Thousands of 
innocent people (including women and chil-
dren.) have been deliberately slaughtered by 
the Vietcong as "examples" for the other 
South Vietnamese. Beheading and mutila-
tion are not uncommon. For American 
academies to bemoan the "brutality" of the 
South Vietnamese response; without the 
telt* test comment on the initiators of the 
brutality, is the epitome of bias. 
6. The Communist regime in North Viet-
nam is among the harshest and most brutal 
in Asia. All opposition has been exter-
minuted. The society is organized into cells 
of mutual surveillance. 
Cis, free elections of any kind have been. 
permitted. The living standards of the 
people are low even by Asian standards. 
7. In contrast, the people of South Viet-
nam, until the stepped-up Vietcong attack? 
were enjoying a far better living tetandard. 
Hunger was virtually eliminated. Industries 
were expanding. Schools, clinics, and 
sobial weleare services were proliferating 
rapidly. Between 1954 and 1961, there 
were four elections, conducted with varying 
degrees of freedom. 
8. The Ceneva accords were brc ken first 
and repeatedly by the Communists, as 
documented by the records of the Interna-
tional Controls Commission, 
9, The President has offered to imold un-
conditional peace talks with Hanoi and has 
been reject ed repeatedly by Hanoi, Peiping, 
and Moscow. The burden of prise C is now 
on the Coirununists. 
10. Cominunist conquest of South Vietnam 
would, in our view, lead inevitaely to a 
deterioration of resolve througho" it south 
and southeast Asia. While the non-Com-
munist states in the region are not 
likely to fall in actual geographical sequence 
(that is, tee "domino" theory), we believe 
these nations would eventually succumb 
politically and/or militarily to Chinese ex-
pansionism following an Americen with-
drawal from Vietnam. We further believe 
that Chinese hegemony over southeast Asia 
would be disastrous to American national 
interest and will severely compromise the 
capacity of Japan, the Philippines, India, 
and Pakistan to survive as independent 
nations. 
If there is any lesson that should have 
been, learned by us since 1919, it is that col-
lective secority is the only effective means 
to deal with totalitarianism on the march. 
Our negot; ations and agreements must not 
be "Munichs." Rather, they must be backed 
by clear evidence of our determination to 
maintain the arrangements agreed to as the 
conditions for peace. Men who prize 
liberty are unwilling to settle for peace at 
any price. Nor does negotiate ea from 
weakness ,ind without conditions serve to 
piacate imperial ambitions. The surest 
guarantee or peace in Asia is evii 'it; it has 
always been eeerywhere; recognithin by all 
that our commitments to our allies will be 
honored. And we shall use the peace thus 
secured as .Americans used it in postwar 
Europe, end as President Johr son has 
pledged to use it for Asia. The beefs for a 
lasting, settlement in Asia will be built as 
we create the conditions for freedom 
through social and economic programs no 
less than through military means.

LAWS RELATIVE TO THE PRINTING OF 
DOCUMENTS 
Either House may order the printing of a 
document not already provided for by law, 
but only when the same shall be accompa-
nied by an estimate from the Public Printer 
as to the probable cost thereof. Any execu-
tive department, bureau, board or independ-
ent office of the Government submitting re-
ports or documents in response to inquiries 
from Congress shall submit therewith an 
estimate of the probable cost of printing the 
usual number. Nothing in this section re-
lating to estimates shall apply to reports or 
documents not exceeding 50 pages (U.S. 
Code, title 44, sec. 140, p. 1938). 
Resolutions for printing extra copies, when 
presented to either House, shall be referred 
immediately to the Committee on House 
Administration of the House of Representa-
tives or the Committee on Rules and Admin-
istration of the Senate, who, in making their 
report, shall give the probable cost of the 
proposed printing upon the estimate of the 
Public Printer, and no extra copies shall be 
printed before such committee has reported 
(U.S. Code, title 44, sec. 133, p. 1937). 
PRINTING OF CONGRESSIONAL LECORD 
EXTRACTS 
It shall be lawful for the Public Printer 
to print and deliver upon the order of any 
Senator, Representative, or Delegate, extracts 
from the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, the person 
ordering the same paying the cost thereof 
(U.S. Code, title 44, sec. 185, p. 1942). 
CHANGE OF RESIDENCE 
Senators, Representatives, and Delegates 
who have changed their residences will please 
give information thereof to the Government 
Printing Office, that their addresses may be 
correctly given in the RECORD. 
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS FOR SALE 
Additional copies of Government publica-
tions are offered for sale to the public by the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 20402, at 
cost thereof as determined by the Public 
Printer plus 50 percent; Provided, That a dis-
count of not to exceed 25 percent may be al-
lowed to authorized bookdealers and quantity 
purchasers, but such printing shall not inter-
fere with the prompt execution of work for 
the Government. The Superintendent of 
Documents shall prescribe the terms and 
conditions under which he may authorize 
the resale of Government publications by 
bookderilers, and he may designate any Gov-
ernment officer his agent for the sale of Gov-
ernment publications under such regulations 
as shall be agreed upon by the Superintend-
ent of Documents and the head of the re-
spective department or establishment of the 
Government (U.S. Code, title 44, eec. 72a, 
Supp. 2). 
RECORD OFFICE AT THE CAPITOL 
An office for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,
