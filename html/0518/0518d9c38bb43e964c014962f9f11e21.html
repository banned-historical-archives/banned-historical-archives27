 dissatisfaction with existing conditions--had been persuaded to perform
 minor acts of espionage and then,haa been blackmailed or terrorized into
 continued cooperation.
 Apparently many others were genuinely won over by the Communist in-
 doctrination program, which the 00 carried out on an individual bas-Ls
 during the preliminary stage (when prospective members were being assessed
 by the 00) and which continued during a probationary period when the new
 members took part in an 00 cell.  From the date of his acceptance as a
 probationary member the new adherent was expected to perform'  he duties
 of a regular Party member:   attend 00 cell meetings, study Party publica-
 tions, pay Party (00) dues, and report to the 00 any information about
 his military unit which would be of interest.
 Intelligence targets included all statistical data--names, functions,
 and locations--of all military, police, and gendarmerie units, lists of
 ammunition and arms, any confidential instructions issued, any trips or
 missions of the American military advisers, etc.  Information procured
 from the security services report edl  was that affecting Tudeh Party (or
 00) security; i.e., instructions orcorrespondence concerning pending
 arrests or surveillances, statements made by arrested Tudeh Party members,
 By August 1954, the 00 had in its posse  ion detailed informatLQ.n
 about the strength and' disposition of every Army, gendarmerie, police,
 and Air Force un?  in Iran.  The 00 allegedly knew the location and de-
 scription of eve                           piece of military equipment supplied by the United
 States.  It canbe assumed that all information of possible interest to
 the Soviets was passed to them.  Allegedly there was evidence of a link
 between the 00 and a Soviet intelligence legal resident agent in Iran.
 Formation of the 00 is stated to have begun about 1941, shortly after
 the.Allied occupation.  The 00 grew most rapidly under tenure of govern-.
 ments most lenient toward the Tudeh Party, with the greatest expansion
 occurring under Mossadeq in 1953.  To date little has been uncovered about
 its past achievements, but it is known that the 00 dispatched several
 members to Azerbaijan in 1945 to participate in the revolt there.  :"Ln
 1950 the 00 assisted in the escape of ten high-ranking members of the
 Tudeh Party, most of whom had been imprisoned since the attempt on the
 life of the Shah in early 1949; the escape operation was undertaken to
 strengthen the Tudeh Party Central Committee.  Some 00 members in the Air
 Force had set fire to several planes of the Iranian Air Force in Septem-
 ber 1953, reportedly to build up morale of Tudeh members and to show
 Mossadeq supporters what the Tudeh was capable of accomplishing.  The 00
 had also given refuge to at least one prominent political offender.

 I.  INTRODUCTION:              SUMMARY OF DATA AVAILABLE
 Disclosure of an extensive Tudeh Party (Communist) network in Iranian
 security services came about through the arrest on August 16, 1954 of a
 Tudeh Party member who had been under surveillance by Iranian authorities.
 Through admissions made by the arrested Communist and through documents
 which were discovered in his possession, an Officers' Organization (00) of
 the Tudeh Party was uncovered and more than 450 additional arrests made
 possible.  Subsequent arrests--made possible by the first one--and raids
 on 00 installations also were productive in uncovering Iranian police,
 Army, gendarmerie, and Air Force officers who performed responsible roles
 in the Tudeh Officers' Organization.  Among strategic posts occupied by
 Tudeh- activists were:  the commandant of the Prime Minister's personal
 bodyguard, the security officer responsible for clearing names of pro-
 spective appointees for Iranian and United States military', authorities,
 and the Iranian Army's chief counter-intelligence officer in the Abadan
 oil area.
 Although to date there appear to have been no officers involved who
 were higher than the rank of colonel, it is obvious that the Tudeh 00 had
 at its command persons of sufficient influence to assist 00 members in
 obtaining promotions and positions of trust.  The 00, if undiscovered,
 reportedly would have been capable, upon signal, of effecting simultaneous
 assassinations of the Shah, Prime Minister, most-Cabinet members, key
 members of the Senate and Majlis, most Governors General, and key military
 The two main purposes of the 00 seem to have been:   (a) to acquire
 intelligence information of value to the 00 itself and to an undetermined
 Soviet intelligence service, and (b) to expand to the point where success-
 ful penetration had been achieved in every unit of the military and police
 forces for espionage, sabotage, or any other activity deemed necessary by
 the 00 or the Tudeh Party.   Continuous activity was carried on by the 00
 to attract new members, and 00 adherents were required to submit reports
 concerning persons they believed were prospective recruits.
 Reportedly some members of the 00 had joined it believing at first
 it was an independent, reformist group; subsequently learning that it was
 Tudeh-dominated, they are stated to have found themselves so deeply in-
 volved in Communist activity that fear of blackmail or other forms of
 pressure caused them to continue to cooperate.  Low morale and pessimism
 allegedly caused by dissatisfaction with conditions in the Iranian Army
 and in the other military services led several of these officers to be-
 lieve they had nothing to lose and possibly something to gain by throwing
 in their lot with the Communists.  Others--also reportedly due to

 The headquarters organization of the 00 was patterned after that of
 a national Communist Party.  It included a Central Committee (Committee
 of the 00), which theoretically held supreme authority in the 00 and was
 composed of 00 representatives from the entire country; an Executive Com-
 mittee (the 00 Executive Board or 'Board of Secretaries); and a, Politburo
 (in the 00, the Three-Man Board), -which provided'daily direction over
 administrative and operational activities.  Thus,. the 00 of the Tudeh
 Party, like its parent organization and like every other typical national
 .Communist Party, was based on the principle of democratic centralism--an
 00 executive body, once elected, had unquestioned authority and, theoret-
 ically at least, exercised collective leadership.  Each member of the
 Executive Board not only headed one of the 00's five principal functional
 sections--information, propaganda, training, finance, and organization--
 but also assisted with the direction of one or more of the others.
 From mid-July 195+ to the time of the arrests, the Three-Man Board
 had the primary responsibility for directing 00 activities.  It was com-
 posed of three members of the Board of Secretaries, who provided funds
 and equipment for 00 operations, determined the means of communication,
 and presented reports and resolutions to the broader directing organ of
 the 00, the Board of Secretaries or the Executive Board.  Approval of the
 Three-Man Board was necessary before contact could be made between military
 and nonmilitary Tudeh Party members and before 00 members could travel
 abroad.  It maintained an office which operated daily.  Presumably the
 Three-Man Board had been set up because security considerations made
 smaller, less conspicuous meetings necessary.
 The Board of Secretaries (or Executive Board) met once a week and
 was responsible as a whole for organization, training, information, prop
 aganda, and finance activities.  Each one of its members headed a section
 which carried out one of these activities and in addition was responsible
 for certain organizational units--such as 00 cells in the police, gen-
 darmerie, Air Force, etc.   The Board of Secretaries reportedly was elected
 at a "general meeting of the Organization from among members of the Com-
 mittee of the Organization."  The Board of Secretaries maintained contact
 with the Tudeh Party Central Committee through a liaison officer who met
 with the Board at every other meeting.
 The Committee of the Organization was made up of Branch Eesponsibles
 of the seven Tehran branches (police, gendarmerie, medical, Air Force,
 and three Army branches--Line officers, infantry, and Army school), plus
 four provincial representatives.  Each Committee member or Branch Respon-
 sible was in turn responsible for a cell of Cell Responsibles; the latter
 were each responsible for a varying number of cells.   It is not certain
 that the last Organization Committee elected had ever actually met and
 functioned as a group, probably because of security considerations.

 sir
 A large part of the income for 00 activities apparently came from
 membership dues.  Members- who received higher salaries and who had
 fewer expenses paid more than others.  Contributions were sometimes made
 for imprisoned Tudeh Party members or their families.  Allegedly, addi
 tional sums were acquired for 00 purposes by embezzlement carried out by
 Tudeh Party civilian members employed in certain government-operated
 firms.  There are a few indications that funds for 00 use were supplied
 by foreign sources.
 A mixed staff of Tudeh civilian and military personnel was set up
 following the overthrow of the Mossadeq government on August 19, 1953 to
 carry out sabotage operations and military training.  For a while a
 program was in effect whereby certain 00 members were responsible for
 giving paramilitary instruction to groups of civilian members of the
 Tudeh Party.   The Party allegedly decided to discontinue this activity
 a few weeks after the program had been in force; there is some evidence,
 however, that the training of nonmilitary personnel was discontinued for
 a time, then resumed.

 II.  STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF HEADQUARTERS ELEMENTS OF .
 As stated previously, after mid-July 1954 primary responsibility for
 everyday direction of 00 affairs apparently rested with the Three-Man
 Board, which consisted of three members of the Executive Board.  Respon-
 sibilities of the Three-Man Board included (a) providing for the procure-
 ment and financing of safehouses and other secret installations, including
 office space and equipment, (b) presenting, reports to the Board of Sec-
 retaries (Heyateh Dabiran), (c) determining communication methods and
 channels, (d) approving any contacts made between civilian members of the
 Tudeh Party and members of the 00, (e) approving (or disapproving) plans
 of 00 members to travel abroad, (f) approving expenses which were within
 nominal sum, and (g) appointing and dispatching inspectors to the
 provinces.  The Three-Man Board was an executive unit which carried out,)
 ecisions of the Board of Secretaries (or Executive Board).  The emphasis
 of its work appears to have been concerned with finances, organization,
 and intelligence questions.'
 1.                         Board of-Secretaries (or Executive Board).  Membership of this body
 was from five to seven members, with each member responsible for either
 organization, finances, propaganda, training, or information activities.
 It appears that the Board of Secretaries actually served as a supreme
 governing body or staff of the 00 until. July 1954) with theThree-Man
 Board having that role subsequent to that date. Reportedly the Board of
 Secretaries had liaison with the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party
 through one member of the latter who served as a "Political Responsible"
 of the 00 and briefed the Board of Secretaries on current developments
 and problems of the Tudeh Party.
 2.  Organization Section.  Three members of the Board of Secretaries
 served as functionaries of the Organization Section.  This appears to
 have been true in the case of each of the other functional sections.  As
 in any other Communist Party organization, the Org Secretary kept the
 statutes, membership lists, etc.  One 00 official served as overall chief
 of the section, while a second functionary of the Organization Section
 was concerned with security matters and'documents and the third with
 training and provincial affairs.  For several weeks prior to the arrest
 of the officers, all reports directed to the Chief of the Information
 Section were routed first through the Chief of the Organization Section,
 allegedly to permit him to excerpt any information of organizational
 interest.  More likely, however, this routing system was arranged to
 permit the Org Secretary and his assistants to see information pertaining
 to security and counter-intelligence matters and to take essential pre-
 cautionary measures.

 3.  Finance Section.  A gendarmerie colonel who had been affiliated with
 the 00 since 1945 or 1946, and who was also a member of the Three-Man
 Board, served as Chief of the Finance Section.  Allegedly one finance
 officer of the 00 deposited approximately 200,000 vials monthly in a
 Tehran Bank for the 000  Apparently none of the arrested officers admitted
 that the 00 received foreign financial aid; however, the fact that the 00
 owned several new automobiles and rented a number of expensive safehouses
 would indicate that foreign aid was furnished.  It seems doubtful that the
 00 could have afforded these luxuries in addition to its regular monthly
 expenses, such as aiding families of deserted Army officers, prisoners'
 families, and so on.  (See paragraph 17 for further information about 00
 finances.)
 4.   Training Section.  Specific details of the supervision over the train-
 ing program which was provided by this section are currently not known.
 Apparently it was ideological training rather than paramilitary training
 over which it had jurisdiction.  Presumably arrangements for Tudeh Party
 civilian instructors to lecture for 00 cells were made by this section,
 working through the liaison with the Tudeh Party Central Committee.
 5.  Information Section.   It is known that this section, through 00 mem-
 bers in the various units of the military and security services, had ac-
 cess to all intelligence information of significance in Iran.   The of-
 ficers who were mainly responsible for the functioning of this section
 apparently escaped arrest and thus details of the operations of this sec-
 tion at the directing level are not known.  It seems possible that many
 of the 00 members may have been contributing information which was largely
 of interest to the Tudeh Party's (and 00's) propaganda activities and that
 only certain strategically-placed 00 members procured information which
 actually constituted intelligence information.  Certain of the latter
 persons appear to have been drawn into nets or apparats which worked
 directly for a Soviet intelligence service.
 6.  Propaganda Section.  One 00 officer, assisted by two other members of
 the Board of Secretaries, reportedly was responsible for the propaganda
 program of the 00.  They prepared articles for Tudeh Party tracts and
 apparently for a time prior to the arrests of August 195k,published a bul-
 letin for exclusive 00 consumption.  Reportedly the Tudeh Party took care
 of the technical details--printing, supply of newsprint, etc.--for all the
 publications.
 7.  The "Staff".  Following the overthrow of Mossadeq on August 19, 1953
 and for an undetermined period of time, the Central Committee of the Tudeh
 Party set up a joint military-civilian "Staff" for carrying out operations
 such as sabotage, military training, and other activities the ultimate

 purpose of which was the overthrow of the government.  Only two members
 of the 00 apparently served on the "Staff," although the entire program
 providing for paramilitary training of civilians may have been supervised
 by an 00 member, an infantry officer who is reported to have been in
 charge of the details of the training and of arrangements for the con-
 tact between the instructors and the trainees (nonmilitary Tudeh Party
 members), a function he accomplished with the assistance of the Provin-
 cial Committee.
 The "Staff" arranged for the training of civilian Tudeh Farty mem-
 bers in 20-man groups by approximately 20 officers of the 00.   The in-
 struction provided for training in the use of rifles, pistols, and hand
 grenades, and in street-fighting techniques, mountaineering, tracking,
 defense against knife attack, recognition of landmarks, estimation of
 distances, etc.  The "Staff" examined the possibility of starting guer-
 rilla warfare in certain forested areas of Iran, but ruled out this
 action as impractical.  Reportedly it was as a result of a "Staff" de-
 cision that several Iranian Air Force planes were destroyed in. 1953
 8.   The Committee of the 00'.  As previously stated, the Branch. Responsi-
 bles of the seven branches of Tehran, plus four representatives from the
 provinces, formed the Committee of the 000   In those provinces where the
 00 had cells of Cell ~2espon'sibles, representatives were elected for the
 Cotmittee; in provinces where there were no cells of Cell Responsibles
 due to the limited number of-members , then the remaining representatives
 were appointed b  the Board of Secretaries to make the Committee's total
 pp         y
 ?uip eleven -seven from Tehran and four from the provinces.   Can-
 didates for membership in the 00 Committee had to be approved by the
 Central Committee of the Tudeh Party.   The Committee's principal function
 was to.examine reports prepared by the five functional sections of the
 00 (organization, propaganda, training, finance, and information). The
 reports were discussed first by the Executive Board and then were pre-
 sented to the eleven-man committee, which studied and criticized them
 and presented new projects to be carried out by the Executive Board.
 Theoretically, the Committee of the 00 had the right to change or to re-
 elect any member of the Board of Secretaries.
 9.  Branches of the 00:  General,  As stated previously, the seven
 branches in Tehran were:  one branch of gendarmerie officers, one branch
 of police officers, one in the medical corps, one in the Air Force and
 three Army branches--line officers, infantry, and Army school.   A'group.
 of 00 functionaries responsible for provincial affairs supposedly con-
 stituted another branch.                                 In general, the cells and branches were to
 work toward the 00's two main objectives:   (a)   expansion, for the
 ultimate purpose of.waginga successful revolution; (b) collecting in-
 formation of value to the 00's propaganda program and for its military

 goals.  Courier service between the individual branches and headquarters
 units was generally carried out by 00 officers not belonging to the branch
 for which they performed this function.
 The seven branches in Tehran each had a cell of Cell Responsibles,
 with one, two, or three cells subject to each of them.  Each cell con-
 sisted of three to six members.  When the number of members in a cell
 (presumably an ordinary or base cell) exceeded four or five members,
 then the cell was divided into sub-cells.
 Each cell elected a representative, who, with other representatives,
 met and formed a cell of Cell Responsibles; cells usually had a second
 Responsible who was to take over in the absence or transfer of the Cell
 Responsible.  The Cell Responsibles also elected their Responsible, who
 was called the Branch Responsible.   The Cell of Responsibles also had a
 second (or Deputy) Branch Responsible.  The Branch Responsibles were
 proposed by the Executive Board to the Cell of Responsibles, but the
 latter were reportedly free to elect the candidate named by the Board or
 to elect another person to the post.
 10.  Strength in the Provinces.  Much effort was reportedly made to have
 more 00 members located in those provinces where the Tudeh Party was
 strongest.   It was sometimes a problem to locate officers in areas where
 the 00 wanted them because transfers were dependent on Army personnel
 action.  Therefore, although it was desirable to locate] them where the
 Party was strongestit did not always work out that way.  When members
 found themselves in areas not considered important by the 00, the latter
 ordered them to apply for transfers to provinces in which the 00 was
 interested,  Members were instructed to follow up their transfer actions
 seriously, and wherever possible the 00 itself took steps through the
 local personnel section of a military unit to secure an individual's
 transfer.
 11.  Recruitment.  For 2 years prior to the arrests of August 1954 the
 procedure for joining the Tudeh Officers' Organizationhad been the same
 as that for joining the Tudeh Party.  A somewhat formal introduction
 procedure was followed whereby members presented to the Board of Sec-
 retaries (after July 1954, the Three-Man Board) a report providing a
 description of the character of the prospective recruit.   The latter was
 first accepted as a sympathizer; during this period he was in touch only
 with the person sponsoring him and he independently studied literature
 containing disguised Communist propaganda.
 The 00 member contacting the new sympathizer did not explain that
 he was a member of the Organization.  When the 00 member was convinced
 of the sympathizer's "integrity" he-could send in another report to 00
 8t

 s
 headquarters and, if-approved, the sympathizer would become a probationary
 member and would be assigned a probationary member's number--a three-digit
 number.  He remained a probationary member for 6 months or longer, de-
 pending on whether he was judged ready to accept 00 responsibilities and
 obligations and on the amount of confidence the Party had in him.  When
 he became a full member he was assigned.a four-digit number which was
 the sum of the number 1,111 and the probationary number.
 The sympathizer paid no membership fees, but if willing made con-
 tributions, nominally for the relief of poor families who were connected
 with the Party.  Once accepted as a probationary member, he had to attend
 cell meetings, pay membership fees, observe the discipline of the Organi-
 zation, carry out the prescribed "self-improvement" activities, take part
 in the political training program of the cell, acquire information per-
 taining to his military unit, and submit reports.   In general, the re-
 ports to be contributed by the trainees were of the same nature as those
 submitted by official members of the 00.   The trainees, like official
 members, were obligated to report everything they observed in their places
 of duty.
 12.  Ideological Training.  Until 1951 a candidate for the 00 was asked
 to study the Constitution and Regulations of the Tudeh Party before being
 accepted as a trainee, but from that date on this step was eliminated.
 Probably the change in procedure was due to two factors:  (1)  to ensure
 better security for the 00 by not disclosing it as a Communist organiza-
 tion until the new member had reached a more advanced stage of develop-
 ment, and (2) to avoid alarming or discouraging the sympathizer by re-
 vealing the entire subversive and revolutionary aims of the organization
 before he was completely convinced of the Communist cause.
 Among the books used by the 00 to win and sustain the loyalty of
 sympathizers and trainees reportedly were the following:   The Economic
 Life of Man, Know the Society, Economics, etc.  Books relating the events
 of the Chinese Communist revolution were apparently rather commonly dis-
 tributed among new sympathizers; among these were reportedly The New
 Democracy, by Mao Tse-tung, and From Semi-Colony to Popular Democracy.
 Continuous and consistent efforts were made to cultivate the loyalty
 of members of the 00 throughout their association with the movement.
 Although the training program of the 00 appears to have come largely
 under the administration of one member of the Board of Secretaries (or
 Executive Board), the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party also took,a
 direct interest in the ideological training of 00 adherents.  A short
 time before the arrests of August 1954, the Central Committee had ap-
 pointed civilian instructors or speakers who attended meetings of the

 Cell Responsibles of the 00 and provided party and political training.
 "Technical lessons" given during these occasions also included discussions
 on current international political affairs.,
 13a  00 Espionage.  Efforts were made by the 00 to procure all information
 which could aid its ultimate objegtive--to overthrow the monarchical form
 of government in Iran and establish a People's Democracy.  As stated,, the
 intelligence procurement efforts of individual members of the 00 were re-
 lated to the particular post and unit in which they were located.  Because
 of the thorough penetration achieved by the 00, with members in every
 branch of Iranian military and security services, the intelligence coverage
 was extremely thorough.
 Reportedly in 00 possession at the time of the arrests in August 1954
 were order-of-battle reports, officer-of-the-guard rosters, Army ordnance
 figures, statistical. reports concerning Iranian artillery units stationed
 on the northern frontier, etc.
 The 00 is stated also to have had information about anti-government,
 pro-Mossadeq groups being formed among Army personnel and to have achieved
 a partially successful penetration of the National Resistance Movement
 (NRM), a loose collection of political elements opposed to the present
 regime.
 Specific targets about which 00 members had apparently been directed
 to report were-  (a) speeches made by commanding officers, (b) missions
 .or trips made by American military advisers, and (c) confidential circulars
 or reports distributed by Iranian, military and security services.
 From its adherents among the police force, the 00 wanted information
 about confidential circulars or correspondence concerning arrests or sur-
 veillances.  From information of this nature, the 00 knew what security
 precautions it had to take.
 it may be recalled here that The Report of the Royal Commission concern-
 ing Soviet and Communist Party espionage activities in Canada in the
 early 1940's showed certain prominent members of the Labour-Progressive
 Party of Canada (Communist) attending secret party cell (study group)
 meetings as observers and instructors.  In some instances they are known
 to have used such occasions to do "talent spotting" (for espionage:) or
 to collect information from individuals attending the cell meetings.

 14. Information for Propaganda Use.  Some of the information collected
 by 00 members was to be used for agitation-propaganda work.   :_ncluded in
 this category were reports about embezzlements, bribery, or other indi-
 dents of corruption in the Iranian services which were related in Party
 bulletins.   Information of this nature was routed to the Propaganda
 Section of.the 00, where the three responsible functionaries prepared
 articles for Party and/or 00 tracts,
 15.  Evidence of Soviet Intelligence Connection with 00 Activities,
 Allegedly some of the arrested officers admitted that the 00 worked for
 the Soviets and that its principal. activity for them was the procurement
 of intelligence information.  It is reasonable to assume therefore that
 all information of possible interest to the Soviets was passed to them.
 As previously stated, there reportedly was some evidence of a link be-
 tween the 00 and a Soviet intelligence legal resident agent in Iran.
 16.   Communication Channels of the 00.  The 00 appeared to have relied
 j            almost exclusively on couriers for the transmittal of 00 communications.
 A serious defect appears to have been its tendency to rely on too few 00
 r~ctionaries for this work.    Consequently, when one 00 courier was ar-
 reSted, a large portion of,the organization was likely to be exposed,
 For instance, following the arrests of August 1954, it was found that one
 police officer had served as a communications link with a contact of 00
 headquarters for five branches of the 00.  Not only did he serve as a
 courier for secret 00 correspondence, but for a short time before his ar-
 rest he had served also to 'distribute publications to 00 personnel.  It
 is of interest that he did not serve as a courier for the branch of which
 he was a member.
 In the routing of reports from branches.and cells to any 00 head-
 quarters unit, somewhat disguised designations had been developed to
 indicate the specific addressee.  For instance, envelopes going to the
 Organization Section were marked "'shapely," those going to the Propaganda
 Section were designated "eloquent," etc.  For an undetermined period of
 time before the arrests there had been, it appears, an increasingly
 greater tendency to use oral rather than written communications.
 Concerning communications with the provinces, it has been reported
 that these were maintained either by correspondence (presumably via secret
 mail drops) or through members traveling between Tehran and the provinces.
 In certain provinces where the Responsible was in contact with a nonmili-
 tary Party member (such contacts were established in the provinces by
 permission of the Party), the ordinary Party channels were also used for
 communication between the 00 in Tehran and the 00 in the prov'nce.  The 00
 functionary (in Tehran) in charge of the provincial branches transmitted
 the letters and/or publications to the Tudeh Party in Tehran; they were
 Approved For Release : C-00915R000400030005-9
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400030005-9,.
 then sent by the Party to the provinces through Tudeh Party channels.  The
 material was then passed to the person in charge of the 00 in that province
 through the local committee of the Tudeh Party.
 Methods of transmitting information procured by the 00 to a Soviet
 intelligence service have not been clarified.  There are indications that
 direct communication channels may have been functioning in Tehran between
 Tudeh Party intelligence components and an undetermined Soviet intelligence
 service. It has also been reported that the 00 had placed a number of men
 in a special unit authorized to cross the Soviet border to deal with such
 incidents as strayed flocks and illegal entrants.  These men reportedly
 formed one channel through which military information was passed to Soviet
 intelligence.
 Liaison between the Tudeh Party and the 00 was conducted on the high-
 est echelon by a member of the Central Committee of the Party; at least
 two civilians--both businessmen--carried out liaison on lower levels.
 17.   Finances.  Reports concerning the monthly income of the 00 have varied
 considerably:  one statement quoted the figure at 6,000 to 7,000 tomans
 monthly (750 to 875 American dollars); another report gave the figure as
 3,000 to 4,000 tomans monthly (between $375 and $500); it is not possible
 to know which of these figures is correct.  Many of the 00 expenses seem
 to have been met by income which was derived from membership dues and
 contributions.  Money collected for newspapers, books, and other publica-
 tions was an additional source of income.                      Allegedly the dues varied
 according to the income and obligations of the members--those who received
 higher salaries and who had comparatively few expenses paid more than
 others.
 Money (membership dues, contributions, payments for party literature)
 was collected by the Branch Responsibles and forwarded to the Chief of
 the Finance Section.  Expenses and payments due were discussed in advance
 by the Board of.Secretaries, and the Finance Officer was authorized to
 make payments as these were approved by the Board.  At the end of each
 month a financial statement was submitted to the Board of Secretaries.
 Funds collected were deposited in a Tehran bank in the name of one of the
 00 members.
 Receipts were issued to 00 members for payment of dues.  These were
 issued in denominations of 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-rial notes which
 were 3 x 2 centimeters in size (sometimes smaller) and of violet color.

 Among expenditures of the 00 the following would appear to have.been
 outstanding: (a)  rental of an undetermined number of safehouses, (b) pur-
 chase and operating expenses of several automobiles, (c) contributions to
 political prisoners and their families, (d) contributions to families of
 deserted officers, (e) payment for "technical lessons," which apparently
 referred to training in political indoctrination given for 00 cells by
 civilian Tudeh Party functionartles.n
 18.  00 Personnel and Security Practices.  For each member of the 00 a
 record was maintained showing his post and rating in the Organization, and
 commendations and demerits which he had received.  This allegedly was kept
 in a code devised on a mathematical system.  Commendation was expressed by
 the cell, the cell of Cell Responsibles, the Board of Secretaries, and by
 the Central Committee of theTudeh Party.   The highest form of commendation
 was a statement signed by the Secretary-General of the Tudeh Party and
 bearing the seal of the Central Committee.
 As a reward for good work, members were sometimes promoted to higher
 rank..  00 posts were ordinarily filled by persons voted into office at
 the time of the general elections (held once every 2 years), but if any
 member showed outstanding performance and devotion to duty, one or two
 newly created cells would be placed under his command.
 Reportedly the 00 had seldom found it necessary to punish its members
 for work poorly done.  When, however, a member failed to perforn his duties
 or showed indifference in establishing contact, he was expelled from the
 Organization.   This was not done abruptly and the member was not told.
 Gradually the contact with him was broken and eventually he found himself
 out of the organization.
 Because the 00 was opposed to foreign travel expected to last more
 than 6 months, its members were obliged to inform it and to have its con-
 sent before going abroad either for continuing their education or for any
 other purpose.   In spite of this ruling, however, certain 00 officers
 apparently did go abroad without 00 consent.
 To prevent hostile penetration the 00 gave studied attention to candi-
 dates who were presented for membership in the 00, and serious effort was
 made to provide for their thorough indoctrination during the early years
 of their association with the 00.  Throughout their association with the
 00, members are apparently subjected to systematic and continuing political
 indoctrination to ensure their absolute loyalty and guarantee t:aeir will-
 ingness to engage in illegal activities.  Meetings appear to be restricted
 to gatherings of three or four members at a time, with these ta::iing place
 in members'-homes.  Meetings between two 00 members (couriers) for the
 purpose of transmitting reports from one to the other apparently occur on
 busy streets.
