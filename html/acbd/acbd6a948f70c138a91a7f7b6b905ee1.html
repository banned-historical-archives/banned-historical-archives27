 DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
 ESPIONAGE LAWS, TITLE 18, USC, SECS:  793 AND 794, THE
 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN
 UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
 1.   Pravda criticizes Soviet industrial management:   A Moscow
 broadcas   of 27 May, commenting on the results o  production
 plans for the first quarter of 1952,  quoted Pravda as criti-
 cizing malpractices in certain basic industries,                            Pravda was
 described as having condemned the continuation of bureaucratic
 procedures, and as having emphasized the need for increased
 technology and more efficient utilization of existing labor and
 machinery in production,   (R FBIS,  28 May 52)
 Comment:   This criticism of Soviet management in industry
 implies t at the policy of increasing production through greater
 exploitation of existing facilities and the raising of techno-
 logical levels, which has been in existence since 1950, will
 continue. This policy might well form one of the basic features
 of the second postwar Five Year Plan, which has not yet been
 publicly announced.
 2.           Yugoslavia announces meeting of Albanian refugees in Priz-
 ren:                          According to a Be gra a announcement, t fie association o
 political emigrants from Albania,  the Yugoslav-sponsored Prizren
 Committee, was to hold its second session in Prizren on May 31.
 It was stated that participants at the conference would repre-
 sent 4,500 Albanians who have fled from Albania since the Com-
 inform Resolution in 19480   (R FBIS Ticker, Belgrade, 29 May
 52)
 Comment:   The Prizren Committee was formed in May 1951.
 It is an organization devoted to tine ends of Yugoslavia in
 Albania, carrying out subversive missions in Albania and
 attempting to harness the activities and resources of the Alban-

 ian community in Yugoslavia.
 A meeting of the Albanian emigre organization at this
 time assumes significance against the background of rumors
 concerning the impending conclusion of a Greek-Yugoslav deal
 over Albania and deteriorating Yugoslav-Italian relations.
 The meeting may shed light upon reported Yugoslav contacts
 with various Albanian political groups in the West and the
 Levant.

 3.           Trieste firm offers ship to Albania:
 25X1C               a Trieste import-export    rni offered to sell
 Albania a thousand-ton steamship for approximately $1,451,000
 and some 3- and 4-cylinder vessels at $11,400 and $14,000 re-
 spectively.   (S Trieste Joint Weeka 22, 29 May 52)
 Comment:   If the sale of the steamship is consummated,
 the shi-will increase the carrying capacity of the Albanian
 merchant marine by some 50 percent,   At present the Albanian.
 fleet consists of ten ships of less than 500 tons.
 4,          Bulgarian Premier affirms subordination of Fatherland
 Front to Communist Party:   In a speec  opening 'the Third  on-
 gress of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, Premier Vulko Cherven-
 kov stated that it is no longer necessary for the Fatherland
 Front to have its own program.   "Although this was necessary
 in 1942 and 1944 and at the time of the Second Congress in
 1948, now, when all these programs have been realized,  there
 is no necessity for a separate program established for the
 Fatherland Front."   (R FBIS, 29 May 52)
 Comment:   The formal acceptance by the Fatherland Front
 of the program of the Communist Party will represent the final
 step in the degeneration of the Fatherland Front into a mass
 political organization dominated by the Communist Party of
 Bulgaria,   The top positions in the Front, have been held by
 leading members of the Communist Party since 19470
 5.          Czech Deputy Premier stripped of offices:   Dr.  Jan Sevcik,
 Czech Deputy Premier since 1949, has been removed from his post
 and from his position as head of the Office of Physical Culture
 and Sports.   On 29 May,  Radio Prague announced that he was dis-
 missed as chairman of the Slovak Regeneration Party for "con-
 tinued violation of the policy of the National Front of Czechs
 -and Slovaks."   The secretary general of the Regeneration Party

 was also dismissed on the same grounds.   They were replaced-
 respectively by Jozef Kysely9 Slovak Commissioner of Health,
 and Jozef Gajdosik9  finance officer of the Zilina National
 Committee in Slovakia.         (R FBIS9 Czech Home Service, 29 May;
 U Washington Post9 30 May 52)
 Comment:   A relative nonentity in the Czech government,
 Sevci   iapparently outlived his usefulness to the Communist
 regime.   Since the Communist coup he has served as a figurehead
 of non-Communist participation in the "National Front" govern-
 ment of Czechs and Slovaks.
 During his tenure,  the government destroyed all possibili-
 ties of an autonomous Slovak policy, and his removal occurs
 at a time when the government has begun to emphasize the Na-
 tional Front more than at any time since the coup.   It may be
 that he has been sacrificed to a shift of government policy in
 the direction of increased Slovak integration with the Czech
 lands of Bohemia and Moravia.
 6.          Czechs purge "hostile elements" in state farms and machine
 tractor stations:   A purge  01  Ub  directors   rom Czec  state
 arms and machine tractor stations occurred on 28 May.        All
 replacements appointed by Minister of Agriculture Josef Nepo-
 mucky have been chosen from among the worker and small and
 medium farmer classes.   (C Prague 825, 29 May 52)
 Comment:   Directors of the machine tractor stations and
 the former   ulaks who act as agricultural experts on the state
 farms have borne the brunt of official displeasure over non-
 fulfillment,of the agricultural plan.   In the past several
 months, emphasis has been placed on ridding the agricultural
 sector of the responsible "hostile elements" in an effort to
 increase production,
 On 27 May the government established a Ministry of Agri-
 cultural Supplies for the bulk buying of all types of agricul-
 tural products "in order to safeguard the population's food
 supply and widen the raw materials base of industry."  Thus,
 it appears that Czechoslovakia is increasing its efforts to
 fulfill the stepped-up delivery quotas set for 1952 and possibly
 to stockpile agricultural products.

 7.         Czechoslovakia establishes maritime shipping agency:
 Cecho rac t, a new Czech agency  or international  ocean shipping,
 began operations on 1 April.   It took over from Metrans,  the
 Czech international forwarding agency, all duties relating to
 Czech merchant vessels:           chartering, maintenance, arranging
 for cargo space, and representation of foreign shipping and
 transportation companies in Czechoslovakia.   (U Prague Desp
 360, 7 May 52)
 Comment:   Czech merchant shipping is principally engaged
 in trade wlth China,  India and the Near East,   Czechoslovakia
 relies heavily upon Polish shipping facilities, but in recent
 months its chartering activities have increased and efforts
 have been made to purchase merchant ships.   The organization
 appears to be a replica of the Polish agency Polfrachto
 8,          Authority of Hungarian State Control Center extended:   The
 Hungarian Nationa  Assembly on 28 May adopted a law extending
 the authority of the State Control Center over economic life.
 The US Legation in Budapest observes that the new measure
 followed a press report of the imprisonment of four officials
 for intentionally producing bad bricks, and lends credence to
 rumors that many factory managers have been arrested and that
 investigators from the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance
 had criticized Hungary for falsification of plan fulfillment
 statistics.   (R Budapest 889, 30 May 52)
 Comment:   The new law places authority for overcoming
 economic-defects, which have been publicized since March,  in
 the hands of an independent state agency which reports to the
 Peoples Economic Council headed by party leader Gero.   The
 State Control Center chief,  Istvan Sebes,  told parliament that
 the measure would enable Hungary,  following Soviet methods,  to
 expose and punish breaches of the law and to enable the masses
 to participate in the process.
 The US Legation previously stated that it was unable to
 verify the arrival of a CEMA investigating mission in Hungary.
 There appears to be no example of such an inquiry in any other
 Satellite country.

 communal elections in Zone A of Trieste.   The Vidali party's
 strength in the city proper was reduced from 35,548 (21 per-
 cent of the total vote)  to 30,976  (17 percent),   Under the
 Italian electoral system,  the Cominformist minority representa-
 tion in the Trieste Communal Council was reduced from 13 to
 6.   In outlying areas the party lost control in two communes,
 retaining power only in the Communist stronghold of Muggia,
 Cominform losses:in the hinterland were generally absorbed by
 the anti-Communist and pro-Tito Slovene lists,   (S Trieste
 Joint Weeka 22, 29 May 52)
 Comment:   The policy of the pro-Titoites to exploit Vidali's
 uncertain stand on independence, and the reported schism in party
 ranks provoked by the fear of a shift in party line, vitiated
 the Cominformist electoral appeal in the predominantly Slovene
 countryside and among those Triestines opposing Italian rule.
 All other issues were subordinate to that of Italian claims to
 the area, and the Vidali group's failure or inability to take
 a strong stand against the return of the Free Territory to
 Italy cost it considerable strength among partisans of both
 camps.
 10.         Sixth Yugoslav Party Congress to emphasize role of the
 party in evolving state policy:   American officials in Belgrade
 report that t e Sixt  Party -Co-        scheduled for October 1952
 in Zagreb will be utilized by Tito to establish and spread the
 new party line.   Emphasis will probably fall upon measures being
 taken to encourage party members to assume greater responsibility
 and initiative as political agitators in the various economic or-
 ganizations.   It will also be necessary to clarify the Marxist
 principles underlying local governmental reforms and their ex-
 tension to the higher levels of government.   (S Belgrade Joint
 Weeka 22, 29 May 52)
 Comment:   Yugoslav party leaders will undoubtedly use the
 congress to propagandize the Yugoslav evolution towards the real-
 ization of true Marxism, characterized by decentralization of
 power to the producers.   As a consequence of growing Italo-Yugo-
 slav hostility and continued pressure from the east, a strong
 nationalistic theme will probably also be evident.

 Chances of Rhee-Assembly reconciliation reported nil:
 American Marge    g  nerd after a conversation with members of
 the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of
 Korea, reports that pursuit of a tentative UNCURK plan to in-
 vite President Rhee and key members of the opposition to a
 joint conference would now be useless.  The President would
 not be deterred from his present course by normal diplomatic
 approaches, while the Assembly would accept no compromise
 which included Rhee in the government.  (S Pusan 1216,
 31 May 52)
 Comment:  Protests to Rhee by the UN Command, UNCURK and
 EmbassysyoTTIcials have been countered with references to a
 Communist-financed plot among the opposition Assemblymen.
 A number of pro-Rhee Assemblymen reportedly have become,
 alienated by his tactics during the past week.
 13.         Chinese radio notes hypothesis of Sino-Soviet split:  A
 Chinese Communist s at on broadcast tees die Ho Chi Minh govern-
 ment on 22 Maythe text of a book review appearing in a pro-
 Government Paris journal.   The book argues that a "realistic
 attitude" in the West would permit Asian Communism "to affirm
 itself in a national way and escape the hold of the USSR."
 The broadcast also repeated the author's speculation that

 Sino-Soviet border areas, might eventually "relax the bonds
 which tie her to the Soviets."   (R FBIS,28 May 52)
 Comment:   In the past, the Chinese Communists have taken
 note of such Western speculations only in order to deny and
 deride them.
 In this case, Peiping may be inviting Ho's attention to
 a line which might be profitably exploited by Ho's regime
 or by any other Asian "liberation" movement which wished to
 conceal its true affiliations
 This broadcast is also of interest, however, in connec-
 tion with a recent broadcast from Radio Free Japan, apparently
 located in North China, which named the Chinese Communists and
 Mao Tse-tung, rather than the USSR and Stalin, as leading in
 Asia's "liberation."
 Chinese-Communists allegedly expect world war to begin
 by 1954:      document  allegedly circulated by Chinese Communist
 age is in Japan concludes that a third world war is "inevitable."
 The document states that the United States will be armed, and
 Japan rearmed, by mid-1954, at which time the USSR will be
 capable of atomic attacks upon the American mainland.
 The document goes on to state that the construction of
 American air bases surrounding Russia and China will be com-
 pleted by March 1953, at which time the plan calls for atomic
 attacks upon the USSR,   (S FEAF INTSUM No.  703, Tokyo F-6,
 30 May 52)
 Comment:   It is true that Peiping is committed to the
 view t azat a "final conflict" between the Communist and non-
 Communist worlds is inevitable.   However, several of the
 reports attributing to Peiping an expectation of global hos-
 tilities at some definite date have already been  disproved t
 events.
 This particular document does not appear genuine.
 Specifically, it seems discredited by its assertion that Ameri-
 can flans call for an attack on the USSR more than a year
 before the United States and Japan are to be properly armed.

 produced 1.8 million bales of cotton  am and 27 million
 bolts of cotton cloth in 1951.                                       ~_,_...
 Comment:  A Communist plan to triple the number of
 spind es in China's textile mills was reported in 1949, but
 the expansion program was not started until 1951.   In late
 1951 Peiping announced that the government had begun to build
 new textile mills "on a scale unknown in the history of the
 industry in China."
 This is the first report from a Communist source giving
 1951 textile production in absolute figures.   These figures
 are substantially less than China's highest output in the
 past, which, the Communist press has claimed, was exceeded in
 both 1950 and 1951.
 Peiping's military budget reported:   The Chinese Commu-
 nists have planned mi itary expenditures of about 2.6 billion
 dollars in 1952,
 About 1.5 billion dollars has been allocated for
 current expenses of the army, navy, and air force.   Some
 840 million dollars will be spent for "national defense
 construction," that is, for the training and equipping of
 military units and buildup of defense industries.
 Comment:  These budget estimates for 1952 total about
 twice   eip ng's peacetime military expenditures.
 China's heavy military expenditures have brought tax
 increases and large "voluntary" levies on businessmen, farmers,
 and workers.   There is no evidence, however,  that popular
 dissatisfaction with the new financial burdens constitutes a
 serious menace to Communist authority.

 a possible successor to Muntasser.   Both Kekhia and Sagizii,

 18,            Soviet Union apparently not yet ready to blockade Berlin:
 The Be         em@en~t. of the High C6im ssionerr  of  ice 3e1
 that the Soviet Union and East Germany are veering away from
 the menacing position taken only a few days ago and suggests
 that the Soviet measures in Berlin.are directed more at isolating
 East Germany and intensifying control there than at the immediate
 strangulation of the city,
 This may indicate that the Soviet Union, which will continue
 to have the power to cut Berlin?s communications with the West,
 is not yet prepared to resort to this drastic measure, but will
 use various other means to try to block ratification of the
 contractual agreement and EDC treaty.   (S Berlin 1434, 31 May 52)
 19.         Possible relocation of Soviet ground force headquarters in
 East Germany,                                                                  25X1

 from the Berlin suburb of Potsdam-Babelsberg to the Zossen?
 Wuensdorf area 25.miles south of Berlin.
 Residents of Potsdam believe that one of the vacated instal-
 lations there is to be occupied by East German Peo le's Police.
 25X1A
 Comment,  .Neither the number of headquarters elements in-
 volved nor the permanence,of the move is established at this time.
 Renovation of the former German High Command installations in
 the Zossen=Wuensdorf area started in August 1950 under GOFG
 supervision and                                       stationed there      25X1
 for over a year       e:Barracks, which are es        mated to have a
 capacity of..35,000 to 40,000 troops, were recently only partially
 occupied.
 The move of GOFG headquarters, if confirmed, would follow
 a recently observed pattern of Soviet Army relocations in East
 Germany, which apparently are designed to take advantage of
 improved facilities and to provide greater security from
 observation.   It would also serve to enhance the prestige of
 the East German Government in Berlin by making it appear more
 independent.

 quarters in Eastern Germany, and, inasmuch as almost all of the

 20.             Council of Europe rejects plan for actual political
 federat ono   T e  onsultative  seem ly o   the Council of Europe
 at its       nal meeting on 30 May rejected a last-minute proposal by
 Belgium's Henri Spaak which would have authorized the Schuman
 Plan and European Defense Community countries to draw up im-
 mediately a draft constitution for the political fderation of
 Western Europe.    The Assembly did, however, approve
 Eden's proposal for coordinating the activities of the EDC, the
 Schuman Plan, and the Council of Europe.
 The American Consulate in Strasbourg comments that the
 advocates of political federation have little chance of over-
 coming British and Scandinavian opposition, and that the Eden
 proposal was approved, despite its vagueness, because of the over-
 whelming desire of the Assembly to retain British association
 with the Council of Europe.   (C Strasbourg 173, 1 Jun 52)
 Comment.   Eden's proposal has had the effect of offsetting
 disappo ntment over Britain's opposition to an earlier draft
 constitution for the political federation of Western Europe.   The
 Assembly's approval of the British plan represents a victory for
 the "functionalists" who believe that cooperation among sovereign
 nations enactual
 wouldfunctions

 Labor opposition to Pinay government develops.  The chiefs
 of the two  eading nn- ommunist labor confederations in France
 have indicated dissatisfaction over the results of a recent hour-
 long interview with Premier Pinay and his Labor Minister, during
 which the Premier was urged to use more forceful measures to
 lower prices.  The unions oppose Pinay's rather conservative
 revision of the escalator wage bill, which is nevertheless
 expected to pass over tough opposition.   (C Paris 7490, 31 May 52)
 Comment.  Non-Communist labor may renounce its wait-and-see
 policy toward Pinay?s reduction program if the Premier wins the
 vote of confidence scheduled for 3 June on the wage bill.   French
 unions are demanding wage increases to compensate for price rises
 to Pinay?s premiership; but there is little likelihood of im-
 mediate widespread strike activity, particularly since Communist
 labor?s current support of the party's political agitation has
 further alienated free labor.
 De Gasperi may seek Monarchist support to avoid losing
 nationa  elect ons.  on t e bas s ?~f results fream the latest
 .cal elect ons, the US Embassy in Rome estimates that "the
 slightest unfavorable shift in sentiment between now and 1953
 might put the democratic parties in the minority."  To avoid
 this, Premier de Gasperi may "make a serious try at a balancing
 trick with the Monarchists," although this would cost him the
 support of the nationally more numerous Democratic Socialists.
 The Premier is expected to revise the electoral law to
 favor the center, and to seek elimination of the neo-fascists
 from political competition by outlawing them or controlling
 their activities through the enforcement of existing laws.
 Another possible course would be for De Gasperi to invite
 the Nenni Socialists into the government and take a chance that
 they could be brought to support NATO,   (C Rome 5228, 29 May 52)
 Comment.   Because the elections show that the Christian
 Democrats Have lost their popular mandate, De Gasperi faces
 the choice of broadening his government, either to the right
 or to the left,   The electoral results suggest that further
 alienation by the De Gasperi government of the left-center in
 favor of the conservative right would accelerate the present
 trend toward extremes and jeopardize Italian cooperation with
 American policies.
 There is no indication that Nenni?s recent expressions
 of strong opposition to "Atlantic clericalism" is connected in

 25.             Swiss Communist Party calls for strong, centralized party

 action.   The manifesto, which represents a further departure
 from former party chief Leon Nicole?s concept of a mass party,
 calls for a strong centralized party cadre,   The party will
 emphasize the formation of factory cells, which will become the
 basic unit for party activity.   (R Bern Joint Weeka 22, 29 May 52)
 Comment,  This directive is a further indication that Leon
 Nicole-is unlikely to regain control of the Swiss Communist Party.
 During the past two or three years all European Communist
 parties have intensified their efforts to strengthen Communist
 factory cells,

 That it will not issue the necessary visas for the formation in
 Copenhagen of a permanent headquarters for a committee to promote
 the expansion of East-West trade.   This committee is presumably
 a result of the Moscow Economic Conference,   The Soviet Legation
 had indirectly approached the Danish Government to sanction the
 establishment of such an organization.   (C Copenhagen 916,
 29 May 52)
 Comment,   The meeting of the initiating committee for the
 Moscow            Conference was held in Copenhagen in October
 2-
 1951, at which time the Danish Government expressed disapproval
 of the meeting, but took no measures to prevent delegates from
 attending.
 A Permanent Committee for the Promotion of International
 Trade was set up at the Moscow Economic Conference where Berlin
 was selected as the site for the permanent secretariat.   This
 is the first indication that any alteration in these plans has
 been considered.

 By-the National      lectoral Jury on 1 June of his election to the
 presidency of Panama, told Ambassador Wiley that he was confident
 the country would become tranquil "when the public became aware
 that order was being maintained."  Political polemics and agi-
 tation have very noticeably abated.
 According to Ambassador Wiley, no disorders are foreseen,
 at least until after the inauguration.  Both the government and
 the opposition, however, agree that the first four months after
 the inauguration will be "difficult and decisive."   (U Panama
 Country 994, 1 Jun 52; C Panama City 995, 1 Jun 52)
 Comment:  Remon is so confident that he is even considering
 a trip a road in the interim before his inauguration on 1 October.
 As long as he retains the support of the National Police it is
 very unlikely that his position can be effectively challenged.
 Much will depend, however, on the still undetermined strength of
 the opposition in the newly.-elected National Assembly, on the

 1.         American Charge comments on South Korean "Communist"
 plot:   In analyzing the possibility of a Communist-financed
 plot among the South Korean National Assembly opposition,
 Charge Lightner comments that involvement of a large number
 of Assemblymen in a plot is "fantastic."  He points out that
 it is a common practice in all South Korean political circles
 to supplement meager official salaries by questionable means.
 While it is possible that Japanese Communist money has been
 smuggled into Pusan, the recipients would have obtained'the
 money through middlemen and not necessarily be aware of the
 source,   (S S/S Pusan 1202, 30 May 52)
 Comment:   Rhee has in the past employed the charge of
 communism to rid himself effectively of his political oppo-
 sition.                              Proof so far in the current imbroglio has not been
 forthcoming.
 2.         Burmese Defense Minister predicts early end of insur-
 gency:   The Burmese Defense Minister has informed the
 mer can Army Attache in Rangoon that organized insurgency
 in Burma would be "dissolved" by the end of this year and
 mopping up actions would be complete before 1954.  He es-
 timated that there were now no more than 5500 armed Commu-
 nists and Karens -- th4 two most important insurgent forces.
 (C MA Rangoon 64, 31 May 52)
 Comment:   The Defense Minister's estimate parallels
 optimis iii-c.statements recently issued by other Burmese of-
 ficials.   These statements, however, overlook the insur-
 gents' continued ability to mount successful attacks against
 important towns and lines of communications and-the possi-
 bility of Chinese assistance to indigenous Communists.

 3.         Transfer of Israeli Foreign Office may harm US-Arab
 relations.  Ass star   ecretary o   fate  yroa a reports
 a  American and other diplomats in the Arab countries,
 particularly Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, are concerned over
 the projected move of the Israeli Foreign Office from Tel
 Aviv to Jerusalem.   He states that if the United States
 accepts the Israeli action without a protest, the Arab
 States will interpret this as another example of American
 acquiescence in an Israeli fait accompli.
 Byroade suggests that the United States might take
 the position that it cannot participate in the move until
 the issue of internationalization of Jerusalem has been
 solved by the United Nations.   (S S/S Athens 5134, 31 May
 52)
 Comment.   The UN resolution for the internationalization
 of Jerusa em has never been implemented.   Israel controls
 the New City and Jordan the Old City.  Most of the Israeli
 government offices have already been moved from Tel Aviv.
 The projected transfer of the Foreign Office to Jerusalem
 will immediately force all countries represented in Israel
 to decide whether to move their diplomatic missions to the
 New City or openly oppose the Israeli action by remaining in
 Tel Aviv.
 4.          Israeli Prime Minister shows ignorance of Arab refugee

 problem, according to Director of the United Nations Relief
 and Works Agency Blandford.   Ben-Gurion stated that all
 refugees were living comfortably in first class camps, andthat
 their problem was solving itself because they were being
 absorbed into the economy of the Arab countries

 Blandford points out, however, that only one third of
 the refugees are living in camps and at least half a million
 must be moved to other countries before resettlement can be
 effected.   (C S/S Beirut 1323, 28 May 52)
 Comment:   It seems improbable that the Israeli Prime
 Minister  s actually ignorant of the true nature of the Arab
 refugee situation, because the Israeli intelligence service
 is a competent one and the refugee problem is one of the
 important issues preventing an Israeli-Arab peace agreement.
 In past discussions with foreign representatives, Israeli
 officials have minimized the seriousness of the refugee
 problem, claiming that the plight of the, refugees was the
 responsibility of the Arab countries, not of Israel.
 According to latest. figures, there are more than
 850,000 Arab refugees in the countries bordering on Israel.
