 Prime Minister Bakhtiar has had little success in
 securing moderate opposition support for his new govern225X1

 More demonstrations denouncing Bakhtiar took place in  25X1

 opposition leaders are willing to risk a military coup

 Bakhtiar's cabinet consists mostly of senior civil
 servants and respected professional men.   One second-
 echelon opposition figure who Bakhtiar had hoped would
 join the cabinet told US officials that he was totally
 opposed to the new government, which he characterized as
 too little, too late.   The source reiterated that the
 Shah must leave the c                                      will

 Bakhtiar persuaded retired General Jam to become
 Minister of War.   Jam is likely to press the Shah to
 give him control over the day-to-day operations of the
 military.                                                    25X1

 Ambassador to the US Zahedi, who had been urging the
 Shah to stay home, now believe it would be wise for
 him to go.
 These advisers expect that,  if Bakhtiar does not

 will step in and crack down on its own.
 the military is very close to
 25X1                  seizing power.   In either case,  Zahedi is said to believe
 the Shah should dissociate himself from the situation
 by leaving the country.
 Zahedi has long urged the Shah to crack down on   25X1
 the opposition.   We believe that,  if Zahedi and other
 hardliners in the court now favor the Shah's departure,
 their change probably reflects their frustration with
 his refusal to order a crackdown.   We doubt that Zahedi
 expects Bakhtiar to implement the "iron fist" approach,
 and Zahedi probably prefers that the military do so.
 The Shah has still not set a departure date,  and his
 public comments remain vague on his plans.

 SITUATION REPORT:   Vietnam-Kampuchea-China
 Following the capture of Phnom Penh,  the Vietnamese
 now control the eastern third of Kampuchea.   Prince
 Sihanouk left Phnom Penh on Saturday and has stopped
 in Beijing  (Peking)  on his way  to New York,  where  he     25X1
 will present Kampuchea's case against Vietnam to the
 UN Security Council.   Other Kampuchean leaders,  includ-
 ing Foreign Minister Ieng Sary, saw Sihanouk off, but 25X1
 Although some Kampuchean forces are still operating
 behind the Vietnamese columns, many Kampuchean main
 forces have disengaged and withdrawn after offering token
 resistance.   We believe the Pol Pot regime hopes to
 marshal these units for a protracted guerrilla campaign
 against the Vietnamese.   The regime will probably es-  25X1
 tablish a "temporary" capital in western Kampuchea.
 The Kampucheans appear to have a viable military force
 still intact, and they presumably have stockpiled suffi-
 cient weapons and supplies in the west to maintain those
 forces until new supply channels can be established.
 The Thai Government has considered various contin-
 gency plans in the event of a Vietnamese takeover of
 Phnom Penh, but it is likely to adopt a cautious approach
 for the immediate future.   Although the Thai have con-
 sidered supporting a Khmer resistance force in western
 Kampuchea if a Vietnamese-controlled government is es-
 tablished in Phnom Penh, they are not likely to take any
 such action until the situation is clarified.

 The Thai have encouraged Chinese support of the
 Pol Pot regime, but their own involvement has been
 tempered by a reluctance to provoke Hanoi.   During
 Deng Xiaoping's  (Teng Hsiao-ping's)  visit to Bangkok in
 November, the Thai agreed to let Chinese aircraft fly  25X1
 over Thailand en route to Kampuchea but were reluctant
 to allow overland transit of Chinese aid.
 The Chinese are also continuing their military
 preparations along Vietnam's northern border.   Since
 late December, China has substantially augmented its
 air,   air defense, and ground forces opposite Vietnam.
 Soviet media were prompt in covering the fall of
 Phnom Penh and lavish in their praise.   The Soviet news
 agency TASS initially published a dispatch from Hanoi
 stating the Kampuchean insurgents'  goals.   Soon there-
 after, prominent Soviet commentator Yury Kornilov said
 that there will be "deep satisfaction" throughout the
 world because the Pol Pot - Ieny Sary "clique" had
 resorted to genocide and was a tool of China's "expansion-
 ist policy."   Radio Moscow's domestic service bluntly
 termed the development a "defeat" for China and complained
 that the Chinese are considering convoking the UN Security
 Council to discuss Vietnam's "mythical aggression."

 BRIEFS AND COMMENTS
 Prime Minister Andreotti is scheduled to present his
 proposed economic stabilization plan for cabinet approval
 this week.   Failure to resolve interparty differences
 over the plan could bring down the government and lead
 to Communist demands for direct participation in a new
 one.                                                     25X1
 Two trends in particular have strained government
 cohesiveness in recent months.   Signs of Communist
 vulnerability--such as losses in local elections and
 growing discontent in the party's working-class base--
 have made many Christian Democrats more reluctant to
 grant new concessions to the Communists in return for
 their continued parliamentary support of the Christian
 Democratic government.   At the same time,  the Communist25X1
 leadership has come under increasing internal pressure
 to demonstrate that cooperation with the government pro-
 duces tangible benefits for party supporters.
 The parliamentary debate on the economic plan is
 shaping up as the decisive test for the Andreotti govern-
 ment.   Christian Democrats want the plan to focus on
 anti-inflation measures and are likely to resist expected
 Communist efforts to emphasize the creation of more jobs.
 Compromise will be complicated by major labor contract
 negotiations scheduled to begin this month.                 25X1
 The absence of agreement on an alternative govern-
 ing formula is a strong incentive to flexibility on both
 sides, however, and there are signs that the major
 parties are growing more inclined to make concessions.
 Nevertheless,  it will be difficult for political leaders
 to dampen the crisis atmosphere that has developed.
 If the Andreotti government does fall, protracted
 negotiations centering on the question of increased
 Communist participation are likely--negotiations that
 could lead to a stalemate and a new parliamentary elec-

 The Zimbabwe African National Union has infiltrated
 some 1,500 guerrillas into Rhodesia since early November.
 The Mozambican Army reportedly has agreed to provide them
 with more arms and may even allow some of its soldiers
 to join ZANU units infiltrating Rhodesia.   ZANU leader
 Robert Mugabe appears to have strengthened his position
 as a result of the stepped-up operations and improved
 his relations with Mozambique.                           25X1
 Mozambican President Machel has long urged ZANU
 to intensify operations inside Rhodesia to ease the
 pressure of Rhodesian cross-border raids into Mozambique.
 He had been frustrated over ZANU's lack of success on
 the battlefield and the inability of Mozambican forces
 to resist the Rhodesian raids.   Machel's more favorable
 impression of the guerrillas'  progress in the fighting
 may have persuaded him to give them more support and
 made him more optimistic about ZANU's ultimate success
 in Rhodesia.
 ZANU leaders apparently believe they are getting
 closer to assuming power in Rhodesia and are maneuvering
 for positions of influence in hopes of gaining top spots
 in a new Zimbabwe government.   The ZANU leadership
 has been plagued by chronic personal and tribal rivalries.
 Mugabe may now be gaining more support within his or-
 ganization because many Rhodesian blacks believe he
 would emerge as the eventual victor in Zimbabwe if a
 civil war broke out with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe Afri-
 can People's Union.   Machel's greater support for ZANU
 may also have strengthened Mugabe's hand.

 INDONESIA:   Possible Fuel Price Increase
 Indonesian consumers, particularly in the opposi-
 tion, will be watching President Suharto's annual budget
 message today for any reduction in the government's
 large subsidy on domestic petroleum products.   The sub-
 sidy has become increasingly expensive and has encour-
 aged excessive consumption, which has diverted crude
 oil that could have been exported.   Indonesian Govern-
 ment economists reportedly have recommended that Suharto
 raise domestic fuel prices by 50 percent, but the is-
 sue is politically sensitive and past increases have
 touched off demonstrations.                                25X1
 ZAIRE:   Prospects for Unrest
 The potential for unrest in Zaire this year is
 high--largely because of economic and social grievances.
 According to the US Embassy, however, only a large-scale
 upheaval in Kinshasa would present an immediate threat
 to President Mobutu.   The capital's population is be-
 coming progressively impoverished, but the city remains
 relatively calm despite heightened tensions.   Factors
 such as fear of a replay of the rampant civil disorders
 of the 1960s and the innate tolerance o     n  Zairians
 lessen the possibilities for upheaval.

 President Zia-uZ-Haq is faced with an accumulation
 of political and economic problems, some of which are
 fast coming to a head.   The country's other senior gen-
 erals may soon feel prompted to replace Zia,  but a new
 military Leader would probably not be much different.   In
 any event, the Pakistani military will probably be able,
 at Least in the short term,  to prevent serious political
 L5XI
 Zia depends on the continued support of the mili-
 tary,  and senior generals--as well as many other Paki-
 stanis--are already unhappy with his performance.   He
 will soon face a decision on former Prime Minister
 Bhutto    at is almost    rtain to increase criticism of
 his rule.                                                      25X1
 The Supreme Court has completed its hearing of
 Bhutto's appeal of his conviction for a political murder,
 and Zia's Attorney General expects it to announce its
 decision late this month.    If the court upholds the death
 sentence, as it is expected to do,  Zia must then decide
 whether Bhutto is to be executed.   The Attorney General
 believes Zia will order the death sentence carried out.
 25X1
 Some of Bhutto's followers believe his execution
 would bring such a strong popular reaction that Zia--and
 perhaps the military--would be driven from power.   The
 government has previously thwarted attempts by Bhutto's
 followers to stage widespread demonstrations, and his
 supporters have so far not made an all-out effort to
 create turmoil.   Should Zia opt for execution, and wide-
 spread rioting follow, his fellow generals might well see
 his resignation as necessary for the restoration of order.

 Zia could be removed from office, however,  if he
 does not confirm the death sentence.   Few Pakistanis are
 neutral about Bhutto, and many--including senior gen-
 erals--feel strongly that Bhutto must be executed to pre-
 vent his returning to power.
 A Civilian Government
 Zia also must decide what to do about growing pres-
 sures for a return to civilian government.   Both the
 politicians and a number of senior military officers want
 Army control ended, and Zia's inability to achieve this
 so far is a major cause of the dissatisfaction with him.
 Zia is reluctant to turn over power until he can be sure
 that the government will be honest and stable and that
 Bhutto's followers will have a minimal role in it.  F_
 25X1 25X1
 Zia hoped to build the Pakistan National Alliance--
 a coalition of nine parties formed to oppose Bhutto--into
 a dominant political force.   Bhutto, however, still has
 widespread popular support, and in a free election his
 party would probably win enough seats to make it at least
 an influential opposition party.                          25X1
 After prolonged negotiations,  Zia has won the sup-
 port of the Pakistan National Alliance but,  in the pro-
 cess,  the two best known figures in the Alliance withdrew
 their parties, a third smaller party also left,  and the
 most important remaining party in the Alliance split,
 leaving Zia with the support of five small parties and a
 faction of a major party.                                 25X1
 Zia has promised an election this year, but so far
 has not set a date.   Unless he makes a firm commitment,
 the rift between Zia and the politicians--including those
 who now support him--is likely to grow.
 Zia is reluctant to incur the political costs of
 forcing Pakistan's economy to operate within its means.
 Last fall, he turned down a proposal of the International

 Monetary Fund that would have provided a $70 million
 standby credit for balance of payments support.   In ex-
 change for financial support,  Zia would have had to curb
 rising public spending, especially on large government
 subsidies for a wide range of consumer goods.
 Pakistan's budget for this year shows that expendi-
 tures will increase sharply because of higher food sub-
 sidies and the government's decision to speed complet,;"
 Any cutback in subsidies would boost urban prices
 for basic foodstuffs and thus encourage increasing criti-
 cism of the government.   Crop failures require large
 imports of high-cost wheat this year and make subsidies
 more important than ever.
 Foreign Challenges
 The troubles in Iran have increased the feeling of
 isolation that has grown in Pakistan since last April,
 when pro-Communist leaders seized power in neighboring
 The new Afghan Government has assured Pakistan
 that it wants a peaceful settlement of the longstanding
 border dispute between the two countries.   As the Paki-
 stanis see it, however, Afghanistan's ultimate goal is
 the annexation of Pakistan's two western provinces.   A
 number of public and private statements by Afghanistan's
 new rulers tend to confirm Pakistani worries.         25X1
 The Pakistanis recognize that the Afghan Government
 is not now in a position to move against Pakistan.   The
 long-term threat posed by Afghan ambitions, however,  adds
 to the general malaise in Pakistan as the country's
 leaders grapple with their political and economic prob-
 lems.

 Hungary
 The government has announced price increases for
 several consumer goods,  including an average 25-percent
 boost for gasoline, effective today.   The increases
 are in line with previously announced plans to reduce
 or abolish many subsidies for consumer goods over the
 next several years.   Hungary was the first country in
 Eastern Europe to begin periodically raising prices of
 selected consumer goods and has been able to do so with-
 out prompting a serious popular backlash.   Wage increases
 have frequently offset the price rises, but none was
 mentioned in the official announcement on Saturday.
 Kampuchea-Vietnam-China
 While in Beijing  (Peking)  today  (see Situation Re-
 ports section), former Kampuchean leader Prince Sihanouk
 took pains at a press conference to dissociate himself
 from the domestic policies of the Pol Pot regime, but he

 said he would nonetheless proceed with his attempt to
 obtain UN condemnation of Vietnam's invasion.   He claimed
 that all leaders of the regime are alive and are leading
 the resistance.   Sihanouk contended that Chinese Vice
 Premier Deng Xiaoping  (Teng Hsiao-ping)  had promised
 yesterday to give Kampuchea "all types of aid" but had
 not said "anything precise" on the possibility of Chinese
 military intervention against Vietnam.
