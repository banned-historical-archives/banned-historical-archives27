 SYRIA:   Countering Corruption Charges
 I             Syrian President Asad has taken steps to neutralize
 omen tc criticism of his regime. Asad attacked corruption and
 government inefficiency Late Last week in a major televised
 speech before the opening session of the newly elected Syrian
 People's Assembly and assigned the ruling Baath party the job
 of dealing with these problems.
 To underscore his concern, Asad announced the establish-
 ment 51--a special committee to investigate charges of corrup-
 tion. The step follows closely the promulgation of several new
 economic decrees ostensibly designed to crack down on graft
 and prevent shortages in basic staples. As a personal gesture
 demonstrating his own probity, Asad also donated some inherited
 land and a house he owns in Damascus to the state.
 Many observers expect Asad to follow soon with long-
 expec.e   cabinet changes. Prime Minister Khulayfawi, who has
 already submitted his resignation, will probably be replaced
 by Naji Jamil, deputy defense minister and a close crony of
 Asad.
 grievances appears to have been prompted in part by the surpris-
 ingly low turnout--perhaps as few as 11 percent of eligible
 voters--at the recent parliamentary election. Some members of
 the President's inner circle reportedly are disturbed by the
 voters'  apathy and fear that it represents serious discontent
 with the regime's handling of the economy.
 Asad's decision to deal publicly with these popular
 I         INone of the President's moves appears to have much
 substance.  Instead, they seem designed primarily to undercut
 the efforts by his opponents to capitalize on popular dissatis-
 faction over economic conditions and government corruption. The
 special investigative committee, for example, is to be headed
 by a close associate of Rifaat Asad, the President's notoriously
 corrupt brother.
 The palliatives are unlikely to still public discon-
 tent for long. Asad will have to demonstrate that he is pre-
 pared to put his personal prestige behind the fight against
 corruption and efforts to improve the government's economic
 performance.

 That will be difficult for Asad to do without alienat-
 g sUMU-of his most important supporters. Although Asad has
 diligently sought to avoid the appearance of using his office
 for self-aggrandizement, he has condoned the corrupt practices
 of his brother and many of his supporters to ensure their con-
 tinued loyalty.
 At best, therefore, Asad may encourage some of his
 senior o      icials to follow his example by divesting themselves
 of some of their property and attempt to put a damper on some
 of Rifaat's activities. But it is doubtful that he or Naji
 Jamil--should Jamil become prime minister--will undertake a
 thorough house cleaning. Neither will it be easy politically
 for Asad to take the necessary measures to dampen inflation
 and improve government efficiency without actually increasing
 popular discontent.
 ROMANIA-ISRAEL:   Begin's Bucharest Visit
 //Israe Zi Prime Minister Begin arrives in Ro-
 mania on Thursday for an official state visit marking the first
 high-level contact between Romania and Israel since  1972. Ro-
 mania is the only Warsaw Pact member that has diplomatic rela-
 tions with Israel.  President Ceausescu will view the trip as a
 vindication of his efforts to maintain friendly contacts with
 all sides in the Middle East dispute and of Romania's inde-
 pendent policies in general.//
 //The Israeli ambassador in Bucharest told US
 p oma s    a   the visit will focus on the Middle East and on
 Jewish emigration to Israel. Begin will hold extended private
 talks with Ceausescu and will meet with members of Romania's
 Jewish community. The Israeli leader will also attend Sabbath
 services at a synagogue in Bucharest.//
 ]//Ceausescu will probably offer his "good of-
 fices   as a conciliator in Israel's dispute with the Arab states.
 Romania has good relations with the Arabs--including the Pal-
 estine Liberation Organization, which maintains a liaison of-
 fice   in Bucharest. Even if Begin declines the offer, Ceausescu
 will still be able to relay the Israeli viewpoint to Romania's
 Arab friends--and to the Soviets.//

 //Bucharest has a mixed record on Jewish emigra-
 tion.                       According to the census figures of January 1977, Romania's
 Jewish community numbers 25,700. This figure is presumably un-
 derstated; the official Israeli estimate is 60,000. Despite
 their restrictive emigration policies, the Romanians negotiated,
 a "gentleman's agreement" with the Israelis early this year
 to allow 3,000 Romanian Jews to leave for Israel during 1977.
 From January to July, however, only 600 to 700 persons actually
 departed--perhaps half the 1976 rate. The Begin visit may spur
 Ceausescu to accelerate the flow.//
 I          uIn 1967, when the USSR and its other allies broke re-
 lations with Israel following the Middle East War, Romania re-
 fused to follow suit despite Soviet pressure. This caused a
 number of Arab states to break relations with Romania. Rela-
 tions with the Arabs were gradually restored, but Romania con-
 tinued to import Iranian oil through a pipeline across Israel.
 Certain Romanian enterprises were put on the Arab boycott list
 in August 1975 and remained on it for about a year.
 I    I Romania persists in its "balanced" Middle East policy.
 is a strong advocate of Israel's right to exist as a sepa-
 rate nation but also supports a Palestinian "national state."
 Ceausescu evidently believes that relations with Israel will
 bolster his independent foreign policy, and he probably also
 expects that his stand will win some points in US eyes.
 Ceausescu's decision to meet with Begin is in keeping
 with a somewhat more independent tone that has crept into Ro-
 manian-Soviet relations since early July. For over a year, Ro-
 mania had attempted to minimize public differences with the So-
 viets. Last month, however, Ceausescu broke ranks with the
 other Warsaw Pact countries and cautiously defended Spanish
 Communist Party chief Carrillo following Moscow's unprecedented
 attack on him in June. Ceausescu received Carrillo in Romania
 in late July, and the two independent-minded leaders reiterated
 their belief in the principles of party autonomy and noninter-
 ference in internal affairs.
 I         IA series of articles highlighting Romania's foreign
 policy  as begun to appear in the Romanian press, and in mid-
 August Ceausescu saw visiting Italian Communist Party official
 Pajetta for "warm and friendly" talks on the communist move-
 ment.

 INDIA: Desai's Travel Itenerary
 A030300010022-0
 Indian Prime Minister Desai plans to travel to the
 USSR and US this fall; he appears anxious to demonstrate the
 even-handed, nonaligned policy of his governs  nt.
 Desai expects to visit Washington in October or Novem-
 ber. It will be the first visit of an Indian prime minister
 since November 1971--just prior to the India-Pakistan war and
 the subsequent low point in Indo-US relations. The Prime Min-
 ister obviously hopes the visit will give impetus to his re-
 cent moves toward improved relations with the US.
 I The relationship with the USSR, however, is still of
 primary importance to Desai's government. To reassure the
 USSR of India's continued good will, Desai plans to hold wide-
 ranging discussions with Brezhnev in September before his trip
 to Washington.
 Defense Minister Ram will make a separate visit to the
 USSR, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany in September on what is
 presumably an arms-shopping mission.
 POLAND:   Rumored Personnel Changes
 IThEe Polish rumor mill has predicted Jaroszewicz's
 fall since the June 1976 riots over proposed price increases.
 In fact, the longer the economic malaise continues, the greater
 will be the pressure for political change. Changes in the
 government lineup could be announced during one of the fall
 sessions of the parliament--the first of which will be held

 late next month. Party shifts could be announced at the second
 party conference--a mini-party congress scheduled for early
 next year.
 Of the two leaders, Gierek is the more secure. He was
 not blamed personally by the public for the price proposals
 and seems to be generally viewed as the most acceptable party
 politician. He has no obvious rivals for his job. We believe
 that the rumors about Gierek's future are overly pessimistic.
 Unless there is a repetition of widespread rioting, it is un-
 likely that he could be forced out of office.
 //Jaroszewicz's status is less certain. He
 was    ame    or    e price proposals and is unpopular because of

 CHINA: Hua's Congressional Speech
 I            Chinese party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng,  in a wide-rang-
 ing po icy address to the 11th Party Congress that was made
 public yesterday, stressed the need for unity and increased
 agricultural and industrial production. He also reiterated
 China's opposition to the USSR and its interest in improved
 relations with the US. The themes are familiar ones, but do-
 mestic issues have not been treated in so comprehensive or
 authoritative a fashion since the Cultural Revolution.
 I           The speech, which seemed to contain something for
 almost everyone, will doubtless be well received.  Its principal
 importance may be as an indicator of how much the Chinese po-
 litical situation has improved since the purge of the left.
 At the 10th Party Congress in 1973, then Premier Chou En-lai,
 who was the consumate Chinese politician, could do little more
 than repeat slogans.
 I          lAfter lavishly praising Mao Tse-tung's contributions
 to Marxism, Hua cleared Mao of all ties to the purged leftist
 leaders. Hua asserted that Mao had actually led the opposition
 to the "gang of four" and that he had worked closely with Hua
 and recently rehabilitated party Vice Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping
 to prevent the gang from seizing power. Mao, in fact, often
 protected the leftists and acquiesced in Teng's fall in 1976.
 Hua's fiction is vital because it enables the new
 leadership to claim Mao's mantle but discard those aspects of
 his legacy that run counter to the pragmatic, moderate policies
 favored by the new Central Committee.
 Approved I
 Approved F
 Hua stoutly defended veteran party cadre, many of
 whom had been criticized by Mao or branded enemies of the party
 by the leftists. The new Central Committee and Politburo are
 dominated by these old party bureaucrats and professional mili-
 tary men. The Party Chairman went to great lengths to show that
 they had been wrongly accused and that their return to power
 does not violate Mao's wishes. The presence of so many old party
 hands on the Central Committee and Politburo is likely to dis-
 please younger party members who have labored at lower levels
 for years and who loyally withstood the blandishments of the
 gang of four.
 Unity and stability were the overriding themes of the
 domestic section of Hua's speech. He indicated that the new
 leadership will not tolerate the disorder that characterized
 the last decade. He repeatedly called for greater party disci-
 pline and warned of harsh treatment for those who break the
 law.
 Hua announced a wide-ranging "screening" of gang of
 four supporters, but seemed to subordinate this work to increas-
 ing industrial and agricultural production. He also stated that
 the investigations must be completed by the end of this year or
 early next, and that purges should be kept to a minimum.
 In conjunction with the campaign against leftist sup-
 porters, a "rectification campaign" in the party will be launched
 later this year. Among other things, it will apparently review
 the cases of those party members who have suffered at the hands
 of the leftists.
 I             Hua broke no real new ground when he discussed eco-
 nomic policy. He did suggest that professional managers and ex-
 perts will be given more leeway to run their enterprises as long
 as they remain within the national economic plan. He treaded
 lightly when addressing worker demands for higher wages and bet-
 ter living conditions by repeating the standard line that worker
 benefits would increase as production rises. Hua did not discuss
 the role foreign trade will play in expanding production, but
 the new Central Committee contains many advocates of increased
 imports of foreign technology.

 Military themes also received standard treatment
 .
 Hua stressed the party's absolute control over the military,

 and at one point repeated Mao's admonition to senior military
 commanders not to abuse their authority. He called for the
 modernization of the army, but made it clear that defense in-
 dustries would not get priority over agriculture and basic
 heavy industry.
 I            IHua strongly endorsed a relaxation of the strict
 limitations the leftists placed on education and the arts and
 sciences. Hua made it clear that intellectuals had been wronged
 by the leftists and indicated that China intends to draw on
 the intellectuals' expertise, even if many of them lack a
 thorough understanding of politics.
 ,
 most authoritative response so far to Albania's recent public
 criticism of China. While he did not mention Albania by name,
 it was obvious that Hua had it in mind when, citing Mao and
 Lenin, he defended China's opening to the US. Those who fail
 to understand the strategic advantages of temporary alliances
 with erstwhile enemies, Hua said, "fail to understand even a
 particle of Marxism."
 Hua's remarks on Chinese foreign policy included no
 although his backhanded swipe at Albania was the
 surprises
 The Party Chairman reiterated Peking's interest in
 improved relations with the US, and sharply criticized the
 USSR's "aggression and expansion." Hua said the 1972 Shanghai
 communique remains the "basis" for Sino-US relations. He
 stressed that the communique states both sides'  opposition to
 "hegemonism," Peking's codeword for the USSR. Hua also said
 ties between the two countries would continue to improve "pro-
 vided the principles laid down in the communique are carried
 out in earnest," a formulation that--since 1975--has implied
 Peking's suspicions about the US ability to move the relation-
 ship forward.
 1             Hua also repeated Peking's "three conditions" for
 the normalization of Sino-US relations. These requirements
 were first made public officially last month by Vice Chairman
 Li Hsien-nien. They state that the US must sever diplomatic
 ties with Taipei, withdraw all military forces from Taiwan and
 the Taiwan Strait, and abrogate its mutual defense treaty with
 Taipei.
 The Chinese leader placed the blame for the lack of
 movement in Sino-Soviet relations squarely on Soviet shoulders.
 Approved Fort
 Approved For
 Referring to the Soviet leadership as a "fascist dictatorship,"
 Hua said that Moscow had not shown "one iota of good faith"
 about improving relations and that the Soviets were responsible
 for leading relations between the two sides "'up a blind alley."
 He said differences of principle between Peking and Moscow
 would continue "for a long time."
 Hua's extremely pessimistic characterization of the
 prospects for Sino-Soviet relations strongly suggests that Pe-
 king's post-Mao leaders have not softened their attitudes to-
 ward the USSR. Coming on the eve of Secretary Vance's visit to
 Peking, Hua's remarks serve to reinforce Peking's apparent de-
 termination to follow through with "Chairman Mao's revolutionary
