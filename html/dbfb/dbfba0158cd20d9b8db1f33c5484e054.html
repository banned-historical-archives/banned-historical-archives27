 MIDDLE  EAST
 USSR RESERVED ON KISSINGER TOUR, CRITICAL OF "PARTIAL STEPS"
 Moscow has treated the current. Kissinger diplomatic shuttle to
 work out a new Israeli-Egyptian Sinai accord in much the same
 fashion as the previous round in March.*  The Secretary's activities
 have been reported only briefly and sporadically, as in item.,:. on
 Moscow radio's Arabic-language service on the 21st and 22d noting
 his arrival in Israel to begin his Mideast tour "to continue dis-
 cussions on a partial settlement" and reporting his trip to '2gypt
 the next day.  Indirect criticism has been clearly conveyed through
 occasional swipes at the value of "partial" agreements which, as
 before, are portrayed as benefiting Israel and delaying settlement
 of the main issues--withdrawal from all occupied Arab terrt.t.ories
 and assurance of Palestinian rights.  Unlike the comment In March,
 however, Moscow has not called for resumption of the Geneva con-
 ference as an alternative to inadequate "partial measures."
 Soviet comment has also sought to imply that U.S. diplomacy is at
 variance with Arab interests by si:ressing reports that Washington
 will. supply Israel with vast amounts of military and economic aid
 after a new Sinai accord.   Explicit criticism of the anticipated
 Sinai agreement and of U.S. diplomacy has been confined to the
 low "unofficial" level of Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress, a
 vehicle used on occasion to convey a more strident tone than
 appears in Moscow radio's regular language services.  Radio Peace
 and Progress comment has been critical to the point of describing
 the prospective Sinai accord as "capitulatory" and advocating Arab
 economic pressure against Israel and the United Staters to counter
 alleged diplomatic prescure tactics.
 KISSINGER     In sparse direct references to Secretary Kissinger,
 MISSION       Moscow has reported his travels briefly and occasionalY.y
 cited some of his remarks on prospects for the nego-
 tiations.  The point of the selective citations has apparently been
 to play down the significance of a new Sinai interim agreement by
 contrasting it to the remaining problems involved in, achieving an
 overall Mideast settlement.  PRAVDA's international review by
 T. Kolesnichenko on the 24th, for example, claimed that some Western
 commentators had predicted the Secretary's current mission would
 "bring peace and tranquillity" to the Middle East, but that
 Kissinger himself disputed this assessment.  Kolesnichenko recalled
 *  Soviet treatment of the March round is discussed in the TRENDS
 of 12 March 1975, pages 1-2, and 19 March 1975, pages 5-7.

 that the Secretary said prior to his departure for the Middle
 East that "of course, it is not a matter of a peace agreement;
 it is a question of an intermediate step on the way to establish-
 ing peace between Egypt and Israel--if this attempt is indeed
 crowned with success."  In a similar vein, TASS on the 26th, re-
 porting from Alexandria on Kissinger's press conference there,
 noted only that he said he hoped a new agreement would be reached
 but that if it was not signed soon he would go t,., New York for
 a special session of the UN General Assembly, returning to the
 Middle East later.  TASS then selectively reported remarks by an
 Egyptian spokesman, and--under Algiers, Washington and Paris
 datelines--foreign press comment designed to minimize the prospec-
 tive Sinai agreement.   It was variously assessed as "purely a
 military document to defuse the explosive situation," "inciting
 a split in the Arab world," "says nothing about Syria or Jordan"
 or the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jerusalem, and
 "includes only secondary political considerations."
 U.S.-ISRAELI TIES      While Moscow has again displayed a measure
 of reticence about Secretary Kissinger's
 mission, it has portrayed the United States to Arab audiences as
 a constant ally of Israel, implying that U.S. diplomacy is sharply
 biased against Arab interests.   Comment has focused in particular
 on reports of American readiness to extend Israel some 2.8 billion
 dollars in economic and military aid, as in an Arabic-language
 broadcast on the 22d which, in reporting Kissinger's arrival in
 Egypt, pointedly cited his remark in Israel the previous day that
 Israel could continue to rely on American friendship.   Similarly,
 Moscow's Arabic-language service and Radio Peace a'nd Progress in
 broadcasts on the 21st singled out a statement by Y. Navon, chairman
 of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in Israel's Knesset,
 that the United States had promised Israel over two billion dollars
 in financial aid, as well as future supplies of oil and weapons.
 TASS on the 23d attributed to the Boston GLOBE a report that the
 United States had agreed to deliver "large consignments of the
 latest armaments," including several hundred jet fighters, a
 hundred Lance missiles, and a thousand laser-guided bombs.
 Radio Peace and Progress on the 22d linked Israel's anticipated
 acquisition of new U.S. military aid with the prospects of a new
 Sinai accord, indicating that Tel Aviv, with Washington's support,
 would be able to pressure Egypt into signing a new agreement dis-
 advantageous to Arab and Palestinian interests.   It quoted Palestine
 Liberation Organization chairman Yasir 'Arafat to the effect that
 since the October 1973 war Israel had increased its armed forces
 from 80,000 to 120,000 and that Israeli "infantry, navy and air
 force had been doubled."  It went on to cite TIME magazine on the
 large amounts of military aid the United States was expected to

 give Israel soon.  According to "observers," the broadcast said,
 "the new military operations being planned by Israel will facilitate
 the conclusion of a separate agreement being negotiated between the
 aggressor and Egypt on Sinai."
 ARAB COUNTER-     Some Soviet comment has suggested that the Arabs
 ACTIONS           counter the alleged U.S.-Israeli diplomatic
 offensive with pressure of their own.  The most
 notable example was a Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Arabic
 on the 22d, which referred approvingly to the notion of increased
 Arab economic pressure against "Israel and its protectors."  The
 broadcast cited an undated call by Iraq's Saddam Husayn for a new
 Arab oil embargo to be imposed against the United States and its
 allies to force Israel to withdraw from occupied Arab territories.
 The commentary also predicted, as did a Moscow radio broadcast in
 Arabic on the 25th, that the ministerial conference of nonalined
 countries, which convened in Lima on the 25th, would urge economic
 pressure "on Israel and the foreign powers supporting it."
 In stressing the: conflict between Arab and Israeli interests, Moscow
 has sought to capitalize on the closer cooperation between Jordan
 and Syria, reflected by President al-Asad's 10-12 June visit to
 Jordan and King Husayn's 18-22 August visit to Syria.   Radio Peace
 and Progress on the 21st, for example, remarked on the realization
 by Amman and Damascus that their eastern front against Israel must
 be strengthened "at a time when imperialism and Zionism are
 intensifying their attempts to impose capitulatory solutions" on
 the Arabs.   The commentary maintained that unless a "firm line"
 was pursued, a large part of Arab territory would remain under
 Israeli occupation--a danger it attributed chiefly to "U.S. and
 Israeli attitudes during the new round of U.S. shuttle diplomacy
 in the Middle East."  The broadcast cited a report in Israel's
 HA'ARETZ that ,after a new Sinai accord, a "U.S.-Israeli 40-point
 document will be secretly signed" obliging the United Stat.-s not
 to try to obtain Israeli withdrawal from any Jordanian territory
 and not to try for more than "minor adjustments" to present dis-
 engagement lines on the Golan Heights.  Radio Peace and Progress
 claimed that such plans on the part of the United States and Israel
 had "naturally" compelled Jordan and Syria "to raise their fighting
 capacity adequately to repulse possible Israeli attacks and liberate
 the occupied territories."  TASS on the 22d, reporting the joint
 communique issued at the end of King Husayn's visit to Syria, noted
 that the two countries had agreed to formation of a "Supreme Command
 Council" composed of Husayn and al-Asad which would coordinate the
 two countries' "foreign policy activities and those in the economic
 and military spheres, and the taking of joint measures to protect
 national security."

 CRITICISM OF     Moscow has continued to impugn Israel's sincerity
 ISRAEL           in the current talks with Egypt and to accuse it
 of militaristic policies.  PRAVDA's international
 review  column on the 24th, for instance, charged Tel Aviv with
 engaging in various "maneuvers" to disregard UN resolutions on
 the Arab-Israeli conflict and continuing to count on a military
 solution to the conflict "while professing peace."EasRAcDAsalalso
 claimed that Israel sought "to prolong
 as a whole by separate agreements"--implying criticism of U.S. and
 Egyptian diplomacy, as well, for being parties to such agreements.
 Moscow has dismissed internal Israeli dissent and demonstrations
 against a new Sinai accord ar "hypocrisy" and a deliberate ruse to
 create the impression that Israel is making serious concessions.
 A Moscow Arabic-language broadcast on the 21st, for example,
 denouncing demonstrations against the "expected agreement," maintained
 that Israel was not making any concessions because any land it
 might relinquish belonged to the Arabs anyway.   The broadcast added
 that Israel, moreover, would soon obtain large amounts of U.S. aid
 and that a new agreement would allow Israel "to postpone for some
 time the solution of larger and more difficult issues."  It cited
 the 18 August CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR to stress that Israel's
 withdrawal "by a few more kilometers in Sinai is a limited
 objective when compared to more important issues such as withdrawal
 from the Colan Heights, the rights of the dispersed Palestinians
 to have a homeland, and the future of Jerusalem."  It was in this
 context, the commentary said, that Israeli demonstrations against
 "so-called concessions on the Sinai agreement" should be viewed
 in order to realize what was behind "the facade of hypocritical
 noises."

 PORTUGAL
 MOSCOW QUESTIONS WESTERN INTENTIONS IN LIGHT OF CSCE
 While Moscow has ignored President Ford's and Secretary Kissinger's
 recent public admonitions to the USSR aga_nst interference in
 Portugal, it has in the past few days lodged countercharges
 against Western intervention in Lisbon's affairs.  Although the
 19 August PRAVDA Observer article on Portugal did not mention
 the Helsinki document in the context of Western interference in
 Portugal, some comment has again made this connection, complaining
 that "some people in the West" are trying to portray the Soviet
 Union as violating the CSCE principle of nonintervention, when in
 fact "it is the other way around."
 Following Observer's call for solidarity with the Portuguese
 "political forces" struggling against reaction, Moscow has rounded
 up expressions of support from various countries.  Rut; other than
 a statement by the Soviet trade unions, Moscow has not as yet
 begun publicizing declarations of support by Soviet "public"
 organizations, factory workers and private individuals, in the
 style of previous solidarity campaigns.  PRAVDA on the 24th did
 assert that the socialist countries and communist and workers
 parties were "acting in support" of the Portuguese revolution, a
 more cautious pledge than IZVESTIYA's 16 July statement that
 Portugal could count on the socialist countries' "active economic
 and political cooperation."
 On the Portuguese domestic scene, Soviet commentators have continued
 to criticize the leadership of the Socialist Party while presenting
 the Goncalves government as settling in and working constructively
 for Portugal's "progressive" development.  Reportage has reflected
 the fluctuating political situation, acknowledging divisions within
 the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) and "passivity and connivance" on
 the part of some army authorities, while portraying the working
 people as reacting "enthusiastically" to progressive developments,
 such as the recent formation of a leftwing front of eight
 organizations including the Portuguese Communist Party.
 APPLICATION OF      Moscow's renewed attacks on alleged Western
 CSCE PRINCIPLES     interference in Portuguese affairs would seem
 to be in response to President Ford's
 19 August remarks in his Minneapolis speech.  The President said
 that detente does not mean a license to fish in troubled waters,
 and that Portugal is one of the situations "we are carefully
 watching" for indications of Moscow's attitude toward detente and
 cooperation in European security.  Soviet accounts of the speech,

 by TASS and in the central press, relegated the remarks on Portugal
 to a final one.-sentence paragraph noting only that the President
 had described the Portuguese situation "as a process of 'a clash
 between ideologies) which 'must b'e'giveii the opportunity to find
 a solution in an atmosphere free of outside pressure."'*
 PRAVDA's Kolesnichenko replied in the paper's international
 review-on the:24th?and?.in a broadcast for North American listeners
 the next day, rejecting the notion that the'Soviet Union was
 violating the CSCE principle'of nonintervention by its attitude
 on Portugal.  In the internat?ional'review, he noted assertions by
 "some people in the West" that events in Portugal were the first
 test of the CSCE nonintervention principle'with respect to
 "different concoctions on 'plans' of the Soviet Union and other
 socialist states" toward Portugal. Everything is "the other way
 around," he said:   "If" the principle is being tested in Portugal,
 "thl.s is.by no means the Soviet Union's fault," but a result of
 the designs of "international reaction and imperialism."
 In his English-language commentary on the 25th, Kolesnichenko
 remarked on controversy in the United States over the Helsinki
 summit, saying that,"some observers" were ready to accuse the
 Soviet Union of violating CSCE principles by their attitude toward
 Portugal.  Without mentioning the recent Ford and Kissinger
 statements, Kolesnichenko aimed his criticism at remarks by former
 defense secretary. Laird to-the effect that "there is ostensibly a
 fairly considerable-Soviet influence in Portugal."' Kolesnichenko
 agreed that,"unfortunately," there was interference, not from the
 Soviet Union but from those "frightened" by the course of Portugal's
 revolution.
 .PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA observers also noted the relevance of the

 friends" of Portugal were concerned over the "open interference
 and pressure" against Portugal and wondered "how all this is to
 be understood following the solemn obligations" on nonintervention
 assumed in Helsinki.
 WESTERN "INTERFERENCE"    Soviet commentators have amassed a grow-
 ing list of "capitalist circles of the
 West" arrayed against revolutionary Portugal.  Along with such
 stereotyped stalking horses as international monopolies and
 "NATO's military-political machine"--accused. of plans for economic
 sanctions, psychological pressure, acid "gunboat diplomacy"--Moscow
 has added the EC to the list (for employing "sheer economic black-
 mail" by conditioning its aid to "how Portugal conducts its
 internal policy") as well as the "so-called European economic
 council" in Strasbourg.
 The West European social democrats have been a target at least
 since their meeting in Stockholm after the Helsinki summit when,
 according to PRAVDA on 10 August, they formed a committee to
 support the leadership of the Portuguese Socialist Party.
 Mikhaylov took up the cudgels in the roundtable program on the
 24th, asserting that in Stockholm the Socialist International
 politicians "virtually identified themselves with the international
 reactionary plot" against the "new Portugal" disguised as friends,
 albeit "false friends."  And a Kononov commentary broadcast in
 Italian on the 26th claimed that the Western European socialist
 leaders were not confining themselves to advice and moral support
 to "antigovernment forces" in Portugal; citing the CHRISTIAN
 SCIENCE MONITOR, the commentary added that the socialists, particu-
 larly the French and West German leaders, were also "giving
 financial aid" to the Portuguese socialists.  Kononov maintained
 that unidentified "slanders" about Soviet interference in Portuguese
 affairs were merely an effort to hide the "gross interference" by
 enemies of Portugal's revolution.*
 COMPARISON WITH CHILE   Following up on the 19 August PRAVDA
 Observer's statement that the "reactionary
 sorties" in Portugal were reminiscent of what happened in Chile,
 PRAVDA's Kolesnichenko has also professed to see similarities in
 the two situations.  And commentator Viktor Shragin, in a
 ?             *  Moscow has thus far ignored recent U.S. press reports that the
 Soviet Union has transferred funds to Portugal through a Soviet-
 Belgian shipping company in Antwerp; such stories are sometimes
 rejected by Soviet media in rebuttals decrying "outright
 fabrications" as anti-Soviet propaganda.

 foreign-language broadcast on the 26th, elevated the comparison to
 "a new slogan born in the broad movement of solidarity" with
 Portugal:  "Portugal must not be another Chile."  Shragin claimed
 that "imperialists and forces of internal reaction" were using
 the same methods in Portugal that they had used in Chile--financial
 and economic measures amounting to "an invisible blockade," as well
 as subversive and terrorist actions internally.  He warned "Mario
 Soares and other socialist leaders" to remember the fate of
 Chilean Christian Democratic Party leader Eduardo Frei, who "raised
 the banner of anticommunism" and cleared the way for the fascist
 junta, thinking he would become president again but "losing all."
 DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS    Soviet commentators have continued to
 criticize the leadership of the Socialist
 Party for "playing into the hands" of counterrevolution and
 reaction, but have avoided blanket condemnation of the socialists,
 pointing out that not all members subscribe to the policy of "some"
 of their leaders, end some have left the party.  Moscow has again
 replayed expressions of support for Prime Minister Goncalves,
 while citinJ Portuguese Communist Party warnings of a possible
 coup by reactionary forces, calls for solutions to basic problems
 "starting with the problem of political power," and appeals for
 unity of "patriots."  Reporting the establishment by eight leftist
 organizations--including the PCP--of a "provisional secretariat"
 on the 25t:'a, TASS' offered no comment of its own but cited
 0 SECULO for a positive comment with somewhat dubious overtones:
 The agreement by the eight parties, "who succeeded in overcoming
 disagreements" in order to unite, was a first step in the target
 of uniting the working class and all working people.  Moscow's
 domestic service on the 26th carried a more approving report
 from TASS' Lisbon correspondent that the Portuguese working
 people had reacted "enthusiastically" to the call of the "leftwing
 progressive parties" to set up a single national front.  The
 report cited Lisbon shipyard workers as saying that "at present"
 this was the only forum for rebuffing counterrevolutionary attacks.

 27 AUGUST 1975
 ITALIAN CO( 1UMISTS SHIFT POSITION, ATTACK SOCIALIST SOARES
 The Italian Communist Party--a frequent critic of the hard line
 pursued by Portuguese Communist Party leader Alvaro Cunhal--on
 13 August came to the defense of the Portuguese communists and
 at the same time launched an unprecedented attack on Portuguese
 Socialist Party leader Mario Soares.  This shift in the PCI's
 stance--the attack on Soares in particular--would suggest the
 PCI was greatly alarmed over the growing anticommunist violence
 and the threat to the Portuguese left, thus the expression of
 solidarity with Cunhal and the tongue-lashing for Soares for his
 apparent indifference to the violence.  Whatever the PCI's motive,
 it is noteworthy that L'UNITA's more strident tone and expression
 of sympathy for the Portuguese communists followed close on the
 heels of a visit to Moscow by a high-level PCI delegation led by
 foreign policy expert and theoretician Giancarlo Pajetta.  The
 PCI's position on Portugal was further obscured when, two days
 after the attack on Soares, the PCI came out with a joint state-
 ment with the Italian Socialist Party calling for the "speediest
 establishment" of a "government of national unity" composed of
 "democratic and antifascist forces" in Portugal.
 CRITICISM     In its attack on Soares,L'UNITA noted that the "anti-
 OF SOARES                                fascist forces" in Portugal were "split by violent
 polemics."  Therefore, the paper went on, Italian
 communists cannot "pass by in silence or without firm criticism
 the fact that socialist leader Mario Soares has been agitating
 violently against the communists  ,  . . while at the same time
 failing to condemn the wave of fascist violence."  The editorial
 denounced those who "out of party sectarianism or provincial
 narrowmindedness, incurable anticommunist hatred or mediocrity
 of political vision" can stand by-passively "or even with ill-
 conceived satisfaction" and watch or "even encourage and justify"
 fascist violence.  This is blindness, L'UNITA said, because if
 Portuguese reaction prevails it will destroy "all democratic forces."
 The editorial concluded by reiterating the PCI's "greatest possible
 firmness" in condemning the acts of violence, expressed "solidarity
 with the Portuguese communists" and denounced "all the attitudes
 of complicity, toleration and silence" regarding the violence.
 DIFFERENCES     The PCI's position on Portugal has tended to be
 WITH PCP        much closer to the line espoused by Soares and
 his socialists than that of the Portuguese com-
 munists, with L'UNITA and PCI leaders frequently taking strong
 exception to Cunhal's dogmatic policies and engaging in polemical
 exchanges with him in the press.  As recently as 29 July L'UNITA
 was taking sharp issue with the Portuguese communists for their

 failure to realistically assess the Portuguese situation and
 understand the views and wishes of the Portuguese people.  L'UNITA
 at that time recalled that the April elections provided ample proof
 of the country's massive backing for democracy and demonstrated
 that it was not the Communist Party that had extensive links among
 the proletariat.  "Our disagreement" with the Portuguese comrades,
 said L'UNITA, starts with the conviction that the "democratic
 factor" cannot be viewed simply as some kind of "concession" to
 the moderate forces.  Democracy is an "indispensable component of
 the revolutionary process," the paper stressed, adding that
 fundamental political freedoms must be preserved and defended, not
 Just "tolerated."
 The ].5 August joint PCI-PSI statement, like the L'UNITA editorial,
 expressed concern for the "exacerbating" situation in Portugal,
 but in general took a low-key approach and stuck to the familiar
 themes espoused by the PCI over recent months--that there must be
 unity of all democratic forces and guarantees of basic freedom.
 When alluding to the recent physical attacks on Portuguese communists
 and party premises, the statement said only that the "first and
 foremost task" was to "put an end to the acts of violence."

 HAVANA, MOSCOW WELCOME PARTIAL LIFTING OF U.S. TRADE EP'IBARGO
 Cuban Prime Minister Fidel. Castro has welcomed the U.S. State
 Department's 21 Augurit announcement of a partial lifting of the
 ban on trade with Cuba as a "positive gesture" of "great satisfac-
 tion" to Cubans.*                                           Apparently interested in responding in a
 positive way to the U.S. action, but still reluctant to begin
 negotiations without a complete lifting of the blockade, Castro
 equivocated on the significance of the State Department decision.
 In press 'onference remarks reported on the 22d by Havana radio,
 Castro reiterated his view that the embargo must be entirely
 removed  before "there is a truly healthy atmosphere in which to
 discuss differences," but he added that "this is not a condition,
 I would call it the essential requisite for discussion with
 dignity."  Later, when pressed by U.S. newsmen, Castro stated that
 now "there can be negotiation on how to negotiate," seemingly
 indicating for the first time that conditions for preliminary
 talks had been met.**
 Moscow's straightforward coverage was exemplified in a 22 August
 commentary by TASS observer Anatoliy Medvedenko, who assessed
 the State Department move at- indicative of "Cuba's growing
 international prestige" and as evidence of U.S. domestic support
 for a revised Cuba policy.  Regarding Castro's press conference
 remarks, Medvedenko reported the prime minister as saying that
 the complete lifting of the blockade would have to precede
 "genuinely effective bilateral talks."
 CASTRO PRESS CONFERENCE     Questioned about the State Department
 action at a 22 August joint press
 conference with visiting Mexican President Luis Echeverria, Castro
 see-sawed between praising the action and urging further steps by
 *   The State Department action permits foreign subsidiaries of
 U.S. firms to trade with Cuba, but does not affect the prohibition
 on direct U.S. trade.
 **  On 7 May, Castro had urged the United States to respond to his
 past overtures with a "gesture of similar importance," and he
 vaguely suggested that lifting the ban on export of foodstuffs and
 medicines would lead to a "reconsideration by the Cuban side of i-,
 relations with the United States."  Castro 's 7 May press conference
 is discussed in the TRENDS of 14 Nty 1975, pages 17-19.

 the United States.  Referring to the U.S. roi:) at the 30 July OAS
 session--which removed sanctions against relations with Cuba, and
 which the State Department cited a,l the basis for its 21 August
 announcement--Castro said that, at the OAS meeting, the United
 States "behaved realistically and voted with most of the Latin
 American countries."  Tying  that conference to current develrp-
 ments, Castro said:  "I sincerely regard these steps as positive"
 but added that "nevertheless, in its essence, the economic
 blockade persists," Declaring that Cuba was willing to negotiate
 with the United States "with absolute seriousness, frankness and
 responsibility," Castro explained that "we would not like to do
 so with a dagger at our throat"--his frequent characterization
 of the blockade--and insisted that "a climate of dignity, equality
 and honor has to be created" if negotiations are to be conducted
 in a "truly healthy atmosphere."
 Asked if this meant that "the entire lifting of the blockade" was
 a precondition for discussions, Castro first answered:   "I
 believe so," but 'gent on to say that this requirement was "not
 a condition" but simply "the essential requisite for discussion
 with dignity."  However, when further pressed as to whether he
 was excluding even preliminary discussions under present
 circumstances, Castro said:   "I believe there can be negotiation
 on how to negotiate," quickly adding that, at any such meetings,
 Cuba would "always maintain that conditions of equality must
 exist to negotiate."   Seewingly concerned to appear reasonable,
 Castro explained:
 This does not mean that we object to holding talks.
 But we maintain the principle that in order to
 engage in deep negotiations, it is necessary that
 the economic embargo imposed against Cuba by the
 United States be lifted.
 Castro also avoided inflammatory rhetoric on the export of
 revolution, as he has done for some time.   Responding to a question,
 he stated flatly that "the revolution cannot be exported," and
 asserted that Cuba had "adhered strictly to the norms of inter-
 national coexistence."  However, he then went an to cite several
 examples of the United States' "innumerable attempts to export
 counterrevolution" in Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America.  In
 toto, his 22 August statements underscored his recent tendency to
 give cautious encouragement to U.S. steps in his direction, while
 continuing to flail United States foraign policy.
 MOSCOW COMMENTS      Moscow's reaction to the State Department
 announcement has been low-key and couched in
 predictable terms.   In a 21 August dispatch, TASS promptly
 acknowledged the announcement, noting that the step "does not mean

 any change in bilateral relations since the decision only applies
 to third countries."  Later reports also emphasized the limited
 scope of the action and suggested the need for further steps,
 again drawing on statements by American political figures who
 favor a more "realistic" Cuba policy.
 Along these lines, a commentary by TASS observer Anatoliy
 Medvedenko, broadcast by Moscow's domestic service on the 22d,
 noted that the State Department move was both a tribute to Cuba's
 "growing international prestige" and "an indication of the current
 trend in the United States toward a revision of l,ts relations
 with Cuba."  Medvedenko remarked that the limited nature of the
 action demonstrated that "influential forces in the United States"
 still opposed normal relations.  The TASS commentator indicated
 that such a position must change, because, as Fidel Castro had
 noted, "a full lifting of the embargo is necessary for a start
 of genuinely effective bilateral talks."

 SING - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 KONTWJNIST SEES CONSOLIDATION OF ANTI-SOVIET COURSE IN CHINA
 An editorial in the most recent issue of KOMMUNIST concludes that
 "Maoism" has reached a new stage in China, characterized by the
 institutionalization of Pekipg's anti-Soviet course.  According
 to summary reviews issued by TASS, the editorial asserts that
 this development will make more difficult China's return to
 socialism and to improved relations with the USSR.*  The editorial
 is Moscow's most authoritative statement on China since its assess-
 ment of the results of the January 1975 National People's Congress
 (NPC) in a PRAVDA editorial article last February.**
 The editorial repeats a series of now-familiar charges concerning
 China's hostility toward the USSR and the socialist community, its
 opposition to detente, its desire for rapprochement with the most
 reactionary elements in the West, and its alleged interest in
 fomenting conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.
 But in asserting that China's anti-Soviet course is now formalized
 and consolidated in the new state constitution adopted by the National
 Peoples Congress in January 1975, Moscow seems to be acknowledging
 implicitly that the possibilities for a significant improvement
 in Sino-Soviet relations are more remote than ever.  The timing
 of this most recent assessment of the dispute also suggests that
 Moscow does not expect any foreseeable leadership changes in
 king to materially affect China's
 policy--a view consistent with
 its long-standing position that the struggle between "leftist" and
 "moderate" factions, associated with Chiang Ching and Chou :n-lai
 respectively, has r" direct bearing on relations with the USSR.
 The new stage in China, according to KOMMUNIST, involves a switch
 from political and ideological confrontation with the socialist
 community to "interstate hostility on all fronts."  Available
 summaries of the article have not mentioned the Sino-Soviet border
 problem or implied that Moscow perceives any increase in the
 immediate military threat from China.  Indeed, a 16 August article
 in SOVIET RUSSIA by G. Apalin making similar charges went on to
 * Based on past experience regarding the intervals between the
 publication of TASS reviews and the actual issuance of the journals,
 it may be several weeks before the latest issue, No. 12, is avail-
 able for inspection.

 note that, while Peking is interested in conflict among its opponents,
 "it is at the same time doing all it can to have these conflicts
 break out as far as possible from Chinese borders."
 The article warns that a neutral or conciliatory attitude on the
 part of other communist parties toward Peking's policies would only
 serve the "antisocialist purposes of the Chinese leadership."  The
 impression that this warning was aimed at independent-minded parties,
 such as the Romanian party, was strengthened by the appearance of an
 article in the CDR party organ NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, summarized by TASS
 on 25 August, which echoed KOMMUNIST's changes about the new stage
 in Chinese policy.  This criticism of neutralism suggests that
 Moscow is in no mood to compromise with those communist parties
 in East and West Europe that are reluctant to participate in the
 European and world party conferences unless there is advance agree-
 ment that the China problem will be soft-pedaled.
 There is some evidence to suggest that Moscow's renewed harshness
 toward China may be accompanied by a peace offensive in the West
 aimed at taking advantage of the favorable momentum created by the
 CSCE.  PRAVDA's Yuri; Zhukov recently wrote of a new "worldwide
 campaign for disarmament" and a "second Stockholm movement," a
 reference to a Soviet propaganda campaign of 25 years ago which,
 according to Zhukov, "prevented the use of nuclear arms in Korea
 and rallied the people in the struggle to prevent a new world war."
 Apalin stressed the linkage between the two aspects of Soviet policy
 in his SOVIET RUSSIA article, asserting that "the struggle against
 Maoism is inextricably linked with the struggle against imperialism
 and against the threat of a new world war."

 EAST-WEST  RELATIONS
 PRAGUE ISSUES PROTEST TO FRG ON HELICOPTER FLIGHTS
 The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry has formally charged West Germany
 with responsibility for the 15 and 17 August helicopter flights
 which airlifted East German refugees to West Germany.  The foreign
 ministry note, issued on 20 August and broadcast by Prague on
 21 August, formalized an earlier verbal protest, which was conveyed
 to the FRG charge d'affaires in Prague on 19 August and which
 presumably was the unattributed protest aired by Prague radio the
 same day.*
 The foreign ministry protest to Bonn is the first such Czechoslovak
 action taken in regard to West Germany since diplomatic relations
 were established on 11 December 1973.  The Czechoslovak Foreign
 Ministry had handled an earlier comparable incident--the hijacking
 of a Czechoslovak plane to the FRG in May 1972--through the U.S.
 Embassy in Prague, which was representing the FRG at that time.
 The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry has routinely issued annual
 statements protesting the holding of "revanchist" meetings of
 Sudetan Germans in the FRG.
 The protest note'said the recent helicopter flights "amount to a
 g:?oss violation of international law, for which the FRG Government
 is responsible" and were "contrary to the spirit" of the European
 security conference final document.  The note demanded that the
 FRG Government take appropriate action to punish the offenders and
 prevent a repetition of the incidents and added that the CSSR
 Foreign Ministry reserved the right to claim compensation for
 damage caused by the exchange of gunfire during the helicopter's
 departure on the 17th.
 The protest note stopped short of alleging an active FRG role in
 the helicopter incidents, claiming only that they had been
 "prepared and organized in advance."  However, a Czechoslovak
 Interior Ministry spokesman, as reported by CTK on the 21st, as
 well as subsequent Prague comment, declared that the incidents
 had been "prepared by the military and security bodies of the
 Federal Republic of Germany."
 The 20 August note identified the helicopter pilot as "former
 American Air Force pilot Meeker," but did not mention the fact that
 the refugees flown out were from East Germany.  However, a Prague
 radio commentary on the 20th described the escapees as "a number

 of citizens of a third state" and, in referring to Meeker.'s
 "records at the CIA center in Langley," implied that he was an
 agent of the CIA.
 NOTE TO AUSTRIA     The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry conveyed on
 the 25th a milder note to the Austrian
 ambassador expressing Prague's "deep concern" that Austrian
 authorities had not prevented the helicopter from entering
 Czechoslovakia via Austrian airspace.  The note, which was carried
 in part by CTK on the 25th, followed a 21-22 August session of the
 Austrian-Czechoslovak border commission, which had been requested
 by Prague to discuss the helicopter incidents.   Citing the Austrian
 side's expressions of "regret" over the incidents and assurances
 that it would seek to prevent similar incidents in the future, the
 foreign ministry asserted that it expects Vienna to "consistently
 fulfill" its pledges.
 W`%ile Prague has given heavy publicity to the incidents, Moscow has
 limited its coverage to brief TASS reports on the Czechoslovak
 diplomatic actions vis-a-vis West Germany, and a broadcast to
 Austria citing Prague's request to convene the Austrian-Czechoslovak
 border commission.

 CAMBODIA
 SIHANOUK LEAVES NORTH KOREA FOR PRC WITH RGNU DELEGATION
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk has ended his three-month stay in North
 Korea and returned to Peking in the company of an RGNU-NUFC
 delegation led by RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth and Deputy Prime
 Minister Khieu Samphan.  The visit of the Cambodian delegation in
 North Korea provided the occasion for Sihanouk's first meeting
 with Khieu Samphan since the Front victory in April, but communist
 propaganda has given no clear indication about the prospects for
 Sihanouk's return to Cambodia or his future relationship with the
 Cambodian-based leadership.
 The only indication thus far that Sihanouk may return to Cambodia
 with the RGNU delegation, apparently including Penn Nouth, was
 contained in Kim I1-song's 20 August banquet speech.  As reported
 by KCNA on the 20th, Kim noted that the delegation had cc.me "to
 accompany Samdech Norodom Sihanouk home."  While Sihanouk has not
 acknowledged that he is returning to Phnom Penh, he has been
 quoted twice by KCNA--in his 20 August banquet speech and in a
 23 August message of gratitude to Kim--as stating that he intends
 to lead an "important national delegation" back to Pyongyang for
 the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers Party
 on 10 October.  Although both Phnom Penh radio and NCNA have
 closely followed the activities of the delegation in the DPRK,
 neither reported either Kim's reference to Sihanouk's return
 "home" or the prince's statement that he would be returning to
 North Korea in October.
 The enthusiastic reception given the Cambodian delegation during
 its 19-22 August visit in Pyongyang, follrwing a warm reception
 in Peking, closely p&ralleled the attention accorded a visit to
 the DPRK last year of a Cambodian delegatiop led by Khieu Samphan.*
 On 19 August the RGNU-NUFC delegation was greeted on arrival by
 DPRK Vice President Kim Tong-kyu, had a "cordial and friendly"
 talk with Kim I1-song in the presence of Sihanouk, and was feted
 at a banquet hosted by Kim Tong-kyu, addressed by Kim and Penn
 Nouth, and attended by Kim Il-song and Sihanouk.  Sihanouk did
 not participate in bilateral talks between Kim Tong-kyu and Penn
 Nouth and Khieu Samphan on the 20th, but he hosted a banquet that

 evening for Kim Il-song at which both he and Kim spoke.  Khieu
 Samphan addressed a DPRK Ministry of the People's Armed 1!'orces
 meeting hosted by Yi Yong-mu, director of the General Political
 Bureau of the KPA, on 21 August.  Sihanouk and the delegation
 were given a high-level send-off from Pyongyang on the 22d, and
 KCNA released a lengthy 22 August joint communique on the 23d.
 The Cambodian leaders were greeted on arrival at the train station
 in Peking on the 23d by PRC Vice Premiers Teng Hsiao-ping and
 Li Hsien-:lien, in an otherwise low-key reception.
 The 22 August Cambodia-DPRK communique employed virtually the same
 expressions of warmth and Khmer-Korean solidarity that were used
 in the 8 April 1974 joint communique capping Khieu Samphan's visit
 last year.  Thus both communiques includel similar expressions of
 gratitude for mutual aid in past struggles and assurances of
 support and solidarity in the future.  Each communique evaluated
 the significance of the visits by the respective delegations in
 similar terms, the present communique stating that the current
 visit has "greatly contributed to further consolidating and
 developing the militant friendship and unity and cooperative
 relationships" between the two peoples.  Simi.r to last year's
 communique, the current communique noted that bilateral talks
 proceeded in "an atmosphere of militant friendship and mutual
 trust" and that there was "a complete unanimity of views on all
 the problems discussed."  The invitation extended by the Cambodian
 delegation for a reciprocal DPRK delegation to visit Cambodia,
 included in the communique last year, was dropped in the current
 communique.  The present communique expressed support for the
 admission of the DPRK to the movement of nonalined nations, as
 both Sihanouk and Penn Nouth had done earlier in their banquet
 speeches.
 Phnom Penh radio covered the visit of the delegation to Pyongyang
 in somewhat less detail and depth than it reported on the
 delegation's earlier visit to Peking.  While the radio had carried
 the full text of both Khieu Samphan's 15 August banquet speech and
 of the 18 August Sino-Khmer joint communique, it carried only
 excerpts of Penn Nouth's and Sihanouk's banquet speeches and of
 the 22 August Khmer-Korean joint communique, and did not cite any
 of Khieu Samphan's remarks in reporting his 21 August DPRK Defense
 Ministry meeting speech.  The radio also reported many of the
 delegation's activities in Pyongyang only in passing, in contrast
 with its fuller accounts of the delegation's activities in China.
 The radio did,, however, include all due expressions of warmth and
 cordiality.

 BANGLADESH
 PRAVDA 'OBSERVER' URGES DACCA LOYALTY TO MUJIB POLICIES
 Moscow's first authoritative reaction to the 15 August coup in
 Bangladesh, contained in a 22 August PRAVDA "Observer" article,
 reflected both vexation over the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
 and skepticism concerning assurances by the new president that
 Bangladesh's foreign policy orientation would remain unchanged.*
 PRAVDA Observer articles have traditionally been regarded as
 representing official Soviet views; they rank below the editorial-
 article level in importance but above the level of routine signed
 articles.  The last article under the Observer  byline? in the
 19 August PRAVDA, dealt  with the current situation in Portugal.
 Eulogizing the former president for his contribution to the national
 liberation movement, Observer stated that the "slaughter" of Mujib
 and his family had evoked "legitimate indignation" throughout the
 world and that the "Soviet people share the feelings of grief"
 over his "tragic death."
 In discussing Bangladesh's foreign policy, Observer acknowledged
 that newly installed President Ahmad had proclaimed an "unchanged
 foreign policy line" and "loyalty to treaties and agreements pre-
 viously concluded with other states."  The article noted, however,
 that "political observers in different countries" were questioning
 whether "forces having a hostile attitude," such as "imperialism,
 Maoism and internal reaction," would "exert an influence on the
 country's future development."  Hailing the "positive trends" of
 Bangladesh's recent foreign policy, Observer recounted that Soviet-
 Bangladesh relations had "progressed significantly" and were an
 "important factor in peace in the region."  The article concluded
 that Bangladesh's "friends" hoped it would "remain loyal to the
 fundamental trends of its foreign policy" and continue to cooperate
 "with its neighbors and other countries" in the interests of world
 peace.
 Subsequent routine Soviet media comment on Bangladesh has predictably
 echoed the Observer article.  Political commentator Druzhinin,
 speaking on the 24 August edition of Moscow radio's weekly

 to carry reports on developments in Bangladesh, but have not as yet

 USSR
 MASHEROV PROMOTES INNOVATIONS IN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
 P.M. Masherov, the ambitious party first secretary of Belorussia,
 appears to he currently riding high as a successful and innovative
 economic leader.   Belorussia's industrial growth is far ahead of
 the plan and Masherov has been publicizing this and attributing
 it to more efficient econc,aic management introduced under his
 leadership.  What is more, he has recently introduced new experi-
 mental systems in construction, transportation and agriculture
 aimed at further increasing efficiency of management.  He is one of
 the few leaders to regularly stress the need to extend economic
 reform and his experiments appear to conform to the ideas of
 Premier Kosygin (as well as his onetime patron, First Deputy
 Premier Mazurov).  Masherov's construction experiment was recently
 endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers, and if the plan is
 successful it could greatly enhance his prestige, since all
 earlier attempts to solve the chronic problems of construction
 have failed.
 The construction industry is plagued by chronic failures to com-
 plete construction projects, a condition partly caused by peculi-
 arities in the planning system which make  it relatively more
 profitable for construction organizations to start new projects
 than to finish existing ones.  Kosygin and others have repeatedly
 demanded faster completion of construction and have attempted to
 facilitate this by drastic cuts in the number of projects permitted.
 The Soviet Government had extended economic reform to the construc-
 tion field already in 1970, after adoption of a June 1969 Central
 Committee-Council of Ministers decree on improving planning and
 incentives in construction.*  But, as pointed out in a July 1975
 OUR CONTEMPORARY article by A.N. Chekalin, even though half of all
 construction organizations now work with the new system, "it has
 still produced little noticeable effect"--partly because of
 restrictions hampering implementation of the reform.  Chekalin,
 deputy editor of STROITELNAYA GAZETA's department of economy, added
 that in 1974 the main construction ministries--construction, indus-
 trial construction, construction of heavy industrial enterprises,
 and rural construction--all failed to fulfill their plans.
 Last year the Belorussians came up with a new system, which Chekalin
 declared "opens a new page in the development of the economic reform."

 The system revises planning procedure and makes payment depend
 on final completion of a project, rather than on completion of
 various stages of construction or on calendar periods.  The number
 of planning indicators  is to be reduced and the builders are to
 have more rights to adjust their work schedules and manipulate their
 own resources.  Starting in January 1976 construction organizations
 will work on the basis of credit from banks:  if they fall behind
 schedule in completing a project, they are penalized by having
 to pay high interest rates; if they complete the project ahead of
 schedule they receive a considerable incentive reward.
 Chekalin described how Belorussian Industrial Construction Minister
 N.T. Arkhipets successfully proposed this systemtas an experiment
 at a meeting in the CPSU Central Committee's construction section
 at the end of September 1974 and how an interdepartmental commission
 (headed by Gosstroy First Deputy Chairman M.G. Chentemirov) was
 created, whic'i carried the proposal "through hell and high water"
 past Gosplan and the various other ministries until it was approved.
 The system, basically one of economic self-sufficiency, conforms
 well to Kosygin's ideas, and in May 1975'a USSR Council of Ministers
 decree (announced in the 5 June IZVESTIYA) approved the proposal
 to adopt the system for the Belorussian industrial construction
 ministry.  On 20 May the Belorussian Council of Ministers adopted
 a decree on improving planning and economic methoda, and on 10 June
 Masherov visited the republic industrial construction ministry's
 computer center and stressed the importance of the new system.  At
 the 4 July Belorussian Central Committee plenum, Masherov described
 the new system in detail and again stressed its importance.
 At the same July plenum, an extensive reorganization of agricultural
 administration was unveiled, aimed at improving efficiency by
 increasfad specialization in interfarm organizations.*  These two
 new experiments come on top of a recent economic reform experiment
 in Belotussia's vehicle transport ministry, which was lauded by
 Masherov is his 30 May 1974 election speech and his 4 July 1975
 plenum speech.  Masherov has also vigorously pushed economic reform
 by creating 100 production associations in industry and transferring
 23 plants to the Shchekino system of raising labor productivity and
 reducing the work force (as indicated in Masherov's May 1974 and
 July 1975 speeches). He has also int'?oduced and promoted other
 agricultural innovations, such as the "shop" (tsekh) system,
 *  This system is described in the Supplementary Article "Reorgani-
 zation of Soviet Agricultural Administration Underway" in the TRENDS
 of 16 July 1975, page S 6.

 which puts specialists in direct command of production, and a
 system of concentrating aural construction in local construction
 departments.*
 In contrast to the generally lackluster Soviet economic performance,
 Belorussia has been achieving remarkable growth.  At the July 1975
 plenum Masherov could boal3t that by increasing efficiency Belorussia
 had increased industrial production by 63 percent during the present
 five year plan instead of the planned 53-56 percent, had raised
 labor productivity by 42 percent instead of the planned 38 percent,
 and had produced over one billion rubles' worth of consumer goods
 above the plan.  He bragged that Minsk had already completed its
 five year plan goals in June 1975 and was greatly exceeding the
 planned growth of labor productivity.  Demographer Viktor
 Perevedentsev in the 30 April 1975 LITERARY GAZETTE declared that
 during the first three years of the five year plan industrial
 production in Minsk grew 34 percent--far faster than any other city
 of one million population.  He also noted that Minsk is growing in
 population far faster than any other major city and said that
 "specialists are even talking about a special "Minsk phenomenon."'
 In the light of such economic success, it is hardly surprising
 that last Tear's Central Committee rebuke to Belorussia for
 inadequate ideological work appears to have had little visible
 e..rect on the republic leaders.**  There have been no shakeups
 as a result of the decree.

 1972, pages 39-40.

 COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP DISCUSSED IN REPUBLIC JOURNALS
 For the first time this year full-acale articles on "collective
 leadership" have been published in the Soviet press.  The August
 issues of the Ukrainian and Estonian party journals carry articles
 on the subject written by P.A. Rodionov, author of one of the last
 notable comments on the subject in PRAVDA early this year.  A prolific
 publicist on the issue and a long-time defender of "collective
 leadership," Rodionov has tailored his articles this time to the
 political leanings of the respective republic party bosses.   In
 KOMMUNIST UKRAINY, the organ of Brezhnev's protege, Shcherbitskiy,
 Rodionov stresses the importance of combining collective leadership
 with strong personal leadership; in KOMMUNIST ESTONII, organ of
 Estonian ''first Secretary Kebin, a regional leader who appears to
 be distant from Brezhnev, Rodionov stresses the predominance of
 the collective over any individual leader.  The articles were clearly
 written with each individual republic in mind, since after discus-
 sing general principles they both deal with party activities
 peculiar to the respective republics.
 Rodionov's article in KOMMUNIST UKRAINY bore the same title as
 his early 1974 book:  "Collectivity--A Very High Principle of
 Party Leadership."  AltL'ough the article includes several of
 Rodionov's usual statements on the importance of collectivity,
 it omits the sharp warnings against a leader permitting himself
 to be exalted or assuming one-man leadership which appaared in
 his book.  What is more, the article includes several paragraphs
 arguing the need for a strong leader--a theme played down by
 Rodionov in the past.  His choice of terms calls to mind terms
 used for Brezhnev in recent months, and his statements carefully
 and curiously use more than one term for leader:  vozhd, rukovoditel,
 lider, avtoritet.   Thus, he declares that "the people and party
 need rukovoditeli, lidery, able to correctly express their
 interests and will . . ." and "Marxism-Leninism is alien to
 anarchic denial of the role of avtoritety, rukovoditeli."  "Vozhdi,
 rukovoditeli, armeu with Marxist-Leninist theory, experience,
 political feeling, ability to see better than others the course
 and prospects of movement, relying in this on the experience of
 the masses, play a very important, outstandin:, role in public
 development."  He states that the "authority of a leader
 (rukovoditel) and the cult of personality are not the same," since
 the latter means "belittling the role of the masses" while the
 "authority of rukovoditeli, lidery, vozhdy is based on recognition
 of the deciding role of the masses. on collectivity in work, on
 common interests of leaders and let   and correct, deep understanding
 of th
 i
 erests by both."

 Rodionov's article in KOMMUNIST ESTONII is entitled "Collectivity--
 The Determining Feature of Leninist Style in Party Work."  In it,
 he stresses that Lenin strictly observed collectivity, never
 forced his views on his colleagues, never decided important
 questions singlehandedly, rejected exaggeration of his role and
 insisted that the Central Committee's secretary can only carry
 out collegial decisions of the Politburo, Orgburo or Central
 Committee.  Rodionov refers readers to his pro-collectivity book
 (which he does not even mention in the Ukrainian article) and
 does not include the paragraphs on the need for a strong leader
 included in the Ukrainian article.  The only bow he makes in the
 direction of a strong leader is to state that criticism of the
 cult of personality does not mean denying the role of leaders
 and that "if leading figures, lidery, vozhdy, invested with the
 trust of the masses and by their collective will set at the head
 of the party or of some party organ, keep pace with the times and
 place their wisdom, their knowledge and their organizational talent
 at the service of the party and people--the role of such figures is
 significant and important."
 BACKGROUND     Rodionov, as party second secretary of Georgia,
 turned out numerous articles on collectivity during
 the second half of the 1960's, articles with an implicitly aL,ti-
 Brezhnev bias.                             Hence, it was not surprising that in 1971, as
 Brezhnev's power-grew, Rodionov was removed from party leadership
 work, dropped from Central Committee candidate membership, and
 reduced to academic work at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
 Although his articles became less frequent and more innocuous
 than before, his book on collectivity, set in type August 1973
 and signed to press February 1974, still reflected his antileader
 bias.  Rodionov appeared ty) return to prominence during the period
 of Brezhnev's illness earlier this year, when PRAVDA on 21 January
 carried an article by him briefly discussing collectivity.  The
 appearance of this sensitive theme in the press during a difficult
 time  or Brezhnev stirred some speculation at the time.  However,
 the article was rather bland in its formulations and did not
 appear to be a sharp jab against Brezhnev.*  While the present
 KOMMUNIST ESTONII article reflects his old views, the KOMMUNIST
 UKRAINY article suggests that he is now willing to occasionally
 bend his principles to accomodate Brezhnev's predominant position.

 NOTES
 KOREAN FRONT ANNIVERSARY:  Pyongyang marked the anniversary of the
 25 August 1969 founding of the Revolutionary Party for Reunifica-
 tion (RPR), the DPRK-backed party in the South, as it did last
 year with a NODONG SINMUN editorial article.  The only available
 version of this year's editorial article, a 25 August KCNA
 summary, praised the party for its success in strengthening its
 ranks through adoption of Kim Il-song's ideological principles.
 The editorial article claimed that on the basis of Kim's "chuche"
 ideas the revolutionary ranks have been "constantly expanded and
 strengthened."  It noted RPR attempts to block the alleged
 U.S.-backed "two Koreas plot," to achieve the country's
 "independent reunification," and to establish a "national
 coalition" government, and offered standard North Korean support
 for the "struggle" of the South Korean people for "winning
 democratic freedom" and reunifying the country.  The KCNA summary
 contained no mention of the "colonial rule of U.S. imperialism"
 in the South, which has been mentioned in Pyongyang comment on the
 anniversary in previous years and is supposedly one of the main
 targets of the RPR.
 ROMANIA ON NONALINED CONFERENCE: The Romanian leadership welcomed
 "with satisfaction" the 25 August decision of the ministerial
 conference of the nonalined countries meeting in Lima, Peru,
 25-29 August to allow Romania to attend as a "guest."  A 26 August
 session of the RCP's Executive Political Committee, as reported by
 AGERPRES that day, indicated no sign of pique that the invitation,
 in effect, amounted to a rejection of Romania's bid to gain "observer"
 status at the conference.  According to Belgrade's TANJUG on the
 25th, "guests" have no definite status within the nonalined move-
 ment and are not automatically invited to future conferences.   The
 Executive Political Committee session portrayed the invitation as
 "fresh proof" of Bucharest's increasing solidarity with the
 developing countries.  At the same time, it stressed Bucharest's
 socialist links in declaring that Romania would continue to develop
 relations of "fraternal cooperation" with all socialist countries
 and in asserting that the participation of Romania and other
 socialist countries at the nonalined conference demonstrates the
 solidarity of socialist and Third World countries against
 'imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism."
