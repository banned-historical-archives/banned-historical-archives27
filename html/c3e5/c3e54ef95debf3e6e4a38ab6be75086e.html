	  	-	    	In  China,   	the  development  of  nuclear  weapons  responds  to  polstical  ends.    	China's
				leaders  are  bent  on  equipping  the  nation  with  the  indispensable  material  means  for
				ensuring   	its  national  independence  and  territorial  integrity.    	They  are  also
				making  clear  their   	reje~tion  of  the  nuclear  duopoly  that  enables  the  United  States
				and  the  USSR  to  impose  a  bipolar   	international  system.    	In  the  context  of  recent			    	-
				years--the  end  of   	the  1950's  and  beginning  of  the  1960's--this  bipolar  system
				signified  the  impossibility  of  a  national  reunification,   	since  the  American  zone			   	'
				of  influence  included  Taiwan.    	By  becoming  a"nuclear  power,"  China  delivered
				it~elf  from  Soviet  guardianship  and  protected  itself  from  an  American  aggression			   	'
				that  its  leaders  deemed  probable  at  the  time.l     	.
				China's  currently   	inverted  perception  of  these  threats  does  not  change  the  under-			   	-
				lying  principles  of  its  nuclear  power.    	But  the  qualitative  evolution  of  nuclear
				weapons  technology  is  eroding  its  "accession-emancipation"2  charactez.    	We  have  in
				mind,  of  course,   	the  advent  of  accurate  ballistic  weapons  systems  tt~at,   	by						,
				enabling  selective  attacks,   	tend  to  alter   	the  absolutist  nature  of  nucl.ear  deter-
				rence.
				Without  going  so  far  as  to  consider  it  from  the  standpoint  of  a  counterforces
				capability,   	and  even  assuming  it  remains  in  the  nature  of  a  deterren~  by  a  weaker
				power  against  the  stronger,   	it  appears  evident  to  us  nevertheless  that  China's
				nuclear  deterrent  capability  cannot  hope  to  maintain  its  credibility  in  the
				absence  of  certain  material  improvements.    	But  will  evolution  of  its  equipment				 	-
	  	=	    	alone  be  sufficient?    	Will  it  not  also  be  necessary  to  reconsider  certain  aspects
				of  its  use  which,   	in  our  opinion,   	still  includes  some  obscure  points?						  	'

			     	China's  personnel  withstands  comparison  at  the  international  level.    	:Sost  of  its
			     	experts  are  graduatQS  of  Western  universities,   	among  which  Caltech  and  MIT  pre-
			     	dominate.    	Some  of   	them  have  taught  in  those  universities  and  carried  on  research
			     	in   	them.
			     	In  accordance  with   	the  objectives  of   	the  Chinese  nuclear  program,   	these  experts		   	'
			     	pertain  to  three  disciplines:   	nuclear  physics,  of  course,  but  also  aeronautics  and
			     	automation.    	Well  known  figures  such  as  Qian  Sanqiang,  Qian  Weichang,  Qian  Xeusen,	     	~
			     	Wang  Gangchang  and  Zhou  Peiyuan  need  no  introduction  from  us;   	the  many  studies
			     	dealing  with   	the  Chinese  nuclear  potential  citP  them  frequently.3    	We  would  like
			     	to  point  out,  however,  two  reports  that  appeared  recently  in   	the  :.hinese  p::ess:
			     	--In  its  July  1978   	issue,   	LA  CHiNE  EN  CONSTRUCTION  published  a  highly  laudatory
			     	article  on  Wou  Tchong-houa,  director  of  the  Institute  of  Idechanics  of  the  Academy
			     	of  Sciences.    	In  1950,   	Wou  Tchong-houa  presented  a  theory  on  three-dimensional
		     	'		subsonic  and  supersonic  flows   	in   	turbojet  engines  a}   	an  annual  meeting  of  the
			     	American  Society  of  Mechanical  Engineers.    	This  theory  makes  it  possible  to  design
			     	high-pexformance  jet  engines.    	It  was  the  basis  for  the  design  of  the  Rolls  Royce
			     	Spey  engine  mounted  on  the  Trident  airliner  and  the  Phantom  F-4K;   	the  T-69  engine
		_		     	on  American   	radio-controlled  aircraft;   	and   	the  Boeing  747  engine;4
			     	--In  November  1978,   	the  NCNA  reported  the  admission  of  Wang  Daheng,   	director  of
			     	the  Institute  of  Precision  Optical  Apparatus  in  Changchun,   	into  the  Chinese
			     	Communist  Party.    	During  the  1960's,   	he  developed  the  first  Chinese  laser.5
			     	Research
			     	Ftesearch    	i.s   	carried   	aut   	throuah   	the   	Gombined   	efforts   	of   	three   	major   	sectors:
					the  Army,    	the   	Academy   	of   	Sciences,   	and   	certain   	ministries   	for   	the   	mechanical
					industries.     	Within   	tr~e   	PLA,   	three   	centers   	are   	involved   	in   	the   	nuclear.pro-
			     	grain:    	the   	Academy   	of   	,ilitary   	Sciences,    	the   	National   	Defense   	Commission   	on
			     	Science  and  Technology,   	and  certain  sections  of  the  Zone  of   	Interior  Services
			     	~epartment.    	Within  the  Academy  of  Sciences,  at  least  five  instituces  participate
					in   	the  research  effort:   	the  Institute  of  High-Atmospheric  Physics,   	the  Electronics
		-				institute,   	the  Institute  of  Automation,   	the  Institute  of  Nuclear  Energy,   	and  the
					Institute  of  Mec.hanics.
			     	Aside   	from  these  institutes,   	the  contributions  of  certain  highly  scientific  com-

		     	Nuclcac  Testing
				Since  1969,  China  has  carried  out  25  tests.a    	From  the  outs~t  of  each  test,  foreign
				observers  have  not  failed  to  express,  on  each  occasion,   	their  surprise  at  the
				level  of   	technical  expertise  the  Chinese  had  attained  in  the  short  in~ervening
				times.    	The  first  explnsion  was  characterized  by  two  major  features:   	the  use  of
				enriched  ur.aniunr235,   	which  ha~  necessitated  a  gaseous-diffusion  proce~ss  starting
				from  uranium-238,  marking  an  advance  over   	the  methods  that  had  been  ch-osen  by  the
				French  and  the  English~   	and  detonation  by   	implosion.    	The  second  tes+_,   	7  months   	.			 	.
				later,   	consisted  of  a  bomb  of  some  30  kilotons  dropped  from  a  TU-e.    	The  following
				year,   	the  Chinese  exploded  a  200-kiloton  bomb  dop~d  with  lithium-6  and  dropped			     	_
				from  a  TU-16.    	The  fcurth  test,   	5  months   	later,   	also  failed  to  pass  unnoticed:
				"The  experiment  was  unprecedented,   	since   	it  was  the  first  timf~  that  a  rocket  and
				the  warhead  it  is  desigz~ed  to  deliver  have  been  tested  simult~ineously."9    	Finally,
				in   	1967,   	a  3-megaton  thermonuclear  bomb  was  exploded  using  the  3  F  principle
			 	(fission-fusion-fission).    	On  this  occasion,  China  expitessed  its  welljearned  pride:
				"China  has  taken  only  2  years  and  8  months  between  the  expl~~sion  of   	its  first				 	-
				atomic  bomb  in  October   	1964  and  the  successful  test  of  its  l~ydrogen  bomb.    	To
				accomplish  the  same  thing  th2  United  States  7  years  and  4  mr.nths,   	the  Soviet  Union
				4  years,   	and  Great  Britain  4  years  and  7  months.    	Chin,3's  *ime  was  therefore~the
				world's  fastest."10    	This  experiment,   	however,   	appears  to  have  marked  an  apogee,
			 	following  which  China's  advances  began  to  slow  down,  particularly  as  regards  the
				development  of  missiles.    	Economic  xmperatives   	intervened  at  that  point,   	and
				China's  political  climate  over  the  last  decade  has  not  tended  to  produce  great
				economic  strides.    	But  let  us  beware  of  hasty  conclusions,   	for,   	since  19?E,  China's
			 	economy  and  its  sciences  have  followed  new  and  very  encouraqing  directions  in
			 	this  regard.

			     	these  proyrams  have  stagnated.    	Among  the  possible  clifferent  reasons,   	the  diffi-
			     	culties  encountered  by  the  Chinese  in  the  development  of  solid  fuels  may  have
     	~				played  an  essential  role.

     	j				NATIO'~ALF,11  P,   	i3erpaix  has  pointed  out  the  close  kinship  that  exists  between
			     	ba:listic  missiles  and  satellite  launchers,   	and  neither  the  United  States  nor  the
     	~				USSR,   	nor  China  now,   	can  ascape  that  common  kinship.    	In  September   	1973,   	it  was
     	~				learned   	that  China  had  tested  a  missile  with  a  5,600-km  range.    	Subsequently
			     	identified  as  the  CSS-3,   	it  sQrved  also  as  the  satellite  launcher   	for  China's
     	:				thir~,   	fourth  and   	fifth  spac:e  trials.    	F3ecause  of  its  range,   	the  CSS-3  represents
     	~				a  first  stage  in  C:hina's   	ICF3M  development  program.    	1975-1976  saw  the  start  of		    	-
     	;				experimentation  on  a  longer-range  missile:   	the  CSS-X-4.    	F.ccording  to  indications
     	�				by  Ren  Xinmin,   	director  of   	the  Chinese  Space  Institute,  while  visitinq  Japan  in
			     	1978,12   	this  missile,   	this  200-ton,   	iiquid-fuel  prorpl.led  missile  consists  of
     	1				three  stages  and  would  appear   	to  res~:mble  the  Tit~an-2  or  the  SS-9.    	Its   	range
     	~				appears   	to  be  10,0U0-11,000   	km.    	A  Japanese  source  attributes  to  it  an  explosive
     	;				force  of  1  megaton,l3
     	~
     	~				Two  experimental  launchings  of  the  CSS-X-4  took  place  in  1979.14    	Two  others  were
     	~				recently  carriec3  out  between  18  and  21  May  1980.    	But  not  until  the  Chinese  suc-
			     	ceed  in  developing  adequate  ~o~.id  propellants,15  will  their  program  experience  a
			     	substantial  advance.    	Sound  financial  considerations  evidently  keep  them  from
     	;				devoting  major   	resources  to  the  development  of  first-generation  ballistic  missiles.
			     	Reversal  of  threats  serves  their  pur~se  equally  well:   	Their  ICBM's  were  aimec]
     	~				specifically  at  the  United  States  while  the  USSR  is  witliin  range  of  their  TRBM's
			     	~Intermediate-Range  Ballistic  rlissiles~.												  	_
     	I
     	,				In  our  opinion,   	the  Spr:ing  1980   	tests  are  to  be  interpreted  in  four  ~vays.    	Frum
     	;				a  general  standpoint,   	the  Chinese  musti  maintain  their  research  potential.    	Con-
     	'				sidering  the  presence  of  observation  ships  in  the  planned  ~impact  zone,   	the  launch-
			     	ings  probably  had  to  do  wiL�h   	the  system  of  guidance  and  the  accuracy  of  the
			     	missile.    	Similarly,   	we  cannot  exclude  the  development  of  solid  propellants.    	And
     	~				lastly,   	these  tests  preceded  by  only  a  few  days  the  visit  of  Geng  Biao,   	chairman

		     	in-depth  study  by  Ti  Chung-heng,  which  appeared  in  the  April   	1977  issue  of
		    	MING-PAO  YACH-K'AN,   	indicated  that  tests  of  the   	"Han,"  beginning  in  1974,  had				 	I
		     	revealed  a  number  of  defects  such  that,   	currently,   	it  is  ~ften  berthed:  The
		     	nuclear  boiler   	is  not  yet  fully~tried  and   	tested,  and  tl~e  "Han"  cannot  be  taken
		     	to  its   	i�ntended  cruising  range.															     	~
		    	Thus,  China  has  encountered  at   	least  four  obstacles:  the  propulsion  problems  aust			  	_
		    	mentioned  in  the  case  of  the  "Han";   	the  advanced  technology  of  underwater  tele-
		     	communications;   	the  development  of  solid  fuels  or,   	strictly  speaking,   	stockable   	~
		     	liquid  fuels;   	and  mastery  of  the  techniques  of  cold  launches.    	If  China  seeks  to
		     	develop  an  SNLE  to  patrol  in  tr~:  vicinity  of  its  coasts,   	it  will  also  have  to  have
		-	     	an  SLBM  of  a  range  equivalent  to  that  of  the  American  Trident.    	The  technical
		     	difficulties  and  the   	financial  cost  of  such  a  project  place  it  out  of  China's
		     	reach,   	for   	the  time  being  at  least.    	If  China  set~les  for  an  SNLE  ~o  patrol  the
		     	Arctic  or   	the  Indian  Ocean,   	it  can  limit  the  range  o�  its  SLBM  to  that  of  an  IRBM.
																										 	i
		     	But   	in   	the  latter  case,   	the  operational  distance  away  from  the  Chinese  coasts				 	~
		     	raises  additional  problems.    	To  keep  two  submarines  on  continuous  patrol  would					~
		     	require,   	according   	to  a  study  by  E.   	Luttwak  presented  at  the  7th  Chinese-Amer~.can
		     	Conference  on  the  Chinese  Continent,  organized  at  Taipeh  under  the  auspices  of					I
		-	     	the  IIR  ~expansion  unknown~,l~  at  least  six  SLNE's  of  this  class;   	hence,   	a  far					i
		     	from  negligik,le  financial  burden.    	Telecommunications  kith  submarines  raises  other
		     	problems  as  well.    	In  principle,    	the  intensity  of  the  received  field  deereases
		     	exponentially  with  depth  and  varies  inversely  with  distance  from  the  transmitter
		     	and  with   	frequency   	;~-8  hence,   	the  advantages  of  very  long  wavelengths   	(VLF?   	~very
		     	low  fr~quencies~,   	subject,   	however,   	to  resolving  the  problem  of  adequately  high-
		     	powered   	transmitters,   	and  miniaturization  and  protection  of  antennas.    	Multi-   	~
		_	     	plicity  of  stations   	is  perhaps  a  solution  if  we  disregard  the  dissuasive  aspect
		     	of  financial  cost:   	The  United  States  has  10   	stations  it  can  use  for  its  submarines,
		     	and  the  USSR  9(4  in  Siberia,  3  in  European  ~Russia  and  2  on  the  Nor~h  Sea}.
		     	Lastly,   	in  the  inverse  direction,   	namely,   	transmissians  from  submarine.to~surface,
		     	the  Chinese  must  also  overcome  the  ri.sks  of  goniometric  location  of  emissions  and
		     	consequently  that  of  the  transmitting  submarine.    	By  way  of  information,  we  point
		     	out  that,   	in   	1967  and  1977,   	China  sent  some  oceanographic  research  ships  into  the
		     	Pacific  to  carry  out  various  tests,   	including  experiments  on  communications  to
		     	land,l9

		     	releases,  disregarding  its  possible  employments.    	Within  the  terms  of  this  defini-		     	~
		     	tion,   	certain  scientific  works  published  in  communist  China   	.are  indicative  of					t

     	~			 	If   	this   	is  so,   	the  slowdown  perceived  in  the  development  of  nuclear  weapons  would

     	;			 	the  future  needs  of  a  nation  bent  on  surpassing   	it-s  merely  regional  influence.
			     	To  the  extent   	the  latter   	needs  prevail,   	the  Chinese  leadership  could  sAt~le  for
     	,			 	a  minimai  security   	accompani.ed  by  a  more  flexible  policy  tow~xrc3  the  USSR.    	This

     	~
			     	In   	1957,   	a  high-ranking  Chinese  military  delegation  arrived  in  Moscow  to  take  part

			     	ponsible   	for  weapons  production,   	took  charge  of  nuclear  weapons.    	The  following
			     	month,   	an  Academy  of  Military  Sciences  was  opened  in  Peking.    	It  was  intended  to
			     	familiarize  the  higher-�level  cadres  of.the  PLA  with  the  problems~of  nuclear
			     	strategy.    	And   	surely   	in   	accordance  with  the   	1957  agreement,   	the  Soviets  began		   	-
			     	delivering  missiles   	to  the  PLA.    	The;~  were  no  doubt  short-range  missiles,2~
			     	probably  Frog- 1's.    	Tt~e  first  launch  trials  took  place  beginning  in  1959  at
			     	Qilianshan   	in   	Qinghai  and  at  Shuang-nhengzi  in  Gansu.

						--MRBM:   	30   	to  40  type  CSS-1   	(1,100  km  range);
						--IRBM:   	50   	to  70   	type  CSS-2/Sandal  SS-4  (1,.300-1,8t~0  km  range  dependnni~  on  warhead);.

				     	--80   	ta  90  Badger  TU-16  subsonic   	(cruising  range  2,500  km).
				     	According  to  tests  carried  out,25  the  missi.les  can  carry  2Q-kt  warheads,   	and  the
				     	Badger  TU-16  one  10-  to  200-ton  atomic  bomb  or  a  3-MT  thermonuclear  bomb.    	In  its
						"Handbook  on   	the  Chinese  Armed  Forces"  published  in  1976,   	the  AIA   	(Defense  Inte1-   	�
				     	ligence  Agency)   	of  the  United  States  estimates  that  the  CSS-2  uses  stockable
	     	_			 	liquid  propellant  and  can  deliver  a  2-  to  3-MT  yield.
				     	The  composition  of  its  tactical  nuclear  weapons   	is  less  known,   	but  they  probably
				     	include:
				     	a)   	Nuclear   	artillery  shells												    	.
				     	According   	ta   	Jane's,26   	China   	has  received  type  S-23  180-mm  shells  from  the  USSR.
				     	This  type  of  weapon  is  knecvn  for  its  ability  to  deliver  nuclear  yie~ds  of  1  to  5
				     	kt.										  	.
				     	b)   	SRBM
				     	Under   	the  1957  Sino-Soviet  agreement,   	the  US512  is  committed  to  furnish  SRBM's  to
				     	China.    	The   	type  of  missile  actually  furnished  is  unknown,   	but  the  Soviet  SRBM's
				     	in  service  at  that  time  were  the  Frog-1  and  Scud-A.    	CHUNG-KUO  YEN-CHIU  has
				     	mentioned  a  Chinese  SRBM  with  a  range  of  around  100  km,   	the  T-5.27
				     	c)   	Aircraft-deliverable  missiles:   	the  Qiang-5,  derived  from  the  Mig-19,   	is  capable
				     	of  delivering  a  tactical  nuclear  bomb.
				     	Operational  Capabilities
				     	We   	refer  here  to  the  theoretical  capability.    	The  CSS-1  could  reach  the  Soviet
				     	West;   	the  CSS-2,   	eastern  Asia  and  central  Asia;   	the  CSS-3,   	all  of  Asia,   	part  of
				     	ruropean  Russia,  Australia  and  part  of  the  Middle  East.    	The  CSS-9,  under  experi-
					~		mentation,   	could  reach  the  United  States.    	However,   	all  of  these  missiles  have  ~the
				     	disadvantage  of  being  liquid-propelled,  which  means  a  delay  of  several  hours  bet-
				     	ween   	the  decision  to  detonate  it  and  the  actual  firing.    	During  this  rather  long
	    	-				interval  exposed  to  the  open  air,   	these  missiles  offer  a  target  for  an  enemy

			   	In  sum,   	Chinese  missiles   	represent  only  an  anticity  capability.
			   	Uses
			   	Comparing  Chinese  public  statements  on  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons  with  certain
			   	passages   	in  GONGZUO  TONGXUN,   	�n   	internal  bulletin   	restricted  tc~  the  rather  high--
			    	level  r.a~res  of  the  APL,   	Jonathan  D.   	Pollac  suggests  the   	idea  of  a  sharp  disparity
			   	between  these  two  points   	of  view.29    	The  reference  materials  he  has  used  actually
			   	bear   	him  out.    	However,   	in  our   	opinion,   	he  has  compared   	sources  of  a  different
			   	nature  and,   	above  all,   	of  different  hierarchic  levels.    	The  public  statements   	.			   	-
			    	issue   	from  the  supreme  policy  body  charged  with   	defining   	the  overall  policy  guide-
			    	lines,   	whereas  those   	to  whome  GONGZUO  TONGXUN  is   	addressed  must  concern  thems~lves
			   	with  military  operations   	based  on  the~ce  guideline:.    	A  similar  distinction,  .gener-
	   	~		 	ally  speaking,   	is  found   	in  the  Soviet  Union  as  well,  between  doctrine  and  the  art
			   	of  war:   	Doctrine  sums  up  the  directives  of  the  Central  Committee  which  the  Army
			   	must  apply  within  the  terms  of   	reference  of  the   	military  arts.    	Under  ..these
			   	conditions,   	a  distinction  should  be  drawn  betwee~n  the  principle  and  its  ~modes  of
	   	-		 	use.
	   	-			Tt~e  Principle
			    	The  principle  emerges  fram  an  overall  strategy  that  is  at  one  and  the  same  time			   	_
			    	political,   	diplomatic,   	economic  and  military  in   	the  service  of  a  single  aim:   	to
			    	preserve  national  independence.     	In  accordance  with  this   	aim,   	Chinese  military
			    	doctrine   	is  essentially  defensive:    	Our  preparations  in   	anticipation  of  an  eventual
											  	?f  we�are  not  attacked   	we  will  not  attack�   	but  if
			    	war    	are   	entirely  defens'ive.						  	r						~
			    	we  are  attacked,  we  will   	counterattack.    	This  is   	our  con~istent,   	reasonable  and
			    	solemn  position."30    	This  statement,   	dating  back   	to  1971,  has  not  taken  on  any
			    	wrinkles:   	It  was  reaffirmed  during  China's  conflict  with  Vietnam  in  February  1979.
			    	It  defines   	the  principle  of  China's  eventual  use   	of  nuclear  weapons.    	On  16				   	`
			    	October   	1964,   	the  day  of   	its   	first  nuclear  test,   	the  Chinese  government  issuea  the		     	-
			    	fallowing  statement:																		   	.
			    	"The  development  of  nuclear  weapons  in  China  ensures  its  defense  and  the  protection
			    	of   	the  Chinese  people...    	On   	the  question  of  nuclear  weapons,   	China  will  never			     	-
			    	commit  the  error  3i  irresponsibility,   	nor  that  of   	irresolution.    	The  Chinese  people		   	-
			    	can   	be  believed."
			    	It  adds  to  this  its   	total  refusal  to  be  the  first  to  use  the  weapon:    	The  Chinese
			    	government  solemnly  declares   	that. at  no  time  and   	under  no  circumstances  will  China
			    	be   	the  first  to  use  nuclear  weapons."
			    	The  princ~.ple  governing   	the  use  of  nuclear  weapons  by  China  could  thus  be  summar-
			    	ized  as  follows:  For   	the  needs  of  its  aefense,  China  will  not  hesitate,   	in  case
			    	of  a  nuclear  aggression,   	to  respond  using  weapons  of  the  same  nature.

			   	The  Modes	  	�
  =				Before  addressing  the  modes,   	xt  seems  to  us  well  to  recall  some  general  nelevant
			   	conce~pts  defined  by  Mao  Zedong.
			   	1)   	war   	takes  on  a  class  character:   	"War,   	which  began  with  the  advent  of  private
			   	property  pertaining   	to  classes,   	is  the  supreme  f~rm  of  struggle  to  resolve,   	at  a
			   	given  point  in  their  deveZopment,   	the  cont~adictions  between  classes.    	If  one  does
   	_				not  understand  the  conditions  of  war,   	i~s  cliaracter,   	its   	relationship  to  other		   	~
			   	phenomena,   	one  does  not  know32he  laws  of  war,   	daes  not  know  how  to  conduct  it,  and
  -				is   	incapable  of  winning  it."															  	-
			   	2)It   	is  not  only  a  matter  of  winning  the  battle,  but  also  of  annihilating   	the
			   	aggressor:   	"The  blows  dealt  to  the  enemy  must  aim  to  annihilate  him;  otherwise,
			   	they  make  no  sense.33    	In  case  of  an  attack  on  the  enemy  and  to  the  extent  that		  	_
			   	conditions  enable  us  to  beat  him,   	our  party  will  automatically  take  the  position		 	_
			   	of   	legitimate  defense  to  annihilate  him  resolutely,   	radically,   	integrally  and
			   	totally."34    	Since  the  Peking   	leadership  bases   	itself  on  Marxism-I~eninism,  we  must
   	_			4		complete  the  first  of  these  statements  concerning   	the  class  character  of  war  with
			   	this  analysis,  by  Lenin,  of  international  relations:   	"The   	period   	of   	modern
			   	capitalism    	shows    	us    	that    	among    	capitalist    	groups    	there    	become_   	establyshed	    	_
			   	certain    	relationships    	based    	on    	an    	economic    	division    	of    	the    	world,    	and   	.
   	-				that  concurrently  and  consequently,   	among  political  groups,   	among  sta~es,   	there
			   	become  established  relationships  based  on  a   	territorial  division  of  the  world,  on
			   	a  struggle  for  colonies,  on  a  struggleforeconomic  territories."35    	In  sum,  only
			   	imperialism  yesterclay  and  socioimperialism  today  nurture  warlike  intentions  in   	.		 	-
			   	regard  to  China,   	not  to  control  a  territory,   	but  to  add  to~their.economic
			   	potential.
			   	Under   	the~e  conditions,   	the  Chinese  J.eadersh~ip  does  not  shrink  back  from  the
			   	principle  of  a  strategic  bombardm~nt,   	fully  aware  though  it  is  of  its  destructive
			   	effects.    	The  ultimate  aim  of  war  being  the  acquisition  of  an  economic  potential,
			   	the  reason  for  being  of  such  bombardment  is,   	in  their  view,  dim.    	Thus,   	the
			   	development  of  an  aggression  against  China  would  necessarily  end  up  in  conventional
   	_				type  confrontations:   	"Although  atomic  bombs  are  very  powerful,   	they  serve  onY~  to
   	-				destroy  the  centers  and  economic  reserves  of  the  enemy  during  the  strategic  bom-
			   	bardment  phase.    	Thereafter,   	they  serve  mainly  as  supporting  fire  in  preparation
   	-				for   	the  assault.    	In  any  case,   	armies  and  conventional  weapons  are  necessary  to
			   	finish  a  war,  destroy  the  enemy,  occupy  territories,.and  win  victory.    	To  count
			   	on   	armies  and  conventional  weapons  means  according  primacy  to  the  human  factor.~~36	    	-
			   	Furthermore,   	the  sparse  cancentration  of  Chinese  economic  objectives  would  lessen
			   	their   	vulnerability  in  case  of  strategic  bombardment:	    	Nuclear  weapons  are
			   	more  of  a  threat  to  imperialist  and  socioimperialist  countries,~whexe  industry  and
			   	populations  are  more~concentrated.    	Our  national  economy  has  agriculture  as  its
	 	'		  	base  and  industry  as  a  dominant  factor.    	A  policy  combining  industry  and  agricul-

			   	and  peacetime.work~.with.preparedness  for,war  fears  neither  modern  weapons  nor
			   	bombardments."37																		   	_
			   	In   	addition,   	a  sustained  policy  of  civil.  defense  was  put  into  operation  beginning
  ~		     	in   	1973.    	That  year,   	the  joint  editorial  of   	the  RENMIN  RIBAO,   	the  HONGQI  and  the		 	-

			 	This  text  dates  back  to  1961,   	a  Feriod  in  which  China  did  not  yet  have  nuclear			   	-
			 	weapons.    	In   	this  regard,   	it  should  be  noted  that  in  1958  there  appeared  in  China
			 	a  collection  of  studies  on  nucleaz  weapons:   	"Yuanzi  Wuqi  Lunwen  Ji."42    	It  was  the
			 	tranGlation  of  a  Soviet  treatise  published  in  1955,  dealing  with  the  followi~ng
			 	points:   	bases  of  nuclear  physics,  causes  of  the  destructive  effects  of  an  atomic
			 	war,   	aerial  bombardments  and  civil  defense.
			 	In  1961,   	the  units  of  the  PLA  on  a  regimental  level  and  above  received  instxuction
			 	not  only   	in  NBC  ~nuclear,   	bacteriological,   	chemical~  def ~nse  but  also  in  the
			 	principles  of  the  use  of  these  weapons.    	But  although  the  le~c3ers  of  the  P.L~
			 	sustain   	the  principle  of  a  nuclear  strike,   	such  an  eventuality  would  not  supeXVene

				 	Critical  Analysis
				 	These  prin~iples  and  moc7es  of  application  call,   	in  our  opinion,   	for  some  comments:
		-			 	1)   	The  Chinese  arguments   	in  scappc~rt  of  the  scarce  probability  of  strategic  bom-
				 	bardments  appears   	to  us  soundly  based.    	In  this  regard,   	one  cannot  avoid  linking
				 	them  with  the  slowdown  noted   	in   	the  ICBM,   	SNLE.and.SLHM  programs,   	since,.under		_
				 	these  conditions,   	the  latter  weapons  would  lose  their  priority  status,  at  least
     	-			 	for  the   	time  being.    	These  arguments  also   	recall  those  developed  by  Samuel  T.		     	_
				 	Cohen  and  by  Colonel  Geneste  in   	favor  of  a  nuclear  barrage.    	In  particul.ar,   	tT~e
				 	latter  writes:
						.    	Bombardment   	alone   	does   	not   	conquer;   	it   	only   	enables   	the   	conquest   	that		 	-
					must  be  effected  by  the  army  and  the  maintaining  of   	infantrymen  and  tanks  on  the
				 	objective."44
				 	However,   	in   	the  event  of  a  Soviet-Chinese  conflict,   	there  is  nothing  to  indicate
				 	that  the  USSR  would  follow  this   	reasoning.    	As  Alain  Besancon  has  so  wisely
				 	remarked:	    	purely  strategic   	reasoning   	is  sterile  if  it~~45  not  subjected  to
					political  reasoning.    	This  is  the  way  the  Soviets  proceed.					   	.
					Under   	these  conditions,   	although  the  USSR  may  be  interested  in  the  economic
					potential  of  Western  Europe,   	it  need  not  be  sparing  of  China  for   	the  same  reasons:	    	_
				 	"China  is  neither  controllable--too  vast--nor  exploitable--too  poor--nor  decisive
				 	in  the  overriding  socialism-versus -nonsocialism  conflict."46
					Besides,   	the  concept  of  Soviet  strategic  bombardments  with  coercive  aims  cannot  be
			   	'    	disregarded  as  long  as  the  credibility  of  a  Chinese  nuclear  deterrent  remains  in
				 	doubt.
				 	During  one  of  the  conferences  mentioned  above,  Edward  N.  Luttwak  @eveloped  a
				 	scenario  in   	the  following  sense.    	According  to  him,   	140  ss-20's  would  be  amply
				 	sufficient  for  a  counterforces  strike  on  200  Chinese  objectives  that  would  include
					China's  missile  sites,   	its  warhead  depots,   	and  its  principal  industrial  and
				 	scientific  centers.    	This  hypothesis  assumes  the  widest  dispersion  possible  of   	the
				,		Chinese  TU-16's.    	The  Soviet  attack  could  be  carried  out  in  two  waves  of  70
				J		SS-20's,   	each  delivering   	210   	independently  targeted,   	high-accuracy  warheads.
					E.   	Luttwak  also  remarks  that  the  Soviets  would  have  no  need  to  resort  to  their
			 	.		ICBM's.    	According  to  these  figures,  28  objectives  could  survive  the  i:irst  attack
				 	and  8  could  survive  the  second.     	In  the  event  Chinese  missiles  were  among  the
				 	survivors,   	no  rational  attitude  would  counsel  their  use:    	On  the  one  hand,   	no

				majc~r  Chinese  urban  center  would  have  been  destroyed  during  the  two  attacks;  on
				the  other  hand',   	the  Soviets  would  have  maintained  such  an  overk=ll  capability  that
				the  few  surviving  Chinese  missiles  would  inevitably  lose  their  significance.    	Thxs		     	-
				is  obviously  only  a  theoretical  scenario:   	It  describes  a  technical  possibility  ~ut
				does  not  integrate   	the  political  motivations  that  could  inc7uce   	the  Soviet  leader-

				2)   	`Phc~  tactical  use  of  Chinese  nuclear  weapons,   	for  example  to  stop  the  advance

				forces  that  would  oppose   	their  offensive:   	The  circular  error  of  the  SS-20  probably
				does  not  exceed  300  meters.    	This  capability  moreover  falls  under   	the  "preemptive"
				type  of  attacks   	in   	the  Soviet  "art  of  war"   	and  entails  another  consequence:  The

				the  start  of  the  conflict  and  limited   	its   	conventional  forces   	to  occupation  o~
				the  terrain  thus  neutralized.    	Thus,   	an  eventual  Soviet-Chinese  duel  would  subStan-		   	-
				tiate  the  situation  described  by  General~Galois:	    	The  gap  is  widening  between
	 	.	     	the  countries  equipped  with  mobile  nuclear  weapons--such  as  missile-launching
	 	=	     	submarines  and  very  long-range  bombers--and  those  that  rely  on  traditional  fozces.

				     	In   	the  Chinese  view,   	nuclear  forces  alone  will  not  suffice  to  win  a  war.    	Their
				    	use   	together  will  the  other   	forces  must  also  be  considered.   	~Generally  speaking,

				     	it  advocates  exploitatior,  of  the  enemy's  possible  weaknesses.    	The  advent  of
	  	_			  	nuclear  weapons  has  not  upset  these  hypotheses.
				     	Initially,   	the  atomic  bomb  was  consider~d  by  China  a  paper  tiger.,50    	But  the	 	~
				    	puerility  of  this  representation  masked  an  incisive  analysis  of  the  limits  being
				     	imposed  by  the  United  States,   	the  leading  aLomic  power  at  the  time,   	on  the  use
				    	of  nuclear  weapons.    	Without  entering   	into  detazl,   	we  believe  the  Chinese  leaders
				    	had,   	unlike  their  Soviet  counterparts,   	foreseen  the  passage  of  American  nuclear
				    	strategy  from  the  principle  of   	"massive  retaliation"  to  that  of  the   	"graduated
				    	response":   	The  Korean  war  revealed  that,   	despite  their  nuclear  superiority,   	the
				    	United  States  w3s  unable  either  to  prevent  a  conflict  from  erupt~.ng  or   	to  even
				    	resolve  it   	in  its  own  favor.51    	From  China's  vi.ewpoint,   	that  American  superiority
				    	concealed  an  exploitable  weakness.
				    	On  the  international   	level,   	Peking's  leaders  decided  to  depart  from  the  prudence
	   	_			 	of  the  Kremlin's  masters  and  posit  its~lf  as  the  champion  of  Third  world  revolu-
				    	tionary  movements.    	~rom  another  standpoint,   	in  thP~r  obsession  with  the  notion
	  	_			 	of  an  American  invasion,   	which.seemed  a  possibility  as  the  situation  evolved  in
				    	Indochina,   	the  top  leaders  of  the  PLA  drew  up,   	near  the  end  of  1960,   	a  new   	two-
				    	point  strategy:   	abandon   	the  concept  of  a  stopping  blow  at  its  borders  anc]  allow
				    	the   	invasion  forces  to  penetrate  deeply  into  Chinese  territory  until  ~they  bogged
	  	1			 	down;  press  contact  with  enemy  troops  so  that  their  command  would  not  be  tempted
				    	to  resort  to  nuclear  weapons.
				    	When  China  joined  the  atomic  club,   	its  military  doctrine  unde.rwent  no  concurrent
	 	~			 	change.    	Although  they  represented  two  extremes,   	the  principles  of  a~"peoples'
				    	war"  and  eventual  rec~urse  to  nuclear  weapons  appeared  complementary.    	A  peaples'
				    	war   	is  aimed  at  deterring  any  attempt  to  occupy  China  by  resorting  to  prolonged
				    	guerrilla  warfare,   	relying,   	in  principle,   	on   	the  support  of  the  popul~tion  as  a
				    	whole.    	For   	their  part,   	nuclear  weapons  would  safeguard  China  from  an  attack  by
				    	weapons  of   	the  sam~  nature.
				    	But  what  would  happen   	if  a  potential  aggressor  were  to  discard  this  preconceived
				    	scheme?    	If,   	for  example,   	instead  of  seeking   	to  occupy  China,   	he  were  to  limit
				    	himself  to  creating  an  accomplished  fact  in   	the  form  of  a  military  incursion  of
				    	brief  duration,   	limited  in  space,   	but  decisive  by  way  of  the  means  utilized.    	The
				    	fact  is  that  the  conquest  of  China  would  entail  more  disadvantages  than  any
				    	benefits  it  might  produce:   	vast  and  ~ensely  populated  as  it  is,   	its  occupation
				    	would  immobilize  such  immense  resources  as  to  divert  the  power  undertaking  this~

			   	Provisians  of  Soviet  Doctrine
			   	As   	far   	as  can  be  gleaned  from  Soviet  writings  on  the  subject,   	two  themes  dominate
			   	Soviet  military  doctrine.    	The  first   	is  none  other   	than  a  paraphrase  of  Clausewitz

			   	Leninism  on  War   	and  the  Army,"  p~blished  in  1976,   	a  group  of  Soviet  officers
			   	affirms:   	"It   	is  with   	the   	utmost  secrecy,  but  in  a  deliberate  manner  and  in
			   	accordance  with  a  plan  that  has  matured  over  a  period  of  many  years,   	indeed
			   	dr_cades,   	t~~at  the  exploiting  classes  prepare  their  wars  of  aggression,   	and  it  is
			   	with  equal  conscientiousness  that  their  governments  and  their  parties  unleash
			   	those  wars  when   	they  judge  the  moment  timely  and  most  advantageous."53
			   	The  fted  Army   	therefore  cannot  be  other  than  defensive.    	But  this  conception  of
			   	defense  goes  beyond  the  national  territorial  boundaries,   	as  Marshal  Gretchko's
			   	writings  perceive  it:   	"The  historic  function  of  the  Soviet  Armer3  Forces  is  not
			   	limited  solely  to  the  defense  of  the  motherland  and  the  other  socialist  countries.
			   	In   	its   	foreign  policy  activities,   	the  Soviet  state  actively  and  intentionally
			   	opposes    	the  exportation  of  counterrevolution  and  political  oppression�;  it  aids
			   	the  struggle   	for  national  liberation  and  resolutely  opposes  imperialist  aggression		     	-
			   	in  whatever  distant  region  of   	the  planet  it  may  manifest  itself."54
			   	Thus,   	we  could  one  day  see  the  Soviet  Armed  Forces  aiding   	"FUSNK"  ~Kitaii  National
			   	Salvation  FrontJ  to  "liberate"   	the  Chinese  people  from  the  "Maoist  dictatorship"		 	~
			   	being  sustained.  by   	"world  imperialism  and  reaction."
	   	_		 	'Objective  Reasons'   	for  an  Attack
			   	We  see   	three:   	the  "defense  of   	the  gains  achieved  by  socialism,"   	the  new  trend  of
			   	Chinese-American  relations,   	and  the  time  factor.
			   	The  Soviets  identify  their   	interests  with  those  of  socialism.    	Every  time  it  has
			   	become    	necessary,   	they  have  taken  the  required  measures   	to   	"safeguard  the  qains
			   	of  socialism."    	The  inhabitants  of  East  Berlin,  Budapest  and  Pragu~e  have  learned
			   	this  at  c~st   	to  them.    	The  vigor  of  the  Soviet  reaction  is  explained  by  their
			   	refusal  to  retreat  from  socialism.    	This  attitude  provides  an  understanding  of
			   	the  moderation  Moscow  has  shown  until  now  in  its  behavior  toward  the  Chinese.    	In

			     	'effect,   	without  overlooking   	in  the  background  some  of  its  national  aspects,   	the
    	~			 	Chinese-Soviet~eonflict  has  mainly  taken  the  form  of  divergences  over  determina-
					tion  of  the  international  communist  movement  line.    	And   	it  is  our  opinion  that
					as  long  as  the  disagreement  between   	the  two  countries  remains  on  an  essentially
					doctrinal  level   	the  Soviets  will  adjust  as  if   	to  the:lesser  of  possible  evils.
					On  t'+e  other  hand,   	they  would  certainly  modify  their   	attitude  if  the  Chinese  were
					to  abandon  the  doctrinal  character  of  their  grievances.    	Actually,   	Peking's
					current  behavior  lacks  clari.ty,   	and  its  references  to  the  "polar  bear"   	are  not
    	-			 	designed  to  reassure  Moscow.									   	,					.
					Moreover,   	the  new  trend  af  Chinese-American  relations  is  adding  to  Soviet  concerns.
					A  genuine  "Chinese  card"  psychosis  has  overtaken   	the  Soviets.    	In  November   	1978,
					Boris  Ponomarev  expressed  to  visiting  American  senators  his  concern  over   	certain
					impl.ications  in  the  normalization  of  Chinese-American  relations:	    	The  fact
					that  some  circles   	in  your  country  are  seeking  to  strengthen  Chinese-American  ties
					on  the  basis  of  anti-Sovietism  cannot  be  other  ttian  disturbing."55
					Far   	from  bringing  appeasement  into  the  situation,   	the.subsequent  unfolding  of
				,		events  exacerbated  the  fears  of  the  Soviets,   	who  were  already  tending  toward  a
					fear-of-the-besieged  complex.    	Sn  October   	1979,   	the  NEW  YORK  TIMES  revealed   	the
					existence  of  'a  study  ordered  by  the  Pentagon56  on  the  possibility  of  aiding  China
					to  defend  itself  in  the  event  of  a  large-scale  Soviet.  attack.    	In   	the  wake  of  the
    	-			 	Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan,   	and  less  than  2  months  after  requesting  it,   	China	     	_
			     	obtained  an  agreement  with  the  United  States  granting  i~t  most-favored-nation			 	-
					status,   	a  status  the  Soviets  have  been  seeking  for  years.
    	-			 	Time   	is   	the   	third   	reason.    	Certain   	circles   	in   	the   	USSR   	estimate   	that   	a   	mili-
					tary  incursion  into  China  beyond  the  latter  half  of  the  1980's  would  be  too  cost.ly
					in  relation  to  the  results  that  could  be  obtained.    	This  evaluation  takes  the
					following  form:							   	~
			     	--1976:  With   	the  death  of  Mao  Zedong,  the   	"Four"  were  eliminated.    	A  major  hin-  .
			     	drance  to  the  modernization  of  China  disappeared.
			     	--1977/1970:   	Political  and  economic  reorganization~with  the  return  of  Deng
			     	Xiaoping  to  power.
			     	--1978/1979:    	The  "New  Long  March"  commences.    	As  viewed  from  the  outside,   	the
     	_			 	results  appear  less  unsatisfactory  than  had  been  predicted.
			     	--1980/1985:   	If  development  continues  at  the  same  rate,   	the  1976-1985  10-year  plan
    	-			 	will  provide  a  solid  base  for   	the  realization  of  the   	"four  modernizations."
			     	Soviet  Concepts
			     	While  Soviet  doctrine  espouses  the  defensive,   	the  Sovaet  art  of  war,  on:the
			     	contrary,   	teaches  the  offensive  or,  more  exactly,   	the  preemptive  action.    	Despite

		     	conditions  most  favorable  to  the  obtaining  of  decision:   	superiority  anc~  the
		     	combined  use  of  all  necessary  means.
		     	Based  on   	the  three   	"objective  reasons"  we  have  just  set  forth,   	a  Soviet  preemptive
		     	action  agains  China  could  take  the  form  of  a"lesson"  or  of  a"surgical  strik~."
		     	These  two  types  of  action  could  also  be  brought  to  a  conclusion.
		     	The  masters  of  the  Kremlin  would  have  no  compunctions  about  displaying  their
		     	pedagogic  talents  if  the  evolution  of  Sino-American  relations  were  to  strengthen
		     	their   	"Chinese  card"  obsession.    	The  fact   	is  that  during   	the  next  5  years--a
    	-		 	period  in  which   	the  probabilities  of  a  S~viet  attack  against  China  seem  high--
		     	the  F+merican  nuclear  commitment  to  defend  Western  Europe   	will   	be   	problematicdl~   	,
		     	given  the  Euro-strategic  and  conventional  superiority  of  the  Soviets  and  the
		     	balance  between   	the  American  and  Sova.et  central  systems.    	Nevertheless,   	there  is
		     	an   	institutional  framewark  of  Atlantic  solidarity,   	a  framework   	that  is  absent  aS
		     	of  now  from  the  relations  between  the  two  Pacific  powers.    	A  preemptive  action
		     	would  demonstrate  to  the  Peking  leadership  f.he  illusory  nature  of  seeking  a  S~.no-
		     	American  convergence.
		     	The  5oviet  intent  to  undertake  a"surgical  strike"  against  the  Chinese  military-
		     	industrial  potential  is  not  new.    	It  was  expressed  in  1969,   	when  Soviet  military
		     	attaches  stationed   	in  Toicyo  and  Canberra  stated  it  to  their  American  counter-
		     	parts.57    	In   	the  context  of  that  period,   	they  could  have  been  seeking   	to  head  off
		     	the  start  of  a  Chinese-American  dialog.    	The  Americans,   	if  advised  of  the  Soviet
		     	threat   	hanging   	over   	China,   	could  conceivably  be  induced  to  make  such  demands
		     	as  would  discourage  the  Chinese.    	Cuzrently,   	the  danger  is  greater.    	In  April  1978,
		     	Hrezhnev's  presence  at  the  Red  Army's  large-scale~  manauvers   	in  Siberia  coincided
		     	with   	the  arrival  of  Sir  Neil  Cameron  in  China.    	On  both  sides,   	these  events
		     	assumed  a  symbolic  character  of  the  first  order:  Sir  Neil  Cameron  was  ii.~  fact  the
		     	first  chief  of  staff  of  the  army  of  a  member  of  the  integrated  NATO  command  to			    	_
		     	visit  China.    	It  turned  out,   	by  way  of  this  occasion,   	that  Great  Britain  was  the
		     	only  country,  among  several  that  had  been  approached,   	to  agree  to  supply  China
		     	with  reactors  capable  of  equipping  a  new  type  of  fighter  plane  being  developed.
		     	In  our  opinion,   	the  Soviet  warning  was  crystal  clear  and  unr.~istakable:   	The  US9R		    	~
		     	will  not  stand  by  without  reacting  toward  a  China  that,  even  as  it  draws  clos~x
		     	to  NATO,   	strengthens  its  own  rnilitary  potential.
		     	Fl.aws   	in   	the  Chinese  Doctrine
		     	Mao  zedong  developed   	the   	principles  of  the  "people's  war"  as  part  of  the  "war  of				-

			  	A  Failing  Doctrine
			  	In   	invading  Chi.na,  Japan  sought  a  colony.    	The  Japanese  presence  was  thus  intended
			  	to  assume.a  durable  character.    	Besides,   	geographical  constraints  compelled  the
			 	Japanese   	to  effect  their  penetration  from  East  to  West.    	The  Japanese  army  thus
			  	landed  on  Chinese   	territory  from  the  sea.    	In  doing  this,   	it~penetrated.into
 -				China's  overpopulated  area,  which  has  always  grouped  three  quarters  of  China's    	~
			 	population  in  23.5  percent  of  its  territory.    	This  populati~n  density  was  there-
			  	fore  capable  of  becoming  the  breeding  gYOUnd  necessary  to  the  pursuit  of  a"pro-	   	,
			  	longed  war,"     	But  ~his  was  all  in  theory.     	The  fact  is  that  the  Japanese  army		    	_
			 	never  lost  its  full  freedom  of  strategic  action  throughout  the  hostilities.
			 	Actually,   	the  zones  occupied  by  the  Chinese  communists  were  never  considered  a
			 	priority  by  the  Japanese.ss    	In  the  North,   	these  zones  were  either  contained  by
			  	the  general  line  of  the  Japanese  front  or  were  outside  the  main  railway  axes
			 	controlled  by  the  Japanese.    	In  central  China,   	the  Japanese  forces  virtually
			  	ignored  the  hinter.land.
			 	Be   	that  as  it  may,   	the  Soviets  would  enter  from  the  North,  descending  upon  the
			 	Manchurian  plain.    	They  would  thus  penetrate  a  very  sparsely  populated  region,   	if
			 	one  judges  from  the  following  densities:
		  	'		--43   	inhabitants  per  square  kilometer   	in  the  Heilong~iang  region:
			 	--90   	inhabitants  per  square  kilometer  in  the  Jilin  region;
			 	--215  inhabitants  per  square  kilometer  in  the  Liaoning  region.
 -				It  must  be  recalled  that  the  mean  national  density  is  297  inhabitants  per  square
			 	kilometer.    	Moreover,   	a"prolonged  war"  would  have  no  purpose  unless  the  caviets
			 	were  to  pursue  their  penetration.    	This  seems  very  unlikely.    	On  ~he  other  hand,
			 	the  Soviets  could  maintain  themselves  in  Manchuria  if  they  wanted  to.
			 	A  Geography  Favorable  to  the  Aggressor
			 	Geog~aphy   	favor~   	the  Soviet  designs.    	Let  us  consider  the  theater  of  operations.
			 	The  Sino-Soviet  frontier   	between  Vladivostok  and  the  Pamir  plateau  compares~in
  ~				length  with   	the  distance  between  Paris  and  Bombay,   	that  is,   	~,200   	kilometers.   	This
			 	gigantic  frent  is  divided,  however,   	into  three  sectors  of  approximately  equal				'
			 	lengths  but  sharply  different  geostrategically,  one  from  the  other:
			 	--the  western  sector,  made  up of  mountainous  rock  masses,  some  of  them  reaching
			 	altitudes  of  8,000  meters;
    	'		   	--the  central  sector,   	extending  over  sparsely  populated  regions  of  Mongolia,   	the	   	'
				Gobi  desert;
			 	--the  eastern  sector,   	comprising  the  coastal  provinces  of  Siberia  and  Manchuria,
    	,		   	which  present  a  terrain  that  is  sometimes  flat,   	sometimes  mammilated  with  groups
			 	of  inedium-sized,  easily  crossed  mountains.						'

		    	The  latter  sector   	is   	in   	northeastern  China,   	that  is,   	the  sparsely  populated  but			  	~
		    	Yiiqhly   	industrialized  Manchurian  plain.    	This  plain  lends  ~`.self   	admirably  to				 	j
		    	maneuvers  by  the  Soviet  large  armored  and  mechanized  units.    	These  are  curren�ly			  	~
		    	equipped  to  advance  75  kilometers  a  day  against  NATO  units.    	Against  the  PLA				  	j
		    	units,   	their  advance  would  be  even  more  rapid.    	They  have  a  sustained  combat  range		     	~
		    	af  thr~e  day~.    	Let  us  not  forget,   	also,   	that  since  1972,   	the  Soviets  have  been			    	i
		    	building  a  gigantic  logistical  complex  consisting  of  airports,   	supply  dumps,				   	'
		    	hospirals,   	roads,   	and  pipelines  to  sustain  an  eventual  military  incursion  into

		    	that  the  daubling  of  the  trans-Siberian  rail  line  will  be  comple ted  very  soon.					~
		    	Thus,   	the  Soviets  could,   	in  a  matter  of  a  few  days,   	take  over  an  essential  park  of		     	~
		    	China,   	without  even  penetrating  toward  the  inte~r�ior  of  the  country.    	To  carry  out			 	~
		    	a"lesson"  of  a  political  nature,   	they  would  need  merely  to  pursue   	their  advan~e			   	~
		    	on  Peking.										 	~											 	~
		    	To  prevent  thxs,   	the  PLA  would  have  to  be  able  to  stop  the  invasion  forces  at  the			 	~

		    	Conclusion
		    	There  are  numerous  indications  that  a  change  is  in  progress.    	The  extent  of  this
		    	evolution  can  be  assessed  from  the  decisions  taken  by  the  Military  Affairs  Com~
		    	mis~ion,   	and  especially  its  Bureau  of  Training  Manual  Revisions,   	in  1961.59    	Sub-
		     	jECC  to   	the  usual  cautions,   	the  following  passage  from  the  article  by  Marshal				  	-
		    	Xu  Xiangqian,   	published  in  HONGQI  on  the  occasion  of  the  51st  anniversary  of   	+tbe
		     	founding  of   	the  PLA   	(1  August  1978),   	appears  to  us  highly  significanfie   	"Marxism     	~		     	-
		'	    	will  not  stagnate,   	but  will  develop  as  practice  progresses.    	The  same  holds  tzu~
		     	for   	the   	theory  of  people's  war.    	It  will  advance  as  history  evolves;  modern  war
		     	differs   	from  the  ancient  in  many  respects.    	Our  enemy  has  experienced  major				     	-
		     	char,ges,   	and  our  own  country  is  very  different  from  what  it  was.    	This  requires
		     	that  we   	link  more  closely  the  theory  of  people's  war  enunciated  by  President  Mao
		     	with  the  new  historic  conditions,   	that  we  study  the  new  characteristics  and  the  .
		     	laws  of   	that  war,   	and  that  we   	intensi~y  our  preparations  in  all  domains
		     	Defending  ourselves  actively  and  drawing  the  the~er,emy  deep  within  our  territqcy
		     	are  the   	fundamental  strategic  principles  that  will  enable  us  to  win.
		     	Drawing   	the  enemy  deep  within  our  territory  does  not  mean  allowing  him  to  go  where
		     	he  wishes,   	but  rather  constraining  him  to  expose  himself  to  our   	blows.    	We  must
		-	    	concentrate  powerful  defenses  at  a  few  key  points  to  prevent  penetration  by  thP
		     	enemy  and  to  lead  him  to  the  battlefield  we  will  have  prepared,   	to  annihilate

		     	The  Fact  is  that  China's  perception  of  the  source  c+f  its  dangers  has  changed~from

				  	development  of  mobile  reprisal  weapons  capable  of  escaping  a  preemptive  strike
				  	or,   	at  least,  of  minimizing   	its  effects.    	With  this  technical  constraint  as  a  point
				  	of  departurP,  we  could  consider  a  two-phase  approach:   	for   	the  short  term,  gain  time	   	_
				  	by  developing  a  minimal  deterrent  based  on  present  capabilities;   	favor  the  long		   	-
				  	term  by  preparing,   	starting  now,   	the  design  of  new  generations  of  weapons.
				  	The  first  phase  hinges  on  polit'ical  action.    	In  recent  years,   	Chinese  leaders  shown
				  	shown  alarm  over   	the  inevitability  of  a  new  world  war,   	as  when,   	at  the  23d  session
				  	of   	the  UN  General  Assembly   	(28  September   	1978),  Huang  Hua  applied.heavy  shading  to
				  	this  view.    	Huang  Hua  went  even  further   	to  stress  China's  peaceful  aspirations:
				  	"Step  by  step,   	as   	the  rivalry  between  the  two  superpowers   	intensifies  and  planetary
				  	strategic  deployments  of  social-imperialism  spread,   	local  wars  are  becoming  more
				  	numerous  and  the  danger  of  worlc3  war  is   	increasing.    	To  delay  the  start  of  this
				  	world  war   	and  mainkain   	international  peace  represents  at  this  very  moment  an			  	-
				  	important   	task  for  the  peoples  af   	the  different  countries		 	The  Chinese  people
				  	ardently  desire  peace  and  oppose  all  that  is  leading  to  a  new  world  war.    	Besides,
				  	we  need  an  international  situation  of  peace  over  a  long  period,   	to  rebuild  our
				  	country."bl
				  	These   	statements  were  reiterated  some  days  later  by  Hua  Guofeng   	in  his  speech  for
				  	the  1  October  national   	feast  day.    	Despite  their  general  character,   	they  appear		   	-
				  	to  be  addressed  particularly  to  the  USSR.    	In  the  c::rrent  evolution  of  the  Sino-
				  	Soviet  conflict,   	the  turn  being  taken  by  the  China-United  States-USSR  triangular		  	_
				  	relationships  is  proving  dangerous.    	Although  the  United  States  occupies  the
				  	privileged  position  of  arbiter,   	the  rigidity  of  Sino-Soviet  relations   	induces  an
				  	escalation   	in  the  systematic  search  for   	reciprocal  checks  and  balances  that  could
				  	accidentally  result  in  a  war.    	Also,   	al.though  we  have  spcken  at  length  of  the
				  	Soviet  threat  perceived  by  China,   	let  us  not  forget  that  the  Soviets,   	for  their
				  	part,   	feel  threa'�,ened  by  the  objective  rapprochement  that  has  developed  amonc~
				  	China,   	the  United  States  and  Japan.    	Thus,   	China,   	by  maintaining  a  certain  dialog
				  	with  the  USSR,   	is  tryino  to  minimize  the  dangers  of  armed  confrontations.
				  	The  fact  is  that  China's  military  doctrine  is  currently  inadequate,   	for�China
				  	does  not  have  the  means  to  back  its  policy.    	As  regards  the  long  term,   	the  Peking
				  	leadership  is  counting  heavily  on  the  development  of  ineans  to  strengthen  the
				  	credibility  of  China's  nuclear  deterrent  capability.    	Although  it  is  still  too
				  	early   	to  judge,   	we  can  at  least  discern  its   	intention   	in  this  regard  as  reflected
				  	in  this  statement  by  Su  Yu  on  the  occasion  of  the  SOth  anniversary  of  the  �ounding
				  	of  the  PLA:   	"We  have  decided  to  constantly  improve  our  weapons  and  equipment  and,		'
				  	through  our  own  efforts,   	to  possess  the  same  weaponry  that  our  enemies  have,
				  	indeed  to   	invent  new  weapons."62
				  	As  regards   	these  new  weapons,   	two  trends  may  actually  be.taking  shape.    	The  first
				  	would  be  bearing  on  the  development  of  enhanced-radiation  weapons,   	as  we  have
				  	already  mentioned.    	in  our  opinion,   	because  of  their  nature  and  possible  uses,	  	~
				  	this  type  of  weapons  would  be  extremely  well  sui.ted  to  an  essentially  defensive		   	_
				  	doctrine  as   	is  that  of  the  "people's  war."    	However,  we  are  aware  of  certain
				  	limitations:   	the  very  small  area  covered  by  each  weapon  would  necessitate  a  large
	  	,				stock  of  them  so  that  their  action  would  not  result  marginal  and  lack  decisive
			  	~		effects  on  the  battle;63    	the  risk  of  remote  disarmament  would  also,   	for  that
