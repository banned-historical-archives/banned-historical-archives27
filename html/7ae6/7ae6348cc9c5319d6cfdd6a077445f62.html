			    	[Excerptsl    	The  political  role  of  specialists  on  the  USSR  witfiin  the  U.S.   	govern-
			    	ment  machinery  has  increased  significantly  in  recent  years.    	Richard  Pipes,  the
			    	author  of  a  number  of  works  on  the  history  of  Russia  and  the  USSR,  has  risen
			    	to  the  fairly  high  posit~on  of aide  to  the  U.S.  National  Security  Council.    	His
			    	political  posture  as  a    	vehement  anticommunist  from  the  academic  world"  is
  -			  	familiar  to  a  broad  range  of  Soviet  people  from  numerous  publications  tn  the
			    	Soviet  press.    	Historians  also  have  on  numerous  occasions  been  forced  to  refute
			    	Pipes'  at~empts  to  "rewrI.te"  history,  wfiether  it  was  the  problems  of  formation
			    	of  the  USSR,   	the  origin  of  the  Saint  Petersburg  Union  of  Struggle  for  the  Liber-
			    	ation  of  the  Working  Class,   	the  t:istory  of  the  early  period  of  the  Russian
			    	social  democratic  movement,   	or  the  problems  of  the  Soviet  and  Russian  intelli-
			    	gentsia.    	The  present  article  is  concerned  with  tfie  question:    	What  kind  of
			    	historian  of  our  country  is  Pipes,   	and  wliat  are  fiis  views  on  tfie  problems  he
			    	cor.siders?
			    	Pipes'   	frank  and  hostile  anti-Sovietism  permeates  his  statements  on  issues  of
			    	USSR  foreign  policy.    	This  vehement  anti-Soviet  is  truly  at  home  in  this  area.
			    	The  author  began  dealing  with  these  problems  in  the  early  1970~s.    	At  that
			    	time  he  was  a  professor  emeritus  at  Harvard  University  and  director  of  the
			    	Russian  Research  Center.    	In  the  United  States  fie  was  considered  a"prominent
			    	specialist"  on  Russian  history.    	The  scholar's  academic  position  and  reputa-
			    	tion  were  subordinated  to  the  ob~ectives  of  vigc=rous  political  activity  and
		    	~	 	backing  up  those  circles  who  weze  not  pleased  By  tfie  processes  o.f.  detente  that
			    	appeared  in  the  early  1970's,  who  needed  to  incite  anti-Sovietism,   	spur  an  the
			    	arms  race,   	and  build  up  fear  of  "communist  aggression."   	Pipes  became  a  very
			    	active  spokesmar.  for  the  "anti-detente"  school.    	Since  the  early  1970''s  Pipes
			    	has  appeared  more  and  more  often  in  popular,   	far  from  academic,  publications
			     	(army  publications,   	ultraright  publications,   	and  publications  directly  linked
			     	to  special  services).65    	As  an  "expert"  he  takes  pa~rt  in  committee  work  of
			     	the  U.S.   	Congress,65  attiaclcs  the  policy  of  detente  violently,   	and  fights  for
  -			  	a  hard  line  toward  the  Soviet  Union  (the  Soviet  press  has  already  pointed  this
			    	out).

										  	FOR  OFFiCIAL  USE  ONLY
			  	In  this  cycle  of  publications  by  Pipes  a  large  number  of  concrete  issues,
			  	both  large  and  small,   	concerning  the  international  situation,  military  aspects
			  	of  detente,  and  Soviet  foreign  policy  fiave  been  toucfied  in  passing.
			  	The  position  of  the  professional  anti-Soviet  was  influenced  b~tfi  ~j~  tfie  general
			  	situation  in  the  wor13  a~xd  by  the  situation  in  Sovietology  circles  involved
			  	with  issues  of  Soviet  foreign  policy.    	It  is  comnon  knowledge  tfiat in  this  area,
			  	in  particular  the  question  of  tfie  :;rigin  of  the  supposed  aggressiveness  of  the
			  	Soviet  Union  (which  is  greatly  exaggerated  in  the  United  States),   	two  primary
	   	'	     	schools  exist  and  compete  with  one  another.    	The  follower~  of  one  emphasize
			  	the  "national"  aspect   	("Russian"  motifs),  while  the  others  stress     	the
			  	"communist"  principle.66    	The  debate  between  tTiem  somet~mes  becomes  quite  Tait-
			   	ter.    	It  was  that  way,   	in  particular,   	ir,  the  early  1950's,  at  the  heigfit  of  the
			   	"cold  war,"  when  Pipes'   	teacher  M.  Karpovich  was  drawn  into  the  battle.67
			  	A  dispute  arose  on  these   	same  problems  in  relation  to  Piges'   	foreign  polt.cy
			  	views.68    	It  is  perfectly  obvious  that  he  is  inclined  to  the  "nationalistic"
			  	version,   	employing  the  following  initial  criteria:    	"Russian  foreign  policy~,"
			   	"Russian  traditions,"  "Russian  history,"  "Russian  national  character,"  and  so
			   	on.    	But  Pipes  also  demonstrates  an  ability  to  dodge  and  use  conflicting  evalu-
			   	ations.69    	Pipes'   	"nationalistic"  premise  i~  ill-founded  if  for  no  other  reason
			   	than  that  the  history  of  Russia  is  the  hist'ory  of  a  country  uf  multiple  na-
			   	tionaliti~~s.    	Limiting  himself  to  the  sphere  of  the  ruling  circles  and  th.eir
			   	ideology,  Pipes  ignores  the  true  creators  of  Russian  history,   	the  popular
			   	masses,   	the  struggle  of  the  working  classes,  and  tfie  struggle  of  the  people  for
			   	freedom,  people's  power,   	social  justice,  and  the  like.    	In  general,  he  does
			   	not  see  the  history  of  the  people,  of  the  "lower  orders."
			   	The  same  thing  should  also  be  said  about  Pipes~   	emphasis.  on  tfie  historical  roots
			   	of  Soviet  foreign  policy.    	"The  roots  of  the  Soviet  regime  go  deep  into  Russian
			   	history,   	especially  the  history  of  the  era  before  Peter,"  he  emphasized  in
			   	statemPnts  before  the  sp ecial  U.S.   	Senate  Committee  on  SALT,  while  starkly
			   	contrasting  Russia  to  the  west.    	In  this  way  he  constructs  analogies  between
			   	the  foreign  policy  of  Tsarism  and  the  policies  of  the  Soviet  Union.
			   	If  we  attempt  to  define   	the  methodological   	~redo  of  Pipes  in  one  word,   	it  is
 i			 	anti-historicism.    	Fipes'   	schemes  and  anaolgies  flagrantly  distort  historical
			   	reality.    	He  resolutely  re~ects  the  idea  that  tfie  October  Revolution  and  the
			   	Soviet  order  broke  with  the  traditions  of  old  Russia,   	and  tTie  idea  that  the
			   	legacy  of  the  autocracy  cannot  be  applied  as  a  key  to  interpreting  modern  times.
			   	In  general  he  sees  no  difference  at  all  between  old  Russia  and  the  Soviet  Union.
			   	"I  believe  that  this  idea  is  incorrect,r71  he  writes  about  Che  famous  statement
			   	from  the  "Manifesto  of  the  Communist  Party,"  whicfi  characterizes  socialist
  -			 	revolution  as  the  "most  decisive  break"  with  the  past.72    	Soviet  historians  have
			   	pointed  out  the  anti-historical,   	anti-scientific  nature  of  such  parallels,  which
			   	are  very  widespread  in  bourgeois  historiography,  many  times.73    	The  fact   	that
			   	Pipes   	"believes"  in  the  succession  of  traditions  betw~een  old  Russia  and  the
			   	Soviet  Union  does  not  change  the  real  state  of  affairs.    	The  foreign  policy  of
			   	a  particular  state  is  determined  by  its  social  order.    	Our  pol.icy  is  a  policy
			   	of  peace  and  securing  conditions  for  building  communism.

			  	Here  is  a  typical  example.    	The  title  of  one  of  Pipest  articles  speaks  for  it-
			  	self:    	"Why  does  the  Soviet  Union  tT:ink  that  it  can  wage  and  win  a  nuclear  war?"
			   	(It  is  remarkable  how  this  echoes  tlte  inte.rests  of  tfie  present  U.S.  Admin~s-
			   	tra:ion.)    	Pipes'   	reasoning  is  based  on  the  same  pseudohis~orical  analogies
			  	mixed  with  distorred  figures  on  the  Soviet  armed  forces.    	These  fabrications
			  	h~ve  been  solidly  refuted  from  the  Soviet  side.    	In  interview~  with  the  news-
			  	paper  PRAVDA  and  later  the  magazine  DER  SPIEGEL,  and  during  tiis  visit  to  West
			   	Germany,   	L,   	I.  Brezhnev  stated  clearly  and  unambiguouslyq   	as  did  D.  F.  Ustino~v
			   	in  his  report  devoted  to  the  64th  ar:niversary  of  ~i~at  October,  that  the  Soviet
			   	Union  resolutely  opposes  nuclQar  war,   	~lobal  or  limited,  and  views  such  a  mili-
  ~			 	tary  clash  Involving  the  use  of  n;~clear  weapons  as  a  catastropf~e  for  the  human
			   	race  in  which  there  could  be  r~o  winners  and  losers.74    	The  inhumane  cfiaracter
			   	of  statements  about  the  possibility  of  nuclear  war  under  contemporary  condi-
  ~			 	tions  was  emphasized  with  complete  su6stantiation.
			   	Pipes  addresses  his  "studies"  in  the  field  of  Soviet  foreign  policy  to  influ-
			   	ential  circles  in  Washington.    	He  aspires  to  the  role  of  inen~tor.    	He  cai.led
			   	one  of  his  statements  a"crash  course  in  applied  Russian  history  for  those  who
			   	make  policp.r75    	PipeS'   	irresponsibility  is  boundless.    	He  bases  his  foreign
			   	policy  assessments  and  conclusions  on  semianecdotal  statements,   	foolish  aphor-
			   	isms,   	bare  statements,  and  d~.~rect  fabrications.    	Anti-Sovtetism  is  the  foundation
			   	of  all  his  advice  and  recommendations.    	Pipes'~"methodology,"  as  we  fiave  seen,
			   	offers  the  broadest  opportunity  for  fabrications  and  distortions.    	He  exhorts
			   	the  members  of  the  SALT  subcomn~ittee  to  believe  that  the  Russians,  supposedly
			   	because  of  their  national  characteristics,  have  a  general,  historically  inbred
			   	"aggressi�:~n~ss,i76  and  that  the  Soviet  leadershtp  is  trying  to  establisii  the
			   	"communist  world"  by  force.~~    	In  his  blindness  Pipes  declares  that  the  Soviet
			   	order  is  "illegal,i78  and  not  jLSt  in  the  historical  sense  but  even  in  the
			   	legal  sense.    	His  statement  that  "the  Soviet  population  on  the  whole  lives
			   	werse  than  it  did  under  Tsarism  and  in  the  early  1920's"  is  equally  bare  and
			   	unfounded.79    	He  ia  a  professional  anti-Sc.viet,  and  a  pseudoscholarly  one.
  ~				Pipes  ignores   	th�a  ~axpress~on  of  rhe  will  of  Soviet  people  and  vast  statistical
			   	data  that  testifies  to  a  rise  in  the  standard  of  living  of  Soviet  people,

		     	[Text]    	The  petty  bourgeois  counter-revolution  in  China  and  the  degeneration  of
		    	the  PRC  into  an  aggressive  social  chauvinistic  state  and  an  accomplice  of  imperial-
		    	ism  and  raaction  is  one  of  the  most  tragic  events  of  our  day.    	In  its  time  the  for-
		    	mation  of  the  PR~  was  greeted  ecstatically  by  communists  and  by  the  progressive
		    	forces  of   	the  entire  world.    	It  had  completed  a  long  revolutionary  process  in  the
		    	country,   	and  many  years  of  stubborn  struggle  against  foreign  imperialism  and
		    	domestic  reaction.    	The  defeat  and  expulsion  by  the  Soviet  Army  of  the  Japanese
		    	interventionists  from  M~anchuria  made  it  possible  for  the  democratic  forces  of
		    	China,   	led  by  the  coumiunists,   	to  create  a  solid  revolutionary  base  with  USSR
		    	assistance  in  the  Northeast  of  the  country.    	From  here  a  powerful  offensive  by
		     	the  revolutionary  armnies  was  deployed  which  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  reaction.ary
		    	Kuomingtang  regime  that  was  supported  by  American  imperialism  and  to  the  estab-
		    	lishment  of  people's  power  on  the  entire  territory  of  the  country,  with  the  ex-
		    	ception  of  the  province  of  Taiwan  and  several  coastal  islands  where,  with  United

		    	The  process  of  the  creation  in  China  of  a::~w  statehood  and  of  a  popular  democratic
		    	regime  could  have  been  substantially  iacilitated  by  the  existence  among  the			 	~
		    	Chinese  communists  of  many  years  of  experience  in  the  construction  of  people's
		    	power  and,   	especially,  by  the  possibility  of  making  use  of  the  comprehensive~
		    	experience  of.  the  advanced  socialist  countries  and,  first  of  all,  of  the  Soviet
		    	Union.    	Unfortunately,   	the  Chinese  people  did  not  succeed  in  making  full  use  of
		     	the  experience  of  world  socialism  because  at  the  end  of  the  1950's  Mao    	Zedong's
		    	nationalistic  line  predominated  in  the  Chinese  l~adership.    	As  for  the  ueilization
		    	of  the  experience  of  the  liber ated   	areas  of  Chinafl  it  received  a  very  one-sided

		     	and  other  public  organizations,  and  in  a  number  of  legislative  and  other  normative
		     	acts.    	However,  by  themselves  those  institutions  were  not  able  to  effectively
		     	oppose  the  "cultural  revolution"  which  was  carried  out  by  the  extremist  wing  of  the
 -		    	Chinese  leadership  headed  by  Mao  Zedong  and  which  subordinated  the  armed  forces  to
		     	itself.    	This  revolutionary  change  was  possible  because  of  a  special  position  of
		     	the  army  in  Chinese  society  and  in  the  Ct-,inese  state.
		     	In  China,   	the  army  is  not  merely  a  part  of  the  state  apparatus,  along,  for  exam~le,
		     	with  administrative  agencies,   	the  courts,   	and  so  forth,  but  the  officially  de-
		     	clared  basis  of  the  state.    	The  army  was  long  ago  declared  to  be  a  mode~  for  all
		     	of  society  which  is:steadily  being  militarized.    	This  position  of  the  army  is
		~			partially  connected  with  its  special  role  in  the  Chinese  revolution:    	During  the
		     	course  of  the  long  struggle  of  the  armed  revolution  with  the  armed  counter-
		     	revolution,   	the  revolutionary  army  frequent~.y  became  the  creator  of  party  and  publie
		     	organizations  and  of  agencies  of  people's  power.    	A  c~ntralized  army  organization
		     	of  the  revolutionary    	forces  arose  much  earlier  than  the  centralized  state  system.
		     	Beginning  with  the  middle  of  the  1930's  the  top  leadership  of  the  CCP  ccincided
		     	in  personnel  with  the  co~and  and  political  leadership  of  the  army.    	The  Military
		     	Council   	(Military  Commission)  of  the  CC  of  the  CCP  occupied  the  position  of  the
	     	'		leading  body  in  the  party  hierarchy.l    	In  addition,   	the  position  of  the  army  in
		     	China  was  influenced  by   	the  militarist  tradi::ions  of  the  past,   	a  fact  which  has
		     	been  admitted  by  the  leaders  of  the  CCP  themselves.    	[1]    	But  all  of  this  in  and
		     	of  itself  did  not  yet  predetermine  the  preservation  of  the  traditions  of  mili-
		     	tarization  in  the  administration  of  the  country  anci  in  its  life,   	including  the
		     	army's  special  position  in  the  state.    	The  pr.eservation  of  the  special  position  of
  '		    	the  army  was  a  matter  of  interest,   	above  all,   	for  Mao  Zedong  who,  like  almos.t  every
		     	petty  liourgeois  political  leader,   	gravitated  toward  military  methods  of  the  admin-
		     	istration  of  the  state  and  society.    	The  "cultural  revolution"  was  a  st.izure  of
		     	power  in  the  country  by  the  most  extremist  and  chauvinist  wing  of  the  Chinese
		     	leadership  which  intended  to  make  use  of  the  enormous  organizational  and
		     	mobilization  possibilities  of  the  new  system  for  the  historically  most  rapid
 _		   	achievement  of  hegemonist  Great    	Han  ends.    	As  a  result  of  the  "cultural  revolu-
		     	tion,"  popular  democracy  in  China  was  in  fact  eliminated  as  a  political  regime  and
		     	replaced  by  a  military  democratic  dictatorship  of  the  social  chauvinistic  Mao
		     	Zedong  group.
		     	At  the  same  time,   	it   	should  be  noted  that  the  "cultural  revolution"  was  not  a  one-
		     	time  act,  but  the  completion  of  a  process  of  the  seizure  of  power  by  the  above-
		     	named  group.    	The  process  itself  which  reflected  the  struggle  of  two  lines  in  the
		     	leadership  of  the  CCP  had  begun  at  the  end  of  the  1950's,  but  its  prehistory  goes
		     	back  to  the  1930's  when  Mao  Zedong  and  his  minions  succeeded  in  striking  the  first
 -		    	serious  blow  against  the  party's  internationalist  forces.    	After  the  formation  of
		     	the  CCP  Gao  Gang  was  removed  from  office  and  then  killed,   	and  this  was  followed
  -		   	by  a  campaign  of  the  slaughter  of  cadres  in  connection  with  the  struggle  against
		     	the  "anti-party  bloc  of  Gao  Gang-Rao,Shushi"   	(1953),   	the  campaign  of  struggle
		     	a~ainst  the  so-called  right-wing  bourgeois  elements   	(1957),  and  the  punishment  of
		     	Peng  Dehua,   	Zhang  Wentian,  and  others   	(1959).    	As  a  result,   	the  internationalist
		     	forces  in  the  CCP  were  greatly  weakened.										     	�

		    	During  the  noisy  politi~al  campaigns  which  followed  one  after  another  and  which
		    	were  accompanied  by  mass  repressia*?s,   	the  Maoists  in  practice  had  demonstrated
		     	their  hostility  to  the  real  power  of  the  people,   	their  distrust  in  its  creative
		    	abilities  and  initiative  and  energy,  and  an  open  fear  of  the  people's  will.    	Be-
		     	ginning  with  the  end  of  the  1950's   	th~ere  began  to  grow  bureaucratic  distortions
		     	in  the  state  and  party  apparatus  of  the  PRC  which  were  expressed  in  an  endeavor
		     	to  militarize  state  and  social  life,   	to  create  a  single  hierarchical  apparatus  for
		     	the  administration  of  state  and  society,  nullify  the  role  of  representative
		    	bodies,   	emasculate  the  law,   	discredit  the  experience  of  the  construction  of  social-
		     	ism  in  the  USSR  and  other  socialist  countries,   	and  so  fo~th.    	At  the  same  time,
		    	although  they  were  subjected  to  strong  distortion,   	formally  the  basic  political
		     	institutions  of  the  PRC  were  preserved  and  could  be  used  by  forces  in  opposition
  =		   	to  Mao  Zedong.
		    	This  became  especially  clear  when  Mao  Zedong  entered  into  conflict  with  Liu				~
		     	Shaoqi  and  Deng  Xiaoping  ~ho  were  trying  to  carry  out  a  great  power  policy  without
		     	the  crazy  ideas  characteristic  of  Mao  Zedong  of  the  type  of  the  failed  "Great
		    	Leap  Forward"   	(1958-1959z  and  with  the  use  of  rational  methods  of  administration
		     	and  economic  management.~    	Most  of  the  cadres  of  the  local  and  central  apparatus
		     	of  the  state,  party,  and  public  organizations  were  on  the  side  of  these  leaaers.
		     	Seeing  that  the  real  power  was  slipping  out  of  his  hands,  Mao,Zedong  at  the  head
		     	of  a  group  of  close  associates  resorted  to  a  monstrous  action--the  scrapping  of
		     	the  constitutional  bodies  of  the  state  and  the  charter  bodies  of  the  CCP  ar~d  of
		     	public  organizations.    	This  scrapping  was  carried  out  by  "support  troops  of  the
		     	leftists"  who  had  been  worked  over  psychol~gically  in  the  Maoist  spirit  and  youth
		     	shock  detachments  of  pupils  which  had  been  created  outside  of  the  framework  of
		     	the  party  and  Komsomol,  by  young  workers  and  employees--the  Hongweibing   	("Red
		     	Guards")--who  had  been  corrupted  under  the  influence  of  Maoist  prupaganda  and
		     	detachments  of  the  Tiaofan   	("Rebels")  which  joined  them  at  the  end  of  1966  and
		    	were  active  only  at  the  first  stage  of  the  coup,   	later  yielding  their  place  to
		     	soldiers.
		     	The  purpose  of  the  coup  was   	to  have  wider  reprisals  against  the  real  and  potential
		     	(and  sometimes  imaginary)   	political  opponents  of  Mao  Zedong  and  his  ent~urage.    	As
		     	a  result  of  the  coup,   	not  only  was  a  new  political  regime  created,  but  also  a  new
		     	power  mechanism  which  was  alienated  from  society  and  in  all  of  its  elements
		     	obedient  to  the  working  group.    	The  army  was  becoming  its  chief  component  part.
		     	The  communist  party  was  not  eliminated  altogether,  but  under  the  sign  bearing  its
		     	name  a  new  political  organization  was  created--the  uncomplaining  executor  of  tre
		     	designs  of  the  "Great  Helmsman,"  as  Mao  Zedong  began  to  be  named  at  that  time  in
		     	the  PRC  official  press.    	A  similar  fate  was  prepared  for  public  organizations.
		     	Both  with  rega.rd  to   	the  methods  of  its  formation  and  to  the  methods  of  3ts  work,
		     	the  state  apparatus  became  completely  isolated  from  the  people.    	But  this  is  not
		     	all--the  coup  led  to  a  change  in  the  state's  basic  goal  which  previously  had  been
		     	formulated  as  the  construction  of  a.  socialist  scciety.    	Now,  although  the
		     	socialist  slogans  were  not  removed,   	the  chief  goal  became  the  creation  of  a
		     	mil.itarist  power  capable  of  making  a  claim  at   	first  to  regional  and,   	then,   	to
		     	world  hegemony.

			 	A  military  bureaucratic  regime  was  established  in  China  which  was  characterized
			 	above  all  by  the  a1l-penetrating  militari~ation  of  state  and  social  life  that
			 	manifested  itself  in  the  ruling  elite  having  its  basis  in  the  army  and  in  the
			 	training  of  the  basic  cadres  of  the  power  apparatus  through  the  People's  L~bera-
			 	tion  Army  of  China,   	in  the  spreading  of  the  army  system  to  labor  processes,   	the
			 	militarization  of  education,   	the  universal  establishment  of  a  military-command
			 	style  in  the  work  of  state  institutions  and  public  organizations,  and  so  forth.
			 	This  regime  was  also  characterized  by  a  bureaucratic  isolation  from  the  massF~s,
			  	the  complete  ignoring  of  the  will  of  the  people,   	and  an  emphasis  in  rhe  perfor-
			 	mance  of  administration  on  a  vast  "ganbu"  strata--professional  bureaucrats
			 	strictly  subordinated  on  the  vertical  and  se~ected  through  an  especially
			  	established  procedure.
			 	The  establishment  of  a  military  bureaucratic  regime  in  China  was  facilitated  by
			 	a  mmmber  of  factors.    	Cultural  backwardness,   	the  preservation  af  feudal  and
			 	sem~-feudal  traditions,  and  also,   	to  a  certain  extent,   	the  ideological  influence
			 	of  militarist  cliques  which  had  L�~~en  dominant  for  a  long  ~ime,  and  the  influence
			 	of  China-centric  ideas--all  of  this  taken  together  facilitated  the  introduction
			 	of  military  bureaucratic  methods  of  administerxng  the  country  and  the  suppression
			 	and  dispersal  of  democratic  institutions.
			 	At  the  same  ti.me,   	the  establishment  of  a  military  bureaucratic  dictatorship  in
			 	China  was  not  an  inevitable  consequence  of  the  social  conditions  in  which  the
			 	People's  Revolution  had  been  victorious  in  that  country;    	indeed,   	it  contra-
			 	dicted   	the  paths  for  the  transformation  of  society  which  had  been  chos~n  by  the
			 	Chinese  people.
			 	The  consolidation  and  development  of  the  gains  of  the  revolution  and  rapid  pro-
			 	gress   	towards  soci.~Iism  could  have  been  brought  about  by  such  factors  as  fidelity
			 	by  the  leadership  of  the  CCP  to  Marxism-Leminism,  a  stren~thening  of  the  prole-
			  	tarian  character  of  power,   	and  close  relations  and  fraternal  friendship  with  the
			 	CPSU  and  USSR  and  with  all  of  the  socialist  countries  and  Marxist-Leninist
			 	parties,   	and  with  the  world  socialist  system.    	However,   	the  operation  of  these
			 	factors  was     	artificiaJly  cut  short  by  Mao  Zedong  and  his  followers.    	The  death
			 	of  Mao  Zedung,   	th~  departure  from  China's  political  scene  of  his  closest  en-
  '		     	tourage   	("The  Band  of  Four"),   	and  definite  changes  in  the  life  of  the  country  and
			 	in  its  political  system  did  not,   	unfortunately,  lead  to  the  restoration  of  the
			 	operation  of  these  factors  and,   	consequently,   	to  d  change  in  the  political  regime
			 	among  whose  basic  criteria  are  the  character  of  the  party,   	its  role  and  policies
			 	in  society,   	the  operational  methods  of  state  power,   	the  r.eal  possibility  for.the

				struggle  for  power  and  which  were  created  by  them  during  the  course  of  or  after
				t11e  "cultural  revolution";    	for  example,   	the  "revolutionary  committees,"  the

				"workers'  militia,"  and  so  f~rth.    	It  is  necessary  to  observe  that  some  of  the
				tendencies  of  a  return  to  the  previous  political  system  had  already  taken  shape
				during  Mao  Zedong's  life:    	Thus,   	already  in  1969  the  restoration  had  begun  of  the
				structure  of  the  party  whose  committees  and  organizations,  with  the  exception  of
				those  in  the  army,   	had  been  smashed  during  the  period  of  the  "cultural  revolution";
				in  the  early  1970's  the  elimination  was  begun  of  +the  "gongqianfa"--united  puni-
				tive  agencies  of  the  time  of  the  "cultural  revoli�~tion"  which  combined  the  functions
				of  ~ecurity,   	procura*.,or,  and  court  agencies--and  ~udicial  agencies  began  to  be
				restored;    	in  1973  trade  union,  women's,  and  youth  organizations  which  had  been
				dispersed  in  1966  were  restored  to  the  provincial  level,   	and  so  forth.
				China's  post-Mao  Zedong  leadership  has  accelerated  this  process  and,  at  the  same
				time,   	has  resolutely  eliminated  all  of  the  political  institutions  which  were
	     	�	 	created  by  its   	"orthodox"  opponents.    	By  the  beginning  of  the  1980's,   	in  its
				organizational  forms,   	the  political  system  of  the  PRC  had  ceased  to  differ
				essentially  from  that  which  existed  before  the  "cultural  revolution."    	Of  the
				component  parts  of   	the  political  system  of  the  PRC,   	the  greatest  importance  is
				being  received  by  the  state  apparatus  which  has  the  respons~,bility  for  the
				basic  part  of  the  work  to  carry  out  the  ambitious  program  of  "four  moderniza-		   	~
				tions."3    	At  the  same  time,   	thi~  program  has  also  been  put  at  the  center  of  the
				work  of   	the  CCP  and  of  public  organizations.    	The  new  Chinese  legislation  is  also
				directed  in  the  first  place  at  its  realization.    	[3]
				A  strengthening  of  the  foundations  of  the  political  regime  which  is  being  formPd
				is  the  basic  content  of  the  political-juridical  processes  which  are  taking  place
				in  China.    	Above  all,   	this  is  being  served  by  the  measures  of  the  Chinese
				leadership  aimed  at  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  sta*_~  apparatus  and
				strengthening  the  entire  state  machine  and,   	especiaiiy,   	the  agencies  of  security,
				of  the  procurator's  office,  and  of  the  courts.    	This  bureaucratic  apparatus  is
				formally  based  on  definite  legal  norms  which,   	in  fact,   	serve  as  an  external  cover
				for  the  repressive  essence  of  the  regime.    	In  practice,   	the  chief  criterion  for
				the  adoption  by   	the  political-juridical  agencies  of  decisions  cnntinues  to  be
				the  Maoist  conception  of  the  "correct  resolution  of  contradictions  within  the
				people"  which  permits  anbitrariness   	in  determining  who  should  be  put  in  the
				category  of   	"enemies.'t    	In  establishing  an  alliance  with  the  world  imperialist
				bourgeoisie  which  is  aimed  against  world  socialism,   	the  Chinese  leaders  are
				shifting   	their  blow  from  the  "remnants  of  the  old  exploiting  classes"  to
				"counter-revolutionary"  and  "enemy  agents"  among  whom  are  usually  numbered
				ideological  and  political  opponents;of  the  authorities,   	and  also  everybody  who
				does  not  suit  them.    	The  trial  of  the  "counter-revolutionary  groups"  of  Ling

			  	The  repressive  activities  of  the  state  apparatus  are  supplemented  by  corresponding
  ~				actions  by  the.armed  forces  which  the  post-Mao  Zedong  leadership  also  rsgards  as
			  	the  chief  support  of  the  regime.    	Official  Chinese  reports  have  spoken  many  times
			  	about  thF  use  of  regular  army  forces  and  units  o~  the  People's  1~Iilitia   	(fi~n-
			  	bing)   	to  "instill  order,"  and,   	particularly,   	to  suppress  protest  actions  againsr
			  	the  polici~~s  of  the  authorities.    	At  an  All-Chinese  Conference  on  the  Establish-
			  	u.ent  of  Pub~ic  Order  in  the  Cities   	(November  1979)  which  was  called  by  the
			  	Beijing  leadership  the  "special  role"  of  the  army  in  "establishing  order  in  the
			  	localities"  was  emphasized.    	[5]    	Concealing  the  punitive  functions  of  the  army
			  	with  the  slogan  of  "the  unity  of  the  army  and  the  people,"  Chinese  propaganda
			  	points  to  the  necessity  of  making  use  of  it  in  order  to  "consolidate  a  politi�-
			  	cal  situation  of  stabiiity  and  solidar~ty"  and  in  order  to  "overcome  difficult~ies"
			  	in  realizing  the  "four  modernizations"  program.     	[6]    	Translated  from  the
			  	langua~e  of  propaganda,   	this  means  a  more  active  use  of  the  armed  forces  to
			  	suppress  dissatisfaction  with  the  actions  of   	the  Chinese  leaders.
			  	On  the  whole,   	the  present  Beijing  regime  is  characterized  by  a  shift  from  the
			  	amorphous  Mao  Zedong  "line  of  the  masses"  to  organized  forms  of  carrying  out
			  	repressions  which  are  stipulated  by  legislative  acts  which,   	in  the  words  of  the
			  	Chinese  press,   	are  a"powerful  weapon  for  striking  against  all  counter-revolu-
			  	tionary  and  criminal  elements."    	[7]    	At  the  same  time,  despite  procedural  norms
			  	which  have  bc~en  introduced  in  a  formal  manner,   	the  political  process  of  present-
			  	day  China  does  not  exclude  punishment  at  mass  kangaroo  courts  which  represent  a
			  	violation  of  the  elementary  norms  of  legality.    	During  the  present  period  especial
			  	attention  is  being  devoted  to  the  "regulation"  of  the  agencies  of  public  security
			  	from  which  the  demand  is  being  made  that  they  "turn  the  punitive  sword  of  the
			  	a~encies  of  the  dictatorship"  against  various  kinds  of  people  who  are  united  by
			  	the  labels  of  "counter-revolutionaries,"  "enemy  agents,"  and  also  "class  enemies."
			  	Criminals  whose  numbers,   	according  to  the  official  data,  have  increased  compared
			  	to  the  beginning  of  the  1960's  by  10  times  are  numbered  by  the  Bzijing  leadership
			  	in  the  latter  category.
			  	During  the  course  of  this  political  maneuvering  and  struggle  for  power  the
			  	Chines~e  elite  made  use  in  its  interests  of  a  widely  advertised  campaign  for  the
			  	"democratization"  of  political  life.    	However,  soon  after  the  consolidation  of
			  	the  positions  of  one  of  the  groups  of  Chinese  leadership  (the  Deng  Xiaoping
			  	group)   	a  process  of  the  iiirensive  curtailment  of  formal  democracy  began.    	In  fact,
			  	taking  place  in  China  is  a  strengthening  of  a  far-flung  system  of  all-embracing
			  	control  by  the  s~ate  apriaratus  over  society.    	In  order  to  consolidate  the  regime
			  	tise  is  being  made  of   	th.e  previously  existing  "cultural-revolution"  and  newly  formed
			  	security  committees  under  the  leadership  of  the  agencies  of  public  security
			  	and  posts  at  enterprises  and  institutions,   	and  population  committees  and  groups
			  	which  have  been  put  under  the  control  of  neighborhood  offices  whose  activities
			  	are  also  controlled  by  the  agencies  of  public  security.    	Thus,   	a  mechanism  for  the
			  	control  of  the  population  is  functioning  which  is  analogous  to  the  old  Chinese
			  	and  Kuomingtang  "baojia"  system  which  was  organized  on  the  baGis  of  mutual
			  	guaranty.
			  	Simultaneously  with  the  measures  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  o~  the  state
			  	apparatus,   	includicig   	the  punitive  policy     	being  carried  out  by  it,   	tne  Beijing

			 	After   	the  death  of  Mao  Zedong  a..^.d  the  overthrow  of  the  "Four"  of  his  clr~sest
			 	henchmen,   	the  Chinese  leadership  took  certain  steps  to  increase  t.`.~  yarty's
			 	effectiveness  as  an  implement  for  the  realization  of  its  political  program.
			 	These  steps  include  a  definite  revival  of  ttie  organizational  life  of  the  party,
			 	the  reforming  of  its  leading  bodies,   	the  restoration  of  the  branch  sections  of
			 	the  local  party  apparatus,  greater  attention  to  the  issues  of  studies,  and  so
			 	forth.    	However,   	the  basic  mass  of  party  members  in  fact  do  not  takQ  part  in  the
			 	activities  of  the  party;    	this  work  is  performed  by  narrow  leadii~g  groups  in  the
			 	center  and  in  the  localities.    	Most  of  the  members  of  the  CCP  .:re  characterized
			 	by  a  state  of  ideological  stagnation,  passivity,   	disorientation,  and  a  lack  of
			 	understanding  of  the  changes  taking  place.    	On  the  whole,   	the  CCP  at  the  present
			 	time  is  ill-matched  organizationally  and  ideologically,   	and,  as  before,  a
			 	po:.itical  organization  which  is  divided  into    	factions  and  united  and  incited  by
			 	nationalistic  aspirations.    	Certain  steps  by  the.present  Chinese  leadership  in
			 	the  direction  of  the  "democratization"  of  intra-party  life,  and  a  formal  return
			 	to  certain  ~f  the  ideas  of  the  Eighth  CCP  Congress  (1956)   	should  not  be  mis-
			 	leading.    	Neither  organizationally  nor  politically  doe~  the  CCP  represent  the
			 	vanguard  of  the  working  class.    	Even  after  the  death  of  Mao  Zedong,   	the  leader-
			 	ship  of  this  party  proved  to  be  incapable  of  returning  to  the  ideological  and
			 	political  platform  of  Marxism-Leninism.    	[8]
			 	Striving  to  expand  the  regime's  social  base  and  to  attract  wider  strata  of  Chinese
			 	in  the  PRC  and  abroad  into  the  realization  of  the  "four  modernizations"  progr`m,
			 	the  Chinese  leadership  has  galvanized  the  organization  of  a  united  front--the
			 	People's  Political  Consultation  Council  of  China   	(PPCCC).    	The  Beijing  leaders
			 	gave  it  the  task  of  uniting  on  a  broad  nationalistic  platform  "all  of  the  forces
			 	which  could  be  united."    	The  nationalistic  bloc  which  is  being  created  on  the
			 	basis  of  the  organization  of  a  united  front  has  the  task,  according  to  the  plans
			 	of  the  Beijing  leaders,   	also  of  serving  for  the  unification  on  the  international
			 	arena  "with  all  of  the  forces  with  which  it  is  possible  to  unite  in  order  to  form
			 	the  broadest  united  front  of  struggle  againsi  hegemonism."    	In  fact,   	this  means
			 	the  incitement  of  hostility  toward  the  Soviet  Union,   	socialist  Vietnam,   	and  world
			 	socialism  as  a  whole.
			 	The  new  charter  of  the  PPCCC  which  was  adopted  by  the  first  session  of  its  All-
			 	Chinese  Committee  of  the  Fifth  Convocation  (February-March  1978)  has  consolidated
			 	the  course  aimed  at  a  broader  representation  of  the  Chinese  bou:?eoisie  in  the
			 	agencies  of  the  united  front  and  the  allowance  of  an  illusory  political  pluralism
			 	under  the  newly  dragged  out  slogan  of  the  "prolonged  coexistence  and  mutual
			 	control"  of  the  CCP  and  the  so-called  "democratic"  parties.    	It  is  not  accidental
			 	that   	the  membership  of  the  All-Chinese  Committee  of  the  PPCCC  of  the  Fifth  Convo-
			 	cation  included  a  substantial  number  of  representatives,  who  had  been  invited
			 	by  the  Beijing  le3dership,  of  foreign  (also  from  Hong  Kong  and  Macao)
			 	Chinese  and  "patriotic  figures"  wiio  occupy  half  of  the  seats  in  the  supreme  body
			 	of  the  united  front.    	At  the  same  time,   	the  mass  public  organizations   	(trade
			 	union,  youth,  and  women's)  were  represented  by  only  five  percent  of  the  delegates
			 	to  the  Al1-Chinese  Committee  of  the  PPCCC.

 ~			 	At  the  second  session  of  the  All-Chinese  Committee  of  the  PPCCC  whi~h  took  place
			   	in  June-July  1979  the  framework  of  the  "revolutionary  united  front"    	was  ex-
			  	panded  through  the  inclusion  in  it  of  all  Chinese,   	regardless  of  citizenship
			   	("all  who  love  their  homeland").    	It  was  takea  even  further  to  the  right  by  the
			   	decisions  of  the  C~nference  on  the  Work  of  the  United  Front  which  was  held  in
			  	August-September  1~79.    	At  the  conference  the  front  was  declared  to  be  "a  broad
			   	political  alliance  of  all  socialist  toilers,  patriots  who  support  socialism,   	and
			   	patriots  who  favor  the  rEUnification  of  the  homeland."    	[9]    	The  very  name  af
			   	the  front  was  changed--it  began  to  be  called  the  "Revolutionary  Patriotic  Front."
			   	In  addition,  mention  is  no  longer  made  of  what  had  earlier  been  recorded  regarding     	.
 -			 	its  being  "under   	the  leader~,hip  of  the  working  class  and  based  on  the  alliance
			   	of  the  working  class  and  pea~:antry."    	Moreover,  according  to  the  new  definition
			   	of  the  front's  composition,   	in  order  to  become  a  member  of  it  it  is  not  even
			  	necessary  to  acknowledge  socialism  as  a  political  platform.    	The  chief  goal  of
			   	this  organization  is  becoming  the  search  for  contacts  with  the  Taiwan  adminis-
			   	tration  and  the  enli$tment  in  the  "four  modernizations"  not  only  of  the  domestic,
			  	but  also  of  the  foreign  Chinese  bourgeoisie,   	the  Chinese  bourgeoisie  of  Hong  Kong
			  	and   	Macao.	  	The  Beijing  leaders  are  attempting  through  the  united  front  to
			  	make  use  of  its  capital,  experience,   	and  knowledge  for  the  realization  of  their
			   	ambitious  programs.    	Serious  modifications  in  the  politics  of  the  united  front
			  	have  led  the  Chinese  leadership  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  necessary  to  review
			   	the  charter  of  the  PPCCC  which�was  adopted  in  1978.    	A  commission  for  the  develop-
			  	ment  of  a  new  charter  was  created  at  the  third  session  of  the  All-Chinese
			   	Committee  of  the  PPCCC  in  September  1980.
			  	The  modified  policy  of  the  united  front  is  a  part  of  a  broad  maneuver  by  the
			   	Chinese  leadership  to  strengthen  the  social  base  of  the  regime.    	This  maneuvering
			   	includes  the  removal  of  labels  from  the  "black  categories"  of  the  population
			   	(for  example,   	from  the  former  landowners  and  kulaks),  and  a  flirtation  with  the
			   	intelligentsia  which  is  declared  to  be  a"part  of  the  proletariat."    	In  the
			   	policies  with  respect  to  the  working  class  and  peasantry  a  reorientation  toward
			   	its  wealthier  strata  (skilled  workers,  wealthier  peasants)   	is  obvious.    	China's
			   	ruling  elite  is  not  orienting  itself,  as  i.n  the  recent  past,   	toward  the  pauperized
			  	masses  of  the  urban  and  rural  poor  who  are  interested  in  equal  distribution.
			  	These  masses  continue  to  be  a  destabilizing  factor  in  the  domestic  political
			   	situation  of  the  country.						     	~
			  	This  is  all  the  more  reason  why  the  Chinese  leadership  is  di.recting  serious
			  	attention  toward  the  organizations  of  mass  support  for  the  regime  and  the  ideolo-
			  	gical  brainwashing  of  the  masses  which  under  China's  conditions  are  the  trade
			   	unions,   	the~youth,  and  women's  organizations.    	At  the  same  time,  mass  organizations
			  	which  were  engendered  or  galvanized  by  the  "cultural  revolution"  have  been  removed
			   	from  the  political  arena:    	For  example,  such  organizations  as  the  Hongweibings
			  	and  Jiaofan,   	the  "conferences  of  representatives  of  the  revolutionary  workers,"
			  	and  the  "alliances  of  bottom   	middle  and  poor."
			  	The  effecting  in  the  interests  of  the  ruling  elite  of  the  restoration  to  the

				revolution"  has  been  accompanied  by  a  criticism  of  the  poiicies  of  the  "Band  of	     	~
				Four"  with  respect  to  these  organizations.    	At  the  Ninth  All-Ck~inese  Congress  of
				Trade  Unions   	(October  1978)   	which  tnok  p?:,:e  more  than  20  yEacs  after  the  con-
				vocation  of  the  preceding  congress,   	the  All-Chinese  Federati.on  of  Trade  Union~
				which  had  been  dissolved  in  December  1966  was  recreated.    	Tne  Maois~  s~~ps  in	     	~
 -		     	its  documents  were    	combined  with  the  re~ection  of  certain  unpopular  trade  union
				work  methods  which  had  become  implanted  during  the  time  of  Mao  Zedong,   	and  by
				the  restoration  of  the  trade  unions'   	tasks  in  organizing  rest  and  improving  the
				well-being  of  the  workers.~
				However,   	in  the  chief  things   	the  present  Chinese  leaders  are  continuing  Mao
				Zedong's  course  of  the  "politicalization"  af  the  trade  unions;    	tha4  ir~,   	~ne
				subordination  of  all  of  their  activitie~  to  a  single  task--the  ir.troduction  among
				the  masses  of  the  ideology  and  politics  of  modified  Maoism.    	An  rinalysis  of  the
				directions  of  the  present  work  of  China's  trade  unions  shows  tha�~  in  the  basic
				spheres  of  their  activities  they  remain  in  Maoist  positions.
				The  interest  on  the  part  of  the  Chinese  leadership  in  organizing  relations  with
				various  strata  and  groups  of  the  population,  and  its  attempt  to  expand  and  cc~n-
				solidate  social  support  for  the  regime  has  alse  been  reflected  in  the  materi:.~ls
				of  the  congresses  and  activities  of  the  women's  and  youth  organizations.5    	Th~is     	~
				bears  witness  to  attempts  by  the  Bei3ing  leadership  to  list  the~a  strata  and~:
				groups   	in  active  participation  in  production  work  and  public  political  activi,L-ies~
				under  the  slogan  of   	the  "creation  of  a  mighty  China."    	The  B~ijing  leadership  is
				imposing  modified  Maoism  as   	the  "theoretical"  basis  of  the  activities  of  public
				organizations  and  is  attempting  to  consolidate  the  basic  theses  of  the  Maoist
				political  course  as  their  long-term  program  orientation.    	The  public  organizatians
				of  the  PRC  are  now  acting  as  transmitters  of  the  chauvinist  and  hegemonist
				policy  of  Beijing.
				As  a  result  of  the  correction  of  a  number  of  political  and  economic  "excesses"  of
				the  Mao  Zedong  course,   	the  present  modified  Maoist  regime  is  growing  stronger.
				Within   	the  country  its  greatest  strength  is  being  used  by  the  ruling  elite  for
				the  realization  of  its  ambitious  programs,   	and  outs~;de  of  it  in  order  to  exacer-
				bate  the  confrontation  between  China  and  the  USSR  and  its  allies  and  to  deepen
				Beijing's  military-political  alliance  with  world  imperialism.    	[10]    	Such  is
				the  foreign  golicy  orientation  of  the  Beijing  regime.
																					     	~
				On  the  whole,   	despite  certain  changes  of  a"facade"  nature,   	the  political  regime
				in  China  essentially  represents  a  modernized  model  of  a  military  bureaucratic
				dictatorship.    	There  is  every  reason  to  suppose  that  its  repressive  character
				will  not  only  continue  in  the  future,  but  will  grow  more  cruel  as  the  difficulties

			 	[Text]    	An  improvement  of   	the  work  of  the  agencies  which  apply  the  law  is  a
			 	necessary  condition  for  a  further  strengthening  of  socialist  legality.    	In  this
			 	connection,  Soviet  juridical  science  is  faced  with  the  problem  of  a  comprehensive
			 	study  of  the  factors  which  determine  legality  and  the  effectiveness  of  the
			 	application  of  the  norms  of   	the  law.    	One  of  its  important  aspects  is  the  question
			 	of   	the  reasons  for  and  the  conditions  of  the  commission  of  errors  in  law  appli-
			 	cation.    	In  the  literature  it  has  received  a  definite  treatment  with  regard  to
			 	court  and  investigatory  errors  in  criminal  cases.     	[1,   	2,   	3]    	The  fullest  point
			 	of  view  on  this  issue  has  been  stated  by  I.   	L.   	Petrukhin  who  distinguishes  three
			 	groups  of  reasons  for  court   	errors  and,  correspondingly,   	three  levels  of  knowing
			 	them:    	a)   	reasons  for  errors  which  are  connected  with  violations  of  the  require-
			 	ments  of  material  and  procedural  law  on  the  level  of  principles  and  concrete
			 	norms;    	b)   	reasons  for  errors  which  are  contained  in  the  general  conditions  of
			 	the  performance  of  court  business  and  in  the  level  of  the  training  of  judges,
			 	in  the  special  characteristics  of  their  awareness  of  the  law,   	in  their  moral
			 	qualities,   	in  the  conditions  of  their  life  and  work,   	the  organization  of  the
			 	court  system,   	the  effectiveness  of  the  activities  of  the  participants  in  the
			 	trial,   	in  the  influence  of  legal  science  on  ~uridical  practice,   	in  the  degree  of     	~
			 	information  support  for  the  court  system,  and  so  forth;    	c)   	reasons  which  are
			 	rooted  in  the  state  of  the  general  types  of  the  guarantees  of  legality:    	economic,
			 	ideological,  political,   	and  juridical.    	[4]
			 	One  cannot  but  note  the  logical  coherence  and  the  internal  harmony  bf  the  above-
			 	described  view.    	At  the  same  time,   	this  conception  is  in  need  of  a  certain  moder-
			 	nization  regarding  errors  as  a  generic  phenomenon  in  the  sphere  of  law  applica-
			 	tion.   	First  of  all,   	it  is  necessary  to  distinguish  the  causes  and  conditions,  or
			 	f.actors,  which  determine  errors.    	Causes  are  immediate  ~uridical  phenomena  which
			 	give  rise  to  an  error  and  determine  its  character  and  place  in  the  general  system
			 	of  legality  violations.    	They  could  be:    	a  failure  to  reach  the  truth  in  an
			 	investigation  of  the  factual  circumstances  of  a  case,   	an  incorrect  selection  and
			 	interpretation  of  the  norms  of  material  or  procedural  law,  a  verdict's  lack  of
			 	correspondence  to  the  actual  or  legal  basis  of  a  case,   	and  so  forth.    	It  is  use-

			   	ful  to  call  them  the  internal,   	or  concrete,  causes  of  errors  in  law  applica-
			   	tion.
  _			 	Conditions  should  be  und~:x�stood  as  the  circumstances  which  are  mediately
 -			 	connected  with  the  errors  which  favor  their  emergence.    	They,   	as.  it  were,   	create
			   	the  general  background  and  the  circumstances  under  which  the  possibilities  for
			   	an  incorrect  application  of  the  law  increase.    	The  following  may  be  numbered
			  	among  such  factors:    	the  level  of  the  professional  training  of  the  subjects  of
			  	law  application,   	their  moral  and  political  qualit~.es,   	the  specific  conditions  of
			   	their  lives  and  work,   	the  dEgree  of  the  organization  and  effectiveness  of  the
  _				system  of  agencies,  and  so  f~rth.    	These  factors  are  the  external  causes  of  the
			  	errors  in  law  application.
			  	The  dialectic  of  the  interaction  between  the  causes  and  conditions  of  law  appli-
			  	cation  errors   	consists  in  the  fact  that  they  are  closel,y  interconnected  with  one
			  	another  and  are  able  to  move  into  one  another.    	For  example,   	an  incarre~ct  selec-
			  	tion  and  analysis  of  a  legal  norm  as  the  concrete  internal  cause  of  an  ~rroneous
			  	application  of  law  can  in  an  individual  case  be  connected  with  many  conditions:
			  	a  large  work  load  for  the  law  applier,   	shortcomings  in  the  selection  and  dis-
			  	position  of  cadres,  a  lack  of  spec.ialization  in  work,   	the  contradictoriness  of
			  	legislation,   	and  so  forth.    	And,   	on  the  contrary,  every  conditian  which  fosters
			  	the  emergence  of  errors  in  law  application  can  manifest  itself  and  activate  the
			  	action  of  several  concrete  causes  depending  upon  the  circumstances  o.f  the  juri-
			  	dical  case  and  the  subjects  of  the  activity.    	Thus,   	the  lack  of  a  stable  juri-
			  	dical  practice  can  be  expressed  in  the  following  causes  of  errors  in  law
			  	application:    	an  incorrect  assembling  and  evaluation  of  proofs,   	the  incorrect
			  	drawing  up  of  the  law  application  document,   	the  erroneousness  of  qualification,
			  	and  so  forth.    	In  studyin~  this  problem,  all  of  this  makes  it  possible,   	in  our
			  	view,   	to  use  a  single  list  of  factors  which  determine  errors  in  law  application
			 	work.
			 	A  study  of  the  special  literature  and  of  court  and  investigatory  practice  on  the
			  	topic,   	discussions  wi.th  those  who  apply  the  law,  and  questionnaire  work  with
			  	them  have  made  it  possible  to  compose  and  test  during  the  course  of  a  sociological
			 	study  the  following  list  of  the  most  frequent  causes  and  conditions  of  errors
			 	in  law  application:    	1)   	lack  of  clarity  and  contradictoriness  of  legislation;
  _		     	2)   	a  lack  of  stable  juridical  practice;    	3)   	insufficient  3uridical  knowledge  on
			 	the  part  of   	the  law  applier;    	4)   	the  counteraction  of  interested  persons;    	5)  un-
			 	favorable  work  conditions;    	6)   	shortcomings  in  the  selection  and  dispositi~:  of
			 	cadres;    	7)   	one-sidedness  and  incompleteness  in  the  proof;    	8)   	the  comr~exity  of
			 	the  procedural  demands  upon  individual  juridical  action;    	9)  a  heav;  work  load;
			 	10)   	the  lack  of  specialization  in  work.
   	~		    	The  purpose  of   	the  study  was  to  establish  the  hierarchical  ~mportance  o~c  each

			  	formed  on  the  investigatory  apparatus  of   	the  Administration  for  Internal  Affairs
			 	of  Volgogradskaya  Oblast,  a  group  of  investigators  studyin�  at  the  advanced
			  	training  faculty  of  the  Higher  Investigatory  School  of  the  USSR  Ministry  of
			  	Internal  Affairs   	(94  people),   	people's  judges  and  m~mbers  of  the  oblast  court
			 	of  Volgogradskaya  Oblast,  and  also  a  group  of  people's  judges  from  the  Bashkir
			 	ASSR.    	In  all,   	327  law  appliers  (218  investigators  and  109  judges)  were  questioned.
			 	Of  course,   	in  a  study  of  this  kind  it  is  only  possible  to  establish  the  sub-
			 	jective  imgortance  of  each  of  the  factors  which  determines  law  application
			  	errors.    	At  the  same  time,   	the  high  competence  of  the  respondents  makes  such
			  	replies  extremely  valuable.
			  	In  totalling  up  the  results  of  the  study  it  became  clear  that  the  subjective
			  	importance  of  each  of   	the  above-enumerated  factors  is  determined  on  the  basis
			  	of  two  criteria:    	the  frequency  with  which  ~he  respondents  mentioned  or  empha-
			  	sized  one  or  another  cause  of  ~rrors,   	and  the  ranking  of  all  of  the  causes   	for
			  	errors  in  concrete  figures.    	The  point  is  that  not  all  of  the  respondents  named
			  	the  10  causes  proposed  by  us,  but  frequently  limited  themselves  ~o  pointing  to
			  	some  of  them.    	This  resulted  in  the  fact  that  the  frequency  of  the  causes  noted
			  	by  the  law  appliers  does  not  correspond  with  the  total  number  of  respondents
			  	(327  people)   	and  fluctuates  from  103  to  244.    	As  for  the  total  sum  which  expresses
			  	the  ranking  of  each  of  the  10  factors,   	it  fluctuates  from  498  to  610.    	As  a
			  	result,   	the  subjective  importance  of  each  of  the  factors  is  defined  by  a  frac-
			  	tion  whose  numerator  is  the  total  amount  of  the  ranking  indicators,   	and  whose
			  	denominator  is  the  frequency  with  which  each  of  the  factors  is  mentioned.    	This
			  	makes  is  possible  to  deduce  uniform  indicators  of  the  subjective  importance  for
			  	the  law  appliers  of  each  of  the  ZO  factors.    	They  are  obtained  by  dividing  the
			  	total  amount  of  subjective  preferen.ces  by  the  number  of  times  that  each  factor
			  	is  mentioned.
			  	A  large  work  load  is  named  by   	investigators  and  judges  as  one  of  the  chief
			  	factors  giving  rise  to  errors   	in  law  application  work.    	The  idea  that  the
			  	quality  of  the  work  of  law  appliers  is  dependent  upon  the  amount  of  their  work
			  	load  has  already  been  expressed  in  the  literature.    	Thus,   	according  to  data
			  	cited  by  V.  N.   	Kudryavtsev  ;  if  among  a  group  of  judges  who  hear  7-10  cases  a	 	�
			  	month  there  is  an  average  of  1.04  annulled  and  1.74  changed  verdicts  per  year
			  	per  judge,  with  a  work  load  of  20  and  more  cases  these  figures  increase  to  2.31
 -				and  12.96,   	respectively.    	[5]    	Data  which  establishes  their  employment  in  work
			  	in  hours  testifies   	to   	the  large  work  load  of  law  appliers.
			  	During  the  survey  of  the  working  conditions  of  law  appliers  they  G?ere  asked  a
			  	question  regarding  their  satisfaction  with  their  work  and  their  position.    	Most
			  	of  those  who  replied  expressed  satisfaction  with  their  work,   	taking  note  in  it
			  	of  elements  of  search,   	creativity,  and  social  importance.    	However,   	of  the  327
			  	investigators  and  judges,   	70  neople  (55  investigators  and  15  judges)   	stated  that
			  	their  work  did  not  satisfy  them.    	Excessive  work  and  a  disproportionate  work
			  	load  for  law  appliers   	(46  people)  were  named  as   	the  basic  reason.    	In  this  case,
			  	we  are  talking  about   	investigators  and  judges  who  expressed  a  desire  to  transfer

			  	to  other  work.    	At  the  same  time,  many  of  the  respondents  who  stated  their
 -				satisfaction  with  their  work  took  note  oi  shortcomings  in  its  organization,  and,
			  	among  them,   	a  large  work  load  figured  in  one  of  the  first  places.
			  	The  lack  of  a  stable  j uridical  practice  occ~ipies  second  place  in  the  scale  of
			  	factors  which  determine  errors  in  the  work  of  investigators  and  judges.    	This
  _				factor  is  derivative  to  a  substantial  degree  from  the  ability  and  persistence  of
			  	superior  law  application  agencies  in  implementing  the  demands  of  unity  in  the
			  	understanding  and  application  of  legal  norms.    	From  a  broader  point  of  view,   	it
 -				is  a  component  part  of  the  stability  of  legal  regulation  and  presupposes  the
  -				relative  stability  of  laws  and  of  the  practice  of  their  application,  and  the		   	.
			  	continuity  of  the  work  methods  of  ~egal  application  agencies  regardless  of  the
			  	replacement  of  concrete  officials.    	[6]    	The  fact  that  this  factor  proves  to  be
			  	in  second  place  in  its  degree  of  importance  for  law  appliers  was  something  of  a
  .				surprise,  and  this  determines  its  importance.
			  	The  stability  of  law  application  practice  manifests  itself  most  vivi3ly  in  the
			  	unity  of  the  legal  qualification  of  juridical  cases  of  the  same  type.    	During
			  	the  course  of  the  study  investigators  and  judges  were  asked  to  designar2  with
			  	figures   	the  hierarchical  importance  of  the  factors  which  promote  correct  quali-
			  	fication.    	They  singled  out:    	1)   	consultations  with  one's  immediate  chief;
			  	2)   	the  help  of  workmates;    	3)   	the  directive  decrees  of  the  plenums  of  Supreme
			  	Courts;    	4)  monographic  literature;    	5)   	commentaries;    	6)   	departmental  orders
			  	and  instructions;    	7)   	the  procurator's  opinion.    	It  turned  out  that  each  of
			  	the  above-enumerated  factors  is  perceived  differently  by  the  investigators  and
			  	judges.    	For  example,   	for  the  investigators  whose  work  position  presupposes
			  	relationships  of  subordination  in  the  investigatory  apparatus  and  in  relation-
			  	ships  with  the  agencies  oi  the  procurator's  office  the  greatest  value  is
			  	represented  by  such  factors  as:    	the  influencQ  of  one's  immediate  chief,  work-
			  	mates,   	the  directive  decrees  of  the  plenums  of  Supreme  Courts,   	the  opinion  of
			  	the  procurator,   	and  commentaries.    	The  judges,   	on  trhe  other  hand,  give  first
		     	'   	place  to  the  role  of  the  directive  decrees  of  the  plenums  of  Supreme  Courts,
			  	and  then  to  workmates,   	the  immediate  chief,  and  commentaries.    	The  importance
			  	of  help  from  the  procurator  in  the  correct  qualification  of  ~uridical  cases  is
			  	clearly  understated  among  judges.
			  	Another  important  aspect  in  the  establishment  of  a  stable  juridical  practice  is
			  	the  exp~rience  of  qualifying  juridical  cases  on  the  level  of  oblast  courts,
			  	the  investigatory  departments  of  the  oblast  administrations  of  internal  affairs,
			  	and   	the  oblast  procurator's  office.    	A  concrete  expression  of  the  policy  of
			  	these  agencies  in  the  sphere  of  law  application  is  represented  by  their  acts  of
			  	control  and  supervision,   	concrete  law  application  acts,  and  reviews  o.f  the
			  	practice  of  hearing  and  resolving  individual  categories  of  cases.    	For  this
			  	reason,  as  additional  causes  of  errors  in  law  application,   	in  addition  to  the
			  	proposed  list,  many  judges  name:    	"the  formalism  of  the  oblast  court,"  "the
			  	unstable  practice  of  the  oblast  court,"  and  "over-insurance  b-~  rayon  and  oblast
			 	judges  in  matters  of  qualification."    	Of  course,   	in  such  replies  there  can  be
			  	felt  the  "age-old"  purely  psychological  critical  attitude  of  lower  agencies
			  	toward  superior  ones;    	nevertheless,   	they  demonstrate  with  sufficient  accuracy
			  	the  role  of  oblast  law  protection  agencies  in  establishing  stable  juridical
			 	practice.

			  	Fourth  place  for  its  degree  of  subjective  importance  was  occupied  by  such  a		     	~
			  	factor  as  the  vagueness  and  contradictoriness  of  the  legislation.    	In  their
			  	replies  to  the  question  as  to  whether  the.legislation  in  effect  contained  im-
			  	perfect  norms,   	the  investigators  and  judges  demonstrated  a  quite  high  level  of
			  	a  critical  attitude  toward  the  law:    	Of  the  327  respondents,  only  46  expressed
			   	their  full  approval  of  the  operating  system  of  legal  regulation,  while  the
			  	remainder  (281)  pointed  to  individual  imperfections  in  ~he  legislation  which
			  	hinder  effective  work.    	A  careful  analysis  of  these  replies  provides  grounds  for
			  	critically  evaluating  them.    	The  point  is  that  most  of  the  respondents  only
			  	stated  the  existence  of  imperfect  norms  in  the  legislation;    	however,   	they  did
			  	not  point  to  concrete  norms  which  could  be  characterized  as  obsolete,  not  usaful,
 -			 	and  so  fnrth.    	In  certain  replies,   	one  feels  a  desire  to  become  free  from  certain
			  	procedural  norms,  and  an  endeavour  to  over-simplify  the  juridical  procedural
			  	form.    	At  the  same  time,  many  replies  con*_ain  sensible  proposals  which  have
			  	been  tested  by  many  years  of  practice  on  improving  the  system  of  legal  regula-
			  	tion.    	This  is  witnessed,   	for  example,  by  the  critical  analysis  of  the  applica-
			  	tion  of  Articles  16  and  334  of  the  RSFSR  Civil  Code  which  are  realized  in  a
			  	formal  manner,   	and  frequently  in  contradiction  with  the  norms  of  morality.
			  	Attention  is  called  to  the  lack  of  norms  which  regulate  the  procedure  for  inter-
			  	rogating  an  illiterate  person,  and  aJso  of  norms:    	on  halting  criminal  proceedings
			  	in  a  case  as  a  result  of  the  sickness  of  the  victim  which  prevents  a  determina-
			   	tion  of  the  severity  of  the  injury  received  by  him;    	on  verifying  testimony  at
			   	the  site  of  an  occurrence;    	and  on  the  possibility  of  applying  sanctions  against
			  	defendants  who  do  not  appear  for  a  court  session.    	Note  is  taken  of  the  imprecise
			  	and  diffuse  character  of  Article  206  of  the  RSFSR  Criminal  Code,  of  the  diffi-
			  	culty  in  delimiting  a  qualification  in  accordance  with  Part  2  of  Article  108,
			  	and  Articles  102  and  103  of  the  RFSFR  Criminal  Code,  and  so  forth.
			  	The  fifth  place  in  the  general  hierarchy  of  causes  of  errors  is  assigned  by  the
			  	investigators  and  judges  to  such  a  factor  as  the  "complexity  of  the  procedural
 ~				demands  upon  the  performance  of  individual  juridical  actions."    	Note  was  taken
			  	above  of  the  discovery  during  the  course  of  the  analysis  of  the  attitude  of
			  	law  appliers  to  the  legislation  in  effect  of  an  aspiration  to  simplify  the
			  	procedural  form,  and  a  desire  to  rid  oneself  of  the  rigid  schedules  for  the
			  	performance  of  individual  actions  and  of  the  complexities  of  procedure  in  so-
			  	called  obvious  juridical  cases.    	This  tendency  was  also  confirmed  from  a  docu-
			  	mentary  study  of  concrete  errors  of  law  application.    	Thus,   	51  percent  of  the
			  	errors  committed  by  investigators  in  the  halting  of  criminal  cases  were  expressed
			  	in  important  violations  of  procedural  law.    	[9]    	While  establishing  the  real
			  	importance  of  the  problem  of  procedural  form  for  the  general  dynamics  of  law

			  	that  they  decrease  with  an  increase  in  the  experience  and  professional  expertise
			  	of  the  law  appliers.    	Thirdly,  any  underestimation  of  the  role  of  the  procedural

		     	~  studies  by  law  appliers,   	a  rise  in  the  level  of  their  professional  e.kpertise,
			 	the  elimination  of  labor  turnover,   	and  the  ensuring  of  the  stability  of  legal
			 	regulation  represent  an  important  direction  in  decreasing  the  nu.:.~er  of  pro-
			 	cedural  errors.
			 	Insufficient  legal  knowledge  on  the  part  of  those  who  apply  the  law  is  in
			 	sixth  place  in  the  hierarchy  of  causes  of  errors.    	It  is  not  difficult  to  see
			 	that   	this  factor  is  closely  connected  with  others,  particularly,  with  the  "vague-
			 	ness	    	and  contradictoriness  of  the  legislation,"  "the  lack  of  stability  in
			 	juridical  practice,"  and  others.    	If  a  law  applier  has  an  insufficient  "baggage
			 	of  knowledge,"  then  the  existing  legislation  will,  of  course,  seem  to  him  to
			 	be  vague  and  contradictory,   	and  the  possibilities  for  the  results  of  his  work
			 	being  influenced  by  other  factors  which  determ~ne  errors  grow.    	In  evaluating
			 	the  role  of  this  factor  a  definite  amount  of  self-criticism  was  demanded  from
			 	the  law  appliers,   	since  in  their  replies  there  was  a  tendency  to  give  preference
			 	to  objective  conditions:    	work  load,   	the  instability  of  practice,   	shortcomings
			 	in  the  legislation,  and  so  forth.    	All  of  this  makes  it  possible  to  assume  that
			 	the   	true  importance  of  this  factor  in  the  system  of  cause:~  of  errors  is  much
			 	greater  than  the  law  appliers  themselves  believe.
			 	Seventh  place  is  assigned  to  unfavorable  work  conditions.    	This  includes  the
			 	social  and  individual  psychological  characteristics  of  the  examination  of  juri-
			 	dical  cases,  organizational-work  and  housing  and  domestic  shortco~i:.gs  which
			 	hinder  the  effective  realization  of  law  application  functions,  and  so  forth.    	A
			 	concrete  expression  of  these  conditions  might  be  nervousness  in  the  relationships
			 	betw~en  associates,  a  lack  of  the  technical  means  needed  for  successful  work,
			 	personal  troubles  on  the  part  of  tlie  workers,  bad  housing  and  domestic  condi-
			  	tions,  and  so  forth.    	Factors  of  this  kind  influence  the  quality  of  law  appli-
			 	cation  not  directly,  but  indirectly,  by  creating  the  conditions  for  the  commis-
			 	sion  of  errors.    	In  the  questionnaire  the  investigators  and  judges  classified
			  	the   	f.ollowing  among  such  conditions:    	poor  work  by  the  oi~anizational  and
			  	technical  services  and  departments,  unesthetic  work  places,  a  lack  of  coordina-
			  	tion  in  the  actions  of  different  services,  a  lack  of  attention  paid  to  young
			 	specialists,   	interference  by  superiors  in  the  procedural  independence  of  the
			 	investigator,  and  so  forth.
			  	Interesting  information  has  been  obtained  as  a  result  of  quest~~ning  law
			 	appliers  regarding  their  use  of  technical  means.    	It  turned  out  that  investiga-
			  	tors  are  more  involved  with  technical  means  and  make  use  of  them  more  frequently
			 	and  more  variously  than  judges.    	Of  203  investigator  respondents,   	86  make  use
			  	of  technical  means  constantly,   	107  use  them  sometimes,  and  only  10  people
			  	admitted  that  they  managed  withaut  them.    	Of  105  judges,   	73  replied  that  they  do
			  	not  use  te~chnical  means,   	and  only  32  ?aid  that  they  sometimes  resort  to   	them.
			 	This,   	in  our  view,   	is  an  irdicator  of  a  poor  situation  with  the  organization  of
			  	labo r  in  court  agencies.
			  	Providing  workers  punctually  with  legal  information--the  texts  of  normative  acts,
			  	codes,   	commentaries,   	the  decrees  of  plenums  of  S~upreme  Courts,  departmental

			  	orders,   	instructions,  and  so  forth--is  also  an  important  factor  in  creating  normal
			   	conditions  for  the  application  of  law.    	As   	the  study  has  shown,   	th3.s  question
			  	has  been  solved  best  in  the  court  agencies.    	Of  106  judges,   	95  replied  that  they
			   	are  provided  with  the  necessary  legal  information,   	and  only  11  not~d  shortcomings
			   	in  information  support.    	In  the  investigation  agencies  only  95  people  out  of  217
			  	respondants  evaluated  the  organization  of  legal  information  as  satisfactory.    	I

 ]			 	believe  that  the  problem  of  punctually  providing  investigators  raith  legal  infor-
			  	mation  has  to  be  solved  first  of  all  by  the  USSR  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs.
			   	In  particular,   	it  would  be  useful  to  create  special  legal  i.nformation  funds  on
			   	the  level  of  oblast  investigatory  administra~ions  for  newly  hired  investigators.
			  	Eighth  place  in  the  hierarchy  of  causes  of  law  application  errors  is  occupied  by
			  	such  a  factor  as  the  opposition  of  interested  persons:    	tele~hone  calls,   	requests
			  	by  relatives  and  acquaintances,   	and  even  "pressure"  from  leading  workers  for
			   	the  purpose  of  a  deci.sion  being  adopted  in  which  certain  people  are  interested.
			  	Overcoming  the  intellectual,   	psychological,  moral,   	and  juridical  obstacles  which
			  	are  created  by  witnesses,  victims,   	the  accused,  and  other  individuals  who  are
			  	interested  in  the  concrete  outcome  of  a  case  is  a  frequent  instance  of  such  a
			  	situation.    	Let  us  note  that  no  serious  a~~ention  at  all  has  been  devoted  to   	this
			  	phenomenon  in  science,   	alth~ugh  in  the  literature  on  court  psychology  there  is
			  	mention  of  the  extremely  unfavorable  conditions  under  which  an  investigator
			  	frequently  has  to  work.    	[10]    	It  is  clear  that  not  only  investigators,  but  the
			  	majority  of  law  appliers  have  occasion  to  come  up  against  the  opposition  of  in-
			  	terested  persons.    	Overcoming  this  negative  phenomenon  goes  beyond  the  framewoz�k
			  	of  a  purely  psycho.logical  question,   	since  the  problem  takes  cn  a  rather  broad
			  	social  importance.    	This  is  a  result  above  all  of  the  fact  that  the  application
			  	of  law  is  a  powerful  activity  in  the  regulation  of  social,   	including  personal,
			  	interests.    	Hence,   	the  inevitability  of  overcoming  conflicts  and  contradictions
			  	between  the  interests  of  different  people.    	It  would  seem  that  this  problem  should
			  	attract  the  attention  of  such  a  direction  of  jurisprudence  as  the  sociology  of
			  	law.    	The  study  which  has  been  conducted  has  st,own  that,   	in  the  opinion  of  inves-
			  	tigators  and  judges,   	this  factor  causes  more  harm  in  the  sphere  of  law.applica-
			  	tion  than  the  lack  of  specialization  in  work  or  shortcomings  in  the  selection  and
			  	disposition  of  cadres.
			  	The  lack  of  specialization  in  work  as  a  factor  which  gives  rise  to  errors  in  the
			  	application  of  law  is  in  ninth  place.    	The  juridical  literature  has  already  taken
			  	note  of  the  positive  influence  o~  specialization  upon  the  quality  of  law  applica-
			  	tion.     	[11,   	12]    	The  questionnaire,   	as  a  whole,   	confirmed  this  ~~onclusion.    	At  the
			  	same   	time,   	it  testifies  to  the  fact  that  law  appliers  do  not  s%e  in  a  universal
			  	and  all-embracing  specialization  a  radical  means  for  improving  the  quality  of   	the
			  	examination  and  resolution  of  cases.    	The  investigators  and  judges  who  opposed
			  	specialization  motivated  their  position  by  the  fact  that  specialization  leads  to
			  	"stereotypes"  in  work  and  narrows  the  professional  interests  of  the  law  applier.
			  	Of  317  respondant  investigators  and  ~udges,   	250  favored  the  wide  introduction  oi
			  	specialization,   	61  were  against,   	and  6  expressed  an  indiffere:ce  to  this  matter.
			  	It  is  curious  that  judges  were  more  resolute  than  investigators  in  their  opposi-
  -				tion   	to  the  idea  of  specialization:    	of  109  judges,   	33  were  against,  while  of  202
			  	investigators,   	only  28  were  opponents.

			 	The  last  and  tenth  place  in  the  overall  hierarchy  of  the  causes,of  law  applica-
			  	tion  errors  is  occupied  by  shortcomings  in  the  selection  and  disposition  of
			  	cadres.    	I  believe  that  this  evaluation  of  this  factor  reflects  the  increased
			  	level  of  the  trainfng  in  recent  years  of  cadres  of  law  appliers,   	especially  in
		     	~   	the  courts  and  investigatory  apparatus.    	The  high  professional  qualifications		~
			  	of  the  present-day  law  applier  presupposes  a  constant  improvement  of  knowledge
			  	and  skills,   	a  study  of  the  new  legislation,  and  a  generalization  of  the  practice
			  	of  examining  and  resolving  cases;    	that  is,   	it  demands  systematic  self-education,
			  	and  also  studies  at  special  seminars,   	studies  at  advanced  training  courses,   	in
			  	graduate  school,  and  so  forth.    	In  this  respect,   	interesting  replies  were  obtained
			  	from  the  investigators  and  ~udges  to  the  question  as  to  whether  they  wished  to
			  	continue  their  education.    	Such  a  desire  was  expressed  by  146  people  out  of  327
			  	(111  investigators  and  35  judges);    	122  people  (56  investigators  and  66  judges)
			  	believed  that  the  educational  level  reached  by  them  was  quite  satisfactory,  and
			  	59  people  did  not  reply.    	One  is  struck  by  the  quite  large  n~ber  of  ~udges  who
			  	do  not  see  any  necessity  for  a  further  continuation  of  their  studies.    	This  is
			  	connected,   	obviously,  with  the  age  of  the  court  workers   	(73  out  of  109  have  a
			  	work  seniority  of  10  and  more  years).    	~ao  people  expressed  a  wish  to  enter
			  	graduate  studies.    	As  for  the  investigators,   	20  stated  they  wished  to  enter  the
			  	Academy  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  17  graduate  studies,   	and  the  rest
			  	were  oriented  toward  studies  in  the  a3vanced  training  system.
			  	The  problem  of  the  selection  and  disposition  of  cadres  of  law  appliers  is  not
			  	limited,   	of  course,   	to  increasing  their  education.    	Of  great  importance  is  pro-
			  	fessional  selection  on  the  basis  of  practical,  political,  moral,   	ideological,
			  	and  psychological  qualities,   	the  creation  of  conditions  for  growth  in  work  and
			  	the  elimination  of  circumstances  which  give  rise  to  labor  turnover,  and  so  forth.
			  	What  has  been  said  means  that  superior  law  application  agencies  must  constantly
			  	give  attention  to  a  study  of  the  above  factors,  and  take  measures  to  eliminate
			  	the  negative  consequences  of  the  causes  of  errors.    	I  believe  that  the  question
			  	of  the  causes  of  errors  in  law  application  could  become  a  special  sub3ect  of
			  	discussion  at  a  sitting  of  the  Plenum  of  the  USSR  Supreme  Court  for  the  purpose
			  	of  working  out  general  recommendations.
			  	The  10  basic  above-examined  factors  which  cause  error;s  in  the  application  of  law
			  	be.long  chie.fly  to  the  so-called  external  conditions.    	But  they  have  a  tendency
			  	to  be  transformed  into  the  internal  concrete  causes  of  errors.    	For  this  reason,
			  	the  problem  of   	the  causes  of  law  application  errors  has   	to  be  studied  only  in  a~
			  	complex  of  the  external  and  internal  factors  which  influence  the  application  of
			  	law.    	It  is  not  to  be  excluded  that  in  the  individual  spheres  of  law  application
			  	(social  security,   	the  administration  of  the  economy,   	and  so  forth)   	there  are
 -			 	specific  causes  of  errors.    	The  analysis  of  the  phenomenon  which  has  been  under-
			  	taken  in  the  present  article  could  serve  as  a  methodological  "key"  for  the
			  	practice  of  branch  special  stu~iies.
