 This paper is offered as a contribution toward the
 critical evaluation of the prospects for World Communism.
 It attempts to analyze the phenomenon known as National
 Communism in contrast to International Communism.  The
 discussion is presented primarily in conceptual and specu-
 lative terms, leaving for subsequent consideration such
 pragmatic features as the power struggle within the Com-
 munist leadership and the aspirations of the non-Soviet
 peoples of the Communist Bloc.
 Although the primary purpose of the paper is to
 analyze National Communism, it also presents a tentative
 evaluation and projection of that development in relation
 to U. S. security interests.  Finally, it examines a number
 of hypotheses concerning the possible effects of National
 Communism on the world movement.
 In the past, the Communist leaders have rigidly
 maintained the doctrine of the "inevitable downfall of capi-
 talism".  There is ample evidence that they still cherish
 this belief, even though its falsehood has been proved in
 the past, as it will be in the future.  On our part there
 appears to be a growing tendency to expect an "inevitable
 downfall of Communism".  This paper submits a number
 of reflections which cast doubt on the validity of this
 expectation.

 "NATIONAL" VERSUS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM:
 A Comparative Analysis
 Introduction: Background
 1.  When Marx and Engels, in 1848, conjured up the
 "'specter of Communism", they envisaged it as an international
 phenomenon, even though they thought of .it primarily with respect
 to industrial countries where a proletariat languished under the
 exploitative whip of Capitalism.  Moreover, contrary to Com-
 munist claims, Marx and Engels were inexperienced in the tech-
 niques of revolution.  They did not outline a clear plan of action
 for the implementation cf their theses.
 2.  It was Lenin who first conceived of methods to carry
 out Marxist Communism.  Lenin's concept of internationalism
 was much broader than that of Marx-Engels.  He saw Communism
 as a.world force but he did not assume that it would, of necessity,
 be directed by one hegemonic power.  He displayed no contempt
 for small countries but, rather, insisted on. "fraternal" relations
 among CPs all over the world. It was only at the end of his life,
 and of course under Stalin's auspices, that the organization of

 World. Communism, the Comintern, came to be dominated by
 the CPSU and that Soviet supremacy emerged in the Communist
 world.
 3.  Stalin's concept of International. Communism differed
 considerably from that of Lenin.  His belief that "Socialism can
 be establi-shed in..one country" prevailed over the far more cosmom
 politan concept of Trotsky, who insisted that a "permanent revolu-
 tion" must continue until Communism had triumphed throughout the
 world.  Stalin, after having defeated Trotsky, set out to consolidate
 the gains of Communism in the USSR, and to make it the "base" of
 World Communism.  On the basis of his success in the USSR, he
 concluded that "Socialism" had to be built on the Soviet model, and
 that the CPSU, controlling the USSR, must command the fealty of
 all CPs throughout the world.  Under his guidance the Comintern
 became the instrument of Soviet Communist leadership until World
 War II.  By that time it had outlived its usefulness, and propaganda
 considerations dictated its dissolution.  The doctrine of Soviet
 leadership of World Communism had been firmly established, and
 the movement could now be adequately guided by the less militant
 instrumentality of the Cominform, or directly by the CPSU.

 4.  In Stalin's lifetime, Soviet control of International
 Communism was breach d_ twice:  first, by Tito's establishment
 of an independent type of Communism following Yugoslavia's
 ejection from the Cominform; and second, by Mao Tse-tung's
 speedy conquest of the Chinese mainland which did not conform
 to Soviet historical and ideological patterns.     In both cases,
 the Stalin regime found itself unable to prevent what amounted
 to deviation from the -orthodox. line.  Although they created dan-
 gerous precedents, these breaches of solidarity had no significant
 effects on the Stalin regime.
 5.  After Stalin's death, the rigid conception of what con-
 stitutes deviationism was loosened, and the more flexible -Leninist
 view -of relations among. "fraternal" Communist parties was found
 better adaptable to prevailing conditions.  This return to Leninism
 was furthered by the recognition that the Stalinist type of adminis-
 tration had compromised the progress of International Communism,
 thereby harming USSR interests, and, in any case, would fail
 *Chief among these is Mao's thesis of the peasantry as the spear-
 head of the Chinese revolution as opposed to the Leninist concept
 that only the industrial proletariat could aid should furnish revolu-
 tionary leadership.

 without a Stalin.  Neo-Leninism was hastened by the realiza-
 tion that the nuclear stalemate made imperative the implementa-
 tion of a new Communist strategy if the ultimate goal, Commun-
 ist-world conquest, was to be achieved.
 6.  Concessions to the Satellites and to other components
 of International Communism throughout the world were made for
 two reasons.  First, it had become essential to permit the blow-
 ing off of nationalistic steam and to loosen economic stringencies
 in an attempt to strengthen loyalties to the USSR and Communism.
 Second, it was found necessary, in pursuit of the much advertised
 relaxation of tensions, to present a more respectable front to non-
 Communist areas, especially the Mr-o-Asian neutralists.  Being
 well aware that non-Communist governments look at Communist
 organizations as conspiracies, the Kremlin strove to make them
 appear as national political parties.  In carrying this concept to
 its logical conclusion, it tacitly admitted that "proletarian inter-
 nationalism" was not sufficient to secure the loyalties of the
 parties and sympathizers in the satellites and abroad nor the res-
 pect of peoples in the free world.                         Thus it was led to allow for
 considerations of national particularities in "building kocialism".

 Terminology
 7.  This new approach is loosely called "national Com-
 munism", a term which has serious defects.  Communism, if
 it is to remain true to its long term objectives, must be "inter-
 national". . So-called national Communism is less a form of
 nationalism than a regional or local interpretation and applica-
 tion of Marxist-Leninist theory, opportunistically adapted to
 achieve certain strategic objectives.   In contrast, international
 Communism insists on a rather uniform interpretation of the
 Marxist-Leninist gospel, which can emanate only from Moscow;
 leadership of the  Soviet Party and State is .held to be imperative
 if Communism's final victory is to be won.  The emergence of
 national Communism has introduced new elements into Commun-
 ist dialectics.  Indeed, ever since Malenkov's introduction of the
 "new course", the 20th.CPSU Congress and Khrushchev's "secret"
 speech, there has been growing unrest, confusion and uncertainty
 in the Communist world.  The 30th June CPSU Resolution sought
 to reduce the disturbance, but with only limited success.
 8.  National Communism is not a uniform phenomenon.
 Its manifestations vary in every state where it has been wholly or
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : Cl -                      001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 partially adopted.  If the independent conduct of foreign rela-
 tions is the keystone of sovereignty, only Yugoslavia can be
 described as genuinely national Communist.  Communist China
 remains too deeply committed to Soviet foreign, economic and
 military policies to be counted among the genuinely national
 Communist states,  Moreover, China believes that its own
 experience can serve as a valid model for the development of
 Communism in large areas of the world, and thus it will pro-
 bably avoid overemphasis on the thesis of "multiple roads to
 Socialism".  Poland has adopted many features of national
 Communism but it cannot have an independent foreign policy
 and it remains closely bound to Bloc economy.  The Soviet
 concept of the satellites as a cordon sanitaire does not permit
 independent implementation of individual foreign policies which
 might run counter to Moscow?s interests.  Therefore, the East-
 ern European satellites patently cannot have full national. Com-
 munist status.  National Communism in the satellites is bound
 to remain limited to mere trappings of sovereignty, although
 they may be allowed to depart from the Soviet model in certain
 aspects of internal political and economic organization and methods.

 9.  In analyzing the Soviet position toward national Com-
 munism, it must first be recalled that the 30 June Resolution
 .calls for "ideological unanimity and fraternal solidarity of the
 Marxist parties" and strongly implies that this requirement
 takes precedence over "national peculiarities and the conditions
 of each country".  A PRAVDA editorial of 15 July states that
 only "among the politically immature and over-credulous may
 there be some who would fall for this claptrap of 'national
 Communism'. " Again on 24 July, PRAVDA linked ideological
 diversity with. the old errors of "reformism" and thundered:
 "To believe that the peculiarities introduced by indivi-
 dual peoples into their movement along the road to
 socialism can assume forms of estrangement in. the
 field of ideology is to draw a monstrous caricature of
 reality . . .  "
 Three days before, on.2l July, Bulganin had exhorted the Poles
 in Warsaw:
 "We cannot disregard the attempts to weaken the inter-
 national ties of the socialist camp under the banner of
 so-called 'national peculiarities', attempts to sap the
 might of the people's democratic state under the banner
 of a dubious 'extension of democracy'. "
 On.the other hand, it is significant that the Yugoslav Party paper
 BORBA, just two days before Khrushchev's trip to Belgrade,  con-

 demned by implication the intransigence of the 30 June
 "Cooperation among socialist forces cannot be limited
 to questions of practical politics or to the peace
 struggle.  It must be based on sincere belief in the
 existence of various ways to socialism. . .    Any
 centralistic organization of socialist forces - even
 if it were freed completely of hegemonic tendencies
 which never has been the case   can only harm
 socialist development . . . "
 10.  This contrast between the Soviet and Yugoslav
 concept of Communism has been highlighted by recent events
 in Poland and Hungary.  The 30 June Resolution outspokenly
 stipulated that concessions to "independence" of states and
 parties were contingent upon.abiding loyalty to the "socialist"
 cause as the USSR understands it.  Nevertheless, the pro-
 nouncements of the 20th Congress which the Soviet leaders
 have frequently reiterated, have created a cleavage between
 "national" and international Communism.  An attempt will be
 made in this paper to analyze the differences between these
 two types of Communism and to evaluate the findings in the
 light of US security interests and possible future developments.

 Essential Characteristics of International Communism
 and National Communism,
 Ideology
 A Comparative Analysis
 11.  Belief in the Marxist-Leninist ideology is a
 fundamental requirement for every Communist.  The univer-
 sal adoption of this secular religion is the avowed goal of
 Communism, and its acceptance by Communists throughout
 the world gives it an international basis, despite national
 diversities.
 a.  The Stalinist concept of International Com-
 munism presupposed a central direction for all the
 components of world Communism.  The Soviet model
 was to be followed and no deviation was permitted.
 Among the Communist parties, the CPSU was the
 unique fountainhead of wisdom and ideological inter-
 pretation; the Communist bloc was a monolithic unit,
 firmly welded along political, economic and military
 lines.  This extremely rigid doctrine has, indeed,
 been loosened by Stalin's successors, but the Soviet
 position of pre-eminence in.the Communist World
 has not been relinquished.

 b.  National Communism is also based upon
 Marxism-Leninism but it qualifies this adherence
 by claiming its own right of doctrinal interpretation
 in accordance with local conditions and national
 self-interest.  Moreover, while it still looks to
 the USSR as primus inter pares of the Bloc,  it no
 longer feels bound to follow the Soviet model
 exclusively in "building socialism".
 The Party
 12.  The unique status of the Communist Party is
 the cardinal doctrine of Leninism which international and
 national Communism both acknowledge.  The Party is the
 "spearhead of the revolution" and the indispensable leader-
 ship organization during the dictatorship of the proletariat.
 Without it, the Communist state is unthinkable.
 a.  The Leninist concept of the Party requires
 absolute domination over the organs of government.
 Stalin, during the pre-war period of his rule, followed
 this doctrine and as General Secretary of the Party,
 -10-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 was doubly interested in enhancing its power for his
 own. purposes.  However, after World War II, the
 concentration of State and Party leadership in Stalin's
 person brought about some diminution of Party
 influence; Stalin was the Party and he left it little
 maneuverability.  The Statutes of the 19th CPSU Con-
 gress indicated this decrease of the Party's power
 position and the deterioration of its, Leninist
 character. _ Stalin's death abruptly ended this develop-
 ment. -Once again, the Party became supreme.  In
 this respect, the "return to Leninism1" was genuine.
 b.  The status of the Party under national Com-
 munism cannot be defined so clearly; it varies with
 the type of leadership and the geographical location.
 For example, in countries contiguous to the USSR or
 Communist China, the Party's power tends to be
 greater than in Yugoslavia.  Generally, national Com-
 munism's trend toward decentralization of administra-
 tion - and economy would tend to make the Party a high
 level guide whose primary task is to provide broad

 counsel instead of detailed orders.  As a result, the
 executive power of government, especially in imple-
 ment ng overall policies, would increase and lead to
 more articulate divi&ions between Party and State.
 Nevertheless, the body politic of a national Commune
 ist state remains within the framework of the one-
 party dictatorship, even though its Party apparatus
 is more flexible and accommodating to the State's
 requirements.  Since Party and government are
 interlocking and are often represented by identical
 officials, no State-Party antagonism or clash of
 interests need arise.

 13.  In the fields of economic planning and organiza-
 tion, the differences between international and national Com-
 munism come into clearest focus.  It is here that the interests
 of the Soviet state may collide with those of other Communist
 states, regardless of ideological affinities.

 a.  The USSR, leading international Communism,
 has sought to build a monolithic bloc economy in which
 detailed economic tasks and norms are assigned to each
 member.    A CEMAmtype* of organization probably is
 considered essential for directing and coordinating the
 overall Kremlin plan.  Strengthening the Bloc economy
 by "scientific" planning also strengthens the Soviet
 economy and thereby assures the position of the USSR
 as the "base" of World Communism.  This concept of
 a Communist economic master plan does not appear to
 have been abandoned in the turbulent course of post-
 20th Congress events.  The doctrinal "liberalization"
 proclaimed at the Congress applies only to the methods
 employed by individual countries to fulfill their "norms
 and not to the basic roles of their economies.
 '.g CEMA, i.e. Council for Economic Mutual Assistance, is a
 Moscow controlled organization, set up for the purpose of coor-
 dinating and integrating satellite economy with that of the USSR,
 iii accordance with Moscow?s economic master plan for the Orbit.

 b.  National Communism regards its own economic
 welfare as basic to the survival of Communism within its
 own borders and, by extension, of Communism throughout
 the world.  It resents Soviet economic dictation with its
 depressing effect on local living standards.  It does not
 accept the pace of industr. l:ization imposed by international
 Communist doctrine, nor the principle of compulsory agri-
 cultural collectivization.  It does not seek to eliminate
 government control of national economy nor to initiate non-
 socialist methods.  But it tends to leave the implementation
 of the nation?s master plan to local enterprises, to decen-
 tralize the national economy and to direct its efforts toward
 better living conditions rather than the achievement of speci-
 fic Soviet assignments.  However, the economies of such
 national Communist countries as already exist are compara-
 tively weak and, with the exception of Yugoslavia, trading
 possibilities with non-Communist countries are as yet quite
 limited.  Thus, satellite states, even if they were to estab-
 lish national Communist regimes, would still be obliged to
 depend on Soviet help which could be obtained only if they
 remained within the Soviet economic empire.  But even if

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 they became less dependent on.Soviet assistance, they
 would hardly be permitted to break out of CEMA.
 Intra-Communist Coordination
 14.  Leninism presupposes close cooperation between Com-
 munist governments and parties throughout the world.  It considers
 the integral and total coordination of policies and tactics to be
 imperative, embracing the political, economic, military, socio-
 logical and cultural fields.  Implicit in this approach is the subor-
 dination of national interests to Communist objectives.
 a.  International Communism adheres to this line.  The
 Communist Bloc is to be strengthened by economic integration
 (cf. above, 13. a.).  Its military organization aims at coordin-
 ating Communist forces throughout the Bloc with those of the
 USSRin such fields as training, weapons parity and centrally
 directed strategy.  International Communism seeks to
 identify "national" defense with defense of the Bloc in
 general and the USSR in particular.
 b.  National Communism tends to accept a certain
 degree of coordination but is wary of total integration.  It

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 aspires to deal with the USSR as nation to nation, in
 the traditional sense, hoping to minimize CPSU intru-
 sion.  It is willing to accept a close affiliation of Bloc
 economies, provided this will not adversely affect its
 own economy and living standard.  It will accept Soviet
 military aid and counsel, since it needs weapons and
 technical advice which it cannot obtain from the West.
 But it opposes the infiltration of its armed forces by
 Soviet officers and technicians.  In general, it does not
 believe that its own nationalism must of necessity be
 suppressed in order to achieve Communist objectives;
 it sees possibilities for combining national with Commun-
 ist interests according to Togliatti's concept of "poly--
 centrism".  It might agree that there should be ideologi-
 cal unity but would hold that this does not have to impair
 national independence.
 The Class Struggle
 15.  The doctrine of the class struggle which would end only
 after the destruction of the bourgeoisie, capitalism and imperialism,
 has been one of the cardinal points of Marxism-Leninism.
 -I&-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08: CIA-                      001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 a.  For international Communism, this concept is
 basic and untouchable.  It is not subject to super-
 structural changes.  To relinquish the class struggle
 would be like renouncing the creed of dialectics.  The
 November 1956 issue of the CPSU magazine PARTINAYA
 ZHIZN' reiterated that "the construction of socialism
 is impossible without a class struggle".  This struggle
 is not always possible by means of-open aggression or
 violence; it must also be carried on through a vast pro-
 gram of subversion, sabotage, infiltration, espionage
 and propaganda.  In the non-Communist world, Party
 cadres, underground organizations and Communist fronts
 are in charge of implementing Communist policies, with
 the CPs acting as transmission belts for Soviet orders.
 Within the Bloc, naked force will be unhesitatingly applied,
 as the Hungarian example has shown, wherever the doctrine
 shows signs of deviating toward "reformism".
 b.  National Communist regimes are first of all con-
 cerned with the consolidation of their own independence,
 standard of living and social problems.
 It may therefore
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 be assumed that domestic energies will be spent on
 internal reconstruction rather than on an activist class
 struggle to which lip service will be paid in a perfunc-
 tory manre r.  The issue of the international class
 struggle will remain, for a while at least, in abeyance,
 but will not be formally abandoned so long as Marxism-
 Leninism continues to be the guiding ideology.  Given
 a chance, national Communist regimes may seek to
 influence and win the cooperation of labor movements
 in non-Communist countries and to exploit nationalistic
 aspirations of the "neutral" or uncommitted nations.
 As national CPs acquire the appearance of respectable
 political parties in many parts of the world, they may no
 longer be looked upon as conspirators and may have
 excellent prospects for building up united fronts with
 Socialists.
 The Meaning of International and National Communism for US
 Security
 16.  In estimating the significance of different types of
 Communism for US security, it is necessary to differentiate
 -18-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RTYR80-01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 between short and long range effects.  In the near future, a
 monolithic Communist bloc under Moscow's leadership would
 obviously be far more dangerous than a decentralized, or
 "polycentric" group of national Communist states, primarily
 concerned with their own welfare and unlikely to indulge in
 Communist missionary work abroad.      But in the long run,
 Soviet absolutism in the Communist orbit, unless greatly
 modified, might further undermine the loyalty and reliability
 of the satellites and possibly lead to the deterioration of
 Communist Parties in the Free World.  On the other hand, a
 polycentric league of Communist nations, based not only on a
 common ideology but also on similarity of national interests,
 voluntarily cooperating and working toward eventual Commun-
 ist victory along independent lines, might prove to be
 extremely dangerous for the US and its allies.  Such a league
 might appear most attractive to the neutralist nations, many
 of which are already tending toward socialism.
 17.  It is true that the concept of National Communism,
 despite basic Soviet objections (see para. 9.), has made some
 headway.       Events since Stalin's death have unquestionably
 -19-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-014 158000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 shocked many of the faithful, and have created contradictions
 within the Communist world.  However, this should not
 obscure the prospect that Communism, led by two large and
 powerful countries, will eventually absorb the blows which it
 has received since the 20th CPSU Congress.  National Com-
 munism will probably continue to be an element of disturbance
 and contradiction, but it will nevertheless remain basically
 loyal to Marxism-Leninism and will work toward eventual
 destruction of evolutionary democracy.
 18.  The short range aspects of Communism's threat
 to US and Western security;, if measured in terms of Interna-
 tional and National Communism, may be outlined. as follows:
 a.  With the help of its organizational weapons,
 International Communism will continue to stimulate un-
 rest in the political, economic and cultural fields.  Even
 though the Soviet Communist leaders probably seek to
 avoid general war, owing to the nuclear threat, to their
 economic needs, and. to the realization that the Satellites
 are not reliable, they will continue to use their military
 establishment directly or indirectly as an instrument of
 -20-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 pressure both inside and outside the Bloc.  Such pres-
 sure might be used liberally in conjunction with other
 means of political warfare, since the Kremlin probably
 discounts the likelihood of Western nuclear retaliation.
 It probably considers that it can pursue activist policies
 much farther without running into unacceptable risks.
 b.  National Communist states, on the other hand,
 are less likely, for the time being, to initiate or follow
 reckless policies.  They must consolidate their gains,
 strengthen their economies and firm up their "indepen-
 dence".  Moreover, they seek an end of Soviet occupation
 and the ouster of Soviet nationals who have penetrated
 their armed forces as advisers, technicians andofficers.
 Nevertheless, it is possible, and even probable, that the
 national Communist states will have to play the role of
 respectable fronts for Soviet manipulations.  It is con-
 ceivable that such activities may not necessarily be
 recognizable as such by national Communist regimes
 or avoidable if Moscow orders them.
 19.  In the economic field, the interests of Soviet and
 -2T?-
 IMF-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 national Communisms are at variance.  On the one hand, the
 USSR will continue to strive for maximum influence on the
 economic policies of the satellites and for the further integra-
 tion of the Bloc.  On the other hand, economic necessities in
 national Communist countries will overshadow, for the time
 being, ideological affinities and beliefs. If the USSR remained
 adamant in limiting satellite economic contacts with the Free
 World, economic deterioration could lead to more unrest,
 rebellion and serious dislocation within the Soviet orbit.  Such
 policy, obviously, would not be in the best interest of the USSR.
 By permitting the satellites some economic rapprochement with
 non-orbit countries, the USSR might achieve certain benefits to
 itself, despite the risks involved in exposing them to non-
 Communist influence.  In any event, the effectiveness of the
 Bloc - whether monolithic or polycentric - will remain impaired
 so long as serious economic deficiencies exist in the Satellites.
 20.  In the military field the Hungarian events have demon-
 strated that Moscow can no longer be confident of the reliability
 of the satellite armed forces.  Recognition of this situation should
 modify the Western estimate on the anti-Communist resistance
 -22-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 potential, at least for the near future.  Continued Soviet
 absolutism would probably perpetuate and deepen. the unrelia-
 bility of Satellite forces.  However, a polycentric organiza-
 tion of nominally independent national Communist states, .
 enjoying relatively decent living conditions and the symbols
 of nationhood, might change the mood of these forces and
 perhaps even permit the eventual development of greater
 reliability.
 21.  If developments should favor progress toward inde-
 pendence and local deviations from the Soviet model (such as
 the end of agricultural collectivization), the gulf between the
 USSR and national Communist countries might widen, thereby
 strengthening national pride, and weakening established doc-
 trines.  Such developments could, in. the end, lead to a loosen-
 ing of Communist solidarity, even though an appearance of bloc
 unity vis-a-vis capitalism and imperialism might be maintained.
 The need of national Communist countries for peace and economic
 improvement would undermine the Leninist character of the
 regimes and promote efforts toward a modus vivendi with the
 non-Communist world.  It is questionable, however, whether
 -23-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 the Soviet Communists would permit such a situation to
 develop.  So long as Communism can uphold the fundamentals
 of Marxism-Leninism, with its implacable hostility to the
 "imperialistic" West, the Sino-Soviet Bloc in ideological,
 economic and military respects probably will eventually re-
 gain its cohesiveness.
 Some Hypothetical Future Developments
 22.  There is ample evidence that the post-Stalin
 methodological changes and the revision of certain unreward-
 ing Stalinist policies not only have left untouched the basic
 structure of the Soviet concept of state and society but have
 considerably enhanced the strength of the CPSU, which still
 remains the "spearhead of revolution".  There is further
 evidence that genuine Titoism, specifically the independent
 conduct of foreign affairs, is confined to Yugoslavia and that
 the 20th Congress doctrine of "various roads to socialism"
 will be forcibly watered down in those satellite states which
 are part of the Soviet cordon sanitaire . Thus national
 Communism, so-called, may well serve as a strategic
 auxiliary of the USSR and as a propaganda weapon for Soviet
 purposes in Asia and Africa to boot.  The lesson taught
 Approved For Release 1999/0910i CIA-RDP 0.- 01445R000100030001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 the CPSU by Stalin's attitude toward the Yugoslav deviation has
 been learned and applied.  Can those changes, permitted in
 satellite states as well as in the Communist Parties outside
 the Communist orbit, leave residues which may, in the long
 run, affect the character of Communism?  And if so, in what
 way and to what extent? While it is, of course, impossible to
 foresee such developments with any degree of accuracy, the
 following hypothetical thoughts are submitted for consideration.
 A return.to Stalinism proper probably is believed inadvisable
 by the Soviet leaders under present conditions.  Leninism
 provides the Kremlin with a policy sufficiently elastic and
 aggressive to cope with a variety of developments which may
 result from the end of the Stalinist imperium.   Ruling out the
 resumption of Stalinism, the following possibilities present
 themselves-
 a.  Pursuant to Lenin's thesis of "fraternal
 relations" among Communists, and in literal fulfill-
 ment of the theses of the 20th Congress, monolithic
 control of satellites and CPs abroad might be relin-
 quished in favor of mere ideological affinity.  True
 national "independence" and development toward
 -25-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 "socialism" according to prevailing local conditions
 would be taken for granted.  Such.a depolarization of
 Communism, together with internal decentralization,
 would increasingly remove national Communist states
 and parties from Moscow's control and influence.
 Indeed, it could result in a retreat from Leninism
 toward a far more moderate type of socialism and an
 inevitable rapprochement with the Free World.  Moscow
 is unlikely to permit such a development to happen within
 the Bloc, since this would endanger Soviet physical secur-
 ity and contribute to a deterioration of Communism
 throughout the world.  It might even use force to prevent it.
 b.  Lenin's idea of "democratic centralism" might be
 adapted to international use in a polycentric system of
 nominally "independent" Communist states.  Such a system
 would still adhere to the doctrine that "socialism" can be
 built in various ways wit"ain a Communist league, albeit
 under Soviet leadership.  This association of states would
 remain rather loose, for the time being.  Its professed
 principles would be that socialism is better than capitalism,
 -26-
 O               i'43Y

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 that capitalism is inevitably doomed, and that a new
 order must be established based on the socialization of
 all means of production.  These Marxian theses, pro-
 pagated by an organization of nominally independent
 states, might well exert a tremendous influence in those
 areas where socialism is considered the only solution of
 contemporary problems.    Since many countries in Asia,
 Africa and part of Europe are now in this category, a
 "socialist" commonwealth, even though obviously Soviet
 directed, might have a good chance to extent its influence
 gradually throughout most of the world.  Its success and
 effectiveness would depend, of course, on the willingness
 of the Eastern European satellites to play their part, on
 the extent and character of Tito's cooperation and on the
 participation of Communist China and its Far Eastern
 satellites.  It would further depend on the stability and
 strength of the Moscow regime and its ability to carry
 out "liberalization" measures on the one hand, while
 successfully preventing secession of member states
 from the Soviet orbit on the other hand.  Without Com-

 munist China's cooperation, a Communist commonwealth
 would be limited to Eastern Europe and would offer far
 less attraction to non-orbit nations.
 c.  The Soviet leaders might decide that the creation
 of a Communist commonwealth would not be a satisfactory
 implementation of the new Leninism.  They might, instead,
 put severe limitations on national Communism, granting
 only marginal independence to the satellites, while display-
 ing a more liberal attitude toward Titoist countries not
 contiguous to USSR territory and toward parties in the
 free world.  However, there would remain the problem of
 organizational control It is not impossible that, if Moscow
 believed the time for tighter control had come, a new type
 of Comintern might be established.  In this case, conces-
 sions to Titoism would probably have to be made, in order
 to avoid splitting the Communist nations into several blocs.
 d.  There is also a possibility that the Kremlin might
 conceive of a polycantric transition period as a gigantic
 tactical maneuver.  After having served the purpose of get-
 ting Communist nations closely together under Soviet auspices,

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 the "Socialist Commonwealth" would be led back,
 more or less gradually, into a monolithically ruled
 Communist bloc.  It must be assumed that the Soviet
 leaders remain convinced that they alone can lead
 the way to the goal of a classless society and that,
 until that is reached, on grounds of tradition and of
 their power position, they must not let their control
 slip away.  Such a development could conceivably
 result in a neo-Stalinism.  However, it probably
 would be considered feasible only after most or all
 of the neutralist nations in Asia and Africa had joined
 the "Socialist Commonwealth".
 Conclusions
 23.  Recent events in Eastern Europe and, previously,
 the apparent relaxation of Soviet aggressiveness, have given
 rise to some hopes that Communism has degenerated and may
 be at the beginning of its end.  In our judgment, however, there
 is no indication that Communism is dying, even though it may
 be temporarily "indisposed".     The Soviet leaders, armed with
 -29-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100030001-4
 the faith of Marxism-Leninism, and a great power potential,
 have the resources and the determination to prevent a
 Goetterdaemmerung of Communism.   Their present favorable
 position vis-a-vis the former colonial and semi-colonial
 countries provides an additional, strong element of potential
 support.  However, the appearance of Communism has changed
 and is changing.  Such changes have frequently occurred inthe
 past.  They have often seemed to indicate a retreat from basic
 ideology but never actually were.  They simply indicated that
 in order to make better progress, different methods were being
 employed or different strategic objectives established.  In the
 past, confusion and dissension resulting from such shifts have
 always been overcome.  There is no reason to assume that this
 will not be the case again.  Whether, as has been suggested, the
 ferment created by recent events will result in an ultimate
 erosion of Communism remains to be seen.  It is suggested,
 however, that current events do not provide reliable clues to
 long-range Communist developments.  Historical experience
 has shown that the convulsions of relatively new movements
 have often been instrumental in their strengthening and resur-
 gence, albeit in different forms.

 24.  If individual national Communist states should
 prove viable in the next few years, a conversion of the cen-
 trally controlled Communist empire into a "commonwealth"
 or league of cooperative and partially coordinated national
 states would increase the total capabilities of the Communist
 sector of the world during the next generation.  The measures
 presently being used at the initiative of the Soviet leaders are
 contrived to assist the national sectors of the Soviet orbit to
 solve their more pressing internal, administrative and economic
 problems and thereby to develop a more stable, productive and
 reliable society.
 25.  Granted the primary fact of national Communism,
 namely, that each state will be run by its own Party and govern-
 ment, we believe that the common ideological positions, the
 personal associations of the leaders, the increasing power of
 the USSR and the comparable social, agricultural and industri-
 al problems facing each of the member: states provide a reason-
 ably solid basis for continuing cooperation and for a common
 attitude toward the non-socialist parts of the world.  We there-
 fore conclude that national Communism per se does not give us
 any basis to hope for a decline of Communism in the foreseeable
