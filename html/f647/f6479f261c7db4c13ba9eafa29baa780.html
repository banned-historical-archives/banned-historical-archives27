 VOL. II, No. 9
 905 16th St., N.W. ? Suite 304 ? Washington, D.C. 20006-(202) 638-4006 OCTOBER 1976
 B-1 Status
 The B-1 bomber is further delayed. On September 1 House-
 Senate conferees on defense appropriations voted to delay
 funding of the bomber until February 1, 1977, when the next
 President will be in office.
 In the interim, money will be appropriated to permit the
 management and engineering staff to keep up the operation.
 The fate of the B-1 bomber hangs on a political thread.
 Gerald Ford and the Republican Party Platform favor proceed-
 ing with construction of the badly needed B-1. It is believed
 that If Jimmy Carter is elected, the B-1 program will not pro-
 ceed.
 This should most definitely be understood by the voters and
 should affect their selection of a President.
 VOTERS HAVE CLEAR CHOICE
 The political run for the numbers is getting down to
 the wire with both Presidential nominees trying to
 catch the elusive voters.
 In analyzing Carter's meteoric popularity it should
 be recalled that, when compared with Udall and Harris,
 he appeared initially to be Conservative. He won with
 only 30%-35% of the vote-rather than great major-
 ities-in the primaries, so his backing is obviously
 very thin.
 As the campaign accelerates, it is disclosed that
 Carter's associates and advisers are much the same
 liberals who gathered around George McGovern so
 disastrously in 1972. In campaigning, Carter has made
 numerous embarrassing mistakes and many contra-
 dictory statements. (See Tax box, this page.) He
 topped himself with the unbelievable interview in
 Playboy.
 President Ford, on the other hand, had a difficult
 primary contest in every case and barely nosed out
 Ronald Reagan.
 Ford's post-Convention campaign leadership has not
 been inspiring, and his committee at times seems badly
 organized. But he has been helped by Reagan and
 Connally, two popu1.4Mw edcfte F  I   t r   ,l liQij28

 hold the Republican Party together and at the same
 time attract enough enlightened Democrats who refuse
 to hand their party over to socialists, labor leaders,
 and amalgamated troublemakers.
 For many years the liberals, socialists, and com-
 munists have denounced both major political parties,
 saying there is no real difference between them. In an
 effort to confuse the voters and keep them from the
 polls, these dissidents downgrade the importance of
 the ballot and create a feeling of frustration and futil-
 ity. They know that massive apathy provides the op-
 portunity for organized minorities and control blocs to
 take over. This happened in England and in Italy, and
 we cannot afford to have it happen here.
 This year the American people will have a much
 clearer choice at the polls than they have had in many
 Carter's Tax Reform
 'Taxes on the average citizen can somehow be lowered by
 increasing taxes on the rich." Sound good? Would-be Presi-
 dent, would-be spender and would-be tax-reformer Jimmy
 Carter thought so. By imposing taxes on "somebody else," he
 undoubtedly thought, the voters wouldn't get angry at the big
 spenders responsible for the taxes.
 Unfortunately, there aren't enough rich people to go
 around. So the money to finance the liberal-sponsored, ne-
 farious social-welfare schemes has to come from taxes on in-
 come earned by lower- and middle-income Americans.
 Let's check the facts. Of the more than 70 million tax re-
 turns filed in 1973, only one percent were filed by Americans
 with incomes of $50,000 or more, and these same people paid
 out approximately 46 percent of their income in taxes.
 Untaxed income the year before amounted to more than
 $500 billion, and the majority of it belonged to "ordinary"
 citizens: $155 billion went untaxed because of the personal ex-
 emption, $70 billion attributed to the standard deduction,
 $93 billion attributed to social benefit payment exclusions,
 $36 billion because of state and local taxes, and close to $20
 billion because of interest payments on home mortgages.
 Only by increasing taxes on lower- and middle-income tax-
 payers can anyone continue the present level of spending and
 at the same time lower taxes for anybody else.

 philosophies of the two con-

 him.
 Ford is bound by a middle-of-the-road platform
 which will satisfy all Republicans and many conserva-
 tive Democrats and Independents.
 The voters will have a clear choice between one man
 who would reduce the size of government and one who
 would only consolidate the departments and probably
 expand the existing numbers.
 One man wants to cut government ..pending; the
 other depends on the very men responsible for this
 spending for his backing.
 One man insists on a strong military establish-
 ment; the other wants further cuts in military budgets,
 which would disarm the United States at a time when
 our national security is already in jeopardy.
 One man wants to return more power to the separate
 states; the other wants a greater concentration of
 power in Washington, which would furtier expand a
 burden we can no longer endure.
 One man wants to help the business soctor increase
 its capital investment (thereby creating thousands of
 new and productive jobs, which would cit unemploy-
 ment and halt inflation); the other supports fraudulent
 schemes for government "make-work" projects.
 One man proposes to trim the profligate spending at
 HEW, bringing useless programs to an end,  and to
 cut foreign aid; the other endorses fu iher experi-
 ments in faulty welfare schemes.
 The voters this year will have a clear choice be-
 tween a return to the Conservative philosophy or the
 endorsement of a man who favors further inroads to
 destructive liberalism.
 Panama Canal Commenis
 "The United States constructed, maintained, operated, and
 defended the canal to the benefit of all nations and at a U.S.
 taxpayers' net investment of almost $6 billion over the past
 60 years. The continued efficient U.S. operation of the canal
 has resulted in major economic benefits for Panama, includ-
 ing a major contribution to that country's economy...Pana-
 ma's history of political instability, her inadec;uate military
 defense capability, and lack of technical and managerial
 skills demonstrate that Panama does not posses3 the capacity
 to manage, operate, and defend effectively thu canal.... The
 United States must insist on retaining the provisions in the
 treaty which guarantee our rights "in perpetuity" rather than
 agreeing to surrender these rights at a specified date in the
 future... .The United States must not surrender any juris-
 diction, territory, or property which is necessary for the pro-
 tection of the United States and the Western Hemisphere."
 Approve   or  e~ea rtlel
 The 94th Congress has gone home to campaign, and we
 hope the constituents carefully view the voting records of
 their representatives and don't pay too much attention to the
 campaign oratory. Never mind what he says; notice what he
 did do.
 The overall record is pretty dismal. The voice of the people
 was not as loud in the Halls of Congress as it should have
 been. Measured in terms of the nation's priorities, the record
 must be deemed nonproductive.
 In the matter of Tax Reform, the results will confound and
 confuse tax lawyers for many months to come. There was
 great talk about loopholes and inequities, but the 1,732-page
 Senate Bill adds further complications to an already overcom-
 plicated situation.
 In the matter of Energy, we find the same lack of program
 or progress. The President's plea for energy independence
 went unanswered. Research and development of sources be-
 sides oil were bogged down in bureaucratic bungling. The
 House voted not to consider a program designed to produce
 oil and gas from shale, coal gasification, and liquefaction be-
 cause it might delay the Members' departure for home. Some
 Members were more interested in breaking up or nationaliz-
 Ing the oil companies than in reducing the impediments to
 discoveries of new sources of domestic oil and gas. Result: In-
 creased cost and dependence on foreign oil.
 Programs designed to fight Crime got little or no attention.
 The Bail Reform Act, an improved drug enforcement law, and
 a recodification of the Federal Criminal Laws never came out
 of the Judiciary Committee.
 On the General Economy, only Presidential vetoes saved us
 taxpayers from a myriad of pork barrel boondoggles and
 phoney public works measures. This Congress talks economy
 but votes for Increased spending.
 All told, the Congress played at politics with added "over-
 sight" Committees challenging every Executive function
 while neglecting to properly clean up some of its own "in-
 house mess."
 With reporters swarming the halls and TV cameras grind-
 Ing, Congressional Committees and Subcommittees vied for
 public attention and the public problems went unattended.
 We hope the people will give Members of Congress their
 full attention come election time.
 FALSE ID RACKET
 The Federal Advisory Committee on False Identifica-
 tion reports that the false ID racketeers cost us upward
 of $20 billion a year.
 Some 75 specialists, ranging from FBI agents and
 Interpol consultants to social workers, form this com-
 mittee of the U.S. Attorney General. They found that
 millions of men and women-using false identifica-
 tion-steal from the food stamp program, welfare,
 Medicaid, Social Security, and so on.
 Hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens-tallied at
 8 to 12 million now in the United States-use these
 false IDs to create a tax burden of more than $12 bil-
 lion annually, which must be paid for by the taxpayer.

 Obviously, an effective weapon against false IDs is
 needed. Watch for our upcoming article on National
 Identity Cards.
 MAINLAND CHINA
 As we prophesized months ago, Mainland China is
 now in a turmoil because of the death of Mao Tse-tung.
 It is obvious that the Communist stronghold never
 really extended beyond the big cities and was usually
 enforced by terrorism and strength.
 The swing now is apparently away from Communism
 and more to middle-of-the-road programs that will per-
 mit economic development. This is on the good side be-
 cause we can be of greater help to the recovery of China
 than any other country.
 On the bad side, however, is the possibility of a
 military take-over to solve the turmoil, which would
 greatly increase the chance of China and Russia join-
 ing forces against us. This is one of the problems of
 detente which has worried us at American Cause from
 the very beginning. If the two great Communist na-
 tions join forces, it could be most dangerous for the
 free world.
 Other good news is the fact that those responsible
 for the so-called Cultural Revolution, during which time
 approximately 50 million Chinese lost their lives, have
 been placed in jail and apparently are to be purged.
 More bad news, however, is in the fact that many
 parts of China are suffering food shortages, vandalism
 is on the upswing, and the general condition of the
 people is not really as happy as the propagandists
 would have us believe. The number of refugees leav-
 ing the mainland by way of Hong Kong continues to
 increase each year.
 It would seem ideal if the new rulers on Mainland
 China could rid themselves of the evil effects of Mao's
 Communism and pattern their society more after the
 plan of Taiwan.

 U.S. SLIPPAGE TO NUMBER 2
 Brookings Institution, bastion of left-leaning, liberal
 intellectuals and oftentimes critical of American mili-
 tary spending, now admits that more money will be
 necessary for military hardware during the next dec-
 ade. There are indications that for fiscal year 1978 the
 defense budget could increase by $20 to $30 billion no
 matter who occupies the White House.
 Rep. Les Aspin (Wis.), long-time Pentagon critic,
 probably summed it up best when he conceded that
 Soviet arms' spending "cannot be ignored." It is obvi-
 ously time we realize that the Soviets are not just inter-
 ested in military parity but are aiming at superiority in
 every phase of defense.
 American Cause believes that the United States must
 wisely stand up to this threat knowing that even though
 arms races are unwanted, often costly and sometimes
 wasteful, it's a contest we can't afford to lose.
 THE CASE AGAINST DANIEL SCHORR
 The First Amendment to the Constitution of the
 United States says "Congress shall make no law...
 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." That
 is all it says.
 This is a great privilege, and the press of the United
 States certainly has taken full advantage of it, even to
 the point in many cases of unrestrained license.
 Lately, it has become the fashion of the press to wrap
 this great charter of freedom around themselves and
 proclaim their freedom to do many irregular things,
 such as publishing secret grand jury proceedings or
 secret documents that play into the hands of the na-
 tion's enemies, jeopardize the national security, or
 make more difficult the conduct of foreign affairs.
 It was in this environment that Daniel Schorr ap-
 peared on the scene.
 He obtained a copy of a secret document dealing
 with CIA activities. This document was drastically
 slanted against the CIA it contained a great mass of
