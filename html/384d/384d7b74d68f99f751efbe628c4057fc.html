 SUMMARY
 Chineso Communist spokesmen acknowledge that Mao's early
 analysts Of I;,he Chinese revolution owes a general debt to
 Lenin and Staalin, but they minimize that debt, and they con-
 coal the importance of Comintern directives in Mao's early
 thinking.  All of their specific claims for this early work
 appear to be spurious.   Mao's alleged "development" of the
 concept of "leadership of the proletariat" in 1926 is not an
 advance on Lenin's position in 1912, and even his agreement
 with Lenin on this point was inserted into Mao's works many
 years later.   Mao's alleged discovery that revolutions in
 backward countries are primarily peasant revolutions was
 anticipated by Lenin,  Stalin, and other Chinese Communist
 leaders such as Peng Pai.   Similarly, Lenin, not Mao, first
 emphasized the importance of the poor peasants in a revolu-
 tion, and, with respect to the responsiveness of the poor
 peasants to Communist party leadership, again the Chinese Com-
 munists have fal:ed a date to credit Mao with making this point
 years before the fact.   Further, Mao's alleged discovery that
 a part of the bourgeoisie was friendly to the revolution was
 simply a repetition of Lenin and Stalin.
 Subsequently, Mao made two or perhaps three contributions
 to the theory of revolution.   One of these, although forced on
 him by circumstance, was the concept of an isolated rural base
 area.   Another, although taken in part (perhaps in largest
 part) from Chu Te, was his doctrine on guerrilla warfare; So-
 viet writers themselves have paid Mao tribute in this field.
 The possible third, a development aver his early thinking,
 was Mao's moderate and conciliatory line toward capitalists
 and the capitalist economy during a revolution, a policy which
 seems to have been troublesome to Moscow at the time.  However,
 another of Mao's concepts of the middle years, the "paper
 tiger"--enjoining Communists to have faith in their eventual
 trium.ph, but to respect the enemy in particular situations--
 which is presented as a "new development of enormous signifi-
 cance" in theory,  is simply a platitude.
 The Chinese Communists believe that Mao's contributions
 to the theory of revolution-?-whether false, true, or platitu-
 dinous--are applicable to other backward countries.   For ex-
 ample, the gloss on Mao's selected works contends that other
 "colonial peoples," holding rural base areas, can wage a long
 war to encircle the cities and win a total victory, just as
 the Chinese Communists had done.

 MAO TSE-TUNG AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
 1.   REVOLUTION
 Introduction
 In his Dialectical and Historical Materialism of October
 1908,  Stalin defines historical materialism as "an applica-
 tion of the principles of dialectical materialism to the
 phenomena of the life of society, to the study of society
 and its history."  (1)  This definition is too general and
 obscures Lenin's and Stalin's special way of treating the
 .idea of historical materialism.
 Marx and Engels had discussed historical materialism
 with primary emphasis on the way in which the material pro-
 duction of goods is organized and the relations between the
 classes producing them.   Revolution would occur almost
 spontaneously as the inevitable stages of class struggle
 developed.   In their writings, the outline of the future
 society was vague.
 Lenin and Stalin shifted the emphasis slightly but de-
 cisively, concentrating in their works more on the tactics of
 revolution and less on the modes of production.  That is, as
 actual leaders as well as theorists, they constantly attempted
 to gauge the strength of political and military forces and the
 possibilities of "pushing the revolution forward," relegating
 theoretical analysis of economic factors in any country to a
 secondary position.  Thus Lenin says that,  "we Marxists have
 always been proud of the fact that by a strict analysis of
 the mass forces and mutual class relations we have been able
 to determine the expediency of this or that form of mass strug-
 gle."   (2)   The same is true of Mao Tse-tung, who, in his first
 Marxist-Leninist work (3), Analysis of the Various Classes in
 Chinese Society of March 1926 /hereafter, Analysis/, centers
 his attention on estimating th`e revolutionary po ential of
 social classes in China.
 Claims of Mao's Originality
 Chinese Communist writers have agreed with Soviet writers
 that Mao Tse-tung used Lenin's and Stalin's ideas in his

 aci;.tl.ysis of the Chineso revolution.   '1'11u.?; Chang Ju--hs:i.n states
 in 1.953 that in the period of the First Rov~olution.tiry Civil
 var' (192/1-1927) ,  "0,-.-.ado Mao ri'.;o tt~r.f?
 ?... to faithful student
 and comrade...-in-arms of Stalin, uphold the standpoint of Lenin
 and Stalin on problems of the revolt ion in China."   (4)
 Chang, however, i;liplies that there was an element of
 Urii; inaJ :l'ty Jr. Mao's analysis:   "in 1926 ('the time of the
 publication of Stalin's Prospects of tip: Chinese Revolution)
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung pub. islieu his Analysis , ' `ri `' h1c > he used
 as a basis the theories of Lenin an 7- `ta- n to arrive at a
 similar conclusion with that of Stalin on tho fundamental
 problems of the Chinese revolution." (5)  That is, Chang seems
 to feel that any careful Communist reader will know that Mao's
 Analysis was written before Stalin's Prospects, as these works
 were published in March 1926 and November l=5 respectively.
 Chang's implied claim that Mao ;vas an independent thinker
 on revolution in 1926 is supported by politburo alternate
 Chen Po-ta, who insists that,  "Both in 1927...and afterwards
 ..,.opportunis,ts...obstructed the dissemination inside the
 Chinese party of Stalin's many work:: on the Chinese question.
 There  were also language difficulties and the counterrevolu-
 tionary blockade.   For these reasons, many comrades in our
 party who were actually leading the Chinese revolution did
 not have an opportunity to make a systematic study of Stalin's
 many works on China..'. Comrade Mao Tse-tung was also one of
 them.  It was only after the cheng feng movement in 1942 that
 Stalin's works on China were sys  ma'ci.cally edited by our
 party...but despite these obstacles in dissemination, Comrade
 Mao" Tse-tung has been able to reach the same conclusions as
 Stalin on many fundamental profile:;rs through his independent
 thinking."   (6)   Another writer :says that only Stalin's Prob-
 blems of the Chinese Revolution of April 1927 was "published
 and circulated" ated" in China, at some unspecified date between 1927
 and 1936 "under conditions of bitter fighting and White -terror."
 (7)
 But neither.   Chang nor Chen snakes any reference to the
 fact that the real tactical policies, and the theoretical
 justifications of these policies, were sent to China in the
 form of numerous Comintern directives with Stalin's approval.

 "Leadership of the Proletariat"
 Chen Po-ta claims that Mao "cons:istoutly adhered to...
 the Lenin-St,tl:tn theory concerning the leadership of the
 proletariat and developed this theory in a concrete manner."
 (9) But how Mao had done this, Chen never informs us.   Chang
 Ju-hsin implies that Mao developed this theory in Analysis
 by pointing out that,  "The national bourgeoisie's a in o es-
 tablishing a state under its own rule is impracticable."  (10)
 Chang continues:   "The leader of the Chinese bourgeois-demo-
 cratic revolution against   nrx perialism and feudalism will not
 be the national bourgeoisie, but the proletariat," as this is
 a "bourgeois-democrat i.c revolution of a nnw type."   (11) To
 settle the matter decisively, lie quotes from Analysis:   "The
 leading force in our revolution is the industrxa  proletariat."
 This is merely Lenin's view of proletarian leadership in
 a revolution against feudalism--one of his revisions of Marx
 and Engels.  According to Marx and Engels, revolution in
 modern times will progress in two distinct stages:  first,   a
 "bourgeois, democratic" revolution places the bourgeoisie in
 power after an attack upon feudalism and monarchy, and, second,
 a "socialist" revolution slowly ripens and overthrows the
 bourgeoisie, establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat.
 Thus Engels says in 1848:   "Fight on bravely then, gentlemen
 of capital.   We need your help:  We need even'your rule upon
 occasions.   For it is you who must clear from our path the
 relics of the Middle Ages and of absolute monarchy.  You must
 abolish monarchy, you must centralize, you must change the
 more or less destitute classes into real proletarians--re-
 cruits for us.   It is your factories and trade connections
 'that must lay 'the foundations for the liberation of the
 proletariat. Your reward shall be a brief period of rule.
 You shall dictate laws, and bask in the sun of your own ma-
 jesty.   But remember,  'The hangman's foot is upon the thres-
 hold.. ' "   (12)
 In his Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic
 Revolution of Jun e-duty 1905, however, Lenin insists tha    he
 proletariat must not be a subsidiary to the bourgeoisie,  and
 that it must become the leader of the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution.   (13)   "Marxism teaches the proletariat not to
 keep aloof from the bourgeois revolution, not to be indifferent
 to it, not to allow the leadership of the revolution to be as-
 sumed by the bourgeoisie."   (14)   "The proletariat, being, by
 virtue of its very position, the most advanced and the only con-
 sistently revolutionary class, is for that very reason called

 upon    to play .the leading part in the general democratic
 revolutionary movement in Russia."  (15)   In the Agrarian
 Program of Social Democracy of November-December-7170     enin
 i~lrst  e1 nes t e our' leis-democratic revolution in Russia
 as a "peasant revolution" and then says that,  "The proletariat
 must in its own interest assume the leadership of the peasant
 revolution."   (16)
 Turning his attention to colonial revolutions--"national
 liberation movements in the East"--Lenin at first does not
 stress proletarian leadership of these "bourgeois, democratic"
 revolutions and seems to have believed that his Two Tactics
 thesis need not be applied to China's bourgeois revoolu ?i~'' on
 of 1911.   In hi  Democracy and Narodism in China  of July
 1912, Lenin contrasts he''? bourgeoisie o    he West who are
 "rotten to the core" with Sun Yat-sen,  "a revolutionary demo-
 crat, who symbolizes the  nobility and heroism inherent in
 a class that is on the rise."  He says:    "The Western bour-
 geoisie is in a state of decay; it is already confronted by
 its grave-digger--the proletariat.   In Asia, in contrast,
 there is still.a bourgeoisie capable of championing sincere,
 militant, consistent democracy, a worthy comrade of France's
 great enlighteners and great leaders of the close of the 18th
 century." /Lenin's emphasis]' (17)  Continuing in an orthodox
 Marxist vein, Lenin points-'to the "virgin naivete" of Sun's
 idea that "capitalism can be "prevented' in China," (18) and
 assigns the small Chinese proletariat only the task of crit-
 icizing Sun's utopias while it "defencl_.and develops the revolu-
 tionary-democratic core of his political and agrarian program."
 (19)
 By November 1912, however, Lenin is prepared to return
 to his Two Tactics thesis of proletarian (that is, Communist
 party) 'leaclerZ-lip of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. In
 his Regenerated China, he says:   "China's freedom was won by
 an alliance o  peasant democracy and  liberal bourgeoisie.
 Whether the peasants, without the leadership of a proletarian
 party, will be able to retain their democratic positions
 against the liberals, who are only waiting for a suitable no-
 men  to shift to the Right--this the near future will show."
 (20) /Lenin's emphasis?
 When, therefore,  Satlin in May 1925 calls on students
 in the University of the Toilers of the East to "ensure the
 hegemony of the proletariat" in the national-revolutionary,
 bloc (21) and Mao in March 1926 designates the industrial

 proletariat as the "leading force" in the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution,  they are not e.:pounding a now idea.
 Returning to Chang's and Chen's claims,  they are open to
 another objection: at no point in the original 1926 version
 of Analysis does Mao designate the proletariat as the "lead-
 irig'r  or c                      Why not?  Because Mao and the other Chinese Com-
 munist leaders at that time were carrying out Comintern di-
 rectives, which designated the Kuomintang (KMT) as a bloc of
 four classes and as the "lea-dbi;l" of China's democratic rev-
 olution.   The sentence which Chang is emphatic in quoting--
 "The leading force in our revolution is the industrial pro-
 letariat"--was inserted into the 1951 version of Analysis.
 (22)
 The Importance of the Peasants
 Chang Ju-hsin also claims that Mao solved the problem of
 allies in the Chinese revolution.   Chang states that,  "Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung developed Lenin's and Stalin's directives on the
 special and important role of the peasant question in colonial
 and semicolonial revolutionary movements, making a complete
 estimate of the peasants' revolutionary attitude.   He said
 that the poor and middle peasants, who compromise more than
 80 percent of China's population, are the most important and
 reliable ally of the proletariat in the democratic revolu-
 tion."   (23) Analysis (March 1926) and Report of an Investiga-
 tion Into the Peasant Movement in Hunan  Marc     2      Bre-
 a  er, epor   ,    ang continues, con ain Mao's contribution.
 In Analysis, Mao says that,  "The overwhelming majority
 of the semi tenant peasants, together with the poor peasants,
 constitute a very large section of the masses in the country-
 side.   The 'peasant problem' is essentially their problem."
 (24)   Mao centers his attention on the poor peasants even
 more forcefully in Report, the most striking thing Le ever
 wrote:
 The  main force in the countryside which has al-
 ways put up the bitterest fight is the poor peasants.
 From the period of underground organization to that
 of open organization, the poor peasants have fought
 militantly all along.   They accept most willingly the
 leadership of the Communist party.  They are the dead-

 According to Chang, therefore, Mao demonstrated original-
 ity by' maintaining' that (1) revolutions in backward countries
 (such as China) are primarily peasant revolutions and (2) the
 poor peasants are the most important force and reliable ally
 in these revolutions.
 1.  Revolutions in Backward Countries Are Primarily
 Peasant Revolutions
 In view of Lenin's statemehts as well as Stalin's and
 those of several Chinese Communists, Mao appears nbt to have
 made a contribution to theory on this point.   For it was
 Lenin who departed from Marx's reluctance to use the peasants
 as an important revolutionary fighting force.   In his Agrarian
 Program of Social Democracy of November-December 1907, Lenin
 emphatically states that,  The agrarian question /In Russia7
 is the basis of the bourgeois-democratic revolution....   We
 must have a clear idea of the character and significance of
 precisely the peasant agrarian revolution as one of the
 varieties of bourgeois revolution."  Further:   "The peasant
 revolution, as Kautsky justly pointed out, leads also to state
 bankruptcy, i.e.,  it damages the interests not only of the
 Russian, but of the whole international bourgeoisie."  Fur-

 bourgeois revolution, and failed to perceive the peculiar
 features of the present bourgeois revolution, which is
 precisely a peasant revolution...,. The Bolsheviks, on the
 other hand ...singled out the concept of peasant revolution
 as one of the varieties of bourgeois revolution.,.. Thus
 we see that Plekhanov completely collapsed on the ques-
 tion of fundamentals of the general Social -Democratic?tac-
 tics in a bourgeois revolution that can be victorious only
 as a peasant revolution."   (26)
 Later, turning to the task of formulating Communist
 tactics for backward countries of the Near East and Asia,
 Lenin in effect sees only the peasants as the revolutionary,
 force.   It is as a proponent of peasant revolutionary move-
 ments that Lenin speaks to the Second Congres of the
 Comintern in July 1920:
 The most important feature of backward coun-
 tries is that the precapitalist relations still
 prevail there and that, therefore, there can be no
 question of a purely proletarian movement in them.
 There is almost no industrial proletariat in those
 countries....   The idea of soviet organization is
 a simple one, and it can be applied not only to pro-
 letarian conditions but also to feudal and se*ifi feudal
 peasant relations ...sve must base the theses of the
 Communist International on the assumption that the
 ;peasant soviets...are applicable not only to capital-
 1st countries but also to the countries of precapital-
 ist conditions, and that it is the absolute. duty of
 thr.: Communist parties.-'.to propagate the idea of peas-
 ant soviets, the Soviets of the toiling people every-
 where ...and to try, wherever conditions permit, to
 create peasart soviets or goviets of the toilers.  (27)
 Actually, despite Lenin's directives on the importance
 of peasant revolutions for backward countries, most of the
 very early leaders of the Chinese Communist party (CCP) di-
 rected their activities toward organizing the urban working
 class, which was small in numbers.   (28)  But at least one
 prominent Chinese Communist leader, Peng Pal, who in the
 late .1 PO's became a politburo member, carried out Lenin's
 instruction to organize peasant doviets.

 In 1921, one year after he became a member of the CCP,
 Peng Pai w. nt t6'tI Ic wanatung countryside to carry out "organ-
 ization and propaganda" work among the peasants.   ?fie organ-
 ized the first village peasants' association in China in
 Kwangtung province which, by September 1922, had enrolled
 more than 500 members,   On 1 January 1923, the Haifeng County
 Peasants' Association was formally established with a mem-
 bership of about 20,000 families of i00y 000 persons, or one-
 quarter of the population of the county-,-.   By mid-1923, he
 established the Kwangtung Provincial Peasant's Association
 and raised the slogan,  "Down with the landowners;  Long live
 the peasants!"  Demands for reduction of land rent became
 demands for its total 'abolition.   Peasant struggles against
 landlords and local officials spread throughout Kwangtung
 Province and into Hupeh and Hunan.    Peasant associations
 were: firmly established in Honan by September 1925.  In
 Hunan, by late November 1926, there were 54 hsien, with a
 total registered membership in the peasants assoc ations of
 1,071,137:'.   By January 1927--when Mao began his investiga-
 tion--this number exceeded 2 ' 000, 000v (29)   Peng?Pai set up
 the first peasant soviet in China--the Haifeng Soviet Repub-
 lic of Kwangtung--in November 1927.   (30)
 Peasant revolution was rapidly developing in the rural
 areas when the KMT began its own revolutionary activities
 among the peasants in 1924.   '!n August 1926, the KMT Peasant
 Department published its declaration of Current Tactics for
 the Peasant Movement in Hunan, which extensively discussed
 policies for expanding And strengthening Hunan's peasant
 associations,  (31) especially among the "poor peasants."
 Mao did not go out to inspect these Hunan associations for
 the Central Committee of the CCP until early 1927, when he
 was also training activists for the peasant movement for the
 KbiT.
 Thus Mao was not a newcomer as a peasant organizer and
 inspector.  Moreover, he was not the first Chinese Communist
 to emp"(asize the importance of the peasants.
 In addition to Peng Pai, several Communist writers work-
 ing with the K111T's Peasant Department placed almost exclusive
 emphasis on the peasants.   In August 1925, they were desig-
 nated the "major force for destroying feudalism" by the Com-
 munist Kan Nai-kuang.   Kan says that,  "The peasant class is
 the basic class of the national revolution.   In other words,

 the peasantry is  the main force of the national revolution."
 He explicitly reverses the view held by Marxists, and, more
 often than not, by Leninists, on the role of the peasants
 as an ally of the proletariat:   "We consider that the work-
 ing class is the most reliable ally of the peasants." (32)
 Stalin, too, had underscored the importance of a peas-
 ant revolution for China before Mao stressed the point. Thus
 the Theses of the Seventh Plenum of the Comitern Executive
 Committee which Stalin and Bukharin drafted with the assist-
 ance of Tan Ping-shan, the Chinese Communist delegate,  in
 November 1926 states:
 Not to deal boldly with the agrarian question,
 not to support in their entirety the political and
 economic aims of the peasant masses would be a real
 danger ifor'.the revolution.   It would be wrong not
 to place the program of the peasant movement first
 in the program of national liberation for fear' of
 alienating the uncertain and perfidious cooperation
 of a part of the capitalist class.   (33)
 In his Prospects of the Revolution in China of November 1926,
 Stalin considered as correct the view o3'-Tan Ping-shan, who
 maintained that the immediate satisfaction of the most urgent
 peasant demands is an "essential condition for the victory
 of the Chinese revolution."   (34)
 Peasant revolution was in the air.   Inasmuch as land
 held by KMT officers was not to be confiscated, 10-IT dele-
 gate Shao Li-tzu reported to the November 1926 Comintern
 plenum that,  "Comrade Chiang Kai-shek declared in his speech
 before the members of the KMT that the Chinese revolution
 would be unthinkable if it were nuable to solve correctly
 the agrarian, i.e., the peasant question."  (35)
 2.  The Poor Peasants are the Most Important Force and
 Reliable Ally
 Lenin, not Mao, first underscored the importance of the
 or peasants in a revolutionary movement.    In his Agrarian
 r-5g-ram of Social Democracy of 1907, Lenin speaks of the
 "poor peasantry" Wilch he describes as crushed by the feudal
 landlords.   He also distinguishes a small group of "middle
 peasants, " who possess' land sufficient to conduct farming in

 Thus Lenin seems to use the designation "rural proletariat"
 as Engels had done in his The Peasant Question in France and
 Gormauy of 1894,  that :ls,  as j~oor  arm worcers a:9 d:Ls in:~t
 from bif; and small landowners.   For Lenin,  it is the rural
 proletariat who will mako the revolution in the countryside.
 Returning to Mao's Report, viewed in its time and cir-
 cumstances, Communists seem not to have considered it as a
 heresy.  Because rural revolution was rapidly increasing in
 1925 and because Stalin had designated it the "essential
 condition for the victory of the Chinese revolution" in No-
 vem'ber 1926, the Report of March 1927 seemed appropriate to
 the time.   It apparent y was a fairly accurate estimate of
 the revolutionary potential and total forces of the peasants
 in Hunan.   To provide an accurate picture of the peasants as
 he saw their activities, Mao gave the peasants credit for 70
 percent of the revolutionary work in Hunan and attributed
 only 30 percent to the Hunan urban dwellers and military units.
 That this was viewed as a useful estimate of the peas-
 ants' revolutionary enthusaism -..ather than a piece of here-
 tical writing is suggested by the fact that it was reprinted
 by the Russian-dominated CCP in its official journal (38) as
 well as by Moscow.   (39)
 Similarly, Peng Pai's reports of experiences in organiz-
 ing the first peasants' association in China in early 1920's
 and the first peasant Soviet in 1927 were reprinted in the
 Soviet publication International Literature (1932).  Moscow
 did this, despite the fact that Peng spears almost exclusive-
 ly of the peasants' revolutionary activity without any signif-
 icant urban support.   In describing Haifeng County as divided
 into two ;i::t; camps--"landowners and -the peasants"--Peng speaks
 of the workers not as leaders but as subsidiary allies of the
 peasants:   "The workers were on the side of the peasants." (40)
 That is the extent of his discussion of the workers.

 In October 1951, however, when t}o Chinese Communists
 were laboring to build Mao Tse-tung's prestige as an eminent
 theorist,  the emphasis on reportorial accuracy was replaced.
 `'.i~o1': now emphasis was on doctrinal maturity, on theoretical
 excellence.   What in March 1927, and in the years immedi-
 ately following, was viewed as a good on-the-spot account
 of the Hunan peasant revolts,  in October 1951 was viewed as
 a "brilliant" Marxist-Leninist theoretical analysis of the
 Chinese revolution in general.   As such, it was subjected
 to the test of doctrinal rather than practical accuracy,
 and as a result, the sentence slighting the "urban dwellers"
 role in the Hunan revolts was deleted.   (41)
 A doctrinal content was supplied by insertion.  Thus,
 theorist Li Ta claims that,  "In the Report, Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung established the theoretical foundation of tha worker-
 peasant alliance."   (42)   But in the original version of the
 Report, Mao does not mention the "worker-peasant alliance."
 "Another theorist, Chu Chien-nung, claims that in the Report
 Mao solved the question of leadership of the peasant revolu-
 tion.            To prove this doctrinal point, Chu cites the follow-
 ing sentence from the Report:   "The poor peasants accept
 most willingly the leadership of the Communist party." (43)
 But this crucial sentence appears only in the 1951 version
 of the Report as an insertion; it was not in the 1927 ori-
 ginal.   For the Comintern had designated the KMT as leader
 of the national revolution, not the CCP.   At the time, Mao
 was working for the KMT as well as for the CCP, and his Re-
 port was therefore published not only in the CCP's officTaT
 organ and in Moscow, but also in the weekly publication of
 the Central Executive Committee of the KMT.   (44)
 The Bourgeois Ally
 Regarding the question of allies, Li Ta claims that in
 Analysis, Mao indicated that the Chinese bourgeoisie is
 different from the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries and
 "came to the conclusion" that the "left-wing of the national
 bourgeoisie could be friendly toward the revolution."    x
 asser s   nat by including the "national bourgeoisie" in the
 worker-led united front of peasants and petty bourgeoisie,
 "   ..Comrade Mao Tse-tung has further developed the Marxist-
 Leninist theory of classes."  "Clearly, Analysis established
 the theory of a revolutionary united front led--'Ey the workers."

 Li mentions no early Communist literature on the subject
 o:f the national bourgeoisie probably because his claims would
 crumble were.- ho to do so,   For Lenin and Stalin were explicit
 in discussing the "revolutionary" section of the bourgeoisie.
 Thus in his The Stages, Trends, and Prospects of the
 Revolution of l90b"'enin ma lies a distinction between two
 sections of the Russian bourgeoisie:   "...The labor movement
 flares up into a direct revolution, while the liberal bour-
 geoisie has already united in a Constitutional-Democratic
 party and thinks of stopping the revolution by compromising
 with t:iarism.   But the radical elements of the bourgeoisie
 and petty bourgeoisie are inclined to enter into an alliance
 with the proletariat for the continuation of the revolution..,
 /tenin's emphasis? (46)
 Discussing revolution in backward countries, particularly
 in China, Stalin in 1925 speaks of the split of the "nation-
 al bourgeoisie...into a revolutionary and an anti-revolu-
 tionary wing."  "Hence the task of the Communist elements in
 the colonial countries is to link up with the revolutionary
 elements of the bourgeoisie...."   (47)  When, therefore,
 roughly one year later Mao says in Analysis that "some sec-
 tions" of Vie "middle class" (i.e., the national bourgeoisie)
 will "turn left and join the ranks of the revolution" and
 the other section will become anti-revolutionary (48), he is
 merely repeating Stalin's formulation.
 But in order to credit Mao with originality, Li Ta cites
 Chen Po-ta's statement that Mao in the 1920's "did not have
 an opportunity to make ^ systematic study of Stalin's many
 works on China."   (See page:  two,", above)  The whole basis
 of Chen's argument is untenable.   Few Communist leaders, if
 any, had the opportunity to make a "systematic" study of
 Stalin's "many" works on China.   The point is that they re-
 ceived his directives on policy regularly and in considerable
 detail through Comintern channels.   These directives in-
 cluded the matter of a united front with the "revolutionary"
 section of the bourgeoisie--a distinction which appears fre-
 quently in the writings of early Chinese Communist leaders.
 In at least one decisive case, the Comintern directive
 was given forcefully and orally in Moscow.  At the Fourth
 Congress of the Communist International, which met from 5 No-
 vember to 5 December 1922, Karl Radek attacked the Chinese

 delegates for being, too "leftist" in their view of the bour-
 geoisie.   "You must understand, comrades, that neither the
 question of socialism nox' of the Soviet republic is now the
 order of the day...the immediate task is:   (a) to organize
 the young working class;  (b) to adjust its relations with
 the revolutionary bourgeoisie elements in order to organize
 the struggle against European and Asiatic /apanese7 imperial-
 ism."  /emphasis supplied? (49)              -        -'
 To sum up, Mao Tse-tung did not make a contribution to
 the theory of historical materialism in his earliest works,
 Analysis and Rep)rt.
 The Rural Base Area
 But Communists say that in the actual conduct of life,
 in the actual direction of the party in revolution, a leader
 contributes to the theory of historical materialism as well.
 This is true, and it is in this area that Mao  has made a
 significant contribution to the theory of revolution.
 Specifically, Chen Po-ta claims that Mao "...worked out
 a series of complete conclusions:   ...that it was possible
 for the revolution to achieve victory first in the country-
 side and that it was possible to establish long-term revolu-
 tionary bases there."   (50)
 Mao and his supporters apparently believed that they had
 little choice but to achieve "victory first in the country-
 side."  In his The Chinese Revolution and the CCP of Decem-
 ber 1939, Mao says that since "powerful imperialism and its
 reactionary allies in China hove occupied China's key cities
 for a long time...," the relatively weak Communists "must
 build the backward villages into advanced, consolidated base
 areas."  (51)  The idea of a rural base area is a contribu-
 tion to the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolution.
 The prerequisities for establiishing "long-term revolu-
 tionary bases" in the countryside are enumerated by Mao in
 November 1928.  In his The Struggle in Chingkang Mountains,
 Mao says that in order to survive, an "isolated base"
 requires, "(1) a sound mass basis,  (2) a first-rate party
 organization,  (3) a Red Army of adequate strength,  (4) a
 terrain favorable to military operations, and (5) economic
 strength sufficient for self-support." (53)  We can agree

 with Chen Po-ta's statement that, "To establish revolutionary
 bases by armed force was the starting point of the road along
 which Canr,:tidv Mao Tse-tung led the revolution to nation-wide
 victory. "   (54)
 Guerrilla. Warfare
 Chen singles out guerrilla warfare, as well as rural
 bases, as an important component of Mao's theory of revolu-
 tion.   Chen says:   "The main strategy of the revolutionary
 war as expounded by Comrade Mao Tse-tung was to develop-
 guerrilla warfare to the fullest possible extent and on a
 :large scale and then, tinder certain conditions, after the
 rf:ro?wth of our strength, to transform it into regular war-
 fare,.,,"   (55)   Chen then quotes from Mao's The Chinese
 Revolution and the CPP:   ",,,the protracted revoTutior nary
 -rug& e con uc ted in such revolutionary bases is chiefly a
 peasant guerrilla war led by the Chinese Communist party...."
 Chinese claims for the originality of Mao's theory of
 guerrilla warfare tactics--some of which he took from Chu
 Te--are marked by considerable detail.   "In this series of
 lectures /-On Protracted War, 26 May to 3 June 19387, Comrade
 ,Rao Tse-tung...worked out  his strategic concept 61 'conduct-
 ing independent and isolated guerrilla warfare in mountainous
 terrain' and 'prosecuting primarily guerrilla warfare coupled
 with a war of movement in favorable circumstances' for the
 Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army."   (56)   "With
 regard to the problem of engaging the enemy, it was Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung who always determined military strategy and
 military art.  Precisely coincident with the promulgation
 of guerrilla warfare, he created his famous 16-word formula-
 tion:   'Enemy advances, we retire.  Enemy tarries, we harass.
 Enemy tires, we fight.   Enemy retires, we pursue.!..'. To
 summarize the- 25 years of experience in guerrilla warfare,
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote many famous military treatises:
 Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War, Strategic
 ?  6   ems of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War, etc.
 In these
 works,  he explains the sources, nature, and theories of war
 involved in strategic military thinking, the laws of war,
 and even problems of military art....".  (57)

 International importance is also claimed for Mao's guer-
 rilla warfare theories.   Thus Kuan Meng-chueh in 1952 states
 that Mao's Strategic, Probblems of China's Revolutionary War
 of December^1~5    "-,.-.:Ls FiiT_ 6 trie most brilliant Marxis
 works of the world Communist movement on military science."
 (53)   Kuan's statement carries considerable authority, as he
 seems to have taken it verbatim from the 30 Years of the CCP
 of July 1951., w'-rich thus far is the only o  icia    istory o
 the CCP.
 Despite their, references to Lenin and Stalin,  Soviet
 writers had paid Mao great tribute in discussing his treaties
 on guerrilla warfare.  Thus in discussing Strategic Problems
 of China's Revolutionary War, M. Mitin states :        is an
 extremely valuable and usul military text ... Mao shows him-
 self to be not only a major military figure and leader of
 great dimensions, but also a military theoretician who skill-
 fully and creatively applied Lenin's and Stalin's ideas in
 the concrete conditions of the revolutionary war in China."
 (59) I. Plyshevskiy and A. Sobolev state that,  "Mao Tse-
 tung's  working out of strategic and tactical problems is, an
 important contribution to the art of warfare."   (60)  This
 Plyshevskiy-Sobolev statement, which was made in a review of
 the second volume of the Russian edition of Mao's Selected
 Works is one of the most unequivocal tributes to Mao ever
 ma a by Soviet writers.
 The idea of revolutionary guerrilla warfare as it was
 fully developed by Mao Tse-tung appears to be another con-
 tribution to the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolution.
 Mao's teacher in guerrilla warfare tactics was Chu Te,
 whom Major Evans F. Carlson, an early on-the-spot observer
 of Chinese Red Army tactics, described as "pre-eminent in
 his field."   (61)   It is difficult to determine the extent
 of Ma'o's debt to Chu on the matter of strategy and tactics.
 In any case, Chu steps asides
 We must not absorb foreign countries' theories
 ...mechanically and regard them as unchanging dogmas.
 The Great Revolution, the Agrarian Revolution, and
 the War of Resistance have given birth to a correct
 military science...it is a military science that has

 This is Chu's tribute to Mao in April 1945.
 To sum up, Mac) made at least two contributions to the
 Marxist-Leniniut theory of revol?ution.   Those are:   the idea
 of forming rural revolutionary bases which were self-sus-
 taining, and the idea of expanding and systematizing guer-
 rilla warfare tactics.
 Conciliation of the Capitalists
 Mao seems to have made a third contribution as well.
 Regarding the question of the "revolutionary section" of
 the national bourgeoisie (also designated as the "middle
 bourgeoisie"), Mao in his earliest works merely repeated
 the formulations of Stalin and of Comintern directives. An
 alliance with the "middle bourgeooisie", meant an alliance
 with political leaders; that is, with the "left F31T."  This
 was to be a united front "fro  above"; a direct appea' to
 the economic interests of businessmen was not envisaged.
 But in his later works, Mao attempts to gain the maximum
 number of allies by a direct appeal to-the economy,.; inter-
 ests of businessmen in the "national" or "middle" bourgeoisie.
 In effect this is a united front "fr. om below," as it included
 a promise to protect their profits and was not restricted to
 political leaders.   Thus in his The Present Situation and
 Our Tasks of December 1947, Mao ?Ztates :   "All that    a New
 Democracy revolution aims to eliminate are feudalism and
 monopoly capitalism, the landlord class and the bureaucratic-
 bourgeoisie, not capitalism in general nor the petty bour-
 geoisie nor the middle bourgeoisie_.  The existence of the
 capitalist economy of the petty bourgeoisie and the middle
 bourgeoisie must. still be permitted for a long period of
 time."  (63)
 In two respects, Mao's statement goes beyond Lenin's
 policy of tolerance towards Russian capitalists during the
 New Economic Policy (NEP) period,   First, it envisaged the
 existence of a capitalist economy for a "longi4period rather
 than for a temporary interval.   Second, Lenin carried out

 tie NEP after the Bolsheviks took over national power, but
 a~1ao pledge   o protect the economic interests of capitalist
 hc_f_ore the CCP 'took power.
 That this degree o,. moderation and conciliation towards
 capi'~alists and capitalist economy during a revolution was
 unprecedented, and troublesome for Moscow, is suggested by
 the manner in which the C'Dminform journal published Mao's
 The Present Situation and Our Tasks.   Included among the
 cue. etions wnic a the CominfoFF-e-d'il-ors made in republishing
 it is Mao's statement on sustaining the "middle bourgeoisie"
 and capi talism.   (64)
 But Mao's idea has been maintained in the CCP.   In their
 review of the fourth volume of Mao's Selected Works, two Chi-
 nese theorists state:   "Comrade Mao Tse- ung...pointed out
 that, with regard to the national bourgeoisie, we should not
 only win them over politically, but we must Also give its
 members consideration economically...."   emphasis supplied?
 (65)  Changes in the C~  s po .cy towards The capitalist
 economy after 1949 will be discussed in a later paper.
 The "Paper Tiger"
 The two theorists also claim that Mao's "paper tiger"
 concept, that is, the idea of "slighting the enemy strategical-
 ly and taking full account of him tactically," is a "new de-
 velopment of ecormous significance in the theory of Marxist-
 Leninist strategy and tactics."  (66)   It is not that at all.
 It is a platitude.   Many revolutionary leaders, including
 non-Communist nationalists.--e.g., Abd-el-Krim, the guerrilla
 leader in Morocco--measured their cloth seven times over be-
 fore acting when faced with a superior enemy force.  As a
 fighter in the cause of Soviet Communism, Stalin was a su-
 preme master,,in showing contempt for his enemy "strategically"
 while using  capitica tactically." The theorists say that
 "paper tigers.. considered on any particular sector or in
 regard to any specific struggle...are also living tigers,
 iron tigers, real tigers capable of devouring people, and
 we must use caution and carefully study the art of struggle."
 (67)  Only a fanatic or lunatic would fail to use "caution"
 when confronted with "rer,,l tigers."
 The idea of "caution" has an important place in Mao's
 "paper tiger" theory, but it is not frequently publicized.

 When it is mentioned,  it is used to provide sufficient rea-
 son for a manifest retreat. Thus in October 1958, Chou En-1.1i
 used the idea to explain to the party's propaganda depart-
 ment the Chinese Communist backdown from the venture in the
 Taiwan Strait.
 A Text .,:or Backward Countries
 The Chinese Communists believe that Mao's contributions
 to the theory of revolution should be applied to other back-
 ward countries,   When Mao's Why Can China's Red Political
 Power Exist? of October 1928 was republished in the 195.
 `c-diti o of'' his selected works, the Commission on the Selected
 Works of Mao Tse-tung, a body of the CCP central committee,
 amended one of Mao's statements.   In 1928 Mao had left it
 implicit that rural revolutionary bases could exist only
 in the unique geographical and political environment of China.
 The Commission apparently was directed to add a footnote
 which made the Chinese revolutionary experience applicable
 to other'backward countries.   The key passage in the 1951
 footnote is as follows
 Thus, just as the Chinese people have done, all
 or at least some of the colonial peoples in the East
 can hold for an extended period big or small base
 areas and revolutionary regimes, carry on a protracted
 revolutionary war to encircle the cities from the coun-
 tryside, and proceed gradually to take over the cities
 and win nationwide victory in their respective coun-
 tries.   (68)

 Russian and English journal published by the Special, De-
 artme_nt of the Far Eastern ;secretariat cf 'L he omi.n-
 torn, the Special Department was established in Irkutsk
 in 1920 annese Section was set up one year later.
 The duties of the Ch inese Section were outlined by Chang
 Tai-lei,  later a hero of t eF  Canton Commune (December
 1927), as follows:
 A Chinese Section of the Far Eastern Secretariat in
 Irkutsk is established to attend to the problems con-
 nected with relations between the CCP and the Comin-
 tern, to supply information to the CCP and to the
 R.S.F.S.R., as well as to pass on the directives of
 the Executive Committee of the Comintern to the CCP.
 The Section follows the pattern of Comintern organi-
 zation by which the Communist parties of separate
 countries serve as Sections of the Comintern. Like-
 wise, the relations between the Central Committee of
 the CCP and the Far Eastern Secretariat of the Comin-
 tern must be based on the similar principle of organi-
 zational contact.  That is, the membership of  the
 Chinese Section of the Far Eastern Secretariat will
 cons t oTthhelocal representative of the Central com-
 mittee of the CCP in the Secretariat, and the Section
 itself will be subordinated to the Secretaria.t."

 Comintern influence was exerted with increasing effective-
 ness.   The Resolution of the First CCP Congress  (July
 1921) is a short  document which rejects compromise
 with the Nationalists  (JUIT),  but the Decisions of the
 Second Congress (July .1922) attack "imperialism," drop
 the non-compromise policy in order to permit Commu-
 nists to join the KART, and provide the theoretical
 rationale that the proletariat must help the bourg-
 eoisie at this stage against "imperialism and feudui-
 ism."  The hand of the Comintern is unmistakable in
 the Decisions and in early CCP policy documents.

 62.  -Chu Te:   Military Report to the 7th Congress, CCP, given
 25 April.      , republished by Foreign Languages Press
 Peking, 1952, pp. 63-64.  According to the Japanese
 Foreign Office Information Department's 7th report--
 The History of the CCP: 19374-.Tokyo, 1927, Chu Te wrote
 Promoting Anti-Japanese Warfare (15 July 1937) and Pang
 T'e- ua  wrote On Guerrilla--War-fare (summer 1937). Early
 Chinese Communist sources indicate that Chu also wrote
 On Guerrilla Warfare (1938), On Anti-Japanese Guerrilla
 Warfare (1938),  .l xperiences and Lessons gained in the
 Past Six Months of War of  existence by the 8th Route
 Army (1938), and The Problem of  Striving for A Qum
 Dee sion Victory in the Protracted War of Resistances
 Current Chinese Communist publications m
 no mention of these works, suggesting that Chu Te's
 light has been concealed so that mao's can shine
 brighter.
