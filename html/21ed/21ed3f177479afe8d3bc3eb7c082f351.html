 September 8, 1965       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 The full value of any land, including
 any park land, taken for a road is just
 as much a part of the cost of the road
 as is the cost of labor, or of materials, or
 of engineering, or any other out-of-
 pocket expenses.
 And the public is paying both costs,
 the one consciously, the other in great
 part without realizing it.  Too many
 people have shared the infant innocence
 of Housman's poem:
 The grizzly bear is huge and wild;
 He has devoured the infant child,
 The infant child is not aware
 It has been eaten by the bear.
 Therefore, I welcome Secretary Udall's
 recent proposal that the interstate high-
 way between the Lincoln Memorial and
 the 14th Street Bridge be put wholly
 underground.
 And I especially applaud Secretary
 Udall's unanswerable demonstration that
 the real cost of the new highway in the
 tunnel would be less than if it were built
 on the surface through Potomac Park.
 The Secretary's point is simply that in
 calculating the real cost of the new high-
 way full account must be taken of the
 far greater acreage of park land which
 would be required by the Highway De-
 partment's proposed surface road, as
 well, of course, as of the value of the
 land now covered by existing roads
 which under both plans. would be re-
 stored to the park.
 The Highway Department argues that
 its surface road plan must be chosen
 because its construction cost is only $40
 million compared with $58 million of
 construction cost for Secretary Udall's
 tunnelled road.
 But the Highway Department's sur-
 face road. would take from the park 8.1
 net acres of present park land worth,
 according to the Secretary, $13 million,
 making the real cost of the Highway
 Department's road $53 million.
 Secretary Udall's tunnelled road would
 restore to the park 9.7 acres more than
 the small amount of park land it would
 actually use.  The value of this acreage
 restored to the park is $17 million.  So
 the real cost of the Secretary's tunnelled
 road would be reduced to $41 million.
 Secretary Udall's tunnelled road would
 actually cost the public $12 million less
 by any reasonable standard of account-_
 ing. And it would save the park as well.
 Fortunately, Secretary Udall-subject
 only to the approval of the National
 Capital Planning Commission, which has
 demonstrated its lively sense of the vital
 importance of our Capital City's parks-
 has full legal authority to insist on his
 position.  He could, of course, be over-
 ruled by the President, but it is incon-
 ceivable that President Johnson, who has
 so admirably launched the "Beautify
 America" campaign, would in this cru-
 cial test fEkil to support his Secretary of
 the Interior.
 Secretary Udall has pointed out that
 areas of Potomac Park already occupied
 by recent interstate highway projects for
 the approaches to the Theodore Roose-
 velt Bridge, the 14th Street Bridges and
 the Washington Channel Bridge total
 37.3 acres, valued by the Secretary at
 almost $70 million.  No compensation to
 our city's park system has been., made
 for any of this land. It is none too soon
 to apply the principle for which I have
 long been contending; namely, that if
 park land is to be taken anywhere for
 highways or any other purpose, at least
 the dollar value of the land so taken
 must be fully accounted for.
 But, though the hour is late, the Sec-
 retary's proposal can still save what re-
 mains of Potomac Park.. r I .`1 2-1
 U.S. POLICY rN VIE'T'NAM
 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, in.re-
 cent weeks we have all heard public
 assertions that U.S. policy concerning
 Vietnam has taken a swift and danger-
 ous turn.  Some Americans would have
 us believe that the course we are pursu-
 ing in that beleagured country was born
 in February of this year when air strikes
 were initiated on a regular basis against
 North Vietnam.
 While the pace of our response to
 Communist aggression has been stepped
 up, our commitment to respond by all
 necessary means is not of recent origin.
 It stretches back to the early 1950's when
 we provided military assistance to the
 French, who in those days were milita-
 rily engaged in Indochina.
 The implications of a  Communist
 takeover were well realized then, as they
 are today.  In June 1953, former Presi-
 dent  Eisenhower warned those                                                       who
 would have us disregard the fortunes of
 the small nations of southeast Asia:
 There is no free nation too humble to be
 forgotten.  All of us have learned * * * that
 all free nations must stand together, or they
 shall fall separately.
 President Eisenhower went on to state
 that to surrender Asia would mean leav-
 ing a vast portion of the population of
 the world to be mobilized by the forces
 of aggression.
 In a similar vein, John Foster Dulles,
 then our Secretary of State, observed a
 month later:
 The situation in Indochina today repre-
 sents one of the most serious present threats
 to the free world.
 Upon reflecting on these statements,
 one gets the eerie feeling that both
 speakers were describing the situation
 that prevails today-more than 12 years
 later.  Vietnam is still a small humble
 nation and the threat to its freedom
 from Communist-sponsored insurgency
 continues to be the most serious im-
 mediate threat to the free world.  But
 the important thing to remember, 12
 years later, is that it is still free.
 Each succeeding U.S. administration
 has had to answer for itself the diffi-
 cult question of the worth of this free-
 dom.  All have come to the same con-
 clusion.  President Eisenhower affirmed
 this in the unilateral declaration of the
 United States following the signing of
 the Geneva Accords when Walter Bedell
 Smith, then Undersecretary of State,
 solemnly promised  that  the  United
 States would view any renewal of ag-
 gression with grave concern and as seri-
 ously threatening international peace
 and security.
 A more. specific U.S. commitment was
 made in September 1954 when South
 22225
 Vietnam was included as a protocol state
 under the umbrella of the SEATO agree-
 ment. Consider, if you will, the warding
 of article IV of that treaty:
 Each party recognizes that aggression by
 means of armed attack in the treaty area
 *  *  *  would endanger its own peace and
 safety, and agrees that it will, in that event,
 act to meet the common danger * * * at
 the request of the government concerned.
 President Kennedy, 7 years later, faced.
 the same question. He responded:
 We are prepared to help the Republic of
 Vietnam to protect its people and to pre-
 serve its independence.
 This same promise has been stated
 many times over by President Johnson.
 And so, the American policy of com-
 mitment to South Vietnam is woven from
 the pledges of three Presidents.  But
 pledges are cheap unless backed up by
 concrete actions.
 We can all be thankful that the United
 States has, over the years, matched
 words with deeds. To have done other-
 wise would have destroyed our national
 integrity.
 Between 1953 and 1961, we provided
 the Government of South Vietnam al-
 most $1.5 billion in economic aid and
 a comparable amount in military assist-
 ance.                                                                                           U.S. economic and military mis-
 sions have been present in Vietnam since
 the days of the French. The amount of
 monetary assistance provided, and the
 number of U.S. personnel sent, have in-
 creased in response to the mounting ag-
 gression from North Vietnam.
 The theme of U.S. Presidents has been :
 We will provide all that is required to
 achieve our objectives.
 What, one may ask, are these objec-
 tives?                                                                                           In 1955, the Assistant Secretary
 of State for Far Eastern Affairs stated
 them succinctly:
 What we want in Asia is what we want
 everywhere-a world made up of independ-
 ent, responsible, democratic countries whose
 governments are devoted to the peaceful de-
 velopment of their own territory and to the
 welfare and freedom of their own people.
 Almost  10  years  later,  Ambassador
 Taylor put it this way :
 We are not looking for anything for our-
 selves.                                                                                           We are not attempting to gain a
 military foothold on the Asian continent,
 we do not seek to widen the  war.  This
 war was started by the Communists, and
 it will end when they cease their aggres-
 sion. * * * Our assistance to the Republic of
 Vietnam has cost the lives of many Amer-
 icans.                                                                                           One must recognize that others will
 be lost before this effort is completed.  But
 these sacrifices are being made in the knowl-
 edge of the far greater sacrifices which have
 been made by the Vietnamese people in their
 struggle to preserve their independence and
 to resume the progress toward well-being and
 prosperity which has been interrupted by
 aggression from the North.
 What the future holds, none can say,
 but the words of the Assistant Secretary
 of State in October 1953 are just as
 apt now as they were then when he ob-
 served, referring to the French effort
 in the Red River delta:
 The future of the world is in the hands
 * * of the infantrymen on the line * *
 in the paddy fields.
 Our policy of providing the support
 necessary to repel the aggression and

 AMERICAN LEGION ENDORSES OB-
 JECTIVES OF COLD WAR GI BILL
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 for several years, the American Legion
 has not taken a position on the cold war
 GI bill, mainly because the veterans who
 would benefit from this bill were ineligi-
 ble for membership in this fine veterans'
 organization.
 At the national convention of the
 American Legion during the last part of
 August of this year, the position of the
 American  Legion changed.  In their
 testimony before the House Veterans'
 Affairs Committee on September 2, 1965,
 on the cold war GI bill, the American
 Legion endorsed and pledged their sup-
 port for the objectives of the cold war
 GI bill.
 To illustrate their fine testimony, I ask
 unanimous consent that the statement
 made by John S. Corcoran, director of
 the National Rehabilitation Commission
 of the American Legion, before the
 House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and
 the resolution be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment and resolution were ordered to be
 printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY JOHN J. CORCORAN, DIRECTOR,
 NATIONAL REHABILITATION COMMISSION, THE
 AMERICAN LEGION, BEFORE THE COMMITTEE
 ON  VETERANS'  AFFAIRS,  HOUSE  OF  REPRE-
 SENTATIVES, ON THE COLD WAR GI BILL AND
 RELATED PROPOSALS, SEPTEMBER 2, 1965
 Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
 mittee, thank you for giving us this oppor-
 tunity to present the views of the American
 Legion on the bills now before you, which
 would provide certain benefits and services
 for cold war veterans. The American Legion
 endorses and supports the general objectives
 of those bills, and we urge your early, favor-
 able action upon them.
 For several years, our organization took no
 position upon proposals to expand the spec-
 trum of benefits available to cold war vet-
 erans.  Although frequently not understood,
 the reason was, I think, a simple and logical
 one.  It was based upon the fact that the
 proposals related to persons who had not had
 war service. The American Legion has long
 adhered to the policy of not actively support-
 ing legislation which would not directly af-
 fect war veterans.  Thus, completely with-
 out regard to the merits of the proposals, we
 declined to take a position on bills such as
 those now receiving your consideration.
 All  that  has  changed,  Mr.  Chairman.
 Circumstances, such as those that exist in
 Vietnam, now justify and, in fact, compel
 the American Legion to take an active part
 in seeking fair treatment for present mem-
 bers of the Armed Forces.                       And,, again, the
 explanation is a simple one: we believe that
 the conditions which exist in certain areas
 of the world today are creating war vet-
 erans.  Thus, we will actively support pro-
 posals aimed at benefiting those persons.
 I do not find it surprising that our organi-
 zation has concluded, even In the absence
 of a declared war, that current members of
 the Armed Forces are war veterans.   The
 Korean conflict was not a declared war. On
 theother hand, the President of the United
 States, in a recent press conference, referred
 to the conditions in Vietnam as a war. In
 short, Mr. Chairman, it appears that the
 term "war" has taken on a new and uncon-
 ventional meaning. While we hope and pray
 that there will never be another general war
 in the conventional sense, we must not close
 our  eyes  to  the  combat  conditions  that
 widely prevail, the hostilities that are taking
 place, and the acts of warfare being com-
 mitted.                                                                                     Nor, can we ignore the fact that
 our servicemen are being subjected to special
 disciplines and special deprivations; we have
 assigned them to special obligations, duties,
 and hazards.  They have earned special con-
 sideration by the Nation they serve.
 In consonance with these considerations,
 our national executive committee, on May 6,
 1965, approved the report of a special com-
 mittee, the essential point of which was the
 conclusion that persons now serving in the
 Armed Forces are war veterans.  In addi-
 tion, our national convention, on August 26,
 1965,  approved resolution  No. 125,  which
 seeks an expansion of benefits for our serv-
 icemen.                                                                                     With your permission, Mr. Chair-
 man, I would like to submit for the record a
 copy of resolution No. 125.
 You will note that our resolution seeks
 additional  benefits for persons who have
 served since August 5, 1964.  That date re-
 lates to an incident which occurred In Viet-
 nam.  The Vietnamese theater was selected,
 rather than some other post-Korea campaign
 or expedition, because of the size and scope
 of  the  combat  activity  there.  August  5,
 1964, was selected on the grounds that, prior
 to that time, our function in Vietnam was
 advisory and our military operations defen-
 sive.  As a result of aggressive acts of war
 committed against us in the Bay of Tonkin
 on August 5, however, the nature of U.S.
 military activity changed.  Consistent with
 long-established Legion policy, we feel that,
 with respect to any additional benefits made
 available by Congress, all persons who serve
 after August 5, 1964, should be treated equal-
 ly, regardless of place of service.  We do not
 favor the "hot spot" concept.
 You will note also, Mr. Chairman, that
 resolution No. 125 directs us to seek com-
 parable benefits.  That word was chosen de-
 liberately because it was recognized that the
 possibility exists that we should not seek
 identical benefits. My staff and I have been
 instructed to study this matter and to rec-
 ommend to the October 6, 1965, meeting of
 our  national  executive  committee  specifi-
 cally what benefits, and in what degree, we
 feel ought to be extended.  We returned to
 our office from the national convention on
 Monday, August 30, and we are, therefore,
 not yet prepared to comment.  We will move
 ahead rapidly, Mr. Chairman, and I do hope
 the committee will permit us, as it always
 has, to offer suggestions as we crystallize our
 thinking.
 I would like to express a personal opinion
 on one of the types of benefits being con-
 sidered, the cold war 01 bill.  This readjust-
 ment benefit appears to be the most con-
 troversial  and  was  singled     out  by  the
 Veterans' Administration witness for special
 opposition.  I cannot agree with the rea-
 sons advanced by the VA for opposing a
 cold war GI bill. VA testified that readjust-
 ment benefits should be limited to situations
 where  wartime service  sharply  disrupted
 career planning and called for special Gov-
 ernment aid to ease the transition from war-
 time  service  back  to                                                                               civilian life.  The
 American Legion believes that the men who
 are serving in our Armed Forces have had
 both their career planning and their careers
 irreparably disrupted; they will lose years
 out of their lives that they will never be
 able to make up; they are serving under
 war-like conditions and, they deserve every
 help our Government can provide to ease
 their readjustment to civilian life.
 The VA witness said, "we recognize that
 the present international situation is ex-
 tremely delicate and that some of our'serv-
 icemen are operating under combat condi-
 tions."  It has been some time since I heard
 an understatement of that magnitude.  It
 sounds like the statement of an agency
 whose opposition to attempts by this com-
 mittee  and the  Congress  to improve  the
 veterans benefits program Is becoming rou-
 tine.                                                                                                                                 It does not sound like the statement
 of an agency whose mandate is to be the
 spokesman  for veterans and  whose self-
 assigned mission is "to exercise constructive
 leadership in the field of veterans affairs."
 National Commanders and other representa-
 tives of the American Legion have visited
 our Armed Forces in Guantanamo, in West
 Berlin,  in  Strategic  Air  Command  Head-
 quarters,  and  in  Vietnam.                                                                                                                                              They  would
 scarcely describe the situation as "delicate,"
 nor would they conclude that only "some"
 servicemen are operating under combat con-
 ditions.  The Veterans' Administration seems
 to be out of touch with what's going on in
 the outside world.
 I would like to emphasize, Mr. Chairman,
 that I make no criticism of the VA personnel
 in the operating and program services, such
 as the Department of Veterans Benefits and
 the Department of Medicine and Surgery.
 Those people give every appearance of at-
 tempting to administer veterans laws in a
 generous  and  compassionate  manner.  In
 addition, in the past two decades, they have
 earned a reputation for innovation and cre-
 ative thinking, both of which have substan-
 tially improved the veterans benefits pro-
 gram.  My criticism is intended for those
 who influence and help establish national
 policy toward veterans; in short, the policy-
 makers and the decisionmakers.
 The witness for the Department of Defense
 opposed a cold war 01 bill on the theory that
 it would induce men to leave the military
 service.  The witness said that these men
 should be given assistance for education and
 training, but in a way which would not inter-
 fere with the mission of the Department of
 Defense. - We believe, Mr. Chairman, that the
 argument that a readjustment law would in-
 duce men to leave service is speculative, and
 that it Is questionable, in any event, whether
 there would be any substantial Impact upon
 the Military Establishment.  It would seem,
 also, that if there were an alternative plan
 to a cold war GI bill the Department of De-
 fense would have found it by this time.
 It is my personal conviction, Mr. Chair-
 man, that there is sufficient justification for
 some kind of cold war GI bill.  In this great
 country of ours, where our Government Is
 trying so hard to do so much for so many, is
 there any group more deserving of special
 consideration  than  the  members  of  our
 Armed Forces?   The American Legion thinks
 not.
 Thank you, again, for permitting me to
 present our views on this most important
 subject.
 RESOLUTION No. 125
 (Adopted at the 47th annual national con-
 vention of the American Legion at Port-
 land, Oreg., Aug. 24-26, 1965)
 Whereas the United States is now and has
 been for some time engaged in actions in
 various areas of the world to keep peace and
 preserve the freedom  of  friendly nations
 against aggression; and
 Whereas American fighting men have been
 and are increasingly being subjected to war-
 time conditions, are suffer:{ng casualties and
 are dying in defense of freedom loving people
 everywhere; and                      -
 Whereas the conditions to which our serv-
 icemen are being subjected are similar to
 those which existed when certain rights and
 benefits were granted to those who served
 in World War II and Korea; and
 Whereas the war veterans program is com-
 prehensive, justified, and a proven program
 supported by the American Legion and the
 general public; and
 Whereas on August 5, 1964, in Tonkin Bay
 off the coast of Vietnam aggressive acts of
 war were taken against U.S. warships which
 retaliated and since that time our country

 fail to produce adverse repercussions on its
 weaker key reserve currency partner (he
 would only have to ask the Fed or the Bank
 of England and they would soon have put
 him right concerning the pressure on ster-
 ling directly resulting from success of the
 U.S. voluntary program).  Similarly Japan,
 which had been particularly prominent in
 exploitation of the Eurodollar market, could
 not have failed to have her troubles as soon
 as the formerly freely flowing U.S. dollar
 tap was turned off.  Are the present cur-
 rency and liquidity crises that now beset
 the world at large not to be considered as
 troubles of any importance whatsoever?)
 (c)    "Canada  has  not  suffered  at  all."
 Why then the Atlantic acceptance default?
 Why the unprecedented action of the hard
 money-minded Governor of the Bank of Can-
 ada in desperately increasing the Canadian
 money  supply by  $600    million  (lest  the
 whole  flimsy Canadian finance "house      of
 cards" alarmingly collapse and Canadian ex-
 ternal insolvency nakedly revealed as a cold
 fact) ?  Yes indeed, Canada has already suf-
 fered, and despite the vaunted Russian grain
 deal coup still cannot  succeed in closing
 her chronically deflcitary payments gap vis-
 a-vis the United States.                    But the real prob-
 lem will arrive whenever the hitherto greed-
 ily blind U.S. investor in Canada becomes be-
 latedly face to face with this fact (to the dis-
 gruntlement of the head of the U.S. Treasury
 Department).
 (d) "The  less-developed  countries  are
 exempt from the effects of the program."
 (Quit true, but of what use to them when
 Mr. Fowler's conservative outlook on world
 liquidity in general serves to bar them from
 access to desperately needed capital of all
 kinds?  Of what practical value such exemp-
 tion, when even countries such as Japan
 cannot now raise in New York a miserable
 $100 million of new loans vitally needed to
 fill the gap' created by the voluntary pro-
 gram  (and the  turning off of the Euro-
 dollar tap) ?  And what are now the hopes of
 such liquidity  starved  nations  when  Mr.
 Fowler hits back so fast at his "liberally"
 siderable proportions, and the foreigners
 when out off from such supply would be in
 trouble, but not the balance-of-payments
 position of the United States).
 But (with all due apologies to the Presi-
 dent) is it not time that those in high office
 commence intelligently to "reason together,"
 instead of continuing to wash dirty American
 linen before the American and foreign pub-
 lic?   And when American exalted officials
 such as the very heads of the U.S. Treasury
 and central bank reveal to the world their
 unenlightened conservative philosophy how
 can Americans and foreigners alike possess
 any faith or confidence in the economy or
 currency of the United States.  Conversely,
 what a profound but uplifting spirit would
 be engendered were such as Mr. Donald Cook
 and Prof.  Seymour Harris  the spokesmen
 of American power and liberally enlightened
 intelligence. Would -the European central
 bankers, whom the American monetary au-
 thorities continue to cosset in search of aid
 and comfort of a sorrily considered weak
 U.S. dollar, then look contemptuously down
 on American monetary amateurs, who fail to
 convey the  overwhelming strength of the
 economy and currency of their country, while
 inviting pious foreign lectures on fiscal re-
 sponsibility                                                                                   and balance-of-payments  dis-
 cipline (how shortsighted they too are, for
 were the United States to observe their be-
 hests, Europe would soon be a truly broken
 continent) . So, before more water (or rather
 hot air)  goes over the dam let the United
 States proceed from peerless strength and the
 righteousness  of  its  cause.   As  Senators
 HARTKE and MCCARTHY so rightfully exhort
 let America at last demonstrate to the world
 bold and enlightened leadership in monetary
 affairs, and call for an early showdown on the
 issue of IMF reform and the role of gold.
 And as they perceptively point out, "the Sep-
 tember meeting of the IMF Executive Board
 will provide the proper forum for such a call."
 of liberation" and specifically referred
 to Vietnam as one such war.  "It is a
 sacred war," he said.   ,We recognize
 such wars." The West cannot let Com-
 munism succeed with this aggressive ex-
 pansionism.
 Finally, and most to the point, South
 Vietnam,. with extremely limited re-
 sources in terms of education and ex-
 perience, is struggling to develop a viable
 economy and a national identity.  The
 Vietnamese have asked, for our help.
 We are giving it. We do so in their in-
 terest, and we do so in our own clear
 self-interest.
 Our goal there is simple and forth-
 right. The United States has no designs
 whatever on resources or territory in that
 part of the world. Our national interest
 does not require that South Vietnam or
 Thailand or Laos or any other country
 of southeast Asia serve as a Western base
 or a member of the Western alliance.
 Our ultimate goal in southeast Asia, as
 in the rest of the world, is to maintain
 free and viable nations which can de-
 velop politically, economically and soci-
 ally, and which can be responsible mem-
 bers of the world community.
 We could, of course, abandon Asians
 to a Communist and Chinese expansion-
 ism by pulling out of South Vietnam and
 vacating our commitments there. To do
 so, as President Eisenhower stated in
 1959, would almost certainly "set in mo-
 tion a crumbling process that could, as
 it progressed, have grave consequences
 for us and for freedom. The remaining
 countries in southeast Asia would be
 menaced by a great flanking movement."

 orable course, it is the wise and neces-
 sary one for America.
 So I support President Johnson in the
 course of action that he has outlined.
 I support him soberly, recognizing that
 the decisions that have been reached
 will mean personal sacrifice for many
 American families.  The decisions to en-
 large draft calls, call up reserve units,
 and extend duty tours were not taken
 lightly.  They  are  the  product  of
 thorough, searching study, and a full
 and careful weighing of alternatives.
 For, as the President has stated over and
 over again, this is not a war that we
 seek.  In Vietnam as elsewhere we pre-
 fer the paths of peace.  We have come
 only with reluctance to the course of
 action now before us. We have done so
 only after exploring all valid alterna-
 tives and rejecting them as incompatible
 with our commitment to freedom and
 human dignity and our interest in in-
 creasing the stability of a divided world
 in the atomic age.
 BIG BROTHER: FDA
 Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President,
 recent hearings before the Subcommittee
 on Administrative Practice and Proce-
 dure exposed certain activities of the
 Food and Drug Administration to be dis-
 graceful and completely contrary to the
 protective guarantees of our Constitu-
 tion.
 Perhaps the most shocking of these
 exposures involved the raiding of a
 premises here in the Nation's Capital.
 This raid was reminiscent of a bygone
 era when large numbers of Federal and
 local law enforcement officials set upon
 centers of gangland activity.  True to
 form, this recent raid was preceded by
 intelligence from an FDA spy planted
 on the premises.  In authentic Holly-
 wood style, FDA agents and marshals
 descended on private property while
 local police roped off the street and held
 back the crowds.  Press reporters and
 photographers accompanied the agents
 while they ran through the premises,
 banged on doors, shouted and seized what
 they viewed as incriminating evidence.
 Three particular aspects of this epi-
 sode were especially shocking to the sub-
 committee.  First, the incursion took
 place on church property.  Second, the
 agents had no valid search warrant.
 Third, the particular objects sought and
 seized were devices used in the churches
 confessional procedure.
 Now I have no objection to the use of
 forceful tactics when the circumstances
 warrant them.  These are necessary
 when bootlegging; gambling and other
 forms of organized vice pose a real threat.
 However, it is difficult, if not impos-
 sible, to justify such offensive behavior
 by FDA agents on the property of the
 Founding Church of Scientology.
 This senseless example of bureau-
 cratic bungling is completely contrary to
 the letter and the spirit of the constitu-
 tional guarantees of this Nation and
 those of other democracies.  The whole
 disgraceful affair is offensive to the sen-
 ?sibilities of all freedom loving men,
 wherever they might live.

 The SECRETARY OF STATE,
 State Department of the United States of
 America, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIa: The enclosed copy of my letter
 of protest addressed to The Canadian Am-
 bassador to the United States, Washington,
 D.C., dated January 6, 1963, is self-explana-
 tory.
 It is my understanding that this case is
 still pending and has never been brought up
 for a hearing and  a decision before any
 court.
 Due to the obviously unduly long period of
 time which has elapsed since the described
 subject incident has occurred and the inter-
 nationally basic principles involved, I here-
 by request that you take immediate action
 to clear up  this  situation  by an official
 apology to me and all others concerned to-
 gether with definite assurances that this en-
 tirely un-American and internationally un-
 constitutional act will not be repeated, and
 that my personal property; namely (1) E-
 Meter Serial No. 782 either be returned to
 me or its purchase price of $150 (U.S.) be
 refunded to me.  And, in the case of the
 meter being returned to me that all costs of
 repairing this instrument to restore it to
 its proper, original working order be borne
 by the U.S. Government.
 Looking forward to your early reply in
 this matter, I am,
 Sincerely,

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:  I hereby wish  to
 report and register the strongest protest pos-
 sible against officials of the U.S. Government
 responsible for the following incident:
 On Friday afternoon, January 4, while at-
 tending as a resident student the Academy
 of Scientology, Founding Church of Scien-
 tology of Washington, D.C., at the above ad-
 dress, my pastoral counseling session in which
 I was receiving counseling at the time from
 my auditor, was rudely interrupted by the
 noisy entrance of a Robert Haislip, deputy
 U.S. marshal, U.S. Department of Justice,
 and another man who had a camera In his
 hand,  loudly  announcing that  they were
 U.S. xx}arshals and that they were confiscat-
 ing all E-Meters (the Hubbard Electrometer:
 an electronic device for measuring the mental
 state and change of state of homo sapiens;
 used   by  Scientology  auditors  in_ pastoral
 counseling sessions)  and Ability magazines
 (official publication of Scientology in the
 Americas), and that we should stop what we
 were doing and give up this equipment and
 materials.   Mr.  Haislip  then proceeded to
 take my auditor's E-Meter, gave no receipt
 for same and only-permitted, when asked to
 do so, that a record of the E-Meter serial
 number for identification be made.   Then
 later in the lecture hall of the Academy of
 Scientology, a John R. Pannetta, deputy U.S.
 marshal, U.S. Department of Justice (phone:
 STerling 3-5700)  took  (1)  E-Meter serial
 No. 782 (personal property belonging to me)
 from me, gave no receipt for same and only
 allowed-me to record its identifying serial
 number, in the same - manner as reported
 above.  When I queried one of the marshals
 by whose authority was this action being
 taken, he showed me an unsigned court order.
 I thoroughly resent and object to this un-
 warranted and extremely highhanded intru-
 sion on my personal, basic rights as a Ca-
 nadian citizen, and the forceful confiscation
 of my personal property (1) E-Meter serial
 No. 782 whilst I was a student here in the
 Academy of Scientology under the guidance
 of  the  Founding  Church  of  Scientology,
 Washington, D.C., and an authorized visitor
 to the United States, and hereby do request
 you to take immediate action in strong pro-
 test of the unmitigated actions of U.S. Gov-
 ernment officials reported above, and have
 my personal property immediately returned
 to me.
 Thanking you for your services on my be-
 half, I remain,
 Sincerely,
 JOSEPH     F  ON U.S. POLICY IN
 ASIA
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, Joseph
 Kraft is one of our most knowledgable
 and perceptive commentators on events
 in Asia and oa U.S. policy toward that
 area. I ask unanimous consent to have
 two of his recent articles from the Wash-
 ington Post printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 REVERSE DOMINOS
 (By Joseph Kraft)
 The divorce of Singapore from Malaysia
 may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
 On the debit side, a loss of potentially
 staggering size is now cut in a relatively
 safe way.                                 On the asset side, the domino
 theory that has been the base of so much
 wrong-headed American action In Vietnam
 Is now exposed as a crude and unreliable
 guide.
 From the outset, back in 1963, the Malay-
 sian Federation was  a chancy thing.   It
 rested on the natural economic association
 of the great Island port of Singapore with
 the hinterland of the Malayan peninsula.
 But Singapore is dominated by Chinese led by
 a Socialist trades unionist, Lee Kuan Yew,
 while the peninsula is dominated by Malay
 Moslems led by a golf-playing dynast, Tunku
 (or Prince) Abdul Ranman.
 To achieve federation at all it was thus
 necessary to fuse two hostile nationalities
 under two different kinds of political lead-
 ership.  For cold war political purposes it
 was deemed necessary to keep the Chinese
 and their leftwing leader in the minority.
 To do that, it was necessary to add to the
 Federation two former British protectorates
 in Borneo-Sarawak and Sabah.
 Their  inclusion  precipitated  Indonesian
 territorial  claims against  the Federation.
 As a guarantee of the Federation's security,
 British forces based on Singapore came into
 action. That In turn     invited the charge
 that the     whole Federation was a put-up
 Western piece  of Imperialism directed by
 the United States against the Indonesians
 and their chief ally in the world, Communist
 China.
 Thus, step by step, there was built up,
 from local economic necessity, a network of
 commitments that came to involve the great
 powers.  In Malaysia, the peace of the world
 was made to rest on a ramshackle structure
 of conflicting claims and competing nation-
 alisms.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE       September 8, 1965
 The withdrawal of Singapore from the
 Federation moves toward a safe scaling down.
 of that crazy system.  All the details of di-
 vorce seem to have been worked out by
 advance agreement between the Tunku and
 Lee.  Indeed, it was precisely because they
 made their arrangements in advance and in
 secret, that the whole world was surprised
 by the divorce.
 But what does all this have to do with the
 domino theory?  Well, the theory is that the
 states of southeast Asia are like a row of
 dominoes with Vietnam in the van; and that
 Vietnam must be given external support, be-
 cause if she falls, the others will come tum-
 bling after.  The events in Malaysia, however,
 offer vital evidence against the theory in two
 ways.
 First, it is plain that the weakness of the
 Asian states springs more from internal di-
 vision than external pressure.  The best way
 to shore up these states is by moving toward
 solidly based local regimes-as the Tunku is
 trying to do in Malaysia, and as Lee is trying
 to do in Singapore.  Had they failed to ar-
 range a divorce, the Federation would prob-
 ably have been blown apart by friction be-
 tween Malays and Chinese.  The dominoes
 would have been falling In reverse.
 Second, the events show that the smaller
 Asian states are stabilized by simplifying
 their internal politics, not by loading them
 down with external commitments.  Vietnam
 has been in trouble steadily since World War
 II mainly because: it was encumbered In im-
 possible   outside   commitments-first                        to
 French colonialism, next to American anti-
 communism.  Thailand, by providing a base
 for American military and propaganda ef-
 forts, now court the same danger.
 Malaysia and Singapore, by reducing their
 entanglement in the East-West opposition,
 have probably improved their chances for
 survival.  They have followed the Burmese
 way of noninvolvement.  And the Burmese
 way, as the foremost of Burmese, Secretary
 General U Thant of the United Nations, once
 said: "is very appropriate in the circum-
 stances prevailing in southeast Asia."
 THE TECHNIQUE OF "As IF"
 (By Joseph Kraft)
 The recent week of secret White House
 talks on Vietnam has been widely written
 off as a charade designed to provide an ap-
 pearance of deep deliberation for decisions
 already taken.  In fact, the White House
 talks yielded a basic change in the pace and
 direction of American policy in the Par East.
 President  Johnson  has  now  explicitly
 broken away from a policy that was leading
 to an early and direct military clash with
 mainland China.  And he did it in a way
 that enabled all of his advisers to go along
 with the new policy, though most of them
 had been leading advocates of the old policy.
 To understand the breadth of the decision,
 it is necessary to have a grasp of the strategic
 view of Asia held in the highest military
 circles.  In this sophisticated and cogent
 view, the only threat to the American posi-
 tion in the western Pacific comes from Com-
 munist China.  American superiority in the
 air and in nuclear weapons would make it
 relatively easy to handle China at present.
 But 10 years from now It may not be so
 easy.  China, the theory runs, could then
 be a real danger.
 While rarely stated, this strategic concept
 has at all times been in the background of
 American decisions in Vietnam.  The war
 there has been seen as an extension of Chi-
 nese power.  At every critical juncture, this
 country has been obliged to go in deeper in
 order to contain the Chinese.  Virtually all
 possible proposals for negotiations have been
 scotched as signs of weakness that would
 only feed the Chinese appetite for conquest.
 The most recent White House review be-
 gan just as all the previous ones.  As usual,
 there was a military crisis In Vietnam.  As
 usual, Secretary McNamara and his aides
 went out to examine the situation.       As
 usual, they came back to Washington with
 new recommendations.  As usual, these rec-
 ommendations amounted to a deeper Amer-
 ican military commitment.                                                                           As usual, the
 President's  chief foreign  policy advisers,
 McGeorge Bundy and Dean Rusk, endorsed
 the proposals.
 For many reasons, however, the President
 was instinctively suspicious of the whole
 approach.    His most important former Sen-
 ate  Colleagues--RICHARD B. RUSSELL,                                                                               CLIN-
 TON                                                                          P.  ANDERSON,  J. WILLIAM        FULBRIGHT,
 EVERETT M. DIRKSEN, MIKE MANSFIELD-were
 expressing their doubts on the matter.  The
 press was just then full of stories showing
 how President Kennedy had been trapped
 by his advisers in the Bay of Pigs fiasco.
 But the real art was not to have doubts.
 The  real  art  was  to  communicate  these
 doubts in a way that would carry weight
 with the President's military and political
 advisers.  Mr. Johnson alone, achieved that
 trick.  He did it by the device of posing
 what may be called "as if" questions.
 He listened carefully to all the recommen-
 dations.                                                                                     He then asked his advisers to con-
 sider the situation, as if all the proposals
 had been adopted.  What would the Other
 side do then?  And where would that leave
 the United States?
 At one point, in fact, the President said:
 "I want every man in this room to think
 where we will be 3 months from now; where
 we will be 6 months from now; where we will
 be a year from now; where we will be 5 years
 from now; where we will be 10 years from
 now."
 When the answers to the "as if" questions
 finally came in, the President had on hand
 not only what he was being asked to do now,
 but also the whole scenario for the future.
 It was apparent that what the military
 wanted was: first, a major effort to drive the
 Vietcong guerillas out of South Vietnam;
 second, an all-out bombing attack on North
 Vietnam; and third, in the likely event of
 intervention by Peiping air raids on modern
 military installations that would set China
 back for at least a decade.  A big Asian war,
 in other words, was just around the corner.
 With  that ugly              prospect  exposed,  the
 President's  advisers        were  at  last  able to
 back away from the position they had en-
 dorsed so many times before.  They agreed
 with the President that it was necessary to
 change the scenario.         Though they accepted
 the immediate military requests, they also
 moved, for the first time really, to open a
 number  of  doors            for  a  settlement  in
 Vietnam.
 The new moves may not work.                They may
 not-and this would be tragic-be pushed
 very long or very hard.      But for the time
 being the United States is not on a collision
 course with China.           By the technique of
 as if," the President has been able to assert
 the political over the military logic.
 TRIBUTE TO ADLAI STEVENSON
 Mr. MONDALE.                 Mr. President, the
 past weeks have seen an outpouring of
 countless eulogies honoring  a  great
 American, Adlai E. Stevenson. They
 have come from all parts Of the world.
 They have lauded the way he uplifted
 American politics, by his nobility of ex-
 pression and his stanch - dedication to
 the betterment of America and mankind.
 Many of these eulogies have been printed
 in the RECORD, and they form an endur-
 ing monument to the respect and affec-
 tion felt by men all over the world to-
 ward Adlai Stevenson.
 I would like to add one more, an ex-
 ceptionally fine statement by a distin-
 guished Minnesotan.  Edward Barsnesc,
 former editor of the Pope County Trib-
 une of Glenwood, Minn. I have known
 Ed for a good amount of time, and I
 have always admired the fine human
 quality of his writing.  I feel that his
 editorial, "Stevenson Belongs to the
 Ages," is one of the best he has ever
 written.
 In particular, he points to striking
 similarities in the lives of Adlai Steven-
 son and our late President, John Ken-
 nedy.
 Kennedy and Stevenson were products of
 the same school of thought, ideals, and as-
 pirations.  Both men were keen students of
 the Bible, and quoted frequently from the
 oldest book in the world.  They were steeped
 in the great literature of the world and
 especially that of England.  The utterances
 of  the  great thinkers of the  past,  great
 thoughts that had stood the test of time,
 became a part of them and their lives.  Both
 were men who dared to back up their con-
 victions and in no uncertain terms.                                                                                                                                            Neither
 of them were politicians in the true sense
 of the word.  When asked about their stand
 on a controversial question, they came forth
 with an answer that could easily be under-
 stood.  Support and votes might be lost
 temporarily, but the future of humanity
 meant more to them.  Both are now dead
 but what they stood for lives on.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this editorial by Ed Barsness
 be printed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 STEVENSON BELONGS TO THE AGES
 (By Edward E. Bareness)
 A great American once said, "I would rather
 be right than to be President."  The same
 might well be said about Adlai Stevenson
 who passed away suddenly in London last
 week, while on duty as U.S. Ambassador to
 the United Nations.  Stevenson and the late
 President Kennedy were the two most out-
 standing men in the world in this genera-
 tion and will live on in history with men
 like Lincoln and Gladstone.
 Kennedy and Stevenson had very much in
 common.  They were both great intellectual
 men, men who understood the past and who
 had the ability to look into the future and
 to see the turn of events. Both loved justice
 and peace and were against tyranny the
 world over.  With them their objectives be-
 came an obsession and as for their dreams,
 they never let them die in spite of setbacks
 and opposition.  Both men lived for some-
 thing bigger than themselves.   History is
 too near to both these men to give them
 the proper place in the annals of the com-
 ing generation, but when their history is
 written, they will be credited with changing
 world thought and giving humanity a new
 vision.   This  was  what  both  men  lived
 and died for.   When these two men appeared
 on the scene, politics and much legislation
 had sunk into a sordid mess and people
 were becoming disillusioned and becoming
 resigned to a world without hope or escape.
 Kennedy and Stevenson brought hope and
 cheer where  there  was  despair,  and  our
 Nation and the thinking world, moved into
 new fields.
 Kennedy and Stevenson were products of
 the same school of thought, ideals and as-
 pirations.   Both men were keen students
 of the Bible and quoted frequently from
 the oldest book in the world.  They were
 steeped in the great literature of the world
 and especially that of England. The utter-
 ances of the great thinkers of the past, great
 thoughts that had stood the test of time,

 became a part of them and their lives. Both
 were men who dared to back up their con-
 victions and in no uncertain terms.  Neither
 of them were politicians in the true sense of
 the word.  When asked about their stand on
 a controversial question, they came forth
 with an answer that could be easily under-
 stood.                    Support and votes might be lost
 temporarily, but the future of humanity
 meant more to them.  Both are now dead but
 what they stood for lives on.
 Adlai Stevenson was a candidate for Presi-
 dent of the United States in 1952 and 1956.
 Unfortunately for Stevenson he ran against
 a returning war hero, Dwight Eisenhower,
 and all his qualifications did not count. The
 fact that one party had been in power so
 many years worked against Stevenson. Al-
 though he lost heavily, he drew to his side
 the most ardent followers and' admirers that
 any candidate has ever had.  These follow-
 ers caught the great dreams of Stevenson
 and  they  never  lost  them.   Stevenson's
 dream  revived the  Democratic  Party and
 gave it the great strength that it has today.
 The Stevenson dream for humanity will go
 on.  He was a modern crusader.
 Stevenson's greatest dream and hope was
 the United Nations and he was there when
 the United Nations was born in San Fran-
 cisco in 1945.  He knew at that time that
 all the objectives of the United Nations could
 not be realized in one generation and that
 law .could not make all the peoples of the
 world behave. He knew that erring hu-
 manity in an imperfect world could only
 realize perfection by degrees.  It was for-
 tunate for humanity and the world that
 President Kennedy appointed Stevenson as
 our representative to the United Nations
 and that he was able to labor there in these
 troublesome years.   By his work here, he
 became a world figure and was looked up to
 by the nations of the world as an outstand-
 ing  statesman whose first objective  was
 world peace.
 Stevenson put every ounce of energy he
 had into the United Nations and he was
 constantly on the go trying to the last to get
 the majority of the nations to work to-
 gether for the good of humanity.  He was
 aware of the storm clouds that hovered so
 near, but he knew that the masses of the
 World want peace more than anything else
 and he kept on working until he died with
 his boots on-the way he would have wanted
 to go.
 Many great men have not been recognized
 in their time and among them can be men-
 tioned Lincoln and Kennedy.  After they
 are gone  the world wakes up to the fact

 hamlets have benefited very little from their
 own production or from American aid.
 They regard their leaders in Saigon as
 merely the successors of the French colonial
 regime, with upper-class urban Vietnamese

 WAR IN EVERY HAMLET
 The central question, therefore, is to think
 about this political problem as steadfastly
 as the Marines thought about their military
 problem  at  Chulai  last  week.   American
 military power can hold bases on the sea, it
 can win time, but the war is going on every
 night in every hamlet in the country, and
 that is a different problem.
 Ambassador Lodge will be confronted by
 the problem this week when he calls on the
 leaders of the South Vietnamese      Govern-
 ment.  It will not be easy. Premier Nguyen
 Cao Ky indicated before Mr. Lodge arrived
 that  he  was  not  enthusiastic  about  Mr.
 Lodge's mission.
 When the Ambassador arrived the Premier
 was out of the country, giving advice to other
 leaders, in Taiwan and Thailand, about the
 importance  of  unity  and  social  justice,
 which are central problems right here.
 Accordingly, there is a tendency in the
 U.S. mission here to say with considerable
 reluctance and self-doubt that while     the
 South Vietnamese really should deal with
 the problem in the hamlets, they will prob-
 ably not do the job, and the United States
 will have to take it on.
 Mr. Lodge's conviction is that the South
 Vietnamese must take over the social revolu-
 tion from the Communists.  He emphasized
 this when he arrived.  But his problem is
 that  the  Vietnamese  leaders  are  willing
 neither to take the leadership nor to accept
 American leadership in this exercise.
 Faced with this problem, American leaders
 are tempted at the moment to give up trying
 to  persuade  the   Vietnamese  Government
 and, though they do not quite admit it, to
 sidestep the Vietnamese Government and in
 the process to replace it.                  -
 The victory at Chulai has encouraged this
 tendency.  The U.S. Army and Air Force
 give the impression that they are yearning
 to prove elsewhere that they can be as effec-
 tive as the Marines, and in limited areas,
 where the military situation favors Ameri-
 can power, as at Chulai, this may help.
 But the huge problem of the hamlets and
 the country as a whole remains, and no one
 in  the  American  leadership  here  really
 believes that it can be solved without the
 cooperation and enthusiasm of the South
 Vietnamese Government and people.
 AFTER VICTORY, WHAT?
 There  is  another  aspect,  a long-range
 aspect, to this issue.  The basic policy of
 the United States in Vietnam is to create a
 military stalemate that will lead to a nego-
 tiated settlement in which American power
 can be withdrawn from this peninsula.
 Such a policy assumes that the South Viet-
 namese will be able to govern and protect
 the country after the Americans leave, but
 there is no evidence that they have this ca-
 pacity, no evidence that they are developing

 this capacity-indeed, no evidence that the
 'United States is determined to prepare them
 for the day when they will have to take over.
 Ambassador Lodge,  therefore, Is a key
 figure in this problem as he begins his mis-
 sion with the Vietnamese leaders this week,
 and he has to work within two policy guide-
 lines that may well be contradictory.
 He Is expected to cooperate primarily with
 any government here that to anti-Commu-
 nist.  The present South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment certainly meets this test:  It is op-
 posed to the effort of the Communists to
 take over the country by force.
 But at the same time it is essentially a
 Saigon group, remote from the problems of
 the people on the land and in the hamlets
 and backed by the urban upper class, which
 is undoubtedly anti-Communist too.  That
 class is opposed to the social revolution that
 the  peasants  want  and  the Communists
 promise.
 The second policy guideline before the Am-
 bassador takes account of this point.                       Presi-
 dent Johnson is constantly replying to critics
 by maintaining that he is following in Viet-
 nam a policy originally introduced by Pres-
 ident Dwight D. Eisenhower.  But that pol-
 icy emphasized-and the Johnson adminis-
 tration endorses the emphasis--that Ameri-
 can aid is to be given to South Vietnam "pro-
 vided that your Government is prepared to
 give assurances as to the standards of per-
 formance it would, be able to maintain."
 REFORMS DEMANDED
 An Eisenhower directive of October 23,
 1954, added that "the Government of the
 United States expects that this aid will be
 met by performance on the part of the Gov-
 ernment of Vietnam in undertaking needed
 reforms * * * responsive to the nationalist
 aspirations of Its people, so enlightened In
 purpose and effective in performance, that it
 will be respected both at home and abroad

 CHULAI:  TSW POLITICIANS AND THE MARINES
 (By James Reston)
 CHULAI,  August 21.-The victory of the
 marines here on this lonely shoreline of the
 central Vietnamese lowlands helps clarify
 the military situation, but does not clarify--
 and may even confuse.-the political prob-
 lem.
 The power of America in these limited
 military enclaves by the sea is formidable.
 Particularly when the effective field of battle
 is limited by a mountain range close to the
 shore, as it is here, and the enemy cannot
 launch equal air and naval power from the
 water, the firepower of the American forces
 is almost insurmountable.
 This is particularly true when such power
 is exercised by brave and processional men
 and nobody who has had even a glimpse of
 the marines here this week is likely to ques-
 tion that they )mow what they are doing
 and have the skill to do it.
 SECID'IITY HAVEN
 The  American  positions  on  this  coast,
 therefore, are as secure as anything can be

 The American effort can hold places like
 Chulai, and can therefore gain time, but the
 decisive question is what the South Viet-
 namese are going to do with the time.
 This  apparently  was  what  Ambassador
 Henry Cabot Lodge was hinting at discreet-
 ly in his statement at the airport in Saigon
 when he arrived.
 He said that the United States was com-
 mitted to seeing that the military attack
 on South Vietnam "must and will be ward-
 ed off," but he emphasized that this fight
 merely "gives us all the opportunity to bring
 about a true revolution which will make pos-
 sible a new and better life for the Vietnamese
 people."
 ESSENCE OT VICTORY
 This may sound like the usual soaring jar-
 gon out of the State Department, and it an-
 noys a lot of people, who say quite rightly
 that without military victories there will be
 no feeling of security among the people, and
 therefore that military victory is paramount.
 Yet it is also true that military victories,
 particularly at lonely military bases along
 the coast, will not win the country.
 In fact it is almost a cliche to say in
 Saigon, not only in the American Embassy
 but even in the American military compound,
 that while victory at Chulai was important
 and even essential, it will be necessary in the
 end to win the people in order to win the
 war.
 anced, it is clear that the absolute power
 of fixing salaries should be with the Con-
 gress and not given to the administra-
 tion.
 The Power of the Congress to veto a
 decision already made by the ' adminis-
 tration is a weak and unsatisfactory sub-
 stitute for the initial and final power now
 residing in Congress either to raise or
 lower the pay of public servants and
 officials.
 Throughout the history of our coun-
 try, the Congress has exercised the power
 to fix pay :levels and assume the respon-
 sibility to provide the moneys needed to
 meet the pay levels which it fixed.  Un-
 der the administration's proposal, it is
 intended that this historic power and
 responsibility of the legislative branch
 will be modified.
 The proposal is not sound and I will
 not support it.  I am in agreement with
 the views expressed by Senator A. S.
 MIKE  MON RONEY,  the chairman of the
 Post Office and Civil Service Committee,
 on this important subject.

 soloist having just returned from a tour
 with the celebrated Sousa Band.  Dr.
 Meyers-who in June 1965     received
 an honorary degree from Muhlenberg
 College-has played with many other
 great bands, notably those of Pryor,
 Conway, and Liberatti.
 But his very special pride is the Allen-
 town Band, . which is described in the
 following words by John Y. Kohl, long-
 time editor of the Sunday Call-Chronicle
 of that city, recently retired but still
 active in the writing of news about the
 theater, music, and the, arts. Says Mr.
 Kohl :
 The  Allentown Band  has  been  offering
 concerts since the afternoon of July 4, 1828,
 and thereby lays claim to being America's
 oldest band.
 But far more ilnportant,  Allentown be-
 lieves that its band is also "the best band in
 the land."
 And there is plenty of competent testi-
 mony to support the claim.
 Sousa, Creatore, Goldman-in fact prac-
 tically all the great bandmasters, living and
 dead-are as one in their praise of the Al-
 lentown Band as the best. "town" band in
 the country.
 Allentownians like to remember when the
 renowned John Philip Sousa, who recruited
 no less than 18 members of the All~ntown
 Band for his own famous organization, said:
 "I hope my own band sounds that good."
 Creatore announced, "I have never heard
 a local band so good," while Goldman's ap-
 praisal was, "The Allentown Band is without
 a doubt the finest organized band in Amer-
 ica."
 And Herbert L. Clark, the dean of cornet
 soloists,  was  equally emphatic,  "No other
 city in the country can boast of such a fine
 band."
 The emphasis, of course, is placed on the
 category, the town band, or what Goldman
 termed     the  "organized"  band  as  distin-
 guished from the professional band and the
 military band.
 Playing in a town band is purely an avoca-
 tion for its members who earn their living
 in fields other than music.  Every commu-
 nity, large or small, has a town band, some-
 times several.
 So the Allentown Band is a town band but
 with a difference and what a difference.
 There is nothing desultory about the Al-
 lentown Band.  It is as tightly operated as
 any of the professional bands., Membership
 is based strictly on performance and no chair
 is a sacrosanct by reason of seniority or per-
 sonal popularity.
 Attendance at rehearsals, for which there
 is, of course, no remuneration, is obligatory,,
 yet many of the members come from a wide
 area about Allentown and provide their own
 transportation.
 Most remarkable is the fact that the band
 has a waiting list of no less than 300 from
 cities and towns throughout eastern Penn-
 sylvania.
 The opportunity of playing good music and
 playing it well in company with other musi-
 cians of equally high caliber is the motivat-
 ing factor that has created this phenomenon
 among "town" bands.
 True, the. band fills many engagements,
 for which, as a unionized group, it is paid,
 but  the  individual recompense  is  only a
 minor factor compared with, the prestige of
 membership in the famous Allentown Band.
 The schedule of engagements during every
 summer    season  takes  the, band  afield
 throughout this part of Pennsylvania, many
 as repeat events year after year.  Its occa-
 sional forays to more distant points, in the
 eastern United States and Canada, never fail
 to bring acclaim couched in almost unbeliev-
 able superlatives.
 The fame the band holds in the band world
 itself is being popularly enhanced in late
 years by its recordings.
 The conductor and guiding genius of this
 really outstanding organization is one of
 Allentown's own, Dr. Albertus L. Meyers,
 whose name has become synonymous with
 that of the band itself.
 Great as was the band throughout its en-
 tire history and great as were predecessor
 conductors who inspired its longevity, with-
 out pause for 137 years, Meyers has brought
 to it the eminence it holds today.
 He is constantly in demand as a guest con-
 ductor and has led many of today's great
 bands.
 As early as 1939, Meyers was named by Kay
 Kyser, on a nationwide radio program, as
 one of the five most famous band leaders,
 living or dead, The others were Sousa, Pryor,
 Goldman and Creatore.
 At 75, "Bert" Meyers, still of youthful vigor
 and appearance, is thus the only one of the
 famous quintette living today and Allentown
 is planning a communitywide tribute to him
 during the week of September 6.
 A concert in the park to top all such events
 locally is on the echedule, plus a testimonial
 dinner on the succeeding evening, with some
 of the Nation's greatest bandmasters in at-
 tendance.
 Of course, the Allentown Band will play
 at both functions, although the likelihood is
 that Meyers will not be on the podium what
 with all the other talented conductors on
 hand to take over.
 That   Allentown's   nationally   famous
 "town" band, which Meyers feels was never
 better, will acquit itself magnificently is a
 foregone conclusion.
 Albertus L. Meyers received his formal
 education in the public schools of Allen-
 town,  Pa.,  and  Muhlenberg  College.
 "Bert," as he is popularly known to his
 friends, started the study of music at the
 age of 9.  He studied piano, pipe organ,
 harmony, and theory under Dr. Clement
 Marcks.    He became a soloist on the
 French horn and cornet and had the
 benefit of instruction on the former from
 Anton  Homer  and from Herbert L.
 Clarke and Signor Liberatti on the cor-
 net. He also studied band and orchestra
 arranging with the late Vernon Knauss.
 Professionally, he has played for many
 years in the theaters of Allentown, in-
 cluding 2 years with Donald Voorhees.
 He played trumpet under Victor Her-
 bert's personal direction for his operetta
 "Naughty Marietta" and "The Red Mill."
 He played first horn in Liberatti's band
 and cornet with the bands of Arthur
 Pryor and Patrick Conway.  He was the
 cornet soloist with John Philip Sousa and
 his band.  After leaving the Sousa band,
 he was elected conductor of the famous
 Allentown Band in 1926, a position he
 still holds.
 Mr. Meyers has had many honors con-
 ferred upon him and has filled engage-
 ments as guest conductor for the follow-
 22355
 rector at Allentown High School, where
 his marching and concert bands are a
 legend.  More recently, he has been di-
 rector of instrumental music at Muhlen-
 berg College.
 Mr. Meyers is a member of the select
 American  Bandmaster's  Association,
 Pennsylvania Music Educator's Associa-
 tion, charter member of the Pennsyl-
 vania Bandmaster's Association, and the
 Sousa Band Fraternal Society, member-
 ship in which is limited to those who
 played with the great Sousa and his
 band.

 THE NEED %POR A14 ALLIED EFFORT
 IN VIETNAM
 (Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr.
 CLEVELAND)   was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MOORE.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 pleased to join with my colleague Mr.
 Rogers of Florida in introducing legisla-
 tion to attempt to prevent our allies from
 trading with the enemy. The bill would
 prohibit the transportation of goods, to
 or from U.S. ports, aboard ships of any
 foreign country which allows ships sail-
 ing under the flag of that country to be
 used in trade with Communist North
 Vietnam.
 Mr. Speaker, the realization that the
 war in Vietnam is an American war
 should not come as much of a surprise
 to us. There is no question in my mind
 that the United States, as the leader
 of the free world, does in fact have the
 obligation to insure that the unprotected
 nations of the world have the, right to
 freedom and peace.  However, I have
 great difficulty in understanding why our
 Nation, great and powerful as it is, must
 shoulder the entire burden.
 Within the last few years we have dis-
 covered that our containment policy has
 not worked as well against Asian com-
 munism as it did against Soviet com-
 munism in Europe.  The geography of
 the area, the nature of our overextended
 military  and  political  commitments
 there, the naive and neutralist mentality
 of the peoples whose homelands we are
 struggling to save from aggressive Chi-
 nese communism, and the insufficiency
 of our own resources to cope with this
 gigantic problem-all of those. and cer-
 tain other forces have brought us to the
 present impasse.
 The unfortunate phase of this involve-
 ing professional bands: the U.S. Marine
 Band, the U.S. Air Force Band, the Gold-
 man Band, the Armco Band of Middle-
 town, Ohio, the Philco Band, and the                                                            ment is that there seems no easy and

 indifference of the peoples directly con-
 cerned have brought about an unenviable,
 'impossible situation.
 When we committed ourselves to the
 defense of these countries against surg-
 ing, revolutionary Chinese communism,
 we were not alone in this undertaking.
 Other governments also vowed to join us
 in this task.  Alliances were formed and
 specific agreements were signed for this
 purpose.  And, of course, the govern-
 ments of the countries threatened by
 communism solemnly and gladly under-
 took to deal effectively with Communists
 within their respective countries..  Sub-
 sequently, however, the Chinese threat
 seemed real and the Communists in these
 countries, instead of being held down,
 were gathering strength and gaining the
 upper hand against inefficient and cor-
 rupt governments.  Then we felt that
 we had to intervene.  We did this in
 South Vietnam in order to strengthen
 the government there so that it could and
 would stave off the deadly Communist
 threat.  That well-intended move was a
 factor in creating the very delicate, dif-
 ficult and dangerous situation in Viet-
 nam today.
 Four years ago, I complained of free
 world shipping to Communist bloc na-
 tions and recently our colleague, the
 gentleman from Michigan, Mr. CHAMBER-
 LAIN,            again called this matter to our
 attention.
 According to unclassified figures avail-
 able  through  Defense  Department
 sources, 476 ships flying the flags of free
 world nations called at North Vietnam
 ports during the period between Jan-
 uary 1964 and June 1965.
 Incredible as it may seem, our friends
 sent more than a ship a day last year to
 supply our enemy, even as our own troops
 were being killed by the North Viet-
 namese officered and supplied Vietcong.
 I do not believe that the cargoes being
 unloaded in Hanoi by our friends are
 clot of a military value.  I say, Mr.
 Speaker, that any supplies received by
 the Hanoi Government are needed by
 them and consequently are used to defeat
 our efforts to contain the Communist
 spread in southeast Asia.
 My personal feeling and honest opinion
 about our commitment in Vietnam is that
 we have overextended ourselves.  We
 have burdened ourselves with far heavier
 and onerous responsibilities that cannot
 be discharged honorably alone  In our
 use of American ports by ships of any
 foreign nation which allows its ships to
 trade with the North Vietnamese. Maybe
 then our allies will realize that they, too.
 have an obligation to defend the freedom
 which their young men no doubt cherish
 as much as ours.

 Mr. HATHAWAY) was granted permission

 Mr. OTTINGER.  Mr. Speaker, many
 suburban and rural communities sur-
 rounding our great metropolitan com-
 plexes are facing a threat of serious pro-
 portions.  As the power needs of the
 metropolitan centers grow, and it is nec-
 essary to bring electrical power in from
 great distances, these communities are
 being dissected by a growing number of
 power corridors bringing high-voltage
 lines in on unsightly towers.  In some
 areas, such as Westchester and Putnam
 Counties in my own district, the destruc-
 tion is already so great as to jeopardize
 the continued existence of these towns
 as attractive residential communities.
 in others, such as Chester County, Pa.,
 and Baltimore County, Md., the power
 lines are, so to speak, beating at the
 door.  These communities are disturbed
 And fighting.
 For many hundreds of other towns
 and villages, the ruthless destruction of
 ,steel towers and high-voltage lines is
 merely on the drawing boards or hidden
 in utility master plans for the future.
 These communities are sleeping.
 The awareness, however, is spreading.

 WITHIN REASON
 (By Betsy Holland Gehman)
 The British have a lovely slang phrase
 that enjoys enormous currency.  Its uses are,
 rather unfortunately universal. The phrase
 is "Up the pole." Its meaning: balmy, bats,
 nutty, craze, insane.  To say that someone is
 up the pole is to say that he is a completely
 hopeless case.
 It is, therefore, not unmeaningful when I
 make note of the fact (as I'm sure you have)
 that, since last May the New York Telephone
 Co.  has  had  an  army  of  men  in  what
 appears to be permanent residence up the
 pole.  Out along Route No. 301, where a full
 platoon of green-clad men have been playing
 Shipwreck   Kelly  for 3 full months  now,
 Ma Bell has added a few little homey touches
 to their aeries, such as tents to protect them
 from the sun and rain, plus, I have no doubt,
 Bunsen burners for cookouts, sleeping bags,
 and  a full supply  of Band-Aids--not for
 themselves, but to patch up the shabby little
 connective wires that somehow seem to get
 all discombobulated every time we have the
 teensiest  little  thunderstorm, a  natural
 enough phenomenon to everyone but the
 telephone company.
 As this paper fully chronicled on May 13
 last, our community's telephone service had
 been disrupted for over a week, in some cases
 2 weeks, by a lightning strike on one tele-
 phone pole.  Again, early this month, hun-
 dreds of telephones were put out of service by
 the   ever-popular   lightning.  This   time,
 silence reigned for 5 days.  As an added fillip,
 my own phone was given an extra 12-hour
 vacation last Friday due to a short circuit.
 When I called the repair service, the man who
 answered assured me nothing could be done
 about it until the next day, because "all the
 men are dog tired from being up the poles
 since May."  This same man of science in-
 formed me that the telephone company was
 not prepared to "fight God."  Now I submit
 that is a piece of blasphemy I would have
 preferred not to hear.  I do not believe God
 is responsibile for the willfulness, sloth and
 profit-grabbing  self-interest the  telephone
 company quite ostentatiously indulges it-
 self in.
 It should interest everyone who has been
 victimized by this particular public utility
 and  that  includes  everyone  who  has  a
 phone, to learn that Congressman RICHARD
 L. OTTINGEn introduced three bills before the
 89th Congress August  17,  1965,  that are
 aimed at getting all overhead transmission
 lines put underground where they belong.
 He pointed out that today more than 300,-
 000 miles of overhead transmission lines eat
 up a total of nearly 7 million acres of land.
 He pointed out that expert evaluation has
 shown that as much as 300 acres of property

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS.

 HON. DAVID S. KING
 OF 'UTAH IN THE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. KING of Utah. Mr. Speaker, the
 tremendous feats of space exploration
 of the last few years have been marred
 by the aura of secrecy and the cut-
 throat competition between the United
 States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet
 Union particularly has kept its space
 program shrouded in mystery; telling
 virtually  nothing  about  experiments
 either before or after they are attempted,
 and revealing very little about whatever
 scientific facts are subsequently uncov-
 ered.  The United States has at least
 told beforehand of launches and has re-
 leased most scientific discoveries made.
 More importantly, the United States has
 allowed the space flights of her astro-
 nauts to be reported in their entirety
 to the country and the world.
 1A new step toward understanding was
 taken recently when President Johnson
 Invited the Soviet Union to send an ob-
 server to the launching of Gemini 6 in
 October.  While it is not immediately
 apparent what the response of the
 Soviet Government will be, the impor-
 tance of the Johnson invitation is ap-
 parent.  The President is attempting to
 encourage communications between the
 two space giants. At the same time, he
 is demonstrating the U.S. confidence and
 capability in space.
 An editorial which appeared in the
 Salt Lake City Tribune August 27 recog-
 nizes the importance of the Johnson ven-
 ture. I think that these opinions merit
 a wider public disclosure and, therefore,
 present them, here:
 [Prom the Salt Lake Tribune, Aug. 27, 1965]
 CURTAIN LIFTS A TRIFLE
 In Inviting the Soviet Union to send a top
 scientist to the launching of Gemini 6 next
 October, President Johnson made a gesture
 of good will which emphasized the openness
 of American society.  It is also possible that,
 by providing a grandstand seat, he would like
 to Impress the Soviets with U.S. accomplish-
 ments in space exploration.
 Press dispatches from Moscow indicate the
 Kremlin is not likely to accept, perhaps be-
 lieving that Mr. Johnson hopes an exchange
 of visits can be arranged later.  The United
 States has announced its space flights in ad-
 vance and has given them full publicity while
 in progress.  The Soviet Union has been far
 more  secretive,  though  in recent months
 more and more information has been released.
 This week the Kremlin lifted the curtain a
 bit further with the premiere of a documen-
 tary film about Lt. Col. Alexei A, Leonov's first
 walk in space.   The movie shows Leonov
 emerging from Voskhod II and floating freely
 in space.  Also included are brief closeups of
 the assembly of a booster rocket, the interior
 of Voskhod II while in orbit and unusual
 scenes of the recovery of earlier cosmonauts
 along with their heat-charred space vehicles.
 The film emphasizes Soviet achievements
 without revealing Soviet secrets, a course the
 United States has always followed in the cov-
 erage of its space flights. Obviously the spur
 of competition has awakened the Kremlin to
 the value of publicity.
 We ho

 Vietcong's Goal    0ver1row of Existing
 Government
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. MATSUNAGA.  Mr. Speaker, the
 Vietcong's goal is the overthrow of the
 existing government. This is the con-
 clusion of James V. Hall, AID official in
 Vietnam and a former East-West Center
 grantee, after a tour of duty in Vietnam.
 Mr. Hall's views were expressed in an
 interview by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin
 on September 2, 1965.  The newspaper
 account reads as follows:
 NOT IDEALISTS, OFFICIAL SAYS-OVERTHROW
 REGIME Is VIETCONG GOAL
 The Vietcong should not be visualized as
 simple,                    downtrodden peasants  struggling
 against overwhelming odds.
 Neither should they be considered a col-
 lection of insidious fiends bent on terror and
 destruction,               according to  a  visiting AID
 (Agency for International Development) offi-
 cial.
 James V. Hall, AID official in Vietnam and
 a former East-West Center grantee, said last
 night "both of these idealized concepts do
 great harm to a deeper understanding of
 what is going on in Vietnam."
 Although there may be among the ranks of
 the Vietcong some idealistic young men fight-
 ing for what they believe to be right, they
 are far from being representative of the Viet-
 cong, Hall said.
 "And although there are certainly some
 insidious and diabolical thugs among the
 Vietcong,"  Hall  said,  "they,  too,  are  not
 representative of the Vietcong as a whole."
 The plan of the Vietcong, he explained, is
 "a protracted struggle conducted methodi-
 cally in order to attain specific intermediate
 objectives leading to the final overthrow of
 the existing order."
 In this master plan, Hall said, no one in-
 dividual matters; no one thing matters.
 The only thing that matters is the final
 overthrow of the existing government, he
 said.
 Concerning the civilians' role in Vietnam,
 Hall  said,  eight free  world  nations from
 Europe,  Asia,  and America are  providing
 much needed medical assistance.
 "In  all,"   he said,  "52  doctors and  147
 medical assistants from nurses to labora-
 tory technicians are working daily, sometimes
 around the clock, to save lives and provide
 medical care which could otherwise be lack-
 ing."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS

 HON. PAUL G. ROGERS
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
 er, I should like to include at this point
 in the RECORD, Virginia Prewett's recent
 column on the progress which is being
 made in the attempts to reach a solu-
 tion to the Dominican problem.  The ar-
 ticle points out the importance to the
 United States of the recent break in the
 stalemate and of the OAS action which
 helped bring that break about:
 [From the Washington (D.C.)  Daily News,
 Sept. 3, 1965]
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Poor VICTORY FOR L.B.J.
 AND OAS
 (By Virginia Prewett)
 The settlement of the Dominican stale-
 mate is a great triumph for President John-
 son's foreign policy.  It is equally a triumph
 for the OAS majority who backed up U.S.
 policy in Santo Domingo in the face of shrill
 criticism.
 Obviously, the die-hard Communists and
 the die-hard military clique in Santo Do-
 mingo will remain threats to the. Dominican
 nation's chances for peace and reconstruc-
 tion.
 But both sides have long since lost both
 their domestic and foreign support.  As the
 realities have grown clearer with time, the
 hemisphere-wide  hubbub  over        "interven-
 tion" in Santo Domingo has gradually died
 down   everywhere   except   among   the
 extremists.
 TOP CHANGE
 The most significant change of front has
 been  that  of  the Christian        Democratic
 Party.
 At one time,    this group which controls
 Chile's administration,  officially  supported
 the thesis that the OAS peace force should
 be withdrawn from Santo Domingo and the

 Chilean officials also condemned the United
 States and OAS actions in Santo Dpmingo
 as an "outrage."
 However,  the  meeting  of  hemisphere
 Christian Democratic leaders, held in Vene-
 zuela very recently, voted for the formation
 of a Dominican provisional government-the
 United States and OAS solution.
 DECLINED SUPPORT
 The 30 Christian Democrats who attended
 the meeting also declined to support the
 Christian Democratic representatives from
 the Caamano Deno camp against those from
 the junta side.  The Dominican factions were
 told to settle their own differences.
 Meanwhile, in the Dominican Republic, the

 peaceful setlement.
 For instance, the mortgr shells fired into
 the OAS peace force on the eve of the final
 accord  obviously came from the northern
 sector controlled by the Imbert forces.
 GAMBLE  FAILED
 The Imbert junta's last-gasp gamble for
 popular support on Sunday, August 29 proved
 a resounding failure.           The junta promised to
 get out 100,000 supporters.  Less than 10,000
 showed up.
 On the rebel side, the die-hard Commu-
 nist groups also failed more than once to
 prove they had popular support.  And the
 sincere  Democrats  around  Col. Caamano
 Deno have  had a prolonged object lesson
 during the months when they have been
 bottled up with the extreme leftists.
 For at the beginning of the enforced truce,
 the leftist extremists were estimated to con-
 trol less than a third of the militants around
 Colonel Caaman.o.  But Colonel. Caamano
 gradually saw the Communist militants get
 control of about two-thirds of his penned-up
 force. At times Colonel Caamano himself
 was virtually their prisoner.

 growth and that of the world at large are ex-
 plained in terms of a greater volume of sales
 here, as *ell as the rapid expansion of over-
 seas markets.                              -
 As vending expands its worldwide scope, it
 is affecting many related fields of activities.
 Its impact on other areas is revealed in the
 following figures :
 Steel: More than 92,000 tons of steel and
 62,000 tons of tin plate are used in the
 manufacture of vending equipment.
 Automotive industry: Approximately 78,-
 000 cars and trucks service vending machines,
 using 240,000 tires and 98 million gallons of
 gas annually.  Gasoline requirements equal
 57 tank cars each working day.
 Agriculture: Total farm land under culti-
 vation  for  raising  products  sold                                                                                through
 venders amounts to 1,850,000 acres.
 Each year, the following amounts of prod-
 ucts are sold through venders:
 [In millions of pounds]
 Nuts-----------------------------      140
 Sugar------------------------------  1,025
 Corn--------------------------------   100
 Tobacco----------------------------    256
 Wheat------------------------------    138
 The entire yield of approximately 178,000
 cows is required for vended products.
 Packaging Materials: Items packaged  in
 paper, plastic or foil for vended candy, food,
 cigarettes, and other products number 14,500
 million annually.
 Paper  cups  and  cartons  alone,  stacked
 one  on top  of  the  other, would stretch
 410,000 miles--from here to the moon and
 almost back.
 Along with this new concept of the dig-
 nity and worth of the individual, however,
 frequently comes resistance to time-honored
 forms of livelihood.  Changing concepts of
 occupational status often make it difficult
 to obtain help in such vital areas as per-
 sonal catering.   As new jobs unfold, and
 men see glimmering vistas ahead of even
 greater opportunities, there is less and less
 inclination to enter work areas which are
 traditionally associated with catering to the
 needs of others.
 In this new world, where bettered eco-
 nomic conditions are frequently accompanied
 by shrinking labor supplies in basic service
 areas, vending fills a gap between ancient cus-
 toms and modern demands.  By placing vol-
 ume food catering on a self-service basis,
 vending frees the individual man from the
 role of servant, while at the same time pro-
 viding  modern  facilities  to  take  care  of
 stepped-up demands for food and refresh-
 ment in the new marketplaces of the world.
 SHORTAGE Or FOOD WORKERS
 Shortages of labor in the food service field
 in the United States have become increas-
 ingly apparent in recent years.  These short-
 ages include both top-level supervisory people
 and those who assume less responsibility,
 down to and including busboys and cleanup
 help.  At the top, the shortage is less notice-
 able to the casual observer.  There are many
 fine dining establishments, operating on a
 very prosperous basis.  :Behind the scenes,
 however, competition for food supervisors is
 keen.  Although 59 colleges in the United
 States are accredited to offer food service de-
 grees, there are not enough graduates to meet
 the demand, and enrollment in these courses
 is not showing the tremendous increase evi-
 dent in other academic areas.  Young people
 with food service degrees are eagerly sought
 out by restaurateurs, but the managerial
 group which is being developed is not suffi-
 cient to fill all available positions.
 A logical way for management to solve the
 need for food service supervisors is to dip
 into secondary levels and elevate cafeteria
 managers and hostess-managers to positions
 of greater authority.  In some cases this is it
 good solution, but for the most part it merely
 compounds the problem of staffing a good
 restaurant or cafeteria, taking individuals
 away from jobs where they are making val-
 uable contributions, and creating new va-
 cancies at lower levels.
 It is as difficult to find qualified persons
 for second-level food service jobs as it is to
 find managerial personnel.  There is a sharp
 decrease in the numbers of workers entering
 the food service area at secondary or lower
 levels.  Who wants to cook or make salads
 or wait tables or clean when he or she can
 get a job with better pay or better hours at
 a local industry?  Many of these persons re-
 gard their jobs as temporary, until something
 better comes along.
 An official of the Hilton Hotel organization
 remarked recently that one of his major
 problems is finding and keeping trained and
 dependable persons for semiskilled and un-
 skilled Jobs.  In order to staff their kitchens,
 chain hotels conduct training sessions for
 kitchen and  restaurant personnel  in  vir-
 tually every city in which they operate--and
 repeat these sessions endlessly, in order to
 keep up with normal labor turnover.
 In their search to find help, many major
 hotel and restaurant chains have been reach-
 ing into European labor markets to recruit
 workers.  But now, with unparalleled pros-
 perity in Europe, this supply is dwindling.
 Men who formerly took: pride in being wait-
 ers or assistant cooks now often aspire to a
 different kind of work; girls who normally
 would look for work as waitresses now want
 dress-up jobs.

 problem of insufficient help, some companies

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 -   of
 HON. JOHN E. MOSS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 7, 1965
 Mr. MOSS.  Mr. Speaker, the United
 States has not-been idle by any means in
 seeking a solution to the war in Vietnam.
 The Sacramento, Calif., Bee, in an Au-
 gust 31, 1965, editorial, recapitulates the
 efforts made by our Government and
 other nations since last summer to en-
 courage discussions which will ultimately
 lead to honorable negotiations.
 I commend this editorial to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues:
 IT Is REns WHO WANT To WAR, WAR NOT
 JAW, JAW
 For the record, it should be emphasized
 that the U.S. declaration that it is willing-
 and  will remain  willing-to negotiate its
 quarrel in Vietnam is not an idle pronounce-
 ment.    It has backed up this assurance re-
 peatedly with overtures for the last year and
 intercessors concerned with  the trend  of
 things in Vietnam England, for example-
 have at the urging of the United States ap-
 pealed to the Communists to cease fire and
 talk.
 To document that record, let us go back
 to late summer, 1964, and pick it up from
 there.
 in August  1964; U.N. Secretary . General
 U Thant at the 'suggestion of the United
 States offered to visit Hanoi and Peiping to
 discuss resolution of the Vietnam crisis.  He
 was spurned by the Reds.
 In February 1965, Britain proposed that
 the Geneva Conference be reconvened to ex-
 plore the dispute.  Communism balked.
 In April 1965, President Lyndon B. John-
 son in a speech at Johns Hopkins University
 offered "unconditional discussions" and the
 Communists charged: "Swindle."
 In the same month Foreign Secretary Pat-
 rick Gordon Walker of Great Britain went on
 a peace mission to Hanoi and to Peiping.  In
 both capitals he was refused an audience.
 , There were two other developments in
 April-nonalined nations urged a settlement
 and North Vietnam and Red China refused
 to consider the petition.  India called for a
 cease fire and maintenance of present bor-
 ders.  Peiping and Hanoi both vetoed the pro-
 posal.
 In May 1965, President Johnson called off
 bombing raids over North Vietnam for 5 days
 to demonstrate this Nation's anxiousness to
 negotiate and all the moratorium won from
 the reds was the smear: "Hoax."
 Also in May, a Canadian envoy asked of
 Hanoi its conditions for peace and was told
 this would require the unconditional with-
 drawal of all U.S. forces.  This, of course, was
 neither possible nor feasible.
 In June, Britain's Prime Minister Harold
 Wilson sought to set up a peace plan and was
 branded by Peiping as a "nitwit."  In July, a
 British leftwing leader, Harold Davies, went
 to Hanoi to seek the Communist's terms.  He
 too was rejected.
 So reads the record of the American and
 the free world effort to bring the Commu-
 nists to the negotiations table.
 Mao Tse-tung may have summed up the
 Communist attitude most precisely when he
 said one does not negotiate a war away when
 one is winning.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. DAVID S. KING
 OF UTAH
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. KING of Utah.  Mr. Speaker, as
 the fighting wears on in Vietnam, we in
 America are beginning to learn what it
 is to fight this new and stubborn enemy;
 we are, beginning to learn what makes
 him act and think the way he does.  Yet,
 we must not tire of learning more about
 him ; as long as the Asian -Communist Is
 our enemy, he is our concern.
 I feel that the American people should
 look carefully at what another Asian has
 to say about Chinese Communist ambi-
 tions.  Dr. Purnendu Kumar Banerjee
 had  2 %2  years of service as India's
 Charge d'Affairs in Peiping before com-
 ing to the Indian Embassy in Washing-
 ton As Minister.  He gave an address on
 July 14, entitled "China and Southeast
 Asia" in which he describes the Com-
 munist Chinese mentality and ambitions
 in an acutely interpretive manner.
 While I want to stress that I do not
 take sides in the unfortunate clashes of
 the past week between India and her
 neighbor, Pakistan, I do feel that Dr.
 Banerjee's comments are worth careful
 consideration.
 The speech follows:.
 (By Dr. Purnendu Kumar Banerjee)
 As all, of you know, the Chinese Commu-
 nists are followers of military conquest.  I
 will start with. a quotation from Mao Tse-
 tung, chairman of the Chinese Communist
 Party.  "The struggle for socialism may re-
 quire nuclear war.  No one can foresee the
 number of human lives which a future war
 may take. It may be one-fourth of the in-
 habitants of the world.  Half of mankind
 could easily be destroyed, but the other half
 would survive.  In half a century, or a whole
 century, the population would grow again
 by more than half."  This statement was
 made in Moscow in 1958.
 Here is another statement made later on
 regarding the liberation movement in south-
 east Asia and South America. "The war will
 be a bridge over which mankind will pass
 into a new era in history.  The world can
 only be reorganized by means of rifles.  We
 stand in revulsion of war-we have no use
 for it. But war can only be abolished through
 war.  If you want war to go out of existence,
 stick to the rifle and the battlefield."  This is
 the philosophy of China, and through this
 philosophy China Is trying to conquer south-
 east Asia.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST OBJECTIVES
 All of you know of the aggression that
 took place in November 1962.  To most of
 you It is known as a territorial problem, but
 it Is not a territorial problem.  It is a symp-
 tom of the political ambitions that China
 has in southeast Asia, and It is a very sig-
 nificant symptom.  I firmly believe that if
 this territorial problem were settled, that
 there would still be the Chinese threat.
 China's ambition Is to influence, if not to
 control, the whole of Asia.  One of the major
 objectives is India. The Chinese are there-
 fore .continuing their effort, using military,
 political, economic, and diplomatic methods.
 The Chinese will again apply military meth-
 ods to India at the time that suits her and
 at the place convenient to her.
 Now look for a moment to see how Com-
 munist  China  lives  today.  Economically,
 politically, and cofhmunistically they have
 made certain progress. I have seen malnu-
 trition, but I have never seen starvation in
 China. They  seem able  to equalize  the
 poverty.
 You find a deep rift between the Soviet
 Union and China. What the future will be
 is very difficult to say.  I believe that the
 rift will develop further between the two
 Communist parties, but not between the two
 countries.
 Some of the western European countries
 are,watching the Chinese market.  However,
 the Chinese Communist market is now a
 very limited market.  The Chinese do not '
 have enough foreign exchange to buy the
 things they want. from abroad.  In addition,
 the Chinese have to pay for the grain that
 they need to buy each year from countries
 like Canada, Australia, and Argentina.  Also
 it is not possible for other countries to have
 trade with China?on a profitable basis be-
 cause the type of consumer goods and light
 Industrial goods the Chinese are producing
 are not quality goods, and they will not find
 a market in an advanced country.
 THE COMMUNIST METHOD
 Chinese  political  diversity  depends  on
 military                              preparedness.  The  Chinese have
 the largest land army in the world, includ-
 ing about 200 divisions.                                                                                                                                                                    These divisions are
 not equipped in a sophisticated way, it is
 true.  But their equipment and training fit
 into China's plan of infiltration,  guerrilla
 warfare,  and  subversion.  These   are  the
 characteristics of the Communist wars in
 Asia,  In South   America,  and  in      Africa,
 From that point of view, the vast land army,
 traditionally equipped with small arms, is
 just suitable for the purpose.
 To achieve their objective, the Chinese are
 applying  a  twofold  method.    One     is  an
 interparty approach, and the other is an
 interstate approach.

 Ike Makes I tear: With L.B.J. on
 Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD BOLLING
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. BOLLING. Mr. Speaker, the dif-
 ferences of opinion among some Members
 of this House about what we should or
 should not be doing in South Vietnam
 has been interpreted in.certain quarters
 as a rupture in our bipartisan approach
 on foreign policy. The recent statement
 of support for the administration's po-
 sition by former President Eisenhower
 did much to correct this impression.  I
 commend it to your  attention, Mr.
 Speaker, and to that of our colleagues:
 IKE MAKES  IT CLEAR: WITH L.B.J.  ON
 VIETNAM
 This week the Nation again had the pleas-
 ure of watching the Dwight D. Eisenhower
 crusade for peace in action.  An impressive
 performance it was, for it left no doubt of
 where the former President stood.  And what
 Ike did, it seems to us, was good for the
 Nation and for the Republican Party as well.
 We have no doubt that President Johnson
 was grateful for the firm statements of sup-
 port not only on Vietnam but also on the
 administration's decision to back down in
 the United,Nations dues dispute.  In fact,
 the anti-U.N. people, ready to pounce on'
 Ambassador  Goldberg's  announcement  in
 New York, were cut down by General Eisen-
 however almost before they had a chance to
 make their first move.
 But the big development was on Vietnam.
 Until quite recently, the GOP has racked up
 a remarkable record of responsible support of
 the administration's foreign policy.  In fact,
 the needling has come chiefly from some
 Democrats on Capitol Hill : andfrom a fuzzy-
 thinking (and relatively small)  segment of
 the population that just won't remember
 the lessons of Munich.   Nevertheless, the
 ghost of Munich is walking again, and.the
 former President, acutely conscious of the
 meaning of appeasement, stated the case for
 drawing a line in southeast Asia with ex-
 quisite clarity.
 He also noted the need, in time of crisis,
 for presenting a united front to the world.
 Granted that there always will be certain
 dissenting  noises  in  the  background,  it
 should be clear that the United States is
 united on its policy in southeast Asia. Here
 is the President, of one party, and a former
 President, of the other, speaking almost with
 one voice,
 We would not attempt to sort out the
 confusion of statements this last week that
 prompted General Eisenhower to speak so
 candidly.  On the one hand, there seemed
 to be a Republican attempt to show that
 there is a division between General Eisen-
 hower and President Johnson.  There was
 also the implication that someone was using
 the former President for political purposes.
 All of which, it seems to us, added up to so
 much  nonsense.   And  some  Republican
 spokesman did not add much luster to the
 party's record of bipartisan support in for-
 eign policy.
 But indirectly, good may have come of it
 all.  The former President felt that he had
 to say, once more, what he thought he had
 said quite plainly before.  With Lyndon B.
 Johnson  and  with  the  vast  majority  of
 Americans, he stands for peace and freedom.
 In the case of South Vietnam, that means
 that the line must be drawn against aggres-
 sive communism and that, it the terrors of
 all-out war are to be avoided, there can be
 no retreat until peace and freedom are guar-
 anteed for the Vietnamese people.
 That is,what Dwight Eisenhower said. Mr.
 Johnson should be grateful for this restate-
 ment by an elder statesman so widely re-
 spected here and abroad.  The Nation should
 be grateful.  And so, come to think of it,
 should the Republican Party.
 Agricultural Labor in California-A
 Realistic Review
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT L. LEGGETT
 OF- CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. LEGGETT.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to publicly thank the Secretary of
 Labor for his certification last week of
 9,50.0 additional Mexican workers to save
 the California tomato harvest from
 catastrophe. The workers were certified
 on the recommendation of the Secre-
 tary's California Farm Labor Panel who
 are to be commended on their efforts to
 remain continuously abreast of Califor-
 nia's ever-changing agricultural labor,
 problems.
 California growers this year have
 stampeded to mechanize, to use women
 and children and athletic teams to har-
 vest at wage rates which are the best in
 the Nation, higher than any contem-
 plated minimum wage law and competi-
 tive with industrial wages in many parts
 of  the  country.  Additionally,  better
 than three-fourths million dollars is be-
 ing paid by growers in a futile attempt
 to recruit farmworkers in other alleged
 pockets of surplus labor in other parts of
 the country.
 Hank Tweith's Independent Herald
 of Yuba City, Calif., further puts this is-
 sue in perspective as follows:
 THE QUALITY OF LABOR
 The quality of mercy may drop gently
 from heaven but the quality of labor does
 not, and, if the mercy of growers in Sutter-
 Yuba isn't strained this season, their pa-
 tience with the quality of their work crews
 has been tested mightily.
 If this facet of the farm labor problem
 hasn't percolated through the thousands-
 more likely millions-of words that have been
 spoken and written on this year's labor crisis,
 it is only because the farmer and his spokes-
 men are not as articulate as they should be
 in presenting agriculture's case.
 Over the years some of the most unpleas-
 ant words that have ever blotted paperhave
 A5077
 been  the  accusations that farmers  delib-
 erately exploit their hired hands by depress-
 ing wages.  This  complaint  is                                                      no                                                                                    more
 valid against growers than it is of any em-
 ployer who is faced with the chore of using
 labor in production, sales, and service. To
 show a profit on operations, growers, like fac-
 tory owners, automobile dealers, and hot dog
 stands must get marketable production from
 their work force.
 This has been particularly true in Califor-
 nia  where  farmers  actually  mass-produce
 fruits and vegetables-almost half of the
 total U.S. production-and they do so from
 a cornucopia of abundance that permitted in
 other days-when labor costs were low-con-
 siderable waste.
 Yet, the California farmer has, for more
 than a generation, paid the biggest farm pay-
 roll in the Nation and maintained the second
 highest pay rate  scale-exceeded only by
 Washington State where the hired labor pool
 is small-and crop production small.
 But in recent years as quality standards
 have stiffened and labor costs have climbed,
 economic survival has depended greatly upon
 the yield per acre a grower could achieve.
 High yield cannot be obtained with a labor
 force that is careless or casual or, In a true
 sense, unskilled.
 This skill factor in farming is surrounded
 by misinformation concerning the degree of
 skill required from an adequate farmworker.
 The myth is exaggerated, of course, by the
 fact that the pertinent requirements are of
 a nature not marketable anyplace else but
 'in agriculture such as the ability to work
 long hours under a hot sun in a dusty field
 with constant strain on muscles most of us
 don't even know we have.
 It  is  no  special  criticism  of men  and
 women in the Nation's heaviest pockets of
 unemployment that they do not have, in this
 stage of an industrial-urban society, those
 skills. Some people cannot sew or cook and
 there are others  who cannot  handle    the
 equations of stellar navigation.
 When growers complain-- ofttimes bit-
 terly-that 200 workers reported to a field or
 orchard at 7 a.m. and that by 9 only a hand-
 ful we;e still working, they may be inclined
 to comment-or at least find themselves as
 saying-the crews are "too lazy" to work.  In
 calmer moments, most of them might agree
 that the labor available is frequently "simply
 unable to perform the function of climbing
 trees or bending over hours at a time.  Some
 people,  it is reported, cannot write news
 stories, repair television sets, or play the
 piano.
 Because wages in farming are based on
 production-as strangely enough they are in
 every nonpolitical activity and sometimes
 there-growers have used as much as they
 could, piece rate pay scales for their work
 force,  paying  some  startlingly  high  pay-
 checks under this system to some of their
 hired hands.
 But piece rate scales are only a means
 of measurement and do not help a grower
 get a crop  out of orchard or field when
 fruit or vegetables are at precisely the right
 stage  of maturity.   Too early or too late
 means an unmarketable harvest.  Unskilled
 labor on any pay scale means damaged trees
 and vines and wasted efforts by other crop
 handlers.
 When gang labor was the complete key
 to the California harvest with as many as
 700,000 people working at peak seasons and
 in a time when there was more farm back-
 ground in the Nation's populace than there
 is today, it was possible with a combina-
 tion                                                                                                                                 of skilled  farmworkers  and  a  large
 number of eager hands and strong bodies to
 deliver a satisfactory tonnage. Seven tons
 of peaches per acre or 10 tons of tomatoes

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX      September 8, 1965
 wasn't bad then although such growers go
 quickly bankrupt now.  With relatively low
 yields, with lenient quality standards and
 with low wage rates, there was still a margin
 of profit for farm operators.
 But as wage rates have risen-and they
 have been going up steadily for more than '
 a decade-there has developed sharper labor
 management on farms and greater research
 into automation to eliminate the more ardu-
 ous phase of farmwork-the hauling, the
 lifting, the bending-and to retain still the
 services of those who could stand the heat,
 the dirt and the monotony of farm har-
 vests.
 Some of sharp vision may have noticed
 the decline of winos on farm payrolls in re-
 cent years-a direct result of management
 recognition that a part-time worker at full-
 time pay hurts production and inflates pay-
 rolls.
 Until this year in California, the Mexican
 brracero filled the gap where management
 and  machines has  not  yet  reached.  For
 years, legally and illegally, he had been part
 of the California farm scene but in recent
 years he was a regulated "package" force,
 assigned almost exclusively to special crops,
 and his loss in the first 8 months of this year
 has affected harvests of lettuce, strawberries,
 cotton,  sugarbeets,  asparagus,  dates,  and
 tomatoes to varying degree depending not
 on substitute labor but on advancements in
 mechanization    for  each    commodity.  His
 background in a native agricultural society,
 where, for the most part, he worked in one
 form or another of husbandry or - didn't
 work at all, made him ideal for the seasonal
 activity which creates almost all of the farm
 jobs in California.  He was transported here
 under contract, did what was asked of him
 or was sent home and was available when
 needed.
 He was no more "enslaved" than are the
 Beatles to make contracted appearances and
 his wages were the prevailing scale of the
 district where he worked-set by the Govern-
 ment, not the grower-and were very high
 i:a relation to what he could make in Mexico
 and substantial by any standard when he
 was truly skilled.  As a matter of fact he
 was not "cheap" as a worker.  Last year in
 the Sacramento Valley, the minimum bra-
 cero wage was $1.25 an hour, the average was
 $1.50 and ranged to $2.50 and higher for
 some  workers.  In  addition, the  grower
 picked up a payroll charge for administra-
 tion, transportation,                insurance,  room  and
 board that added up to, at least, another $1
 an hour per man.
 But the bracero did get the work done
 whereas his substitutes this year in the same
 fields, including football players, women, and
 other youngsters have not done so well no
 matter how willing.  Too many growers this
 year have found themselves paying a mini-
 mum of $1.40 an hour for a production with a
 cash value of $1 or less.  How many plumb-
 ing firms could afford to pay their artisans
 pipe and lug 40 percent more than their serv-
 ices would bring in the marketplace?
 In the farm labor crisis of 1965, the most
 :frustrating situation has  been  the  bland
 statements by Government officials and la-
 bor union leaders that growers could get all
 the  help  they  need  if   they  would  pay
 enough.    Yet, how may physicists, concert
 musicians,  topflight  salesmen,  competent
 executives and skilled administrators would
 they get-at any scale-with an ad in the
 morning newspaper??    Somewhat more, we
 suspect, than the 14 tomato pickers located
 in one combing of Louisiana.
 One of the requirements for learned ut-
 terances on the criteria for farm labor should
 be a week's work in a peach orchard or to-
 mato field, or, even, the relatively soft job
 of hoeing sugarbeets on a summer's after-
 noon in the Sacramento Valley.
 These experts on labor might discover the
 farmer's problem is almost as simple as de-
 livering a pound of flesh without a drop of
 blood
 Congressman Horton Welcomes March of
 Dimes Big City Meeting
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. FRANK HORTON
 OF NEW YORK
 ].N.THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr. HORTON.                     Mr. Speaker, On Oc-
 tober 4 and 5, 1965, in Washington, the
 National Foundation, March of Dimes-
 will convene its most important meeting
 of the year. At that time, more than 500
 top-level volunteer leaders, representing
 all 50 States and every major city, will
 plan the 1966 March of Dimes campaign
 against birth defects, one of the Nation's
 leading causes of premature death and
 disability.
 The importance of their task cannot
 be overstated.  Each year in the United
 States, an estimated 250,000 babies are
 born with significant birth defects. Sixty
 thousand children and adults and an
 estimated half million unborn babies die
 as a result of these defects.  With the
 exception of heart disease, no other con-
 dition claims so many lives.
 Some of the causes of these tragedies
 are known.  The news media recently
 focused attention on the thousands of
 defective children being born to moth-
 ers infected with German measles dur-
 ing last year's epidemic.  In most cases,
 however, neither causes nor means of
 prevention nor specific methods of treat-
 ment are known.
 The National Foundation-March of
 Dimes, has made a strong beginning in
 the fight against these problems through
 its national network of treatment centers
 and an international program of scien-
 tific research.  It is to map a program
 of expansion in this urgent campaign
 that these volunteers from across the
 country are meeting here in Washing-
 ton.
 The National Foundation-March of
 Dimes, since its establishment in 1938,
 has  always believed that the way to
 solve a problem in America is to bring
 its importance home to the public. When
 the people are convinced that the job
 is important enough, they will do some-
 thing about it.  That is what happened
 in the fight against polio when the pub-
 lic, through the March of Dimes, achieved
 one of the most important medical vic-
 tories of our time: the development of
 the Salk and Sabin vaccines.
 The Wien and women attending this
 national conference will be truly repre-
 sentatives of the people of their States
 and communities, where they are labor-
 ing to bring about an awareness of the
 birth defects problem.  They are the
 chairmen of each State March of Dimes
 organization,  the State chairmen of
 women's activities, and the chairmen of
 the largest of the foundation's 3,100
 county chapters.  Last year, they and
 their counterparts coordinated the work
 of an army of some 3 million volun-
 teers, including a corps of nearly a mil-
 lion Marching Mothers who visited an
 estimated 10 million homes distributing
 educational materials and seeking finan-
 cial support for the March of Dimes.
 Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that a great
 part of America is involved in this mas-
 sive struggle. I know that all the Mem-
 bers of this House join with me in wel-
 coming these dedicated people to our
 Capital City and in wishing them every
 success as they plan the important work
 of attacking the scourge of birth de-
 fects. -
 Washington Report
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JAMES D. MARTIN
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 8, 1965
 Mr.                                      MARTIN  of  Alabama.   Mr.
 Speaker, under permission to extend my
 remarks in the RECORD, I wish to include
 my weekly report to my constituents of
 April 22, 1965:
 WASHINGTON REPORT FROM CONGRESSMAN JIM
 MARTIN, SEVENTH DISTRICT, ALABAMA
 THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION RESOLUTION
 The House passed House Joint Resolution
 1, proposing an amendment to the Constitu-
 tion providing for presidential succession.
 The vote was 368 to 29 and I was one of the
 29 voting against the resolution.  This is one
 of those technical pieces of legislation not
 easy to explain, but I feel there is grave
 danger in approving an amendment to the
 Constitution which would make it possible
 for an appointed official, never having been
 approved by the people, to become President
 of the United States.
 Under this proposal, upon the death of the
 President, the ,Vice President, having taken
 the oath as the new President, would appoint
 a new Vice President.  His appointee would
 have  to be  approved   by the Senate  and
 House, but there are no restrictions as to
 whom he could appoint.  I could not help
 but think whom the present Vice President,
 HUBERT  HUMPHREY,    might appoint if fate.
 decreed that he became President. Certain-
 ly, his choice would be approved by the pres-
 ent liberal majority in the House and Senate.
 This worries me when I remember that on
 their first vote after having been sworn in as
 Members of the 89th Congress and having
 taken an oath to uphold the Constitution,
 149 Members of this Congress voted not to
 seat the legally elected Members of Congress
 from the State of Mississippi.  What could
 happen in the future, and what kind of man
 could be appointed as Vice President if some
 later Congress, made up of ultraliberal-radi-
 cals, decided to impose their choice on the
 people?  It is too dangerous a power to con-
 fer lightly.
 I believe we should  follow the present
 order of succession which makes the Speaker
 of the House next in line for Vice President.
