Dear Mr. Dulles, 
accua a Registry 
A host of friends will be thinking during these days of your brother 
with so much gratitude and prayer. He has given himself unsparingly. 
His faith and his patriotism will be sorely missed. 
I was especially grateful for his statement at Cleveland last November 
when he said, Ne need to change ourselves to meet the chAllenge of a 
changing world. Under our forms of society it is individuals and not 
governments who have the decisive role to play. Many find us lacking in 
faith and deeds.' 
We were grateful for the thorough summary of the Communist danger 
which you gave at the Edison dinner. Your warning of subversion was most 
timely. We Americans so easily go to sleep when we think our steel 
production will keep ahead of the Russians. Few in America recognize the 
mortal threat of subversion, still trusting that material strength and 
economic aid, however necessary, will win this ideological struggle. 
The Shah of Iran has asked us for help for his country. He wants 
Iranian students studying abroad to be trained in Moral Re-Armament. He 
speaks with considerable feeling of the Iranian students who go abroad to 
Europe and America and come back Communist agents or moral wrecks. 
We are hard at work at Caux and Mackinac to answer the urgent appeal 
which has also come from other countries in Asia and Africa with ideologically 
trained manpower and tested weapons. We aim to get ready task forces of 
such men BO that what has happened in Iraq is not the pattern of the future. 
You may be interested in the story of some events which lay behind the 
miracle of Cyprus, and a statement by Admiral Standley, former Chief of 
Naval Operations and Ambassador in Moscow. 
The Foreign Radio Broadcast Service gives us invaluable source material 
with which to train our people. It is much appreciated. 
With warm regards, 
Yours ever sincerely, 
H. Kenaston Twitchell

Superior Ideology for Iran

CYPRUS SETTLEMENT "A MIRACLE" 
CAUX, SWITZERLAND ?The Chief Adviser to Arch-
bishop Makarios unfolded the behind-the-scenes story of 
the Cyprus settlement before a thousand people here at the 
MRA Easter Assembly. 
Zenon Rossides, Cypriot member of the Greek delegation 
to the United Nations and adviser to Archbishop Makarios, 
said: The agreement in Cyprus came about not by sticking 
to entrenched positions, nor merely by aiming to protect 
our rights, but by thinking how we can cooperate together 
for one goal . . . it is a symbol of a sudden important 
change in the hearts and minds of men." 
Before the Cypriot delegation arrived here, Archbishop 
Makarios said in an interview, "I am extremely grateful 
for what Moral Re-Armament is doing for the 
country." 
Ever since the summer of 1954 the Cyprus crisis has been 
creating a widening gap between Greece and Turkey, allies 
in NATO's eastern flank. 
In December 1958 a new note was injected into the bit-
ter deadlock. 
"The courage of the men of Moral Re-Armament has

For Berlin ?Strength 
And New Hope 
Berlin can touch off global war 
The world watches tensely as both power blocs bid for 
the city's future. 
And from the heart of Berlin at this critical time 
Deputy Mayor Franz Amrehn went to the MRA 
Easter Assembly in Caux, Switzerland, in search of 
an answer. 
Here representatives from Asia and Africa, as well as 
the Western world, joined to launch a continuing ideological 
campaign in Europe and the Middle East. 
Mayor Amrehn said after his visit, "We go to Berlin 
strengthened and with new hope. 
"The problem of Berlin is not just a question of conflict 
between two power blocs; it is a conflict between two types 
of world. 
"A solution . . . can only come from the strength of our 
own conviction and the strength of our faith. 
"Berlin is only the crystallization point of a much 
greater ideological conflict." 
He said it would be "a grave self-deception" to try and 
settle the problem in isolation, that it must be tackled in 
a much wider framework. 
"On every side we meet a strong feeling of resignation. 
Many, even in the highest circles, think that no liberation 
is possible for those under Communist domination. 
"We shall win if we are absolutely determined and 
if we are clear never to yield morally or allow any 
compromise on principle." 
After he spoke, Maurice Mercier, general secretary of 
the French Textile Workers, assured him that French Social-
ist workers were in solidarity with him. And a British 
financier, Stanley Hoar, joined Mercier. 
They promised the Deputy Mayor of Berlin, in the name 
of all present, that they would support his people in their 
fight for freedom?by making every sacrifice in their own 
countries to overcome weaknesses and divisions among the 
free nations.

To the Caux Assembly 
Our task is to pioneer paths to peace and unity. Where are the men and women who in 
the spirit which has brought the solution to Cyprus will secure Berlin and Germany, 
overarch the crisis between France and Algeria, bring freedom without bloodshed and 
bitterness to Africa, resurrect Britain with a moral ideology and live before the nations 
an indissoluble unity which will answer every problem? 
',R. FRANK N. a BUCHMAN 
Swiss President Visits Caux 
The President of the Swiss Confederation, Paul Chaudet, 
accompanied by his wife and two sons paid a private visit 
to the Caux Assembly on March 31. 
In a spontaneous reply to a message from Dr. Buchman, 
the President who is also Minister of Defense said, The 
modern world lives under the pressure of fear?fear which 
makes hundreds of thousands of human beings say, it is 
better today to go on living even in servitude than to fight 
again for the defense of our liberty.' 
"In face of the pressures, we can wish for nothing better 
than to see a force of which you are the instruments?a 
force of unity and love?gradually win the world, freeing 
men and women of their fear." 
CYPRUS (Continued from page 137) 
changed the climate of Cyprus," declared the Greek Minis-
ter to London in the presence of members of the British 
Foreign Office. 
This was typified by an article the editor of the Cyprus 
Mail wrote which appeared in The Times of London. It 
said, "We British have not sufficiently considered the feel-
ings in the hearts of the men who live on Cyprus. Before 
any approach can be successful, we may have to make 
apologies. This may cost us a little pride, but it will 
save a lot of blood." 
Shedding his bitterness against the Cypriots among 
whom he worked, this editor took four steps: he saw Sir 
Hugh Foot, Governor of Cyprus, and told him of his 
change and determination to answer hatred; he visited 
Archbishop Makarios; in London he gave the Foreign Office 
facts on the Cyprus situation; and he visited the Greek 
Embassy in London telling of Moral Re-Armament as the 
basic answer to the crisis in Cyprus. 
Archbishop Makarios heard of the work that MRA was 
doing. "Moral Re-Armament in the spirit of God offers 
a great hope for world peace and the future of mankind," 
he cabled to the New Year's MRA Assembly in Los Angeles. 
En route to Los Angeles John McGovern, for 28 years 
a Member of the British House of Commons, conferred for 
one and a half hours with Archbishop Makarios in New 
York. 
He apologized for the mistakes of the past and outlined 
the British policy he favored, based on "what was right 
not who was right." 
At the request of Makarios, Rossides flew to the Los 
Angeles Assembly. 
In the atmosphere of trust there, Rossides lost his bitter-
ness. With McGovern he was able to develop a plan for the 
138 
settlement of the Cyprus issue on the basis of Moral Re-
Armament. 
Shortly afterwards, Rossides flew back to Europe. He 
conferred with officials in Athens and London. 
He said later these "high level political contacts proved 
most effective in paving the way for agreement" because 
he approached them in the spirit of MRA. 
Three weeks later the agreement was signed in London 
closely paralleling the points Rossides had put forward. 
Sir Hugh Foot commented, "Surely a miracle." 
A. E. Yalman, editor of the great Turkish newspaper 
Vatan, added to the story. He told how he had flown to 
Athens and spoken to the Greek press immediately before 
the Zurich conference. 
The Athens daily, Vima, took the unprecedented step of 
publishing an article by Yalman saying: "We must now 
perform the miracle of changing Cyprus into a link 
instead of a barrier between us." 
Jean Rous, former political editor of the Paris daily 
Franc Tireur said, "There are close analogies between 
Cyprus and Algeria. The interests of France and Algeria 
could be reconciled?what is needed is the will to tackle 
the basic issues. It is not a question of political formulas, 
but of human reconciliation. As in the case of Cyprus, I 
believe the solution lies in Moral Re-Armament." 
Turkish and Greek Cypriots at Cat= crowd forward 
to thank A. E. Yalman (left), editor of Vatan, Istan-
bul, for his articles in Turkish, Greek and Cypriot pa-
pers stressing the common destiny of these lands.

FOR IRAN A SUPERIOR IDEOLOGY 
By MA JID MOVAGHAR 
Iran, with her Soviet frontier on 
the north and her western border 
now closed by Iraq, is acutely con-
scious of the ideological struggle. 
The Shah, in decorating Dr. Frank 
Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-
Armament, last December said, "Our 
greatest need is a superior ideology." 
In consequence sixty Iranians this 
month have been attending an MRA 
Assembly at the Caux, Switzerland, 
training center. Fifteen are high in 
the government, military, educa-
tional and business life of the coun-
try and 45 are studying at European 
universities. 
These delegates, during one ses-
sion, said that their Minister of 
Court, Minister of Education and 
President of the Chamber of Com-
merce were launching a program to 
provide MRA training facilities and 
literature in Iran on a national scale. 
Their aim: "To help the rising 
generation in Iran become a force 
through MRA for the peaceful so-
cial reconstruction of our country, 
and lift her out of the present illiter-
acy, poverty and division." 
Chairman of the session was the 
Iranian editor and parliamentarian, 
Majid Movaghar. His article on Iran 
follows: 
* * * 
DURING WORLD WAR II when 
Russia violated the neutrality of Iran 
and occupied the northern part of the 
country, she freely gave her ideology to 
the youth. The Tudeh (masses) Party 
was organized. 
Later, when the Shah was visiting 
Teheran University, five shots were 
fired at him. All five bullets hit the Shah, 
wounding him in the face and piercing 
his hat, but he was miraculously saved 
for a higher destiny. Subsequently the 
Tudeh Party was suppressed and the 
ringleaders fled. 
Aim at Regime's Downfall 
These fugitives have since been shel-
tered in the Communist countries and 
have undergone intensive ideological 
training. They are now being massed in 
Iraq on the Iranian border. Simultaneous-
ly Baghdad Radio is instigating the 
Iranian Kurdish tribes to revolt and 
join the Iraqui Kurdish tribes. 
The aim of the fugitives is the down-
fall of the present Iranian regime 
through the same tragic fate as befell 
young King Feisal. The ultimate object 
is to drag the nation behind the Iron 
Curtain. 
Russia recently sent a delegation with 
promises and menaces to isolate Iran 
from the Free World. Iran, realizing the 
meaning of "friendship" in the Com-
munist world, had no alternative but 
categorically to say "No." 
Points of Pressure 
In all these troubles two significant 
points should be borne in mind: 
(1) Iran is the only country in the 
Baghdad Pact which is left unprotected. 
She is neither in NATO nor SEATO; 
(2) In the Russo-Iranian Treaty (now 
revoked by Iran) there was an article 
which gave Russia the right to move 
her army into Iranian territory if a 
third party should threaten Russian in-
terests in Iran. 
Russia is now charging Iran with 
having given the U.S. military bases on 
her territory, and threatens to take ad-
vantage of this treaty right. Iran has 
called upon America to guarantee her 
integrity against any foreign aggression, 
in a bilateral treaty which is now 
operative. 
Accordingly Iran is less worried over 
Russian aggression than an inside up-
rising. Iran is in search of an answer 
to satisfy the nation, particularly the 
youth. 
Revolutionary Reforms 
Great revolutionary reforms, unheard 
of in the long annals of the nation, are 
now being introduced into Iran, through 
the Shah's personal efforts to answer the 
national needs. He stated: 
"We shall have either a revolution by 
consent from within or a revolution by 
force from without." 
What does he mean by a "revolution 
by consent from within?" Every time 
the Shah looks in the mirror the scars 
of ideological war left on his face re-
mind him of the meaning of "ideology." 
Communism is an ideology based on 
atheism, materialism, division and class 
warfare. Moral Re-Armament is an 
ideology based on absolute honesty, ab-
solute purity, absolute unselfishness and 
absolute love. 
Scorpion Juice 
A Persian quotation says, "Scorpion 
bites are best cured with scorpion juice." 
Only an ideology answers an ideology. 
It was to this end that the Persian 
Government invited the International 
Mission of Moral Re-Armament ? a 
force of some 250 from 30 nations of 
all points of view, castes and colors, to 
visit Iran in 1955 as guests of the Gov-
ernment. The Shah not only gave a state 
reception in honor of the Mission, but 
even went so far as to open his royal 
palace, for the first time, to the public 
to see the musical show The Vanishing 
Island. 
Since then the Shah has received sev-
eral other MRA missions. He has 
bestowed the decoration of Commander 
of the Order of the Crown on Dr. Buch-
man. He sent a personal message?the 
first of its kind by the head of a state?
to be delivered by his representative, 
the Iranian Ambassador to Switzerland, 
at Caux at the end of 1958. 
Iran has found the answer. She is 
giving an example of the right states-
manship in the Age of Ideology.

WHAT AMERICA IS MEANT 
As told to a friend 
by PRISCILLA CORNELL 
(Written a year before her death) 
WE ARE AN AMERICAN FAMILY?
Doug, Priscilla, Susie, Debbie, Sam 
and Steve. We live in a large, old-fashioned 
house in Washington, D.C., with Taffy, our 
dog, and two parakeets. 
Doug goes to his job in the National 
Academy of Sciences every day, and the 
children go off to school, just like thousands 
of other families in America. 
But we have a secret in our home that 
lights up dark corners and takes the fear 
out of everything that makes life so un-
certain these days whether you live in 
Washington, or London, or Moscow or 
Manila: fear of the future?fear of what 
other people think of you?fear of failure 
?fear of the boss?fear of your husband?
fear of death. 
An Answer To Fear 
God can direct the life of each one of us 
if we are humble enough to want it and 
honest enough to recognize His guidance. 
This fact completely changed our lives. 
One day in 1955 I found I had cancer. 
We had discovered the deeply satisfying 
unity that comes with honesty and com-
mitment to an idea greater than ourselves. 
Just the same, knowledge of my illness was 
a shock. 
We persuaded the doctors to tell us the 
full truth, and we shared it with the chil-
dren. Each one at his level of understand-
ing knew what it meant. We sat down to-
gether and listened to God. We learned to 
face reality together in the family and with 
our friends, and we found a deeper unity 
each time a crisis came or a decision was 
necessary. 
Of course I worried about the children. 
I think I love them more now than I knew 
how to before, because the possessiveness 
in me is gone. But I know with certainty 
that God loves them and knows their needs 
even better than I do. The only thing we 
can give our children to equip them for the 
future is a security in God. 
Physical cancer is not a tragedy. It can 
be a painful disease?I have had four oper-
ations in the last three years. But I know 
the suffering so many families endure of 
disunity, of hate, of fear, the acid pain of 
jealousy, the pangs of desire for satisfac-
tions that do not satisfy when you get them, 
the choking of self-will, the monotonous 
deadness of a life without purpose?these 
tragic diseases have been cured in our fam-
ily forever. 
Sometimes I have become a materialist 
again, wanting things for myself?includ-
ing life and health. But I know that what 
God has for me is right. It isn't what hap-
pens to me that matters, but what I do 
with what happens. This is the real chal-
lenge?to continue to care for the family 
and friends, not in the easy way of doing 
for them, but by time spent in prayer and 
guidance, in living a compelling faith. 
Faith and Ideology 
We had a faith in God before. From 
Frank Buchman in MRA we have learned 
to relate our faith to the needs of the world, 
and to live to answer those needs. That is 
an ideology. It gives a goal and a purpose 
to living. It means a satisfied heart. 
More than that, it means whatever hap-
pens to me can be a weapon for the future. 
Whether it is humanly good or bad does 
not matter so long as we are faithful and 
obedient. When I have been physically un-. 
able to do anything, my guidance has been, 
"I can still listen and obey." 
Each time fear and , discomfort come 
back, they point me to the Cross. Jesus 
really is there to carry half the load. I 
know He can heal me, but He may have 
a bigger plan than that. It is no longer I, 
myself, with a personal problem, but a 
gift for all, given to me to be used for 
the world. When we live always at the 
foot of the Cross we serve our ideology and 
faith floods in. 
President Eisenhower says: "Whatever 
America hopes to bring to pass in the world 
must first come to pass in the heart of 
America." That means in the hearts of 
families like ours. We have come to see 
that what we live as a family has every-
thing to do with what America is meant 
to give to the world.

TO GIVE IN THE WORLD 
Her Gallant Faith Joined East and West 
DRISCILLA CORNELL, wife of Dr. S. 
Douglas Cornell, Executive Secretary of 
the Nationel Academy of Sciences, died in 
Washington on March 19 at the age of 41. 
She is survived by her husband and their 
four children?Susan, Deborah, S. Douglas, 
Jr., and Steven . 
Mrs. Cornell's funeral services were in 
the nation's capital, and she was laid to 
rest in Buffalo, her father's home. She was 
honored in memorial services at Mackinac 
Island, Michigan, at Los Angeles and San 
Diego, and :is far away as Melbourne, 
Australia. 
Four years ago Mrs. Cornell discovered 
she had cancer. She learned she had only 
a short time to live. Yet, even after succes-
sive operations, she flew with her husband 
?once to Britain and later to the Philip-. 
pines ? to take part in the ideological 
struggle for Asian and European unity. 
For she had been freed from fear by the 
permanent faith she lived and passed on. 
It was rock-firm?for world statesmen, for 
her children, for scientists of the space age. 
"Continuing Courageous Fight" 
Messages came to Dr. Cornell and his 
family from every continent: from Burma's 
Ambassador in Washington; from Japanese 
government, industrial and labor leaders; 
from African nationalists and Dutch South 
African figures; from an American diplo-
mat in the Ivory Coast; from Rio long-
shoremen's leaders, former rivals, who had 
found unity in "Priscilla's continuing 
courageous fight." 
Dr. Frank Buchman telegraphed: "Lov-
ing wife and mother whose gracious form 
illumined every act; one of God's gallant 
ladies, whose valor gave hope and victory 
wherever she went. Priscilla lived an answer 
adequate for her family, America and the 
world. 
"She lives in countless hearts to whom 
she brought a radiant faith, especially those 
Asian peoples at Baguio whom she touched 
and changed and brought to a new love 
for America. She was gentle, gracious, hon-
est, humble and committed. 
"You Douglas, and Susie, Debbie, Doug 
and Stevie, her children, will rise up and 
call her blessed. Precious in the sight of the 
Lord is the death of His saints. 
"Priscilla lives, she lives in all the past. 
She lives, nor to the last of seeing her 
again will I despair. In dreams I see her 
now, and upon her angel brow I see it 
writ, 'Thou shalt meet me there.'" 
* * * 
Perhaps the best way to understand the 
full measure of a person like Mrs. Cornell 
is through the eyes of her friends as they 
remembered her "who has not gone but 
only gone ahead." There were scores of 
tributes. 
The President of the National Academy 
of Sciences, Dr. Detley W. Bronk, spoke in 
the Washington Cathedral at Mrs. Cornell's 
funeral service. He said: "The Cornelis 
taught me to transform impatience into pa-
tience. They encouraged me to replace fear 
with courage. They shamed me out of 
anger into love. They taught me to scorn 
complacency for positive deeds of goodness. 
"Priscilla showed that one was not justi-
fied in hiding behind a physical handicap 
in order to do less than we can do. She 
showed how a handicap can be transformed 
into strength if one is fortified by the 
spirit of Christ in God." 
Begum Hayaud-Din, wife of the military 
attache at the Pakistan Embassy, also spoke 
in the Washington Cathedral: "What an 
excellent friend! She was like a mirror for 
me?the thing that Islam says we Muslims 
should be for one another. She had a mag-
netic charm because of the quality of her 
faith. 
"The way she received her illness was a 
miracle to me. She often said, 'It isn't how 
long I live, but how I live.' A wonderful 
example of gracious American woman-
hood." 
Masahide Shibusawa, son of a former 
Japanese Finance Minister, told of the Cor-
nelis' time in 1957 at the Asian Assembly 
in the Philippines at Baguio. 
"We Asians were very deeply impressed 
and greatly challenged by the faith and 
commitment which she lived. To us such 
Americans are the only hope for the world. 
"I was standing on the balance, whether 
I should choose a selfish career for myself 
or the fight for Moral Re-Armament. I de-
cided to give the rest of my life to restore 
for what my nation had done to America 
and to our Asian naighbors. 
(Continued on page 142) 
"Her Horizons Were The World" 
From all those who have sent mes-
sages I see the amazing outreach of 
all that Priscilla lived and fought for. 
Her fight was never cancer; that was 
never a burden or a punishment, but 
one of God's amazing gifts, and her 
task was to use it to His Glory. 
She faced her own human nature, 
but was never bound by it; she 
claimed victory over it again and 
again. She gave her family endless 
love and care, and she fought for us 
constantly because she knew that our 
unity together and our surrender to-
tally to God's plan for each of us 
would change the world. 
She carried all the world on her 
heart, which is what made her heart 
big enough to care so much for each 
of us. She surrendered each of us to 
find, in fullest freedom from human 
constraint, the maximum God wants 
to give. I pray that I shall have the 
wisdom and strength to do that for 
our children, as she did. 
Hers was the biggest fight of all--
literally to remake the world along-
side Frank Buchman. She poured 
herself out for the person next to 
her, but she kept herself free of fear, 
self-pity and ambition so that she 
could give joyously where God said, 
and fight as He guided. Her horizons 
were the world, her focus on the next 
step in guidance. 
She burned that America awaken 
to the full responsibility of her heri-
tage and her destiny and she gave 
everything to advance that in God's 
way. I pledge to you that I will car-
ry on that fight and give everything 
as she did for it.

The Right Revolution In Africa' 
Riots and revolution in Nyasaland and the Belgian Congo have focused 
the attention of the world on Africa. By 1960 one third of the continent's 
220 millions will be independent. 
The question is, "Will Africa become another China?" or will it fulfill 
Frank Buchman's vision of "Africa?the answer continent for the world?" 
With these issues in mind a confer-
ence to bring freedom to Africa with-
out bitterness and bloodshed took place 
at the University College of Ibadan in 
Nigeria last week. 
Delegates included members of the 
federal and regional legislatures, a group 
from the French Cameroons, and black 
and white from South Africa. 
They were welcomed by Emmanuel 
Obe, president_ of the National Union 
of Nigerian Students. 
Chief J. L. Tifase, Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Ministry of Health and 
Social Welfare in Western Nigeria, said, 
"Yesterday we floundered as we in 
Africa sought an ideology big and com-
plete enough to bring lasting freedom 
to the emerging nations. Today we say 
Moral Re-Armament is the only hope 
in creating national unity?one aim, one 
mind, one goal." 
"Button That Opened The Door" 
Roland Bekale, general secretary of 
the Cameroons National Action Move-
ment said, "The coming of indepen-
dence of the Cameroons is due in a 
great part to MRA." The visit of Fi-
nance Minister Charles Assale to the 
MRA Assembly at Mackinac, he said, 
pressed the button that opened the door. 
Following his visit to Mackinac, Min-
ister Assale had apologized to leaders 
of the government party for his bitter-
ness toward them. Later he was asked 
to be Finance Minister in the Govern-
ment. 
The passage through Parliament of 
the 1959 budget by unanimous vote was 
due to what the Minister had learned 
through MRA, Bekale said. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
Cape Town, South Africa: Manasseh 
Moerane, a leader of South Africa's 
8,000,000 Africans, stepped forward on 
stage and spoke to the white audience 
at the new Broadway Theatre in this 
capital city. 
It was the first time in SOuth African 
history an African had 'addressed a 
white audience at a public meeting. 
Moerane, former President of the Afri-
can Teachers' Federation, ,,was greeted 
with applause. The occasion was the 
premiere of Freedom, the all-African 
film of which he is an author. 
MANASSEH MOERANE 
Senators and Members of Parliament 
from the Government and Opposition 
articulated the answer to the division 
created by hate and haughtiness. 
Parliament sitting now in Cape Town 
faces the issue of finding a solution to 
the unrest that is boiling up into riots 
and bloodshed from one end of the 
continent to the other. 
Die Burger, the leading Africaans pa-
per, which the late Premier Malan used 
to edit, reviewed Freedom under the 
headline, "One cannot shake off this film 
by a shrug of the shoulder." 
Gallant Faith 
(Continued from page 141) 
"It is up to us whether we carry on 
the Cross of Christ which Mrs. Cornell 
lived. With the Cross of Christ lived in 
reality?which means a change at the 
very root?America can save the world. 
This is the only answer which can take 
Communists' breath away and change 
them. This is what Mrs. Cornell wanted 
to say to America and the whole world." 
Noted Burmese educator Daw Nyein 
Tim also told of Priscilla Cornell at 
Baguio: 
"The word for Priscilla is selflessness. 
Her absolute commitment was to obey 
God. She often said, 'God never makes 
mistakes.' Everything from God is a 
gift?use it to the maximum to remake 
the world.'" 
Mrs. William Close of Greenwich, 
Connecticut, said: "I'll never forget 
when Priscilla stood up and told the 
Baguio Assembly about her, cancer?and 
about her victorious faith: and how with 
four children at home she was at Baguio 
while her life was held by such a slender 
thread. The room was stunned, people 
Were so shaken. 
"Americans are not alWays loved in 
Asia. But I was proud to be with Pris-
cilla because she was honest with Asians 
about where she needed to change, with 
her joy and sense of humor, and they 
responded to that." 
A British couple, Mr. and Mrs. Rich-
ard Channer, said that Mrs. Cornell 
"melted cold hearts in Britain" during 
her time in 1956 when the musical 
drama The Vanishing Island was in 
London. 
Alfred Ferreira, South African school 
principal, remarked on the effect of her 
welcome to Africans in her home: "How 
happy she was! To us Africans she was 
the woman of the new America, who 
really lived the revolution of the heart 
which is going to win the world." 
The grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, 
Rajmohan Gandhi, called her "a patriot 
and stateswoman whose heart was given 
to the world. The first Baguio Assembly 
completely changed the history of Asia."

"Mao. Tse-tung's Hungary" 
TIBET FOCUSES NEW THINKING IN ASIA 
MORE THAN ANY EVENT in the last 
ten years, the dramatic flight to 
India of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's 23-year-
old god-king, has alerted millions 
throughout Asia to the true nature of 
the Communist bid for the world. 
At the same time, Tibet now throws 
into sharp perspective the trend of posi-
tive ideological thinking among Budd-
hist Asian leaders in the past decade. 
A new awareness has come. Mao Tze-
tung's suppression of Tibet has violated 
"the spirit of Bandung." It has exposed 
"peaceful coexistence." This is the tone 
of press reactions in India, Burma, Cey-
lon and Indonesia. The Daily Times of 
Jakarta commented: "This picture of 
Asians kicking Asians around is not a 
pleisant one." 
"Mao Tse-tung's Hungary . . ." With 
rocket speed this commentary has al-
ready circled the world. 
The New Enlightenment 
What is the new thinking, the answer-
ing force in Asia? 
Quietly and effectively over the past 
ten years a new direction has come 
among Asian leaders. When Dr. Frank 
Buchman in 1952 took a force of 200 
to India, Pakistan and Ceylon?during 
the course of which he was invited to 
address both houses of the Indian Par-
liament in New Delhi ? the Bombay 
Chronicle commented: "For the first 
time millions in Asia have seen a posi-
tive alternative to Communism." 
Meanwhile there was a stirring in 
Buddhist Asia, the spiritual kinsmen of 
the Dalai Lama's Tibetan subjects. 
Two saffron-robed Buddhist priests of 
Burma set precedent by attending World 
Assemblies of Moral Re-Armament at 
Mackinac and Caux. U Rewata, Abbot 
of the Aletawya Monastery of Rangoon, 
gave up his plans to retire in Ceylon and 
decided instead, after seeing the effec-
tiveness of this answering ideology at 
Mackinac, to bring Moral Re-Armament 
to his people. "We must work with oth-
ers to bring Moral Re-Armament to 
every nation," U Rewata said. "Only so 
can we bring peace to the whole world." 
The Lord Abbot of Wet Mahadhatu Monastery, leader of 200,000 Buddhist priests in 
Thailand, decorates Dr. Frank Buchman with a' gold medal at Mackinac Island, Mich. 
U Narada, another Buddhist priest of 
Burma, attended the Caux Assembly and 
joined U Rewata in the fight for the 
new thinking in Burma. 
The action of U Rewata and U Nar-
ada led to a meeting at Rangoon's famed 
Shwe Dagon Pagoda under the leader-
ship of the Mon Yin Sayadaw, elder 
statesman of Burma's 80,000 Buddhist 
priests. 
So effective has been the impact of 
Moral Re-Armament in giving a new 
thinking that former Prime Minister 
U Nu?five years later in 1957?public-
ly declared, "Dr. Buchman has given the 
world an ideology above race or class 
because it answers the needs of the heart. 
It seeks to change men, their ideas, their 
aims, and their motives." 
"Never Too Late To Begin" 
A further statesmanlike leadership 
has come from one of Thailand's out-
standing Buddhist monks, the Lord Ab-
bot of Wat Mahadhatu Monastery in 
Bangkok, leader of 200,000 priests in 
his country . 
Last summer the Lord Abbot, with 
official permission of the King and Cabi-
net of Thailand, attended the World As-
143 
sembly of Moral Re-Armament at Mack-
inac. 
"I wish I had met you twenty years 
ago," the Lord Abbot said to Dr. Buch-
man at Mackinac. "Think of what we 
could have done together for world 
peace." 
"It's never too late to begin," Dr. 
Buchman replied. 
For China and Russia Too 
From Mackinac the Lord Abbot went 
to Washington, London, Bonn, Rome, 
and New Delhi, fired with this new con-
viction. He spoke from the President's 
box, night after night, at the National 
Theater in Washington to packed audi-
ences, after the presentation of Moral 
Re-Armament plays. He talked with 
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in the 
German capital about Moral Re-Arma-
ment. He met the late Pope Pius XII at 
Saint Peter's in Rome. He conferred with 
the President of India in New Delhi. 
Wherever he went he had one burn-
ing conviction. "The four absolute moral 
standards of Moral Re-Armament must 
go to the whole world?including China 
and Russia."

New Light For Italy 
Behind the effort to unite Europe and establish a sound 
economic foundation and an effective military defense 
(NATO) comes the story of a bloodless revolution. 
As Uncle Tom's Cabin caught the conscience of the 
American people, so the play La Luce di Domani (The 
Light of Tomorrow) has awakened a new thinking and 
attitude in the industrial, social and government life of 
Italy. 
Angelo Pasetto, author of the play, fought in the under-
ground resistance movement during World War II and 
was for six years a member of the Italian Communist 
Party. He and millions more in his country became cyni-
cal towards the Church and democracy. At war's end Fas-
cism and Communism clashed violently for the people's 
allegiance. Extremes of poverty and progress divided them 
still further. 
Angelo Pasetto forged Light of Tomorrow from these 
realities, and his own experience in Italy since. A militant 
trade unionist won from Communism by Moral Re-Arma-
ment, he lost his bitterness, and the road reopened for him 
back to the Catholic Church. 
Light of Tomorrow is one of the weapons being used to 
implement Chancellor Adenauer's appeal for Dr. Frank 
Buchman to help unite Europe on the basis of MRA. 
In the first-night audience at the Georlomo Theatre were 
nobility, industrialists, workers of every viewpoint. 
"Every time I see this play," said the wife of trade union 
leader Egidio Quaglia, "it uncovers the wound again." (Her 
father had been killed by the Communists.) "But it is 
ANGELO PASETTO 
worthwhile because through it an answer is brought to the 
world. I am grateful to MRA which has brought healing 
to these hurts and all the bitterness in my life." 
One of Italy's foremost textile industrialists, Franco 
Marinotti, brought a party of 18. "This play will resolve 
many problems in Italy," he said.

Additions 
Additions to the program for

The coaching clinics will be 
held every Saturday during the

district coaches, recreation 
personnel and outstanding San 
Marino High School Athletes 
will work together to provide 
top notch instruction in foot-
ball, basketball, track and base-
ball for all interested boys in 
San Marino. 
The Valentine School Pro-
gram which started late this 
year on a two day per week 
trial basis will be expanded to 
operate Monday through Fri-
day next year. 
In addition, the possibilities 
of adding a summer drama 
class and extending the intra-
mural program into the High 
School age levels are under 
consideration. Plans for further 
expansions of 'baseball pro-

Instructional costs in the Unified School District are con-
tinuing their gradual climb upward, with the Board of Educa-
tion Tuesday night approving a salary increase of $100 per step 
for teachers in the Unified School District and ok'ing the addition 
of another seven teachers for 
the next school year. Superin-
tendent Walter Dingus affirmed 
that the net cost of these in-
creases and additions would 
approximate $55,000 - slightly 
above increased costs last 
year with additions and raises. 
Dingus also said the District 
will be able to live within its 
present tax rate, and contem-
plates no increase. 
A beginning teacher in San 
Marino would now earn $4600, 
compared to $4500 per annum a 
year ago, while a teacher with 
three years experience in the 
District (or the equivalent of 
three years experience when 
hired) would be paid $5150, up 
$100 over a year ago. All in all 
these salary increases will raise 
operating costs for next year 
by $13,000, Dingus noted. 
New Personnel Costs 
However the biggest increase 
In operating expenses will 
come in hiring of new person-

hired had three years exper-

the best instructors available, 
it will take another $35,000 to 
pay teachers this year. 
Other increases will bring the 
total to around $55,000.

(Editor's Note: Douglas Cunningham of Melville drive is turing Company in Vernon. 
A native of Southern Califor-
nia, he graduated from the Uni-
versity of Southern California 
in 1931, entering business later. 
He was a member of the Ver-
non Rotary Club, the Univer-
sity Club and the Vernon Cham-
ber of Commerce. 
Members of his family who 
survive him include his widow, 
Mrs. Grace Houck Blackman; 
four children, Carol, Robert, 
Linda and Russell; a brother, 
Russell G. Blackman; two sis-
ters, Mrs. Harry Wittenberg 
and Mrs. C: L. Brewer Jr. and 
his mother, Mrs. Carolyn M. 
Blackman. 
Spending this academic year far from Pomona tranquillity, earn-
ing credits at the American University in Beirut. Last week he 
reported on the anti-communist change in Arab politics. This 
week, as Christians in San Marino celebrate Easter - and as 
Spring comes to the city - he writes of a troubled Holy Land. 
This other land, far from Lacy Park sunrise services and the 
"Alleluias" of the local Church choirs, is celebrating Easter its 
own way. Cunningham's report follows* 
Just as Easter assumes its place in the affairs of San Ma-
rino, even so do religious events receive attention in the Middle 
East, although quite apart from Easter celebrations there. Re-
porting on he anti-communist gyrations of Gamal Abdul Nasser 
of Egypt, Douglas Cunning-
ham of Melville drive opines 
that "Nasser has brought in re-
ligion to back him in his anti-
communist campaign. In an 
unprecedented show, probably 
for Western and Lebanese con-
sumpton, the Greek Orthodox 
Bishop marched side by side 
with the Chief Muslim Sheikh 
into the main Damascus Mos-
que to orate over the body of 
an Iraq rebel killed in last 
week's revolt." 
Cunningham adds "this type 
of ceremony, minus the Chris-
tian participation of course, 
dates from the 'Holy War' 
declarations of the early days 
of Islams and the Crusades. 
Religion is a powerful weapon 
in Nasser's hands, but more 
powerful among the peasantry 
than among the students and 
Intellectuals who have guided 
Syrian politics." 
Religion Of Revenge 
A religion of "revenge is the 
only solution" guides the ref-
ugees from Palestine, another 
group powerfully affecting the 
Middle East, Cunningham pens. 
"Having visited friends in one 
of the Middle East's many 
camps for Palestine refugees, 
I can report on the amazing 
durability of their hopes of re-
turning home." 
"They are, I believe, rightly 
convinced of the justice of their 
claims," he goes on, "and very 
few will even discuss the pos-
sibility of Israel's long-term 
existence." 
Nasser On the Spot 
Commenting on Nasser's 
propaganda war with Iraq's 
Premier, Abdul Karim Has-
sem, the young San Marinan 
notes that "by his current anti-
communist outbursts, Nasser 
has really put himself on the 
spot." If he antagonizes the 
Soviets too much, Cunningham 
ventures, Nasser may lose the 
military materiel support he 
counts on to equip and main-
tain his war machine. If he 
ceases to attack Israel, he may 
lose the support of the Arab 
community. 
He writes that "Abdul Nas-
ser's hope is that the United 
States will back him, but with 
as few demands as possible re-
garding Israel. This is the ap-
proximate translation of the 
term, 'unconditional foreign 
aid." 
Street And 
Storm Drain 
Jobs Start 
Two long awaited projects 
planned by the City and Coun-
ty began this week, according 
to City officials. The San Ma-
rino avenue project, the City's 
biggest capital improvement 
for the year, will reconstruct 
the tree line avenue from Eus-
ton road north to the City 
limits. 
In another action, the County 
got its Granada avenue storm 
drain project started, as work-
men opened the project in the 
west end of San Marino. 
ame Valentine 
As President 
Of Auto Club 
Edward R. Valentine of El 
?Molino avenue, for many years 
a resident of this city, was 
elected president of the South-
ern California Auto Club re-
cently, succeeding Harry J. 
Bauer. Valentine had been 
vice-president of the Club since 
1949, and in taking the post re-
places a man who had held the 
job for 29 years.

MRA The Answer To Communism 
"FOR AMERICA ? MORAL RE-ARMAMENT OR COMMUNISM" 
By 
Admiral William H. Standley 
Former Chief of Naval Operations and former United States Ambassador to Moscow 
SAN DIEGO, March 24, 1959?It is well known to all my friends in 
San Diego and for that matter to all San Diego residents that I am and 
have been for years a definite and outspoken enemy of communism. 
My stand on the McCarthy issue is well known to them all. 
We are in a world war of ideas and our greatest need is to go on the 
offensive. We must awaken America to the need of arming our nation 
with an ideology as well as through economic and military means. Sub-
versive forces are tearing down and undermining the moral strength of 
America. At the same time with ruthless duplicity Moscow is sweet one 
day and tough the next with a strategy which the free world has failed 
to comprehend. 
Moral Re-Armament, which came to San Diego with an internation-
al ideological force of 150 men and women from 23 nations is at the 
same time effectively operating with similar forces in Europe, Asia and 
Africa. I have known Moral Re-Armament for 20 years. I know it is 
effectively answering communism. Moscow attacks it for that reason. 
Subversive forces, aiming to weaken the free world and destroy Moral 
Re-Armament, have accused it of being pacifist, and are behind this mis-
chievous propaganda. 
Moral Re-Armament strives to make men 
and nations incorruptible and therefore a bul-
wark against the advance of communism in this 
country as well as every other free country. 
Moral Re-Armament provides strength for demo-
cracy. It is a continuation of the American Re-
volution on a world scale. With Moral Re-Arma-
ment America can go on the offensive in the 
world war of ideas. 
To set the record straight, Moral Re-Arma-
ment is not and has never been pacifist. It shares 
equally in importance with material re-arma-
ment. Both are essential to our survival. Men 
trained in Moral Re-Armament have served and 
are serving with honor on many battelfields of 
the world. When the Second World War was 
over these men knew that the real battle had 
just begun. In the last 20 years a force of men 
has been built on every continent with the train-
ing adequate to the need. Moral Re-Armament 
ranks with the highest form of patriotism and is 
providing an irreplaceable national service. 
Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of Moral 
Re-Armament and a great American, 30 years ago 
saw the need for an ideological force in the free 
world and started then to create the answering 
force. He says, "We need an idea in the head and 
an answer in the heart as well as a gun in the 
hand." 
Moral Re-Armament is being recognized as 
a superior ideology to communism throughout the 
world. Statesmen in key areas are turning to it. 
Chancellor Adenauer of West Germany in invit-
ing an MRA force to Germany says, "Unless 
the work of Moral Re-Armament is carried for-
ward, peace in the world cannot be maintained." 
Prime Minister Kishi of Japan, inviting the 
MRA force to Japan, says, "This idea is the most 
needed one at this crucial time in our history." 
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma 
Gandhi, said to me, "For India the choice today 
is Moral Re-Armament or communism." 
I believe the same choice confronts America; 
Moral Re-Armament or communism. 
Moral Re-Armament is bringing a rebirth 
of democracy and is restoring God to leadership 
in the lives of men and nations. I have witnessed 
these ideological plays recently presented in San 
Diego by Moral Re-Armament and am more con-
vinced than ever that they are bringing the 
answer for all mankind. 
ADMIRAL WILLIAM H. STANDLEY, the former Chief of Naval 
Operations and formerly United States Ambassechr to Moscow, 
in a statement printed on this page called MRA "the continu-
ation of the American Revolution on a world scale." He adds: 
"The choice that confronts America is Moral Re-Armament or 
Communism." 
SAN DIEGO. General J. W. O'Daniel, seen here with some of the cast of the MRA Asian play, "The Road to Tomorrow," 
after a presentation in San Diego last week. General O'Daniel, who commanded the famous "Hell on Wheels" 3rd 
Division, which fought through Italy into Germany, and was known as "Iron Mike" by his men, called MRA "the 
answer to Communism for the whole world." 
PALM SPRINGS. Mayor Frank Bogert (right) greets Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahatma. The Mayor pre-
sented the keys of the city to Gandhi and the MRA force following performances of the MRA play at the Palm 
Springs High School Auditorium. The Mayor said the visit of this MRA force was "the best thing ever to happen to 
Palm Springs." The School Board has since passed a resolution inviting the MRA youth play "The New American" 
for a presentation in the High School at a School Assembly. 
WASHINGTON. Two missile experts, Dr. S. D. Cornell (right) Executive Officer of the 
National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. and B. F. Coggan, General Manager, 
Convair, San Diego. The MRA task force has been in San Diego this week at the 
invitation of Coggan and other senior citizens. Speaking in Los Angeles recently, 
Cornell "TnC.1" we face three aitern.t;vp. tntriL, voru AL-4 _ 
renaissance for all men through MRA." 
EL TORO MARINE BASE: Major-General S. S. Jack, Commanding General AirFMP Pacific, with members of the MRA 
task force, following a presentation of the MRA plays at the Marine Base this week. With General Jack is a Japanese 
who spent eleven years in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp in Siberia. In Russian periodicals there he read attacks 
on MRA. The MRA plays were invited to the Base by the Base Commander, Brigadier-General Ronald- Salmon. 
BEVERLY HILLS. Chief of Police Clinton Anderson, (right) talks before the MRA play with 
Kichizaemon Sumitomo of Japan. Sumitomo is head of the well-known banking and

political advisor to Archbishop Makarios, confer on the Cyprus problem at the MRA Assembly in Los Angeles. Rossides then 
flew directly to the Cyprus Conference in London, where he played a significant part. The Greek Ambassador to the UN recently 
wrote MRA expressing his "thanks for the valuable contribution made by MRA towards the settlement of Cyprus." 
San Marino, California, Thursday, March X, 1959
