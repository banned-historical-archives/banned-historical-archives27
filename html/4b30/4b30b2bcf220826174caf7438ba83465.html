 Zhang Wenjin May Be Next
 Foreign Minister' (s NF)
 /hang Wenjin apparently has the inside track on
 replacing ailing Huang Flua as Foreign Minister. A
 senior Foreign Ministry official told US Embassy
 officers that /hang, currently a Vice Foreign Minis-
 ter, is likely to take up his new post after he finishes
 supervising discussions with the United States over
 the sensitive Taiwan arms sales issue.
 Zhou's Protege
 As a young language officer and protege of Zhou
 Fnlai, /hang assisted in Zhou's negotiations with the
 Marshall mission in 1945-46. He later accompanied
 Zhou to the Geneva Conference on Korea and Indo-
 china.
 /hang participated in meetings with the two
 Kissinger missions in 1971 and the Haig mission
 inimediately preceding President Nixon's February
 19721 visit. lie also played an active role in negotiating
 language for the Shanghai Communique
 /hang apparently ran afoul of some top leaders in
 1973, but Zhou Enlai moved quickly to protect Zhang
 by appointing hint Ambassador to Ottawa, where he
 served quietly until recalled in late 1977. In January
 1978, with Deng Xiaoping running foreign policy,
 there were good indications Zhang would become
 Depute Permanent Representative to the UN during
 a major reshuffle of China's ambassadors. Zhang
 instead was appointed to the more substantial post of
 Vice Foreign Minister responsible for West European
 affairs, in which capacity he apparently helped pre-
 pare for negotiations to normalize relations with the
 United States.
 Mao's niece and his leftist representative-Vice For-
 eign Minister Wang Hairong  was nominally respon-
 sible for American affairs, but her career and Zhang's
 intersected in a way that suggests the two were rivals
 who monitored their patrons' interests in the develop-
 ing relationship with the United States. Both Wang
 and /,hang originally were appointed to the posts of
 Assistants to the Foreign Minister in May 197'_ in
 what may have been an effort at striking a balance. In
 December 1978, when the left had suffered setbacks
 at a watershed plenum of the Central Committee and
 when the party under Deng's leadership decided to
 press ahead with US-China normali,ation, /hang
 was abruptly brought in to replace Wang Hairong in
 the negotiating sessions with Ambassador         25X1
 Woodcock - an indication of Deng's special trust in
 him. Wang Hairong was sent to a party school  a
 form of political punishment  and /hang assumed
 formal responsibility for American affairs
 Implications for the United States
 Zhang has shown himself to be both conciliatory and
 tough in his dealings with Washingt(,n. Members of
 the Nixon party portrayed /hang as mild and cooper-
 ative in his dealings. After the May 1979 signing of
 the Claims and Assets Agreement, however, /hang
 said privately that the Chinese suspected that they
 "had been had" and that this had sparked criticism at
 the National People's Congress. He implied that 25X1
 China would be more ware in later agreements.
 25X1
 Under instruction, /hang can be as abrasive as
 Foreign Minister Huang, but lie is not so unifornily
 inflexible and dogmatic. The leadership may in fact
 be using Huang's illness as a pretext to put a more
 subtle tactician in the Minister's office.
 25X1
 Zhang's close association with the United States,
 moreover, suggests that his reported selection reflects
 a hope in Beijing that current tensions in US-China

 Although Zhang apparently has been tapped for the
 job, his appointment has not yet been publicly con-
 firmed and it is conceivable that it could fall through.

 mors that Zhang would become the next Ambassador
 to the United States but apparently was not queried
 about the Foreign Minister's position. Huang llua,

 Third World
 China is devoting greater attention to the Third
 World in an effort to rejuvenate its own image,
 distance itself from some US policy initiatives, and
 expand support for an anti-Soviet "united front."
 Chinese actions are partly a response to differences
 with the United States over Taiwan, but Beijing's
 efforts in the Third World have acquired a logic of
 their own, mainly because of China's desire to moder-
 ate its identification with the West. Beijing is likely to
 maintain a more active and independent approach to
 the Third World regardless of the outcome of the
 Taiwan issue.
 Signs of Change
 For the past year, China's emphasis on the Third
 World has been intended in part to signal to Washing-
 ton the alternative directions for Chinese policy and
 implicitly to register displeasure over the Taiwan
 issue. Essentially, Beijing sought to demonstrate the
 potential limits on its cooperation with the United
 States if differences over Taiwan were not resolved.
 At the same time, however, the Chinese also respond-
 ed to several US initiatives in the Third World by
 criticizing Washington for actions that, in Beijing's
 view, jeopardized an effective international opposition
 to the Soviet Union.
 Chinese criticism of the United States initially sur-
 faced last year over El Salvador, with Beijing ap-
 plauding Washington's opposition to Moscow in the
 Caribbean Basin. while questioning US intentions and
 sensitivity to local conditions. Beijing obviously
 sought maneuvering room in case US actions pro-
 voked widespread local or international criticism, at
 the same time hoping to retain some identification
 with the leftist movements in the region.
 China's public statements, for example, have implicit-
 ly condemned the United States as part of their direct
 attacks on the USSR and Cuba for "outside interfer-
 ence.'' Chinese media also replayed Without eontntent
 statements from the Sandinista and Salvadoran guer-
 rillas that run counter to US positions
 Concern that identification with the United States
 could harm the anti-Soviet effort and China's ovyn
 diplomatic equities has also been reflected in Beijing's
 approach to southern Africa and the Middle Fast.
 Various actions by Israel and South Africa, and vocal
 Third World criticism thereof', have prompted the
 Chinese to make increasingly harsh public continent.,,
 that have usually linked the criticized actions to lS
 support.                   25X1    25X1
 Beijing also has been more active  and independ-
 ent-in various international forums, where it has
 spotlighted its Third World interests. North-South
 economic issues have presented an area \\here the
 Chinese could simultaneously work to mitigate divi-
 sion among states opposing the Soviet Inion and also
 burnish their own credentials. At Cancun, for exam-
 ple, Beijing urged the United States and other West-
 ern nations to accommodate moderate Third World
 goals as part of' a common strategic and implicitl\
 anti-Soviet interest. China castigated Moscow for its
 poor record on economic aid and for failing to attend
 the meeting. Beijing also subsequently chided Wash-
 ington for its "obduracy'' in the face of Chinese
 advice
 At the UN, meanwhile, China gained points with the
 Third World by advertising its support for Tanzania's
 Foreign Minister Salim and its opposition to Secre-
 tary General Waldheim in the race for the UiS's
 senior leadership position. Indeed, Beijing's I N role
 drew considerable praise late last year when Foreign
 Minister Huang Hua and Vice Foreign Minister
 Gong Dafei toured several African capitals soon after

 Approved For Release 2008/09/02 : CIA-RDP03TO2547R000101160001-3
 Beijing's revitalized campaign for attention to the
 Third World reflects several motives. On the one
 hand, the Chinese realize that they could be tarred by
 their greater identification with the United States if
 Washington's actions provoke a backlash. The Chi-
 nese also know their longtime anti-Soviet stand had
 been generally regarded  and portrayed by Mos-
 cow  as paralleling the US position. For tactical
 reasons alone, China may feel a need, particularly in
 such cases as South Africa and Israel, to distance its
 own position from that of the United States.
 In fact, as the theoretical underpinning for their new
 emphasis on the Third World, the Chinese have
 revived Mao Zedong's "Theory of the Three Worlds,"
 which holds that the developing nations constitute the
 main force to combat imperialism and hegemonism. A
 return to the theory as a more ideologically orthodox
 foreign policy position not only is useful for China's
 international objectives, but also reflects the conserva-
 tive domestic political climate ushered in by the
 December 1980 Work Conference. It also coincides
 with the reemergence of Ji Pengfei and Li Xiannian-
 two ideological traditionalists- -as more prominent
 spokesmen for China's foreign policy. The influence
 of their more orthodox views, which would favor
 greater emphasis on the Third World, suggests that
 the shift in China's policy will persist irrespective of
 how the Taiwan question is resolved.
 Policy Tools
 This new emphasis has not significantly changed
 China's commitment of resources to implement its
 policy goals in the Third World where Chinese eco-
 nomic assistance has been declining since the early
 I 970s. Beijing lacks military or economic leverage
 comparable to that of the United States and the
 USSR in the developing world, although the Chinese
 have selectively increased the quality and visibility of
 their aid in certain politically important areas. More-
 over, the Chinese are sensitive to complaints about the
 level of their assistance and have avoided criticizing
 countries that accept aid from Moscow but have
 cautioned them about Soviet motives.
 The Chinese use their arms sales programs both to
 earn foreign exchange and to enhance their foreign
 policy objectives. Since 1980, when China shifted
 from gratis arms aid to arms sales, Beijing has heavily
 reoriented its military supply relationships toward the
 Middle East and away from a number of its former
 and considerably less wealthy  recipients in Sub-
 Saharan Africa. China's willingness to supply Soviet-
 type military equipment, especially in crisis situations,
 has enhanced its influence with new clients like Iraq.
 The Chinese also have maintained several supply
 relationships with such longtime clients as Pakistan,
 Tanzania, and Zaire by offering concessionary rates
 and attractive terms. China has thereby been able to
 use its arms sales for an increased economic return
 without damaging its position in key states.
 During the past year, China also focused its more
 traditional diplomatic efforts on the Third World. In
 1981, Premier Zhao Ziyang undertook the highest
 level official trip a Chinese leader had ever made to
 Latin America: he also made three separate trips to
 Asia. Foreign Minister Huang Hua also traveled to
 Latin America, to West and Central Africa  ending
 nearly three years of inattention to that region and
 to India. Meanwhile, a steady stream of Third World
 leaders visited China.
 Complementing regular governmental activities, the
 Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is attempting to
 further develop its network of party-level contacts and
 to undercut Moscow's claim to be the "natural ally"
 of the Third World. Since its rapprochement with the
 Yugoslavian party in 1977, the CCP has gradually
 moved to establish official relations with a broad
 spectrum of political parties, focusing particularly on
 the ruling parties in the Third World. Official rela-
 tions with parties in the Third World also serve as a
 conduit for Chinese efforts to encourage an informal
 grouping of leftists against the Communist Party of
 the Soviet Union
 Prospects
 Although a resolution of differences with the United
 States over the Taiwan issue almost certainly would
 affect Beijing's approach to US actions in the Third
 World, the Chinese will still maintain a more active
 and independent approach in this arena. Such actions
 will include:

 ? Criticizing L;S support for Israel, South Africa,
 South Korea, and the military governments in Cen-

 ? Highlighting moderate demands for a "New Inter-

 ? Publicly supporting "national liberation'' move-
 ment, in the Middle East and southern Africa,

 selected amounts of direct aid: perhaps providing
 rhetorical backing for similar causes in Latin
 America.
 ? Focusing attention on the nonaligned movement and
 the Group of 77 and their causes in international
 organizations
 The desire to check, and ultimately to reduce, Soviet
 influence, however, will remain the linchpin of Chi-
 na's policies in the Third World. Beijing will continue
 to provide material support to anti-Vietnamese and
 anti-Soviet resistance in Indochina and Afghanistan
 and will also continue to furnish military supplies to
 key states such as Egypt, Sudan, and Pakistan, where
 it has the avenues and means to help. Moreover, even
 in areas such as the Middle East, where ES policies
 are the subject of Chinese criticism, Beijing will seek
 to avoid actions that directly undercut E ,,'S efforts to
 counter Moscow's designs.

 The Vietnamese most keenly suffer from the limited
 availability of food, although shortages of nearly
 everything else are widespread  from the most ordi-
 nar consumer goods to fuels, electricity, and trans-
 portation services. Government control of what few
 goods are still readily available has been weakening,
 and people are increasingly being forced into the free
 market to survive. Vietnam is likely to turn more to
 the Iy1 F for help to control the currency problems
 that have followed the 1981 rises in procurement
 prices and wages.
 Shortages of Food and Consumer Goods
 Grain production, which was 8.9 million tons in the
 initial full postwar year of 1976, dipped almost 20
 percent by 1978 because of bad weather and misman-
 agement but recovered in 1980. During the same
 period, however, the population grew by 4.9 million.
 Official rations, which normally feed about 20 percent
 of the total population of 55 million, were set at the
 beginning of the postwar era at an average 15 kilo-
 grams per month. By 1979, the average had fallen to
 less than 10 kilograms. Beginning sometime in 1980,
 the government increasingly left non-food-growing
 southerners to live by their own wits and concentrated
 on collecting food from the Mekong Delta for ship-
 ment to the north.
 Industrial output after the war rose 43 percent from
 1975 through 1978, starting from a yen low base and
 boosted by the availability of billions of dollars of
 Communist and non-Communist aid. During 1978-
 80, however, industrial output dropped some 15 per-
 cent as a result of the cumulative effects of niisnian-
 agement, socialization policies that undermined
 incentives, and shortages of spare parts and raw
 materials
 Simultaneously with the development of deficits in
 food and daily necessities in Vietnam, the I'SSR by
 default gained a near-monopoly position as aid donor
 when China ended its aid and Western donors sus-
 pended their programs because of' the cruel treatment
 of the boat people and the invasion of Kampuchea.
 Moscow, already concerned by a level of aid to allies
 that has risen to more than x25 billion a year in recent
 years, has offered only minimum economic aid and 25X1
 has warded off Hanoi's repeated demands for more.
 Growth of the Private Sector
 Most Vietnamese found that they could not survive on
 the official economy alone and, from late 197$ on,
 turned increasingly to the free market. The govern-
 ment reluctantly sanctioned a wider scope for the
 private sector and eventually acknowledged that until
 the economy achieved a higher level of socialist
 development, free markets could legitimatcly supply

 Some Improvement Last Year
 There was a small increase in supplies during 1981.
 Because of good weather in the north and the effects
 of a new system of contracts with peasants that
 allowed them to retain for themselves output above
 stipulated levels, grain production rose to an officially
 announced 9.6 million tons. Together with an estimat-
 ed 750,000 tons of Soviet grain aid and after deduc-
 tions for various losses and for seed, there was
 probably enough to provide average rations of at least
 10 kilograms per capita per month. The supply of
 industrial goods may also have risen substantially due
 to agreements signed with Moscow that called for a
 90-percent increase in commodities to be exchanged
 during 1981-85 compared with 1976-80. There was no
 improvement in government management, however,
 and output from industries run by the state declined.
 The state's most effective move during 1981 was to
 compete harder for grain from peasants and for goods
 from private producers by paying higher prices; the
 prices for so-called voluntary sales to the state report-
 edly rose by up to 200 percent depending on locality.
 At the same time, salaries for workers and officials
 were supplemented by up to several hundred percent
 to enable them to buy part of what they needed on the
 high-priced free market
 To finance these efforts, however, the government had
 to expand the money supply by about 15 percent. By
 mid-1981, the rate of inflation had climbed to three
 digits, according to some reports, driving people to
 seek refuge in foreign currencies, particularly the
 dollar. The government tried to gain control over all
 foreign currency in the country by requiring registra-
 tion but eventually had to devalue the dong from 2.19
 to 9 per dollar. The black market rate reportedly has
 climbed to 40 dong per dollar.
 hardship.
 Prospects for 1982
 Prospects for permanent improvement in the economy
 remain bleak. Hanoi does not have additional re-
 sources to throw into economic development in 1982.
 It is planning to continue last year's policies, hoping
 that good weather and tighter management will bring
 results. In an effort to increase production, the gov-
 ernment will extend the coverage of the incentive-
 boosting programs  the contract system in agricul-
 ture and piecework wages and increased plant
 autonomy in industry. A nominal 600,000-ton in-
 crease in grain production is planned. On the distribu-
 tion side, the government will try through administra-
 tive controls to curb the corruption and pricing abuses
 associated with the private sector. Hanoi apparently

 The Political Climate
 Although Prime Minister Suzuki's fiscal austerity
 program is coming under fire, he is still pursuing it
 and wants only a moderate increase in defense spend-
 ing. He has also suggested to the Defense Agency that
 defense expenditures should be kept under 1 percent
 of GNP:
 ? The 1-percent ceiling was established in 1976 along
 with the Program Outline to assuage the opposition
 parties and has since become an important political
 restraint on defense spending.
 ? Our projections show that even a moderate accelera-
 tion in defense spending increases would exceed the
 ceiling by 1986
 Although it is still politically risky for a Japanese
 politician to advocate a dramatic increase in the
 defense effort, there are a few signs that public
 opposition to an incremental military buildup is begin-
 ning to soften. Despite heavy press criticism of this
 year's defense budget, ruling Liberal Democrats
 passed a resolution at their annual convention last
 week declaring that a defense budget limited to I
 percent of GNP was "undeniably inadequate." This
 contradiction of Suzuki's personal preference clearly
 indicates that party pressure was instrumental in
 determining this year's defense spending and that

 Questions unanswered on
 Philippine Strafing of Japanese
 Ship
 The attack on the tanker Ilegg by Philippine aircraft
 on I; January could strain Philippine relations with
 Japan, but Manila and Tokyo have agreed to play
 down the incident until Japan's formal investigation is
 completed. Because of its concern that the incident
 ma  have broader implications, Tokyo is holding
 closely the information uncovered so far.
 FishN Stories
 According to Manila, the I Legg failed to display its
 flag and  as attacked when it refused to heed naval
 challenges to stop. The Ilegg is a Japanese-owned
 tanker that was chartered by a private South Korean
 company to deliver a cargo of methanol from Libya.
 Tokyo suspects that the tanker may have been in-
 volved in some sort of illegal activity. Its investigation
 is focusing on discrepancies in the stories of the crew.
 Several crewmen stated that the ship v'as not flying
 its flag at the time of attack, as previously claimed by
 the captain. Interrogation of the crew has also re-
 vealed that while loading its cargo in Marsa al-
 Buragha, Libya, the crew was taken ashore and
 driven downtown by government bus. The crew be-
 licved that during their absence approximately 20
 men  possible Libyans  may have boarded the ves-
 sel.
 The captain has not provided Japanese investigators
 with a valid explanation of why the ship was in waters
 off Mindanao. His original route from Libya to South
 Korea vvas through the Straits of Malacca, with a stop
 in Singapore. The captain later amended the route to
 include stops in Malaysia and southern Mindanao. It
 is not clear from the interrogations if the ship had
 already stopped in southern Mindanao, a tradition;il
 infiltration point for arms moving from Mala\si;i to
 the Muslim insurgents.                     25X1
 Although Tokyo has permitted the tanker to proceed
 to South Korea, Japanese authorities h.nrc remained
 on the ship and will continue their investigation on its
 return to Japan. F--l                      25X1

 The Idegg incident could also damage .Japan's ties
 with Seoul, just when aid negotiations that havc
 strained relations since last summer seem hack on
 track. If in the Ilegg case a Korean company in fact
 chartered a Japanese ship to take part in illegal
 activity aimed against a friendly nation, relations
 between the two could again become tense. The
 Japanese have long been critical of South Korc,t's
 involvement in questionable dealings. particularly
 when those activities have been conducted on J ipa-
 nese territory. The kidnaping of a Korean dissident
 residing in Japan by South Korean intelligence ;tgents
 in 1973 raised a storm of protest in lapin.

 and natural fertilizers. If successful, corporate management of energy resource
 development will likely be tried out in other regions.
 More Overseas Construction Projects
 As many as 10,000 Chinese workers participated in foreign construction projects
 in 1981 . Although the total foreign exchange earned from the projects probably
 amounted to less than $100 million, Beijing is currently negotiating contracts that
 could increase annual earnings substantially
 Iraq and North Yemen have been the biggest customers for Chinese labor, but
 contracts have also been signed with the Philippines, Malta, and Jordan. The
 Chinese have had difficulty penetrating some of the more lucrative markets such
 as those in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because of it lack of diplomatic relations.
 Beijing views the overseas construction market as a means of employing its most
 abundant resource -manpower  to generate badly needed foreign exchange.
 Since early 1979 China has established at least 10 national companies having
 access to a work force totaling more than a million people. The companies offer di-
 verse labor for constructing housing and industrial complexes, roads and harbors,
 and for manning foreign merchant vessels. At least six provincial-level companies
 also offer their services abroad. To refute accusations of "coolie labor," Beijing
 bills its work force as one comprised of skilled laborers, many of' whom have had
 extensive overseas experience with Chinese aid projects.
 Metals Exports lip Sharply Last Year
 The surge in sales of ferrous and nonferrous metals from $680 million in 1980 to
 $I billion in 1981 in part reflects the trend toward allowing industrial producers to
 make direct sales abroad. Some metals trade, formerly managed by the Ministry
 of Foreign Trade, has also been taken over by the provinces and by the China Na-
 tional Metallurgical Import and Export Corporation, formed in 1980.
 Despite declining steel production and a deemphasis on heavy industry, China has
 increased metal exports by drawing down its huge stockpiles. Further, China's
 metals industry is structured to provide products for heavy industry. By selling
 abroad, China can earn the foreign exchange necessary to buy the thin sheet
 metals needed to supply the rapidly growing consumer industries.

 gone far enough for Tokyo:
 ? The Koreans have modified their original demand for S6 billion in Coll cessionaI
 loans and seem willing to accept a package as low as $4 billion. this figure is still
 an eightfold increase in current aid levels and is unacceptably high to the
 Japanese.
 ? The Koreans have also given the Japanese some details of the I I de%elopnicnt
 projects they want funded  although Tokvo has indicated that it skill scant
 If Seoul provides additional project details  as is likely  Tokyo nay prove more
 flexible in meeting Seoul's demand for a five-'car ''lump sum" aid commitment.
 Tokyo has resisted such a commitment, which runs counter to its policy of
 awarding development aid on a project-by-project, year-by-year basis. I he
 Japanese could, however, follow the example they set in loan negotiations vsitli the
 Chinese in 1980, when they indirectly indicated their willingness to provide loans
 over the life of a number of specific projects, with yearly amounts negotiated
 separately. Seoul and Tokyo still face the questions of aid mix, lhosvcver, svitlt the
 South Koreans insisting that the package be limited to loss-interest official
 development assistance and export-import credits only, without any private
 commercial loans, which they are seeking separately
 China now has a homeland visitation program with South Korea similar to one it
 has with North Korea and has allowed several aged Koreans living in China to vis-
 it relatives in South Korea. The program, the culmination of an 18-month effort by
 the Korean National Red Cross, began last December. Beijing also Hass permits
 the exchange of letters between separated families.

 Fast February Seoul unilaterally adopted an official policy of permitting Chinese
 fishing boats to take refuge in South Korean waters during bad weather, even
 offering to supply food, medicine, and fuel if needed. Ever since the offer was
 passed to Chinese authorities by a US official, well over 120 Chinese fishing boats
 have sought haven in South Korean waters. There is no evidence of Chinese
 reciprocity, however.
 Seoul intends these initiatives- and a brisk bilateral trade (some $400 million in
 1980)-- to be confidence-building measures that it hopes will expand into a more
 formal political relationship and exacerbate Beijing-Pyongyang tics. China, sensi-
 tive to North Korean displeasure over such contacts, has avoided publicizing them.
 Seoul uses the visits as effective, low-cost, pro--South Korean propaganda that can
 be directed at the 2 million Korean residents in Manchuria. Pyongyang's image
 among this group is already blemished, and South Korean radiobroadcasts play up
 the news of relatives in the South and descriptions of South Korean life. Moreover,
 Seoul is using what it perceives as a mood of conciliation with China to point up to
 its own people the flexibility of the Chun Doo Hwan government in dealing with a
 former Communist enemy. For both the domestic and international audience,
 Seoul can also contrast its efforts with Pyongyang's intransigence and unwilling-
 ness to discuss family exchanges and other humanitarian measures that could case
 tension on the peninsula and foster reunification.
