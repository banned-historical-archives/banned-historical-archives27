 has insisted that Havana emphasize agricultural production-rather

 Top Secret
 Prime Minister Gandhi yesterday appointed K.C. Pant as Defense
 Minister to replace V.P. Singh, who resigned amid growing financial
 scandals reportedly involving Gandhi's office. According to press
 reports, senior Cabinet and fellow Congress Party members last week
 had pressed Gandhi to drop Singh for embarrassing the Prime
 Minister by ordering an inquiry into a shady arms deal commission
 paid while Gandhi was serving as Acting Defense Minister. According
 to press and US Embassy sources, Singh's resignation had been
 imminent since his removal from the Finance Ministry two months ago
 following reports that he was checking into allegedly illegal foreign
 holdings of several Gandhi aides and had hired a US detective agency
 to investigate the affair.
 Comment: Singh's resignation almost certainly will do little to quiet
 Gandhi's critics. The financial scandals are only part of a series of
 opposition and intraparty challenges facing Gandhi, including his
 inability to solve the Sikh conflict in Punjab State and to halt an
 erosion of the Congress Party's power in non-Hindi-speaking states.
 Singh, long one of the most loyal of Gandhi's aides, almost certainly
 will not seek to implicate Gandhi more deeply in the scandals.
 INDIA-PAKISTAN: Trade Talks Moving Slowly
 India and Pakistan, in accordance with the agreement reached
 between Prime Minister Gandhi and President Zia at their meeting in
 February, continue to discuss the resumption of bilateral trade.
 Pakistan's Ambassador to India met with
 the Indian Commerce Secretary earl last month to make plans for a
 subcommittee on expandin trade.
 Comment: Other than the negotiations on troop withdrawals, these
 discussions mark the first time since the Zia-Gandhi meeting that the
 two countries have gotten together. Pakistan's determination to
 protect its markets and New Delhi's skepticism about Islamabad's
 commitment to restoring bilateral trade nonetheless are likely to
 delay additional moves. New Delhi probably believes Islamabad is
 more interested in impressing the US Congress, which is conducting
 hearings on aid to Pakistan, with a show of progress on easing
 regional tensions. Although the Indian Government probably will
 agree to the proposed subcommittee in principle, it is unlikely to
 proceed much further until the Pakistanis show a willingness to
 enlarge their list of imports.

 JAPAN: Trade Surplus Still Growing
 The Japanese trade surplus, a source of serious tensions between
 Tokyo and its trading partners, is headed for another record this year.
 The surplus in the first quarter of this year was nearly 40 percent
 larger than it was for the same period last year, according to official
 Japanese data. Most of the increase, however, occurred in the West
 European markets; the surplus with the US grew only slightly.
 Comment: If the trend of the past three months continues, Japan's
 trade surplus this year may reach $115 billion-nearly $33 billion
 more than the record level attained last year. The changing
 geographic makeup of the trade surplus suggests that Tokyo will be
 under increasing pressure from West European governments in the
 months ahead. The strong yen will force Japan to become less
 dependent on overseas sales, but the process will be slow and is jast
 beginning, as shown by the small decline in export volume last year.
 EGYPT-NORTH KOREA: Missile Development Cooperation
 Egypt is trying to develop a short-range ballistic missile similar to the
 Soviet Scud and hopes to begin production by late 1989 with North
 Korean assistance. Cairo wants to produce about 100 missiles a year
 eventually,                                      Production
 has not gone beyond the prototype phase, however, and the first
 motor assembled in Egypt was successfully bench-tested only
 recently. The Egyptians, with the assistance of 30 to 40 North Korean
 advisers, are doing most of this work at a factory near Cairo.
 Comment: If the program is successful, Egypt will be the first country
 in the Middle East-other than Israel-to produce indigenously
 SRBMs in quantity. Egypt, however, probably lacks the necessary
 plant, equipment, and technical expertise, especially in guidance and
 control, to begin series production before 1990, even with continued
 North Korean assistance. Cairo is likely to persevere as much for
 reasons of prestige as in expectation of eventual export earnings.

 Mexico's economy declined at an annual rate of 5 percent last
 quarter, and financing the federal deficit continued to absorb more
 than 90 percent of domestic credit, according to preliminary Mexican
 data. The private sector fears that this slump-caused by the delay in
 disbursing new foreign loans-will prompt President de la Madrid to
 overstimulate the economy later in the year, according to the US
 Embassy. Businessmen are reportedly concerned that the new money
 will be used primarily to create jobs and otherwise pump up the
 economy, activities that would fuel inflation-already running at
 125 percent on an annual basis.
 Comment: Even with new money, the government's economic growth
 target of at least 2 percent this year is in jeopardy, and plans to
 reduce inflation to 80 percent or less are virtually unattainable. With
 the economy now performing below target and national elections a
 little more than a year away, de la Madrid probably will opt for higher
 spending-even if it means higher inflation-over more conservative
 policies, such as cutting the country's deficit.

 Comment: Moi's increasingly autocratic behavior has helped to
 create an environment conducive to human rights violations by
 subordinates, but there is little indication that he sees this issue as
 anything more than a public relations problem. Despite the recent
 criticism, Kenya's record on human rights compares favorably with
 those of other Third World countries, and Western donors are unlikely
 to reduce aid substantially unless there is a sharp deterioration in that

 spokesman disclaimed an Army role in the ouster of former General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang; members of the Legislative Affairs Committee
 explained the anticipated holdup in the village council regulations and
 the controversial delay of a state enterprises law last month. Peng
 Peng once again demonstrated his power as chairman of the NPC by
 using its meetings as a personal forum. During his outing with the
 Hong Kong press, he expanded-perhaps disingenuously-on the
 need for Deng Xiaoping alone among the party elders to remain on
 the Politburo. He also parried a host of reformist complaints, denied
 the existence of "conservatives" within the leadership, and gave his

 Economic Straws in the Wind
 The delegates endorsed a resolution that culled from Zhao's report
 the most orthodox passages for special emphasis. In registering the
 criticality of grain production and underscoring the need for caution,
 thrift, scaled-down investment, and national self-reliance
 resolution repeated a litany of conservative concerns.
 Despite the conservative tone of the session, Zhao's report-
 apparently endorsed in its entirety-indicated he will continue to
 press for market-oriented reforms that reduce central control. Zhao L
 referred to a major review of China's reform program now under way
 that,                                   will detail a comprehensive,
 coordinated reform "blueprint." Slated for release next month, this
 study almost certainly will reaffirm the need for price reform and other
 controversial measures while reassuring critics of prudent
 implementation.
 Beijing is emphasizing "business as usual" following Hu's ouster, and
 controversial policies are likely to remain on hold, at least through the
 party congress. Chinese media have treated the NPC's public give
 and take as evidence of true deliberation and "socialist democracy."
 The main benefactors of the additional political weight now ascribed
 to the NPC are Peng and his associates who have been shunted there
 from high party posts since 1982.
 Although reformers have tightened fiscal and monetary policies, they
 have only limited control over several major problems. For example,
 their ability to boost grain production is heavily dependent on the
 weather, which has been poor this year. Reducing China's
 troublesome foreign trade deficit also requires increasing exports of
 textiles and other light manufactures, which may be difficult because
 of heightened protectionist sentiments in the West.

 Growing Dependence on Foreign Aid
 Foreign financial assistance to Nicaragua nearly quadrupled
 from $200 million in 1979, the year the Sandinistas seized power,
 to almost $800 million last year. Aid from Communist countries
 accounts for all of the increase, although the West provides
 about 20 percent of Nicaragua's foreign aid. The Soviets are
 likely to supply whatever additional assistance is needed to keep
 the Nicaraguan economy afloat despite Moscow's warnings that
 the Sandinistas must show more accountability for Communist
 Soviet Bloc and Cuban assistance to Nicaragua has expanded
 rapidly, soaring from $17 million in 1979 to almost $600 million last
 year                           Of the nearly $2 billion in
 economic assistance provided by those countries since 1979, more
 than one-half has been disbursed over the past two years; Moscow
 alone provided $235 million in 1985 and $325 million last year./-]

 The sharp increase in foreign assistance has done little to stem the
 deterioration of Nicaragua's economy. According to an official
 Sandinista study, the regime has failed to use investment assistance
 on projects that provide immediate returns but instead has directed
 much of it to long-term projects that drain scarce resources and
 produce few economic benefits. Moreover, most Soviet Bloc and
 Cuban aid has been spent on consumable goods rather than on
 development projects needed to generate economi  rowth,
 according to official Nicaraguan data.                                 25X1
 Declining Western Aid
 As Managua has increased domestic repression and moved closer to
 Communist countries, economic support from the West has gradually
 declined. Until 1984, the OECD countries, Latin America, and

 multilateral lending institutions provided
 Nicaragua's Communist benefactors
 The US cut off aid credits to the regime in 1981, credits from most
 multilateral lenders dropped in subsequent years, and Latin American
 aid fell sharply after 1983. Disbursements from Western Europe
 began to decline in 1984.
 Additional major cuts in Western aid are unlikely. US embassies in
 Western Europe report that the key remaining donors-Spain,
 Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands-are committed to
 maintaining ties to Managua.                       the focus of
 Western aid has shifted in recent years from emphasis on
 development projects to humanitarian aid and technical assistance.
 The Soviet Bloc and Cuba probably will supply, even if reluctantly,
 whatever economic aid it takes to buy the Sandinistas time to
 consolidate the regime and restructure their economy along
 "socialist" lines. Although Moscow probably would prefer to pace the
 growth in assistance, Nicaragua's economy is in such dire straits that
 much more aid will be needed to satisfy current consumption needs.
 As long as the insurgency continues, major development projects
 probably will remain on hold. Whatever the outcome of the fighting,
 Managua will need several billion dollars to rebuild its economy.

 Special Analysis
 POLAND: I            Status of Church-State Relations
 The possibility that the Polish regime will grant legal status to
 the Catholic Church appears to be increasing as the papal visit
 to Poland in June nears. Warsaw hopes that more cooperative
 relations will shore up its legitimacy, while the Church wants
 legal recognition of its status as Poland's leading independent
 institution. Powerful factions in the regime and the Church still
 oppose any agreement, however, and relations could deteriorate
 after the euphoria of a papal visit if the regime disappoints
 Church hopes for moderate reform or if the Church is unable to
 convince moderate opponents to give regime reforms a chance.
 The meetings between Pope John Paul II, leading Vatican officials,
 and President Jaruzelski in January reportedly resulted in an
 understanding to pursue greater cooperation that could culminate in
 the regime's recognition of the Church's legal status. Jaruzelski said
 that he would slowly implement reform, acknowledged that the
 regime needed the Church to help achieve national reconciliation, and
 claimed to have Moscow's blessings for his dealings with the Church.
 Church, Regime Objectives
 A final draft agreement on the Church's status reportedly has been
 prepared                                                At a
 minimum the Church probably hopes for an enlarged educational
 role, clarification of its tax status, increased media access, and a
 guarantee the regime will not interfere in administrative matters.

 Jaruzelski probably hopes to isolate opposition radicals by having the
 Church endorse his "slow but steady" approach to political reform.
 He also wants the Church to call for patience and cooperation while
 the regime enacts painful economic reforms, and he may hope to
 manipulate the Church into sharing responsibility for some of these
 reforms. Cardinal Glemp, however, is probably leery of that prospect,
 fearing that reform failures would be blamed on the Church.
 The Church does not want reform to stagnate nor does it want open
 confrontation between the regime and the population, and it probably
 hopes it can convince the regime to honor reform commitments.
 Through this mediation, the Church hopes it will increasingly be seen
 as an interpreter of events in Poland and arbiter of the regime's
 performance without losing its credibility with the people.

 will implement.
 The regime and the Church also may find themselves at odds if the
 regime is unable, or unwilling, to pursue reform as its part of the
 bargain or if the Church does not use its influence with the faithful to
 caution patience as the regime pursues reconciliation. Moreover, to
 avoid a rancorous split between moderates and radicals in the
 opposition and to retain reformist credentials, the Church may be
 forced to endorse a more ambitious reform agenda than the regime
 Seeking Western Support
 As the regime courts the Church, the latter may expect the West to
 accept it-and not the secular opposition-as the principal
 interpreter of political developments in Poland. It will probably
 increase efforts to secure Western aid for Church-supported projects.
 The Church may also take a more sanguine view of regime prospects
 and objectives than will the independent opposition. It may also be
 less sympathetic to such secular opposition political goals as strongly
