 U,S, -SOVIET  R E L A T IONS
 OBSERVERS DEFEND SUNWIIT, SEE RELATIONS AT CRITICAL STAGE
 A PRAVDA article has presented a strong argument for moving ahead
 with the normalization of U.S.-Soviet relations despite U.S.
 domestic uncertainties.  In making a case for the forthcoming
 Moscow summit, the 18 May article, by R. Vasilyev and V. Slavin,
 painted a more optimistic picture of recent U.S. developments
 than have other recent discussions.  At the same time articles
 by USA Institute director Georgiy Arbatov and others in the most
 recent issues of USA and INTERNATIONTAL AFFAIRS have warned that
 U.S.-Soviet relations are at a decisive stage and that movement
 forward is the only alternative to increased tensions.
 Vasilyev and Slavin depicted a growing bipartisan support among
 diverse segments of the American public for detente with the
 Soviet Union.  The existence of a "broad political base," in
 their opinion, overshadows "all the complexity and contradictions
 of the domestic political situation existing in the country  and
 enables the American leading circles to follow the course set as
 a result of the Soviet-American summit meetings in Moscow and
 Washington."  .3rezhnev had alluded to the "complex and contradictory"
 nature of contemporary world affairs in his last major speech, in
 Alma Ata on 15 March.
 Though the PRAVDA article did not mention Watergate specifically,
 it is clear that it was the major domestic "complexity" at issue.
 Since reporting the President's 29 April speech announcing that
 he w.s turning over transcripts to the House Judiciary Committee,
 Moscow has not reported ensuing developments, adhering to its
 normal policy of reporting major Presidential moves while ignoring
 other developments in the case.  A hint of possible impending
 developments, however, was contained in a TASS report, carried in
 the central press on. 3.7 May, of an interview in the Washington
 ,':)TAP.-NEWS in which the President was quoted as saying that "if
 the house of Representatives decides to bring charges against me
 and discuss-ion begins in the SEuate, I am prepared to pursue the
 process to the end . "
 The PRAVDA authors' cautiously optimistic outlook on the prospects
 for further m.ovet-gent on the  ride issue is noteworthy.  Where in
 other recent coaater.tary the Congress, as the major stumbling block
 to most-favored-nation status and credits for Moscow, has come in

 for some pointed criticism,Vasilyev and Slavin stressed the
 support of American business for expanded trade and concluded
 that "on the whole understanding is growing on Capitol Hill
 that the course taken by those legislators who are enemies of
 detente is in conflict with the national interests of the
 American people."
 In expressing support for a third Brezhnev-Nixon meeting-the
 PRAVDA article rejected arguments that the U.S. internal political
 situation dictates against it.  Though the article did not
 characterize the prospects for such a meeting or discuss a
 specific agenda, the authors twice quoted American senators on the
 need for further arms limitation measures.
 An article by M.O. Kolosov in the May issue of USA, signed to press
 16 April, was devotee,. more specifically to the forthcoming summit.
 Perhaps reflecting the views of those Americanologists at the
 institute with a personal stake in improved U.S.-Soviet relations,
 Kolosov emphasized the need for specific measures and "substantial
 practical results" at the summit.  His discussion of SALT
 reflected Moscow's recently more cautious public posture on timing,
 however.  Where earlier in the year there were frequent references
 to the goal of reaching a permanent agreement in 1974, Kolosov
 said only that the "extremely complex" nature of the subject left
 "no room for premature decisions."
 CRITICAL STAGE     Kolosov's concern about the erratic progress of
 U.S.-Soviet relations was expressed even more
 dramatically by Arbatov in the same issue of USA.  Arbatov argued,
 as he had in the wake of the Middle East crisis last October, that
 if the two countries miss the opportunities that now exist for
 further improving relations, "it may be too late tomorrow."  Citing
 the analogy cf a traveler with one leg raised to cross an obstacle,
 Arbatov noted that "he cannot remain in this position indo;f initely:
 he must either cross the obstacle or turn back."  Arbatov applied
 this analogy specifically to SALT.  "If other steps do not follow
 in the near future," he affirmed, "the arms race will continue and
 even grow" with the attendant "serious political repercussions."
 In the same vein the lead article in the May issue of INTERNATIONAL
 AFFAIRS by V. Nikitin, signed to the press on 19 April, warned that
 Soviet-U.S. relations were now at an "exceptionally important stage"
 and that "under these conditions it is particularly important that
 U.S. leaders consistently adhere to the general policy line sealed
 in the Soviet-U.S. agreements."  Nikitin took issue in this respect

 with U.S. policy on SALT and with last October's military alert,
 which was "objectively aimed at exacerbating the overall
 situation in the world and creating tension in Soviet-U,S.
 relations."
 SUPREME SOVIET DELEGATION     Vasilyev and Slavi.n in their PRAVDA
 article cited the visit by the USSR
 Supreme Soviet delegation which began on 20 May as an example of
 the "profound constructive changes which are taking place in tha
 mental attitude of Americans." Moscow has given prominent
 coverage to that visit, highlighting remarks by delegation head
 and CPSU Central Committee secretary Boris Ponomarev.  TASS
 reported that IZVESTIYA of the 22d had devoted "almost an entire
 page" to reports on the visit,  Moscow's reporting has not focused
 on substantive issues, though TASS quoted Ponomarev as telling both
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Congress as a whole
 that he did not consider this a "protocol" visit but planned to
 discuss specific bilateral and international issues.  He has been
 frequently quoted as stressing the progress that has already been
 made in improving U.S.-Soviet relations but also as urging further
 progress at SALT.  According to TASS on 21 May, he told a group
 of senators that such progress was necessary since "given the
 present nature of armaments and the balance of armed forces, attempts
 at settling disputes by military means are fraught with the gravest
 consequences."

 MOSCOW SEES CONTINUITY IN BONN, GDR EXTENDS OLIVE BRANCH
 Moscow has shown evident relief over the evolution of events in
 Bonn since the sudden 6 May resignation of Willy Brandt.  Follow-
 ing some breath holding in the immediate aftermath of the crisis,
 prominent Moscow commentators both in the central press and on
 Moscow radio have begun to discuss at length the statements of
 the new government leaders and the implications of the change in
 government for future FRG-USSR relations.  The thrust of this
 comment has been that the continuity of the SPD-FDP coalition,
 as well as the declarations of Schmidt and other leaders, indicates
 that the new Bonn government intends to continue the Brandt-Scheel
 policy toward the East.  The GDR, in the meantime, with perhaps
 some arm twitting from Moscow, has responded positively to suggest-
 ions from the floor of the Bundestag that the process of improving
 FRG-GDR relations should be carried forward.
 CONTINUATION OF           The most thorough evaluation of the events
 OSTPOLITIK                since 6 May and their effect on Soviet-FRG
 relations was provided by IZVESTIYA's first
 deputy chief editor and German expert Nikolay Polyanov in Moscow
 radio's international observers discussion program on the 19th.
 Repeatedly citing the 17 May government statement by Schmidt,
 Polyanov asserted that "we now know that the policy of this
 cabinet will be the same as the policy of the preceding cabinet."
 Claiming that an "analysis" of Sc'nmidt's policy statement "merely
 confirms" what observers;: had said since Brandt resigned, Polyanov
 concluded that the new Bonn government "will as much as possible
 embody continuity. . . ."  Similarly, in the first commentary in
 the central press by a Moscow-based commentator, IZVESTIYA's A.
 Grigoryants on the 16th cited statem;a.ts by Born leaders reassuring
 Moscow that the new leadership would not alter the "basic directions"
 of West German foreign policy.
 Moscow, in the meantime, has apparently been able to persuade the
 East Germans to come forward with a conciliatory move toward Bonn.
 The occasion was provided by the "short, friendly visit" by GDR
 Council of Ministers Chairman Sindermann on 12-1  May.  The reports
 on the visit, and on separate meetings with Kosygin and Brezhnev
 on the 13th, revealed that the talks ostensibly were focused
 on joint economic coordination; but the report on the Brezhnev
 meeting also noted that the leaders discussed "certain inter-
 national questions" and "the strengthening of detente both in

 Europe and throughout the world."  Both meetings were said to
 have been held in an atmosphere of "complete unity of views."
 '.lthough no mention was made of German affairs, Brerhnev and
 ether Soviet leaders almost certainly used the occasion to re-
 view the Brandt resignation and its repercussions.  And with
 East Berlin on the 21st offering to hold discussions with the
 new Bonu leaders on Issues including Berlin, it can be assiuned
 that Moscow was successful in persuading East Berlin to make a
 gesture of reasonableness toward Bonn.
 GDR RESPONSE '0     ADN reported on the 21st that an East Berlin
 BONN LEADERS        foreign ministry spokesman, speaking for SED
 leader Honecker, stated. that the GDR was
 "prepared to examine" proposals affecting FRG-GDR relations made
 by SPD deputy cha{.rman and parliamentary floor leader Wenner on
 the 20th in the Bundestag debate on the new government's policy
 statement.  The spokesman noted that "the GDR party and state
 leadership" shared Schmidt's view that "despite difficulties"--an
 obvious allusion to the Chancellor's reference to the "espionage
 case"--relations  between the FRG and CUR "can. be actively and
 further developed,"  The spokesman asserted that the GDR was
 "prepared to react positively" to the proposals of the Bonn leaders.
 Specifically, the spokesman said that the GDR was ready to examine
 proposals made by Wehner related to economic cooperation, the
 issue of conversion of money by West German visitors to the GDR,
 and the coordinating of energy supplies to include West Berlin.
 The GDR spokesman ignored the double-edged statement by Wenner
 which seemed to include a suggestion that if East Berlin does not
 now move forward on issues of importance to Bonn in the FRG-GDR
 relationship, this could affect the development of economic
 relations between the two countries.  Also, Wehner declared that
 all the treaties and agreements between Bonn and all the Warsaw
 Pact countries made up a whole, all parts of which must be followed
 both in spirit and letter.  The implication seemed to be that
 Soviet-FRG as well as GDR-FRG economic relations would be affected.
 TASS carried textually the ADN report on the foreign ministry
 spokesman's statement.  And GDR media on the 22d were quick to cite
 the very favorable reaction by Bonn leaders to the GDR spokesman's
 statement.

 MOSCOW SATISFIED WITH GISCARD. EASTERN EUROPE MORE SKEPTICAL
 Moscow is accenting the positive in its initial comment on the
 victory of center-rightist candidate Giscard d'Estaing over the
 leftist coalition candidate Mitterrand in the 19 May run-off election
 elections for the French presidency.  Focusing primarily on the
 foreign policy implications of the election, Moscow has indicated
 that it foresees a continuation of French policy and good re-
 lations with France along the general lines developed under de
 Gaulle and Pompidou.  East European media, on the other hand, have
 stressed the narrow margin by which Mitterand was defeated (50.8%
 to 49.2%), and have predicted a continuing important role for the
 leftist forces on the French domestic political scene.
 DETENTE AND COOPERATION     Moscow radio's French service, in a
 commentary on 20 May by V. Grigoryev,
 praised Giscard as an "energetic promoter" of Pompidou'a "independent"
 foreign policy, which Grigoryev said included a policy of "detente,
 harmony, and cooperation" toward the USSR.  Grigoryev mentioned
 twice in the same broadcast that Giscard has been chairman on the
 French side of the Soviet-French Grand Commission and that in this
 capacity he had visited the USSR and developed good relations with
 Soviet leaders.  Citing Paris newspapers to the effect that Giscard
 "'ias always recognized the irreversible nature" of pie Gaulle's
 policy toward t::_- USSR, Grigoryev quoted Gi.scard as saying that
 future French policy wiil be sirilarly directed toward "detente
 and cooperation" with the USSR, as well as accompanied by expanded
 scientific, economic, and cultural relations.
 LEFTIST STRENGTH      Moscow's restraint toward Mitterrand's electoral
 achievement and its pragmatic, positive approach
 toward Giscard's victory--at least as reflected in limited, initial
 comment--stands in sharp contrast to the highly partisan attitude
 that most East European countries have shown toward the French left
 alliance.  Virtually all East European comment has emphasized at
 length that the election results testify to.the "enormous" and
 "unprecedented" strength of leftist political forces in France
 and presage increasing influence for the left alliance.  Typical
 was a commentary on 21 May by T. Varkonyi, Paris correspondent for
 the Hungarian daily MAGYAR NFM.ZET, which said that the left had
 never come so close to governing France and that it would win
 victory in the 1978 elections.

 22 MAY 1974
 ELECTION POST-MORTEM     Moscow and its East European allies have
 as yet made little attempt to delve publicly
 into the specific factors that led to Mitterrand's narrow defeat.
 Their analysis, for the most part, has been confined to suggesting
 that the vote was split along class lines, with an "arithmetic
 majority" going to Giscard while the majority of workers, youth,
 and intelligentsia supported Mitterrand.  The most specific commentary
 to date from Soviet and East European sources which has sought to
 analyze Giscard's victory in terms of specific strengths and weak-
 nesses of the candidates and their campaigns was provided by V.
 Kostov, Paris correspondent for Sofia radio, in a 20 May commentary
 over Sofia's domestic service.  Citing the last four days of the
 campaign as "decisive"--probably because French polling results
 published on 15 May showed both candidates receiving equal percent-
 ages--Kostov referred to four major strengths exhibited by Giscard,
 coupled with two main weaknesses in Mitterrand's campaign.  First,
 not only did all "bourgeois" parties support Giscard, but the
 "extreme leftwing forces" assisted him as well since "in appealing
 to their supporters to vote for Mitterrand, they stated at the same
 time that they did not entirely trust him."  Second, whereas Gis-
 card conducted a "lively" campaign, Mitterrand "for a long time
 stood on rather vague political positions trying to win votes
 from petit bourgeois circles."  Third, Giscard had "solid" fi-
 nancial support, although Kostov refrained from repeating Mitterrand's
 lament in his concession stateml:nt that "the forces of money" had
 barely defeated "the people's movement."  Finally, "anticommunism"
 was said to play a considerable role in drawing votes to Giscard.
 Kostov's last point, although not further explained, is at variance
 with most other Soviet and East European comment, which has stressed
 to the contrary that one conclusion to be drawn from the election
 is that use of the "Red threat" and anticommunist themes are no
 longer effective in France.  Although the basis for the latter and
 more prevalent assessment has been stated as the size of Mitterrand's
 vote, the difference in analysis may reflect uncertainty concerning
 the future of the leftist coalition, an uneasy alliance since its
 formation in 1972 and one whose fate is now in question after its
 failures in the 1973 parliamentary elections and on 19 May.

 USSR BLAMES ISRAELI "PERFIDY" FOR DEATHS IN MA'ALOT INCIDENT
 In its reportage and comment on the 15 May Palestinian fedayeen
 operation in the Israeli town of Ma'alot, Moscow has contrived
 both to blame the Israelis for the tragic outcome of the affair
 and to reaffirm its standing condemnation of international terror-
 ism in general.  Delaying its first report until the 16th, when
 th_z Israelis launched retaliatory raids on Palestinian targets
 in Lebanon, Moscow was able to offsp:: its reports of the Ma'alot
 incident with complementary report., of the Israeli attacks.
 Portraying worldwide indignation at Israeli "savagery," Moscow
 rejected the "pretext" that the attacks in Lebanon were in
 reprisal for the Ma'alot incident.'  While Moscow held "Israeli
 perfidy" responsible for the loss of lives at Ma'alot, some comment
 also expressed disapproval of terrorism in general and specifically,
 in one instance, of the Palestinian seizure of children as hostages.
 MA'ALOT INCIDENT     The 16 May TASS account of the "tragic events"
 in Ma'alot, and a report by corresporL.dent
 Orekhov in PRAVDA on the 17th, provided some details:  Orekhov
 said the fedayeen demanded the release of 23 guerrillas in Israeli
 prisons in return for the release of 9C schoolchildren held
 hostage.  He said the Israeli Government "allegedly" agreed to
 the demands but that half an 'hour before the Palestinian ultimatum
 expired, army detachments--" led" by Dayan--attacked the school,
 resulting in the death of the three Palestinians and the killing
 or wounding of many of the students.
 The TASS and PRAVDA accounts set the theme for subsequent comment
 in charging that the "perfidious actions" of the Israeli military
 caused the tragedy, and that the inhabitants of Ma'alot themselves
 denounced the "treachery" of Tel Aviv and called Dayan a murderer.
 TASS commentator Kulik took up the condemnation of Dayau on the
 20th, comparing him with Eichma*in and accusing him of killing
 Israelis and then blaming others to provide an Israeli pretext for
 prolonging occupation of Arab lands.
 *  From 1967 through 1970 Moscow from time to time issued TASS
 statements condemning Israeli "armed provocations" against neighbor-
 ing Arab states.  The last retaliatory action to draw a formal Soviet
 response--the Israeli incursion into Lebanon following the incident
 at the Munich Olympics in September 1972--was denounced in a Soviet
 Government statement.

 INTERNATIONAL     While the Palestinian operation at Ma'alot could
 TERRORISM         be construed as falling within the category of
 terrorist acts which Moscow has approved--internal
 as opposed to international acts, such as airplane hijackings--Moscow
 has not chosen to stress the distinction.  Yermakov's international
 review in PRAVDA on the 19th placed equal blame on both Israelis
 and Palestinians, declaring that "perfidious attacks" of Israeli
 shock detachments on a school and "the seizure of children as
 hostages by the Palestinians" had brought condemnation by inter-
 national public opinion.  And Kolesnichenko's weekly review of
 events broadcast to North American listeners on the 20th also
 denounced terrorism in such a way as to apply to both parties.
 Referring to Israel's "revenge against Palestinian guerrillas,"
 it went on to assert that the Soviet Union condemns terrorism,
 believing it can solve no political problems.
 Moscow abstained from any criticism of the 11 April fedayeen
 operation in Qiryat Shemona, but seemed to convey its disapproval
 by indirection.  Two days after that incident, a Moscow broadcast
 in Arabic carried an article by a Jordanian communist deploring
 "harmful and adventurous trends" in the policy of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization and remarking approvingly that the PLO
 planned to give up adventurous actions which greatly harmed its
 reputation and upset world public opinion.  Comment at the time
 stressed a statement made earlier by PLO chairman 'Arafat to the
 effect that the feda:,teen had suspended operations from territories
 of Arab countries adjacent to Israel and were conducting their
 activities "deep in Israel."  Although Moscow has said nothing
 about this claim in the present instance, Lebanese and Palestinian
 spokesmen again indicated that the Ma'alot fedayeen did not come
 from Lebanon but were "sons of the occupied territory."
 Soviet media failed to report the.involvement of France and Romania
 in the Ma'alot affair as intermediaries at the request of the
 fedayeen.  In reporting foreign reaction, TASS noted that the
 French foreign ministry declared that the Ma'alot incident could
 not justify attacks on Lebanon.  But Moscow ignored AGERPRES'
 18 May explanation of Romanian invol-rement and the agency's
 authorized statement expressing the disapproval of "the Romanian
 people" regarding both individual terrorist actions and Israeli
 reprisals.

 USSR USES JALL.UD VISIT TO BOLSTER IMAGE AS ARAB SUPPORTER
 Against the background of its deteriorating relations with Cairo
 and its efforts to assert a role in the diplomatic action in the
 Middle East., Moscow has played up the importance of Libyan Prime
 Minister Jallud's 14-20 May official visit to the Soviet Union.
 Ntthough not announcer by Moscow until 10 May, the visit had been
 rumored for some time, and Libyan Chairman al-Qadhdhaf_i had. c'.is-
 closed the data, as well is raising the possibility of a So,;,iet-
 Libyan "summit," in an interview with the Beirut AS-SAFIR on
 28 April.  The Jallud visit follows .'y three months his February
 tour of several European countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia
 and Hungary, and has been presented by Libyan media as a continuation
 of that earlier round.  Moscow Arabic-language comment on the visit
 included sharp digs at Egyptian policies, and Cairo newspapers
 responded in kind with sarcastic references to a marriage of con-
 venience and to "political adolescents" trying to exploit Soviet-
 Egyptian differences.
 PROGRAM OF VISIT     The length of Jallud's stay in the USSR was
 not announced in advance, although the Libyan
 news agency said on his departure for Moscow that the visit would
 last several days.  According to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY on the
 20th, he extended his visit a few more days, having been scheduled
 to leave Moscow for Leningrad on the 17th.  The only reported
 speec:_as during the visit were made by Kosygin and Jallud at the
 welcoming dinner on the 14th; no remarks were reported at the
 luncheon which Jallud gave on the 16th.  Moscow extended Jallud
 the same courtesy it had extended Syrian President al-Asad, a
 television interview, broadcast on the 21st, according to TASS.
 On his previous visit to the USSR on 23 February to 4 March 1972,
 Jallud had gotten the more normal treatment for Arab visitors,
 a radio interview broadcast on the Arabic-language service.*
 Jallud held a succession of "friendly" official discussions with
 Kosygin, as well as separate meetings with Brezhnev and Podgornyy
 on the 16th.  Tripoli--but not Moscow--media indicated that Jallud
 had another meeting with Brezhnev on the 17th and also met with
 Defense Minister Grechko for two hours on the 19th.  According to
 Libyan repor..s the talks were lengthy--with Brezhnev, five and a
 half hours, with Podgornyy over two hours, and with Kosygin the
 final day over four hours.  His talks on his 1972 visit were also
 lengthy, according to Libyan reports.
 *  The 1972 visit is discussed in the FBIS TRENDS of. 24 February
 1972, pages 37-38, and 8 March 1972, pages 29-32.

 Jallud last met with a Soviet Leader when he was received by
 Podgornyy in Paris at the time of the de Gaulle runeral.
 According to PRAVDA on 8 April, they "exchanged views on certain
 questions of mutual interest."  Presumably, Moscow was interested
 in sorting ouc the implications of al-Qadhdhafi's just-announced
 withdrawal from political and administrative functions to devote
 his time to "organizational and ideological" activities.
 There was no mention of al-Qadhdhafi in Moscow's coverage of the
 Jallud visit.  Kosygin in his dinner speech did acknowledge that
 Soviet-Libyan differences were "evidently chiefly in the field
 of ideology."  Moscow media in. the past have taken al-Qadhdhafi
 to task for his attacks on communism and his claims of a "true
 socialism" based on Islam.  The communique papered over these
 differences.  Thus it said that Jallud explained to his hosts
 the economic, social, cultural and other changes in Libya, white
 similar passages in the communiques on his East European -,isits
 noted that he also described "ideological" changes and Libyan
 efforts to preserve the country's "spiritual sanctities."
 TRADE AND AID     The communique characterized Jallud's official
 talks with Kosygin as taking place in a friendly
 atmosphere "in a spirit of frankness and mutual understanding,"
 the same description applied to his 1972 talks.  A Tripoli radio
 commentary on 14 May described Jallud's visit as a continuation
 of the East Enropean visits.  The announced agreements followed
 much the same pattern.  In Moscow, a trade agreement was signed
 and agreement was reached on establishing an intergovernmental
 commission on economic and scientific-technical cooperation.
 Similarly, Jallud had concluded trade and scientific-technical
 cooperation agreements in all three East European capitals and
 additionally an agreement on an economic commission in Budapest.
 Soviet coverage of the visit contained hints but no firm con-?
 firmation that the discussions also included military cooperation,
 which would seem to have been indicated by Jallud's meeting with
 Grechko.  Jallud was reported in a Moscow Arabic-language broad-
 cast on the 14th as telling a TASS interviewer that there were
 wide prospects for development of Soviet-Libyan relations in
 political, economic, military and other fields.  And a commentary
 broadcast in Arabic on the 13th remarked that the USSR and Libya
 were developing ecc!"omic and technical cooperation and "cooperation
 in the field of defense."

 Jallud again invited Brezhaav, Podgornyy and Kosygin to visit
 Libya; in the 1.972 communique, the invitation was extended on
 behalf of the Revolution Command Council, but this time by
 Jallud himself.  Similar invitations were extended to the East
 European leaders by Jaliud in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but
 on behalf of al-Qadhdhafi in Poland.
 ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUE     Not surprisingly, in view of Libya's
 antipathy to any negotiated solution of
 the Arab-Israeli dispute, there was no mention in the communique
 of the problem of disengagement.  Kosygin, however, broached the
 subject in his dinner speech with an attack on "half measures."
 The communique condemned Israel, Zionism, and "imperialist forces
 supporting them" along the lines of the 1972 communique, which
 had also denounced U.S. support for Israel.  The current document
 routinel;* insisted, reflecting the consistent Soviet line, that a
 "radical and all-embracing settlement" in the area is impossible
 without Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories and
 insurance of the Palestinians' legitimate rights.
 The communique pledged to continue "every assistance" to the
 Palestinian resistance movement.  While this pledge is not a
 customary feature of Soviet-Arab communiques, TASS' report on
 the November 1973 visit of a Palestinian delegation to the USSR
 noted Soviet determination to continue assistance and support
 to the Palestinians' struggle for their legitimate national
 rights.  During his East European tour Jallud obtained an express-
 ion of support for Palestinian self-determination from Poland,
 while Czechoslovakia and Hungary additionally supported the
 Palestinians' right to "return to their homeland."
 Undertones of criticism of Cairo's domestic "liberalization"
 and emerging friendship with the United States appeared in a
 routine passage  i Arab unity which, in contrast to the 1.972
 communique, this time called for unity of action on the basis
 of "social progress and democracy."  And also unlike the 1972
 communique, it called for struggle not only against the usual
 targets of imperialism and Zionism but against "reaction" as
 well.  The USSR expressed determination to continue "every
 support" for Arab piLioples "fighting for stronger national
 independence and for economic and r3ocial progress" and the
 communique stressed the importance of strengthening Arab-Soviet
 friendship "in all f ielde&" as an important factor in the anti-
 imperialist struggle.

 Comment on the visit broadcast in Moscow's Arabic-language service
 and Radio Peace and Progress in. Arabic also seemed aimed at dis-
 approved tendencies in Cairo.  A Radio Peace and Progress broad-
 cast on the 15th, for example, accused Arab reaction of collaborating
 with imperialism and Zionism by substituting partial measures for
 a comprehensive Middle East settlement.  It claimed that these
 rea,,tionary groups, whether they "are now in office or not," were
 try.Lng to convince the Arab masses that American imperialism had
 suddenly changed from an Arab enemy to a friend.  A.zother Radio
 Peace and Progress broadcast on the 1.8th complained that imperialism
 and Arab reaction were trying to upset Arab cooperation with the
 socialist countries 1v' "introducing polemics and controversies
 which favor national interests."  And a Moscow commentary in Arabic
 on the 13th seemingly cautioned Cairo on deviating from its "progress-
 ive" economic and social measures when it declared that the Soviet
 Union assisted the Arabs in consolidating their economic independence
 on the basis of establishing supervision over the activity of foreign
 capital and introducing social changes."

 SINO - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW PRESENTS CASE ON BILATERAL RELATIONS, BORDER TALKS
 IZVESTIYA on 16 May published a comprehensive analysis of the state
 of Sino-Soviet relations which reiterates the Soviet view that the
 next move to improve relations must come from Peking but also argues
 that in the interim the best policy is one of restraint, seeking an
 improvement in relations as the best means of encouraging healthy
 forces in Peking.  The article was widely broadcast by Moscow
 radio over a four-day period.  Authored by Oleg Borisov,* the
 article also broke with Moscow's usual reticence on the border
 talkr3 in Peking to offer the lengthiest defense of Moscow's
 position there since chief Soviet negotiator Leonid Ilichev last
 returned from Peking in July 1973.
 Borisov accused Peking of "blocking" the talks by its "ultimatum--
 style demands" and its refusal to deal with narrower issues and
 specific sectors of the 4150-mile common border.  He laid the blame
 for the "impasse" at the border talks and across the board in
 bilateral relations at the door of Peking.  In evoking an image of
 Soviet reasonableness on bilateral issues and arguing that the next
 move is up to Peking, Borisov reiterated a Soviet posture
 spelled out late last year in official policy statements in the
 wake of the July 1973 Crimea summit of bloc leaders and the 10th
 Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in August. The reason for
 the appearance of the Borisov article at this time is unclear.
 It makes only a cryptic reference to the March incident involving
 the Chinese capture and detention of a Soviet helicopter and crew,
 as well as to the expulsion of Soviet diplomats in January, and
 thus seems related to longer-term difficulties in bilateral relations.
 Borisov reiterated the line taken by both Brezhnev and Kosygin last
 fall in claiming that Moscow had acted responsibly, doing all it
 could to move relations off dead center, and that the next move was
 up to Peking.  As part of the public rationale at that time for the
 *  Borisov has written since at least the late 1960's on Sino-Soviet
 relations and international communist relations.  Though his articles
 have as a rule not appeared to be particularly significant, they
 ir,Mclude a contribution to KOMMUNIST in the wake of the first 1969
 border clash and one to PRAVDA on the second day of President Nixon's
 visit to the PRC in February 1972.  See the TRENDS of 24 February
 1972, page 13, for an analysis of the PRAVDA article.

 Soviet position, Moscow began discussing more openly the various
 proposals it had made to Peking in and outside: the border talks.
 Borisov revealed that in J;:Pii,c last year Moscow had again proposed
 a Sino-Soviet summit as well as the non-aggression pact disclosed
 by :rezhnev last September in Tashkent.
 Criticizing Peking for setting forth ultimatums and "absurd,
 unacceptable conditions" at the border talks, Borisov made a rare
 reference to the Soviet approach at the negotiations, noting that
 10the Maoists are in no way interested in solving questions connected
 with defining more precisely individual sectors of the Soviet-
 Chinese border?"  He also accused Peking of "flouting" an agreement
 that the substance of the talks should remain confidential.
 THE ANTI-CONFUCRUS CAMPAIGN     Touching briefly upon the internal
 situation in China, Borisov asserted
 that "many people in the Peking leadership do not believe the
 farfetched fabrication of the 'Soviet threat"' and disagree with
 the prevailing "anti-Soviet course," and he noted that former
 Politburo member and Defense Minister Lin Piao had "probably" been
 among them.  That assessment appeared to assign to the anti-Confucius
 campaign in China more immediate relevance for Sino-Soviet relations
 than have other commentaries which have emphasized leadership
 factionalism but have typically played down its significance for
 policy toward the Soviet Union.  Recent Soviet analysis, ,
 example, has not sought to dit?erentiate among the current Chinese
 leadership.   And comwactaries in connection with Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping's recent trip to New York for the U1IGA special
 session suggested that Moscow expected no change as a result of his
 political ascendance, labeling him a "veteran" anti-Soviet figure.
 Moderate Soviet spokesmen such as Aleksandr Bovin, in a Sunday
 supplement to IZVESTIYA in April, have from time to time expressed
 optimism that eventually a change in leaders in Peking would bring
 a change in policy as well.  But this has ncvwally been seen only
 as a long-term development.  The more typical Soviet assessment of
 the short-term effects of PRC infighting was presented in the 19 May
 international affairs roundtable on Moscow domestic radio.  In an
 unusual move, the roundtable invited Vladimir Krivtsov, deputy
 director of the USSR Academy of Sciences' Far East Institute, to
 answer listener's letters on the internal situation in China.
 Krivtsov discounted the impact of the Confucius campaign on basic
 policy, claiming that whatever the "vacillations" in China's foreign
 policy course resulting from the internal political struggle, "it
 will remain a great power chauvinist course."

 Borisov's depiction of a leadership seriously divided over
 policy toward the Soviet Union could be seen as a counsel of
 restraint on  is part.  That attitude seemed visible elsewhere
 as well, in his acknowledgment of the "socialist gains" in China,
 and his closing assertion that "any improvement in Soviet-Chinese
 relations undermines the positions within the country of Mao
 Tse-tung and his group."

 `PEACEFUL INTENTIONS" NOTED BY MOSCOW, IGNORED BY PEKING
 Moscow promptly reported on 18 May the Indian Atomic Energy
 Commission's announcement of Tndia's first successful explosion
 of a nuclear device.  The TASS report noted India's efforts to
 advance the technology of peaceful explosions and cited the
 Commission's assertion that India has no intention of producing
 nuclear weapons.  A second report on the 19th cited the Indian
 defense minister's statement that India would never use its
 nuclear capability for military purposes.  Moscow has otherwise
 been silent on the test, failing thus far to comment or report
 other world reaction.  In urging wider adherence by near-nuclear
 states to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the past,
 Moscow has gone on public record to the effect that there is
 no distinction between nuclear weapons and devices intended
 for peaceful purposes and hence a state carrying out peaceful
 nuclear explosions must be viewed as possessing nuclear weapouc4.
 Moscow's allies in East Europe have also maL:tained a low
 profile on the Indian test, reporting factually and including
 India's protestations of no military intent.  Yugoslavia has
 predictably reported more extensively on the details of the
 test and world reaction, but available commentary has sh..an
 reticence in criticizing India, a fellow stalwart of the
 nonalined movement.
 Peking responded initially with. a straightforward 19 May NCNA
 report citing the Indian press regarding the size, location and
 underground nature of the nuclear explosion experiment.  It made
 no reference to India's intentions.  NCNA the following day
 reported Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto's press conference
 remarks on the 19th that Pakistan would not succumb to nuclear
 blackmail by India nor compromise positions for Kashmir-i self-
 determination and against Indian domination on the subcont:" ent.
 While noting the prime minister's call for greater. Pakistani
 unity at this time, NCNA ignored Bhutto's announcement that he
 is sending his foreign minister to China and other countries to
 discuss the implications of the Indian test.

 COMMUNIST ATTACKS TN SOUTH VIETNAM PORTRAYED AS It PUNISHMENT'
 A flurry of Vietnan.cae communist comment promptly hailed the
 16 May communist "destruction" of the ARVN base at Dak ?ek,
 Kontum Province, as justified "punishment" for Saigon's "war
 acts."  Other communist attacks in recent days have drawn less
 attention from communist media, but news reports on the
 15 May attacks in Binh Duong Province and on the 20 May
 explosion at the Nha Be fuel depot also portrayed these actions
 as retaliatory in nature.
 A 17 May Liberation Radio commentary attempted to justify the
 attack on Dak Pek by accusing Saigon of launching ground,
 artillery, and air attacks from the base against PRG territory.
 Charging that Sa.i;on wants to erase the "liberated area," the
 commentary prais?:d "fierce counterblows" in the central highlands
 this month, especially the Dak Pek attack, and added:  "This is
 a necessary and appropriate measure aimed at checking the Thieu
 clique's intensification of the war."  Such counterattacks were
 also endorsed by Hanoi in articles in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN
 DAN on 18 May.  NHAN DAN dwelt upon U.S. responsibility in the
 current situation, charging that GVN attacks are "directed and
 abetted" by Washington.
 Vietnamese communist comment does not recall the 15 October 1973
 PLAF command order which set forth the policy of counterattacks
 and which has been cited in connection with communist offensive
 actions in the past.*  However, a Liberation Radio commentary,
 broadcast on the 18th and 19th, recalled that a 4 July 1973 order
 from the regional Kontum PLAF command had advocated counterblows
 against GVN military operations and attacks on the bases from
 which they originated.
 Communist comment on the Dak Pek attack made no effort to obscure
 the fact that the base had long been controlled by the GVN.
 Thus, for example, the 17 May Liberation Radio commentary noted
 that "before and after the advent of the agreement, the Dak Pek
 base has served as a blocking position situated deep in the
 PRG-controlled area."

 In recent months, the communists have come closer to acknowledging
 that they have attempted to expand their areas of control since
 the peace agreement was signed in January 1973.  Notably, in this
 connection, the latest six-pcint PRG proposal for a political
 settlement, issued on 22 March, did not repeat the call in similar
 proposals in April and June 1973 for a return of forces to
 positions occupied when the agreement was signed.*  Subsequently,
 a 26 March Liberation Radio commentary on fighting in Kontum
 suggested that th::'ommunists actually controlled more territory
 in that province than they did in January 1973, and a 29 March
 NHAN DA.N editora.al and other comment from Hanoi have claimed that
 "most areas" le3t to the ARVN since the peace agreement had been
 retaken and that:  "In many areas the strength and position of the
 revolution are better than prior to 28 January 1973."
 NORTH VIETNAMESE EDITORIALS MARK HO CHI MINHIS BIRTHDAY
 North Vietnam marked Ho Chi Minh's 19 May birthday, as it did last
 year, with editorials in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  While
 NHAN DAN recalled that Ho's testament had urged that the party and
 government draft effective economic and cultural plans and care for
 the people's livelihood, the army paper stressed the need to
 struggle for "final victory."
 The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial on Ho's birthday could be read as an
 argument for a new efforts to achieve advances in the South through
 military means.  It maintained that the Vietnamese revclution "is a
 process of struggle to achieve one success after another" and that
 after a victory it is necessary to "consolidate our battleground"
 and strengthen forces to advance to "even greater victories."  Noting
 that "as soon as one stage of the revolution ends, a new stage will
 start," the army paper added:  "The current situation as regards the
 revolution in our country, as well as in the world, has given us new
 advantages to continue to develop our offensive strategy and advance
 to score new victories."  T';ze editorial in another passage called
 for preventing and overcoming negativeness, a lackadaisical attitude,
 and "pacificism"-?-a rarely mentioned error.  Balancing its stress
 on the need to pursue victory, the editorial also noted, after citing
 the role of "collective interests," that "only by devoting all their
 strength and ability to building socialism can our cadres and party
 members progress toward a bright future."
 The six-point PRG proposal is discussed in the TRENDS Of 27 March

 HANOI ATTACKS 'i1-IAI POLICIES, SETS TERMS FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS
 Abandoning the attitude of restraint which marked its propaganda
 on Thailand followin?? the installation of the civilian government
 in Bangkok last October, Hanoi. in recent weeks has directed
 increased criticism against Bangkok policies related to sensitive
 issues in DRV-Thai relations.  In particular, a 12 May NHAN DAN
 article, attributed to "Observer," charged that Bangkok's actions
 do not match its professions of goodwill toward the DRV and took
 the unusual step of listing Hanoi's conditions for improved
 relations.  The Observer article was followed on the 18th by
 two DRV Foreign Ministry spokesmen's statements--one criticizing
 as deceptive the recent announcement of zdditional U.S. military
 withdrawals from Thailand and the other charging Bangkok with
 terrorizing Vietnamese residents in Thailand.
 The 12 May Observer article castigated the Thai Government for
 asserting that its policy of goodwill toward Hanoi has not been
 reciprocated and listed a long bill of historical Vietnamese
 grievances against Thailand.  The article acknowledged that the
 Sanya regime* had issued positive statements regarding policy
 toward Hanoi and the rest of Southeast Asia, but said that it had
 failed to follow through with its announced intentions.  Observer
 focused particularly on continued U.S. military presence in
 Thailand, Thai officials' allegations regarding North Vietnamese
 intentions against Thai national security, and Bangkok's policies
 toward Vietnamese nationals living in Thailand.
 In specifying conditions for establishing "friendly relations"
 with Thailand, the article notably avoided a direct call for the
 total withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.  It more
 generally asserted that Bangi' k must "stop its collusion" with
 Washington agairi3t the Vietnamese, cease its alleged slanders
 against Hanoi's intentions toward Thailand, and release Vietnamese
 residents in Thailand who have been "illegally detained."
 However, a demand for U.S. withdrawal from Thailand was voiced
 in the 18 May DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on the
 question which maintained that the United States must "immediately
 and completely withdraw" its military forces and installatior,
 and that the Thai Government "must not put the Thai territory at
 the United States' disposal."
 *  The abrupt resignation of the Sanya cabinet on 21 May was noted
 on the same day in a Hanoi radio broadcast which cited Western press
 comment that there had been growing pressure in Thailand for a
 cabinet reshuffle and the removal of several ministers.

 22 MAY 1974
 BACKGROUND     Hanoi's recent outburst caps the second major
 cycle in DRV propaganda treatment of Thpiland
 ever the past year and a half.  In the immediate wake of the
 January 1973 Paris agreeme>t, Hanoi had reduced its previously
 harsh invective against thi conduct of the Thanom-Praphat
 regime and for three months avoided sharp criticism of Bangkok's
 association with U.S. military efforts in Indochina.*  Thailand's
 persisting association with Washington, especially in connection
 c.Tith U.S. bombing raids in Cambodia last spring and summer,
 prompted a revival of harsh anti-Thanom denunciations by late
 spring 1973.
 Following the overthrow of Thanom and installation of the Sanya
 regime in October 1973, Hanoi once again reverted to a low
 posture.  A 10 December QUAN DOI NHAN DAN commentary had labeled
 the new government as a case of "new wine in old bottles," but
 harsh invective was not revived until last month when a 16 April
 NHAN DAN commentary denounced the "vile, slanderous" remarks
 made earlier by Sanya regarding North Vietnamese military intentions
 toward Laos and Thailand.
 PEKING SHOWS MEASURED CONCERN OVER VIETNAM DEVELON.w..NTS
 At a time of increased Vietnamese fighting and the suspension of
 talks between Saigov..nd the PRG, Peking has departed from its
 low posture on Vietnamese affairs of recent months and endorsed
 PRG -nd DR.V foreign ministry protests--cf 15 and 17 May--in a
 21 May PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article.  Since last December
 Peking had sidestepped author~:`atide endorsement for its
 Vietnamese allies' statements at the. foreign ministry level or
 below.  The Chinese this year have only once responded
 authoritatively to Vietnamesa statements--a 26 March PEOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator article seconded PRG and DRV Government
 statements announcing the communists' revised six-point plan.
 The last authoritative Peking endorsement of Vietnamese protests
 at the foreign ministry level cane in an 8 December 1.973 PLOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator arL!.cle just prior to the Kissinger:-Le Duc Tho
 talks that month.
 The present article as usual focused the brunt of invective
 ,Against Saigon violations, but also castigated the United States
 for leaving behind disguised military personnel, replenishing

 military and economic aid to Saigon, and threatening the
 Vietnamese.  This represented harsher treatment than the
 26 March 1974 article, but was somewhat milder than the
 8 December 1973 article which had accused Washington of "brazen
 provocations" against the Vietnamese.  In contrast to the
 article last December, there was this time no direct Chine3e
 demand that Washington halt its violations and scrupulously
 implemer t the WYaris accord.  NCNA's r;:olay of the PRG and DRV
 statements predictably dropped references to the Nixon
 Administration and Nixon Doctrine and the accusation that
 Washington is the "mastermind" behind Saigon's "sabotage" of
 the Paris accord.

 PRC IGNORES U,SP ASIAN ROLE ON ANNIVERSARY OF MAO STATEMENT
 Peking's recent sanguine posture regarding the U.S. presence in
 Asia is strikingly apparent in comment marking the fourth
 anniversary of Mao Tse-tung's 20 May 1970 anti-U.S. united front
 statement, issued in response to the U.S. moves against 'Vietnamese
 communist sanctuaries in Cambodia.  Thus, a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 article on the anniversary made no direct mention of a U.S. role
 in Indochina or elsehwere in Asia.  Chinese speeches during the
 early April visit in Peking of a Cambodian Front delegation led
 by insurgent armed forces chief Khieu Samphan* recalled the
 1970 Mao statement to underline Chinese unity with the Cambodian
 and other revolutionary struggles; however, Peking was careful to
 avoid stressing the anti-U.S. features of the Mao statement.
 The total avoidance by the PEOPLE'S DAILY article of any mention
 of the U.S. role is the more notable since it appeared on the
 very day that Khieu Samphan returned to Peking from a lengthy tour
 abroad.
 While excerpts from the 20 May statement are freque,ltly quoted in
 PRC media, especially the remark that "revolution is the main
 trend in the world today," with the movement toward improved
 Sino-U.S. relations the anniversary has not recr.:.ved. high-level
 attention.  For the past three years the date has ':,aen i.ti:.int:'
 only by PEOPLE'S DAILY articles attributed to a woiker.  The
 current article reiterated the foreign policy thesis articulated
 in Chou En-lai's report to the CCP Congress last August that
 -.-irld disorder stemming from U.S.-Soviet rivalry and tir.ird world
 %.?position to the superpowers is the salient feature o  the
 present age and is advantageous to China and oppressed peoples
 throughout the world.  While acknc:wiedging that Washington and
 Moscow may reach agreement on some detente-related issues, it
 reaffirmed that their strategic rivalry is "absolute and
 irreconcilable," demonstrating that Peking continues to see ample
 opportunity for advantageous Chinese maneuvering in the triangular
 relationship.  The article also underscored Peking's continuing
 differentiated view of the superpowers, singling out Moscow's
 "inordinate ambition" for special criticism while offering a
 routine critique of the United States.  It reaffirmed Peking's
 stance that while China is vigilant against war caused by the
 superpowers, it is particularly on guard against any "surprise
 attack" launched by the USSR.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 HUSAI( REGIME SEEKS ACCQ4VO ATION WITH POLITICAL OUTCASTS
 The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPCZ) appears to be seeking
 an accommodation with scientists and technically trained personnel
 alienated by the 1968 events as well as those expelled from the
 party.  Although the terms of the accommodation remain unclear,
 a conciliatory offer was issued at the 14-15 May Central Committee
 plenum which considered problems of scientific-technological
 development in the economy.  The offer appearing in the official
 resolution of the plenum represented a setback for hardline
 elements favoring removal of "revisionists" from scientific and
 other intellectual work.
 The CPCZ plenum resolution, published in the 17 May RUDE PR.AVO,
 stressed the. "irreplaceable role" of the scientific intelligentsia
 in society and declared that the party "highly appreciates" its
 past contributions.  The resolution thus implicitly acknowledged
 that the economy cannot function without highly skilled personnel.
 As an inducement for improved social collaboration the resolution
 went on to state that in the future, practical accomplishments
 rather than past political views will be the test by which
 intellectuals are to be judged:  "Thin also goes," the resolution
 stated, "for those with wham the party parted company in the past
 but who now realize their m:stakes and through their positive
 efforts demonstrate their attitude to our Abcxi`t~-` gd hel  to
 develop it."
 The conciliatory approach embodied in the plenum resolution was
 also evident in the CPCZ Presidium report delivered by Presidium
 member Josef Kempny.  Kempny noted that the party will seek to
 increase the participation "of all honest scientific and techno-
 logical workers" in the economy and that  ?iis requires "an
 atmosphere supporting scientific inquiry. . . ."  However, he
 warned, as did the plenum resolution, that "all scientific work
 should be systematically based on the ideological fcundation of
 Marxism-Laninism. "
 Hardline concerns about the dangers of adopting a more tolerant
 attitude toward the scientific intelligentsia were for the most
 part ::~nspicuously muted at the plenum.  Two traditionally
 hardline Presidium members who might have been expected to raise
 such fears, ideological commission chairman Vasil Bilak and trade

 uniou leader Karel Hoffmann. both of ':hom - chaired Ihssiono of
 the Presidium, reportedly did not epe:ak.  Another, Prague
 party chief Antonin Kapek, restricted his remarks to technical
 matters.
 The only fully hardline speech was delivered by Jr:n Fojtik, a
 Central Committee ecretary and Ideological commie +sion member,
 who attacked the tolerant approach to the scientific intelli-
 gentsia by which "parsons who have no future, for either political
 or technical reasons. . . , are allowed to keep their position."
 Recalling the "extremely benevolent attitude" that led to the
 Prague Spring, Fojtik warned that revisionists "will undoubtedly
 do everything possible to make a comeback and start a new onsloughtt
 as soon as the first opportunity arises."
 The paucity of comment from hardliners contrasts sharply with the
 plenum discussions on ideological tasks of October 1972.  At that
 time Bilak delivered the Presidium report and warned that "it
 would be an unforgivable mistake if we were to ouccumb to self-
 satisfaction, if we were to let up on our work. . . ."  The
 following month at a Slovak party plenum Bilak revealed that
 within the party hierarchy there were some lice himself who
 favored a "tough course" and others--an  allusion to moderates
 led by-General Secretary Rusak--who took a "blue sky" approach,
 being satisfied with a more conciliatory attitude toward the
 scientific intelligentsia and other social groups.  The next
 step in the process of accommodation will probably have to
 await the outcome of the struggle for the succession activated
 by the imminent death of President Svoboda.

 CHOU EN-LAI STATUS:  Premier Chou's public appearances during the
 17-21 May visit to Peking by Archbishop Makarios followed the
 pattern set during Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto's visit earlier
 this month.  Chou was aboent from airport ceremonies, banquets
 and some discussions with Makarios, but did greet him at the
 guesthouse, participate in the first round of bilateral talks,
 and attend Makarios' audience with Mao on the 18th.  Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping acted as host during most of the talks and
 ceremonies and was again careful to note, in his 18 May banquet
 speech, that he had been "entrusted" by Chou to host the
 gathering.  Official photographs of Mao's meetings with Bhutto
 and Makarios showed Teng sitting in Chou's traditional seat
 to Mao's right.  It is not clear whether the seating change
 symbolizes an increase in real status for Teng personally, or
 merely indicates that he was acting as chief host.  During
 the visit of Senegal President Senghor, Chou, and Vice Premier
 Li Hsien-nien were both present and Chou retained his traditional
 seat.  This meeting was prior to Chou's apparent indisposition,
 however, which occurred two days later, after which Li sirbstituted
 for Chou at functions for Senghor and then accompanied Senghor
 on a tour around China.  Li is also maintaining a full schedule
 as a Chou substitute, and NCNA's 18 May listing of those who
 sent wreaths to the funeral of an NPC member showed Li still
 in his usual rank order just ahead of Teng.

 PRC ON DISARMAMENT:  Peking has never acknowledged the Soviet call,
 on 16 April, for the participation of "all nuclear powers" in the
 25-state disarmament negotiations in Geneva.       However, the PRC
 position was made clear in a 16 May PEOPLE'S DAILY article by
 Hsj.ing Ming which ridiculed "so--called disarmament meetings,"
 especially the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD)
 in Geneva.  In reporting the CCD session of 16 April, NCNA had
 ignored Soviet representative Roshchin's call for "enlisting in
 the negotiations on disarmament all militarily powerful countries,
 including all nuclear powers, and first and foremost, the Chinese
 People's Republic whose negative stand provides one of the major
 obstacles to the implementation of disarmament programs."  The
 PEOPLE'S DAILY vow characterizes the talks as "forlorn" and "on
 the verge of death," adding that they serve little purpose other
 than to allow Moscow to play its "title role" as the "world's
 top-ranking trumpeter" of fraudulent disarmament.  The article also
 typically differentiated between the two superpowers.  It not
 only castigated Moscow's "hypocrisy" in pleading detente while
 expanding arms but went so far as to cite Defense Secretary
 Schlesinger to bolster its charge:  It quoted the Secretary as
 saying that Washington's arms buildup is needed because Moscow
 "sees no inconsistency between detente and increasing military
 capabilities."
