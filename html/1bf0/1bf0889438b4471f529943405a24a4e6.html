 FAR EAST
 The Mao-Lin faction appears to have gained at
 least a temporary advantage in China's leadership
 struggle.  This is reflected in the reversal of
 policies designed to restore order and discipline
 which were put into effect in February.
 Chou En-lai's first direct attack on Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping suggests that the agile premier
 judged it expedient to adjust to the new situation
 which resulted from high-level meetings last month.
 Chou has also failed to defend his proteges in key
 government positions who now are under heavy attack
 by Red Guard militants.
 The Maoists apparently are making a major effort
 to remove leading military figures both iri Peking
 and in the provinces who took the lead in subduing
 unruly pro-Mao forces in February.  This drive is
 also evident in charges that two members of the Mil-
 itary Affairs Committee and Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 have opposed Lin Piao.
 There were no major military engagements in the
 Vietnam war last week.  However, Communist pressures
 against South Vietnam's Revolutionary Development
 program remain heavy in the northern provinces. These
 attacks have damaged the morale of Revolutionary
 Development teams and have increased desertions and
 absenteeism in this area.
 The steady decline of Burma's economy over the
 past several years has accelerated in recent months.
 General Ne Win may be obliged to modify his doc-
 trinaire "Burmese Way to Socialism" and seek foreign
 economic assistance.  Failure to show some progress
 in reviving the nation's moribund economy could
 erode the support of the armed forces on which Ne
 Win's authority depends.

 VIETNAM
 Although the tempo of mili-
 tary operations has been rela-
 tively low during the past week,
 there continue to be indications
 that North Vietnamese regulars
 plan a major "summer offensive"
 in South Vietnam's northernmost
 provinces.  Following up their
 heavy raids of 5-6 April against
 the capital of Quang Tri Province,
 the Communists on 13 April again
 struck Quang Tri city with mor-
 tar fire and destroyed or dam-
 aged several bridges along the
 coastal highway which is the
 main land route for supplies
 from Da Nang to allied forces
 near the Demilitarized Zone
 (DMZ) .
 The Communists are also main-
 taining heavy pressures against
 the Revolutionary Development
 (RD) program in the I Corps area.
 In Thua Thien Province an attack
 against three RD teams and a Prov-
 ince Reconnaissance Unit on 17
 -April killed 16 and wounded 19.
 Of the more than 200 incidents
 targeted against RD workers
 throughout South Vietnam since 1
 January, over 100 have taken
 place in I Corps.
 Additional information on
 Communist plans in the northern
 provinces was obtained last week
 from further interrogation of a
 the DMZ.  He stated that with
 the onset of the dry season
 around April, his regiment was
 to be .reinforced to participate
 in "division and multidivision
 sized" attacks in Quang Tri
 and Thua Thien.  The prisoner
 added that the 3?_4B NVA Divi-
 sion would also be conducting
 reg:imental and larger attacks
 against forces in Quang Tri
 from a staging area near the
 province's border with Laos.
 In the southern part of I
 Corps, the Thien Phuoc district
 headquarters and nearby Special
 Forces camp, in Quang Tin Prov-
 as among the main tar-
 gets of the Viet Cong summer
 campaign.
 Farther south, in the west-
 ern highlands, Communist forces
 remain deployed in a wide pat-
 tern, apparently in an effort
 to tie down allied troops while
 avoiding large-scale contact.
 Most of the enemy-initiated
 incidents in this area have been
 mortar attacks, mining of roads,
 and harassing fire.

 Hanoi Extends Control Over
 Viet Cong's Northern Command
 An increasing number of
 knowledgeable defectors as well
 as captured documents indicate
 the extent to which Hanoi has
 assumed direct control over mili-
 tary operations in the provinces
 comprising the northern half of
 South Vietnam--generally known
 as Viet Cong Military Region V.
 Hanoi's gradual assumption of
 greater authority over MR V
 probably began in mid-1965 with
 the introduction of regular North
 Vietnamese units.
 A recent high-level defector
 maintains that, although MR V
 remains technically subordinate
 to the Viet Cong's Central Office
 for South Vietnam (COSVN),since
 mid-1966 it has merely kept that
 authority informed of its activi-
 ties and maintained a direct com-
 mand link with Hanoi for both op-
 erations and logistics,  He also
 stated that two subregions--one
 in the western highlands and the
 other embracing the two northern-
 most provinces of Quang Tri and
 Thua Thien--were detached from
 MR V in 1966 and are also di-
 rectly subordinated to Hanoi.
 Saigon's New Lures to Defectors
 After several postponements,
 Premier Ky announced the South
 Vietnamese Government's new pol-
 icy of "National Reconciliation"
 on 19 April.
 Although it generally re-
 emphasizes and strengthens the
 government's "Chieu Hoi" or "open
 arms" policy, the new program
 is intended particularly to en-
 courage defections by medium- and
 high-level Viet Cong officers
 rather than the rank-and-file ele-
 ments who have been the princi-
 pal "ralliers" up to now.  To
 those who leave the Communist
 side, the program offers full
 constitutional guarantees of
 citizenship, including the
 right to run for office, equal
 employment opportunities ac-
 cording to individual capabili-
 ties, and immunity from prosecu-
 tion for acts committed while
 under Viet Cong "coercion."
 It does not explicity offer com-
 parable positions in the govern-
 ment to Viet Cong leaders, nor
 does it unequivocally guarantee
 full immunity from prosecution
 to all former Viet Cong.
 The various delays in the
 announcement of the National
 Reconciliation program appar-
 ently were caused at least par-
 tially by some debate among
 government leaders as to how
 fa.r they could realistically go
 in offering guarantees to the
 Viet Cong.  As they stand now,
 the principles of the program
 are flexible enough to allow
 for some latitude in practice.

 NEW FACTIONALISM IN PEKING
 Recent reports from Peking
 convey the impression that ex-
 tremist leaders around Mao Tse-
 tung and Defense Minister Lin
 Piaa are once again locked in
 struggle with moderate forces led
 by Premier Chou En-lai, the most
 level-headed member of the tri-
 umvirate.
 After the Cultural Revolution
 had brougYrt the country to the
 brink of chaos in January, Chou
 was able 1=o implement a series of
 policies designed to restore order
 and discipline and to reassure
 the army and malce it a more re-
 sponsive instrument of control.
 These policies, grudgingly sup-
 ported at the time by Mao and
 Lin, were reversed at contentious
 high-level meetings held in March.
 Vicious Red Guard poster attacks
 are now being aimed at key gov-
 ernment figures--Chou's proteges--
 and several top military men who
 are being held responsible for
 the  "adverse  current"  alleged]_y
 created in February.
 A major effort may be under
 way to remove military commanders
 both in Peking and the provinces
 who vigorously implemented the
 February directives Chou pushed
 through to restore discipline,
 even when that meant arresting
 unruly Red Guards.  Among them are
 two senior officers who until recently
 worked closely with Mao an C- Lin
 but now are being accused of is-
 suing orders in February to army
 commanders in many localities to
 suppress pro-Mao leftists.  These
 men, Hsu Hsiang-chien and Y"eh
 Chien-ying, also allegedl~T opposed
 Lin Piao at a recent meet_ng of
 the party's Military Affairs
 Committee,  with  Hsu  calli~ia  Lin
 unfit to succeed Mao.
 Hsu, who was named head of
 a special army purge grou~~ on 11
 January, was reportedly d:+_smissed
 from that position on 16 11pri1,
 with the implication that h.e had
 used the post to dampen the purge.
 He is charged with blockiJlq at-
 tempts by Mao's wife--advriser to
 the purge group--to find out what
 the group was doing and with
 covering  up  for  the mistal~es  of
 a deputy head of the grou~~.
 Chou En-lai's authority has
 been further weakened by 7_he
 steady drumfire of poster attacks
 and demonstrations agains!_ men
 who work for him.  The common
 thread of the current cha:?~ges is
 that they resisted extremist pol-
 icies  desired by  Mao  and 1:.in.  In
 the past week a main target has
 been Chou's protege, Fore:i.gn

 Minister Chen Yi.  Posters have de-
 nounced him for opposing Lin and
 exhibiting an "extremely bad
 attitude" at a recent central
 committee meeting.  Chen Yi con-
 tinues to perform ceremonial
 duties--he appeared at a Syrian
 Embassy reception on 17 April--
 but he is clearly in serious
 trouble.
 Chou En-lai continues to
 be the chief spokesman for the
 regime, however,.  He appeared
 with Mao and Lin Piao at a recent
 meeting with the North Vietnamese
 ambassador--Lin's first public
 appearance since 26 November.
 Nevertheless, Chou's failure thus
 far to come to the defense of
 his proteges suggests that the
 premier characteristically is
 adjusting to the latest political
 current with onl  his own status
 in mind.

 BURMA'S ECONOMIC DEC-LINE MAY BRING APPROACH TO WEST
 The steady decline of Burma's
 economy over the past several
 years has accelerated in recent
 months.  This may force General
 Ne Win to modify his "Burmese Way
 to Socialism" and seek Western
 economic assistance.
 A sharp drop in rice exports,
 which normally account for 70
 percent of Burma's foreign ex-
 change earnings, has accelerated
 the downward trend.  The trouble
 comes mainly from failure of the
 regime's rice procurement program,
 which, being keyed to artificially
 low prices, discourages peasants
 from making their crops available.
 A government official has esti-

 of imported consumer goods are

 Aside from removing controls

 plight have received unusually
 extensive coverage in the govern-

 there are indications that Ne Win
 has quietly laid the groundwork

 as the most influential theorist
 behind the "Burmese Way to So-

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Kanellopoulos government in Greece has
 wccheduled elections for 28 May, and the campaign is
 likely to revolve around the issue of the monarchy.
 'T'here are reports that the main antimonarchist,
 Andreas Papandreou, may be arrested, a move which
 would provoke further unrest.
 The national elections in Jordan on 15 April
 for the 60-seat House of Representatives went off
 without serious incident, and the regime appears to
 have in hand what it wanted--a manageable parliament
 which is somewhat short of being a rubber stamp.
 Incidents continue along the Arab-Israeli border,
 and the wrangle over farming in the demilitarized
 zones is keeping tension high.
 The perennial dispute over the status of South-
 West Africa will occupy the major part of the debate
 at the special session of the UN General Assembly
 opening this week (see page 27).
 The latest move in Nigeria's continuing crisis
 is another decree from the Eastern Region taking
 control of federally chartered corporations in such
 fields as electricity, transportation, broadcasting,
 and produce marketing.  The East probably does not
 intend to withdraw formally from the federation at
 this time, but the region will continue to try to
 provoke the federal government into actions that
 would make secession appear justified.
 Addis Ababa has begun to withdraw the 3,000
 Ethiopian troops sent to the French Somaliland border
 prior to the 19 March referendum, and the Emperor
 thus can claim to have taken the first step to re-
 duce tension between his country and its arch-
 antagonist, the Somali Republic.

 coup attempt of 17 April, but the regime's ima e of

 COUP ATTEMPT IN GHANA CRUSHED
 Ghana's governing National
 Liberation Council (NLC) is in
 firm control in the wake of an
 abortive coup attempt on 17 April
 by junior army officers.  The
 image of national stability im-
 parted by the NLC has been seri-
 ously damaged, however, and the
 killing of its most important
 military member has produced a
 power vacuum within the ruling
 junta.
 The rebels gained temporary
 control of Ghana radio and the
 residences of NLC chairman Ankrah
 and Armed Forces Commander Kotoka,
 announced the dissolution of the
 NLC, and proclaimed the establish-
 ment of a new three-man military
 junta.  Ankrah managed to escape,
 but Kotoka was killed.  After the
 initial confusion, police chief
 Harlley, NLC vice chairman, and
 Maj. Gen. Ocran, armed forces
 chief of staff, organized loyal
 forces and quickly suppressed the
 mutiny.
 The coup attempt was poorly
 planned and executed.  The limited
 number of troops which supported
 it came from one unit of the army's
 reconnaissance regiment.  The
 prime organizer appears to have
 been a lieutenant from that unit.
 It is unclear to what extent the
 three senior officers named to
 the would-be junta participated
 in planning the coup.
 The reasons for the coup are
 not apparent, but the instigators
 may have been motivated primarily
 by personal and perhaps tribal
 considerations.  There have been
 some morale problems--aggravated
 by NLC neglect of the military--
 and an undercurrent of tribal
 resentment among junior officers
 and men.  The coup seems to have
 no connection with exiled former
 president Nkrumah's comeback
 schemes.
 The abortive coup and especially
 the death of Kotoka, whose troops
 overthrew Nkrumah last year, will
 have a profound psychological im-
 pact on the surviving NLC members.
 They probably will mete out ex-
 emplary punishment to all plotters,
 try to correct the grave weaknesses
 revealed in their intelligence and
 internal security systems, and
 ameliorate any serious grievances
 in the armed forces.  Council
 members, however, probably feel
 somewhat reassured by the fact
 that all senior military officers
 rallied to the regime and that the
 public appeared genuinely relieved
 when the NLC regained control.
 Although the NLC is seeking
 to play down the significance of
 the coup attempt, it will probably
 find it more difficult to cope with
 Ghana's massive problems.  Fric-
 tion may well develop between po-
 lice and military officers of the
 NLC as well as among military mem-
 bers vying for Kotoka's position.
 Civilian political elements, par-
 ticularly those attracted to the
 former opposition United Party,
 will probably feel that their crit-
 icism of the NLC has been vindicated
 and may increase their pressure to
 speed the transition to civilian

 INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY GOVERNMENT ROCKS ALONG
 Few political observers in
 New Delhi expect Prime Minister
 Gandhi's Congress Party government
 to last out: its full five-year
 term, but to date its slim ma-
 jority in t:he lower house of the
 National Parliament remains in-
 tact.  Political instability on
 the state ]_evel has eased some-
 what, although new changes may be
 in the making.
 The defections from state
 Congress Party organizations that
 recently toppled two Congress
 state governments have not yet
 spread to New Delhi, where state
 factional alignments still pose
 no threat to Congress' majority
 in Parliament.  The moderates in
 the several opposition parties--
 most notably the Hindu nationalist
 Jan Sangh and the conservative
 Swatantra--continue to push for
 greater cooperation in forming
 a united front against the Con-
 gress, but so far have made little
 headway.  'T'hus, defection by
 Congress members of Parliament
 means either political wilderness
 or a new election--prospects which
 few of them would welcome.
 The election of India's new
 president and vice president on
 6 May will be the first major
 national test of strength between
 Congress and the opposition par-
 ties.  The Congress candidate for
 vice president, V. V. Giri,
 should win handily because of
 the party's substantial majority
 among the elected members of both
 houses of Parliament who will make
 the selection.
 Communal and regional fac-
 tors and the different composi-
 tion of the electoral college
 make the result of the pre:;iden-
 tial contest less certain.  The
 Congress Party's candidate is a
 Moslem, and Hindu defections
 could be hidden from the pz~.rty
 hierarchy by the secret ballot
 of the presidential electoral
 college--the elected members of
 both houses of the National Par-
 liament plus the state legisla-
 tures.  A complicated systE~m of
 weighted voting further confuses
 the picture.
 Defeat of the Congress can-
 didate for president--incumbent
 Vice President Husain--would be
 a serious blow to party prestige
 and could even threaten the
 stability of the central govern-
 ment.  In any ease, it would
 make it harder than ever for
 Prime Minister Gandhi to m~in-
 tain her position within th.e
 party because she strongly backed
 Husain's candidacy against the
 wishes of party president k:amaraj.
 The recent rash of defec-
 tions from Congress state c,rgani-
 zations seems to have run its
 course for the present.  Congress,
 moreover, now stands a chance of
 recovering control of the F~unjabi
 Suba government.  In Rajasthan--
 presently under direct rulF~ from
 New Delhi--Congress leader:; re-
 portedly still hope to form. a
 government without resorting to
 an interim election. On the other
 hand, long-range prospects for a
 stable Congress government in the
 southern state of Mysore are in-
 creasin 1  doubtful

 GREECE GETS SET FOR NEW ELECTIONS
 Prime Minister Kanellopoulos'
 decision to dissolve Parliament
 and hold new elections on 28 May
 has thrown Greece into a month-
 and-a-half-long political campaign
 in which the position of the
 monarchy will be a major issue.
 The scheduling of the elec-
 tions has, at least temporarily,
 calmed the political atmosphere
 as all parties swing from parlia-
 mentary maneuvering to preparation
 of lists of candidates.  Ex-
 premier George Papandreou, whom
 King Constantine forced out of
 office in 1965, and his son
 Andreas have attacked the King
 for his second "coup d'etat"--
 elections under a National Radical
 Union (ERE) government rather
 than a nonpolitical cabinet. Both
 the Papandreous' Center Union (EK)
 and the Communist-front United
 Democratic Left (EDA), however,
 appear anxious to avoid any ac-
 tion which would cause strong
 counteraction by the security
 forces or give an excuse for post-
 poning the elections.
 With Kanellopoulos as ad-
 ministrator of the elections, his
 ERE par-ty will have the advantage
 of being in power.  Public reac-
 tion against government manipula-
 tion of this favorable position,
 however, could strengthen George
 Papandreou, who has predicted an
 even greater victory for the EK
 than the 53 percent of the popu-
 lar vote he polled in 1964.  He
 will get the election campaign
 under way with a major speech
 scheduled for 23 March and has
 indicated that its keynote will
 be that Constantine is no longer
 King of the Hellenes but only of
 the ERE.
 Andreas Papandreou has al-
 ready warned publicly that if
 the elections are not honest the
 regime will be at stake.
 25X1
 25X1
 As the pre-electoral pres-
 sures grow, the prospects of a
 victory by the EK and the conse-
 quent strengthening of Andreas
 Papandreou's position are likely
 to increase sentiment among the
 military and the right-wing
 politicians favoring an extra-
 constitutional so:Lution to the
 roblem.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Most Latin American leaders returned home from
 last week's summit meeting apparently at least gen-
 erally satisfied with its results; public reaction,
 however, has ranged in tone from mildly approving to
 highly negative.  The Argentine foreign minister's
 comment appeared to summarize much of the hemisphere"s
 sentiment:  "All that could be reasonably expected
 was accomplished."
 Public media and returning presidents alike
 reserved some of their most enthusiastic comments
 for the side benefits of the summit meeting.  Thus,
 the individual presidents' discussions with President:
 Johnson and other chief executives on topics of over--
 riding local importance--Venezuela's oil exports,
 Panama's desire for rapid completion of a new canal
 treaty with the US, coffee-producing countries'
 concern over the International Coffee Agreement--
 were widely hailed.
 The refusal of Ecuadorean President Arosemena
 to sign the final summit declaration was largely
 played down outside his own country and was depre-
 cated by some as an ill-timed slap at inter-American
 solidarity.  World Communist propaganda media were
 quick to seize upon Arosemena's actions as telling
 indications that the conference was a failure and
 to claim that this represented a heavy blow to US
 leadership in the hemisphere.  Most Communist spokes-
 men stressed that insurgency and political problems
 rather than economic and social development were the
 real issues at stake in the meeting.
 Conditions in Uruguay, the host country for the
 summit meeting, have returned virtually to normal.
 Some 150 leftist students, however, are still holed
 up in a downtown Montevideo university building
 where they barricaded themselves as a protest measure
 during the conference, and they may yet cause further
 problems for the Gestido government.

 POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT SHIFTS IN ECUADOR
 Interim President Otto
 Arosemena's refusal to sign the
 summit declaration has received
 enthusiastic acclaim in E-cuador.
 A large crowd greeted him on his
 return and cheered his statement
 that he did not sign the declara-
 tion because it "is defective for
 what it did not state or contain."
 7'he Ecuadorean press, leading
 politicians, and government of-
 ficials were full of praise for
 Arosemena's stand throughout the
 conference, and the constituent
 assembly passed a "vote of sup-
 port" for Arosemena's actions,
 noting that he "interpreted faith-
 fully and loyally the sentiments
 and aspirations of the Ecuadorean
 people."  Arosemena has thus be-
 come something of a national hero
 for "standing up to the US," and
 his political star has risen ac-
 cordingly.
 Arosemena's performance at
 Punta del Este has temporarily
 removed domestic problems from
 the spotlight.  The country con-
 tinues to be plagued, however, by
 strikes and threats of strikes
 which have tied up commerce from
 time to time and which have pro-
 moted widespread uneasiness.  The
 Communist-dominated Confederation
 of Ecuadorean Workers (CTE) post-
 poned a general strike scheduled
 for 13 April after the government
 capitulated to its demand that
 the constituent assembly take
 prompt action on the workers'
 grievances.  The failure of the
 government to stand up to the CTE
 illustrates .its habit of giving
 in rather than facing a problem
 or possible trouble.
 The constituent assembly
 continues to allow demagogic ex-
 president Carlos Julio Arosemena,
 Otto's cousin, to push his ven-
 detta against members of the
 former military ;junta that ousted
 him.  General Gandara and Admiral
 Castro Jijon tools asylum. in for-
 eign embassies on 14 April to
 avoid Supreme Court warrants for
 their arrest in connection with
 the death of a student during
 demonstrations a~t Quito's Central
 University on 25 March 1966..
 Carlos Julio Arosemena is attempt-
 ing to keep them from leaving the
 country on grounds that they are
 common criminals.  Senior mili-
 tary officers say privately that
 there is nothing they can or
 should do about Arosemena's ac-
 tions or the plight of their
 fellow officers.
 Delegates to the constituent
 assembly from Ecuador's coastal
 provinces are pushing a bill that
 would impose a fine of up to
 $30,000 on foreign vessels ;.aught
 fishing without authorization
 within the 200-mile territorial
 limit over which Ecuador claims
 jurisdiction.  The measure has
 a good chance of being enacted.
 The US tuna fleet is now on the
 way to Ecuadorean waters, and
 Ecuador will probably seize a
 few of the boats as it did last
 January.

 PANAMANIAN REACTION TO JOHNSON-ROBLES TALKS
 Officials of the Panamanian
 Government who discussed the
 canal negotiations with Presi-
 dent Johnson at Punta del Este
 returned to Panama in a euphoric
 mood.
 During a homecoming speech
 on 15 Apri:1, President Robles
 stated that he was "elated" over
 his meeting with President
 Johnson, wlio "grasped our prob-
 lem" and "manifested great
 sympathy toward resolving the
 outstanding issues."  Other mem-
 bers of the Panamanian delega-
 tion voiced renewed optimism
 that the negotiations can be
 concluded within the time limits
 set by the government.
 e  anamanian public had
 expected more concrete results
 from the meeting.  Some edi-
 torials lamented the absence of
 a joint statement and called
 for a complete revelation of the
 details of the meeting.
 News media reaction to the
 Johnson-Robles talks took a
 predictably partisan line.  Press
 and radio facilities owned by
 leaders of the government coali-
 tion were, in  general, laudatory
 of Robles' accomplishments, Op-
 position leaders and the :?arias
 family press played down the
 talks as "vague and unsatisfac-
 tory" and gave full play to a
 recent statement by ArnulFa
 Arias that Robles did not rep-
 resent the country's majority
 and had no right to speak f=or
 them at Punta del Este.
 In a recent radio interview,
 ultranationalist former  Meaty
 negotiator Eloy Benedetti  Mated
 that the time lapse since t-he
 anti-US riots in January X964
 was a net loss to Panama's bar-
 gaining position and diplomatic
 victory for the US.  While ad-
 vising against a repetition of
 the rioting as "impossiblE~ and
 too dangerous" Benedetti voiced
 the opinion that if the talks
 became deadlocked, Panama should
 break off the negotiation::.
 During the 27-month-e~ld ne-
 gotiations Robles has repeatedly
 assured the public that the talks
 were "going well,"  Although he
 has undoubtedly gained some po-
 litical mileage and prestige
 from his meeting with President
 Johnson, Robles will be hard-
 pressed to keep the negotiations
 out of the political arena as
 campaigning for the 1968 elec-
 tions picks up.

 UNITED NATIONS
 SPECIAL SESSION OF UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY CONVENED
 The Special Session of the
 UN General Assembly opening this
 week is unlikely to make much
 progress on either of the major
 items on it:s agenda--South-West
 Africa and peacekeeping procedures.
 The session is expected to last
 about a month, most of it devoted
 to South-West Africa.  Most dele-
 gates are reluctant to face a
 debate on t=hese complicated issues
 and believE: nothing can be ac-
 complished, but none of them is
 willing to offend the Africans by
 moving for a postponement.
 The special committee set
 up last fall to study means to
 implement the General Assembly
 resolution divesting South Africa
 of its South-West Africa mandate
 reached no agreement.  The com-
 mittee's report will merely sum-
 marize its discussions.  The
 Africans on the committee have
 called for immediate establishment
 of a UN administration in the
 territory and, if South Africa
 resists, f'or coercive action un-
 der Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
 Most UN members, however, are not
 eager for such a confrontation
 with SoutYi Africa.  The Latin
 Americans have a plan similar to
 the African one, but without the
 enforcement measures; theirs
 calls instead for some sort of
 dialogue with Pretoria on trans-
 fer of the territory.  A proposal
 put forth by Italy, Canada, and
 the US would ask a special rep-
 resentative to survey the situa-
 tion and leave the problem of
 implementation to the next as-
 sembly.
 Some sort of compromise
 along  the  lines  of  the  Lat~_r:_
 American plan seems the most
 likely to get a majority.  The
 Africans might come to see this
 as the best they can hope .or.
 South Africa's recent announce-
 ment of its willingness to offer
 eventual self-government to the
 "separate peoples  of South-West
 Africa has complicated matters.
 The black Africans suspect that
 Pretoria actually has in mind
 annexation of the valuable white
 areas of South-West Africa..
 The committee on peace-
 keeping likewise has little to
 show for its work since December.
 The nonaligned members are trying
 to get approval of a committee
 report which appeals for volun-
 tary financial contributions,
 recommends that developing coun-
 tries pay no more than five per-
 cent of future peacekeeping
 costs, and asks for further study
 of the problem.  This wouJ_d be

 resolutions--which might again

 as well as a role in financing
 such operations.
 The USSR's recent promise
 of a voluntary contribution ap-
 pears to have been intended to
 win support for a postponement
 or curtailment of any discussion
 of peacekeeping proposals at this
 .session.  A recent Soviet memoran-
 dum to the Security Council on
 peacekeeping warned against adop-
