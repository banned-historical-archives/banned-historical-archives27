 China will yield economic benefits.
 Poland: Legislating Against Dissent
 Since the abolition of martial law three years ago, the Jaruzelski
 regime has been amending old laws and passing new legislation to
 restrict dissent. The new restrictions have been used to conduct
 university purges, make preventive detentions before important
 anniversaries, and carry out widespread arrests of persons engaged
 in illegal printing and distribution of underground publications.

 Italy-Libya              Implications of the Fiat Sale
 The Italian firm Fiat hopes it has cleared the way for participation in US defense
 contracts by convincing Libya to sell its 14.5-percent share of the automaker. In a
 deal completed in mid-September, Fiat purchased one-third of the Libyan shares
 and a consortium of bankers-led by the Deutsche Bank-acquired the remaining
 shares for resale on the secondary market. Tripoli accepted the current market
 price of $3.1 billion for its shares although it had demanded a much higher price
 when Fiat first offered to buy back the shares last May. F__1
 Profits from the sale will bring Libya's reserves to last year's level, and Tripoli
 may have decided to accept the market price now to reduce the impact of a
 possible Italian freeze of Libyan assets. The Italian Government probably hopes
 the sale will smooth Italian-US relations. The sale also removes one obstacle to
 Italy's adoption of stronger measures against Qadhafi-backed terrorism, although
 Rome will still be constrained by the 2,000 Italian workers in Libya and by the
 nearly $1 billion Tripoli owes Italian companies. F_~
 United Kingdom-France    Final Evaluation for an AEW Aircraft
 The UK Defense Ministry has announced that it has closed bidding for the Royal
 Air Force's new airborne early warning aircraft (AEW), reducing contenders to
 the British Nimrod fitted with a radar made by Britain's General Electric
 Company and the US-manufactured E-3 AWACS. According to the US
 Embassy, both contenders have been requested to submit final proposals by mid-
 November, and a Defense Ministry decision is expected in December. France,
 which is interested in aquiring three such aircraft, will participate in the evaluation
 of the two contenders and may consider a joint procurement option.
 London may hope that a joint Anglo-French evaluation, especially if it leads to a
 decision by both nations to buy AWACS, will help mute criticism that the
 Thatcher government too often favors US manufacturers for military
 procurement. A joint purchase also would demonstrate London's commitment to
 increased European defense cooperation and would probably bring down the unit
 cost of either system. The French have long pushed for an airborne early warning
 aircraft to fill gaps in their air defenses but probably cannot field a French-built
 system before 1993.F___-]

 Safety Concerns Delay Nuclear Power Program U
 Work on Poland's first nuclear power plant was halted for several months this
 summer, probably due to increased safety concerns in the wake of the Chernobyl
 disaster. Following the Soviet mishap, some 3,000 Polish citizens petitioned
 parliament to temporarily halt nuclear power plant construction, and Polish
 scientists warned that planned safety systems were inadequate. A parliamentary
 commission, citing limits on domestic coal production and energy imports from the
 Soviet Union, reiterated the importance of nuclear power but promised that safety
 concerns were a priority. Last month, the Council of Ministers ordered a review of
 blueprints for the plant, and Polish nuclear power officials announced that fire
 prevention equipment and monitoring devices would be upgraded. According to a
 regional party newspaper, Polish nuclear experts rejected poor quality cement
 deliveries and have noted quality problems with Polish steel and electrical cable.
 Warsaw probably will have to seek additional outside technical assistance-
 possibly from East Germany or the West-to address safety concerns and alleviate
 materials shortages. Despite the delays and mounting costs of the plant under
 construction, plans for Poland's second nuclear power plant are moving forward.
 Nonetheless, Polish officials do not expect nuclear power to contribute
 significantly to Poland's energy supply before the year 2000.1

 Yugoslavia               Foreign Exchange Laws May Be Revised 0
 Yugoslav officials appear increasingly convinced that the controversial foreign
 exchange laws passed last December after a major political struggle are not
 working and may have to be changed. From the outset, leaders and businessmen
 from the northern trade-oriented republics have criticized the legislation-the
 heart of which is a requirement that exporters turn over all hard currency earnings
 to a federally administered "market." Both Premier Mikulic and a deputy trade
 minister in public statements have left the door open to eventual changes. The
 southern regions-which initially pushed for the new system in hopes of gaining
 greater access to foreign exchange-are likely to acquiesce to some changes over
 the next year as they discover they have even less access to hard currency than
 The problem with the new laws, according to critics, is that they decrease the
 incentive to export to the West and are less efficient in allocating foreign exchange
 than the "gray" market that flourished under the old system. Regional officials
 note that exporters have been slow to remit earnings and say privately that firms
 and banks are "hiding" foreign exchange through "creative" accounting methods.
 The Federal Government estimates that of $6 billion earned in the first eight
 months of 1986 only $320 million reached the official market. US diplomats report
 that importers face growing difficulties in obtaining foreign exchange. Moreover,
 many exporters can no longer increase their profits through gray market sales of
 foreign currency and have seen their earnings fall. At the same time, inflation has
 made domestic sales more attractive.)
 The fate of the laws ultimately may depend on Belgrade's ability to meet
 obligations stemming from its roughly $19 billion hard currency debt. The
 disincentive to export in the new system almost certainly has contributed to the
 recent deterioration of Yugoslavia's trade balance with convertible currency
 markets-Belgrade recorded a $1.1 billion deficit in the first six months of 1986,
 nearly double the $683 million deficit registered during the same period last year.
 Hungary                  Authorities Ban Literary Journal
 The closure this summer of the literary journal Tiszataj for publishing a poem that
 implicitly accuses Hungary's current leaders of betrayal for helping crush the
 October 1956 revolution reflects the regime's anxiety at the approaching 30th
 anniversary of the uprising. This is the first time in recent years that the relatively
 benign Kadar regime has taken such harsh reprisals against a legitimate journal
 for critical commentary. This action, which a source of the US Embassy recently
 said was appealed by the regime-sponsored Writers Union, is a clear warning to
 the literary community to avoid unauthorized interpretations of the 1956 events.
 The authorities have used unusual force several times this year to break up
 demonstrations or confiscate dissident literature in an apparent effort to set clear
 limits to nonsanctioned activities prior to the revolution's anniversary.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Ap i proved for Release 2012/01/09: CIA-RDP87T00289R000301200001-3
 The regime's unusually severe response to Tiszataj's transgression may also have
 been prompted by the journal's strong nationalist orientation. It has long been an
 outlet for so-called populist writers, who have focused on the plight of Hungarian
 minorities in neighboring Romania and Czechoslovakia, a cause that has wide
 appeal in Hungary and has even forced Budapest to protest Prague's and
 Bucharest's alleged mistreatment of their Magyar populations. The authorities
 may fear that the populists are now turning to the-heretofore taboo issue of the
 1956 uprising and its aftermath and even joining forces with dissidents who have
 been consistently critical of the role played by current leaders in the revolution.
 The affair also highlights divisions within the party over how to handle touchy
 subjects such as 1956. Embarrassed party officials told US diplomats that they
 acted quickly to revoke the journal's license because the editorial board is
 composed of party members. Some elements of the party, particularly young
 members, tend to favor removing the ban against open discussion of the topic,
 according to US Embassy officers. The party's senior members, however, some of
 whom participated in the events of 1956, remain opposed to unfettered discussion
 of the uprising and defensive about their own activities during that time.)
 Bulgaria            Continuing Economic Troubles L__]
 Bulgarian economic growth in key sectors during the first half of 1986-the
 crucial first year of its Ninth Five-Year Plan-was below the mark even for the
 government's modest targets, and it is now unlikely that the country can meet its
 economic goals for the year. Poor performance in the critical areas of agriculture
 and energy production will have serious repercussions throughout the Bulgarian
 economy. The country's deteriorating trade situation will almost certainly lead the
 regime to expand its now modest Western debt.
 Party leader Todor Zhivkov, who turned 75 on 7 September, will not hesitate to
 make scapegoats of top economic officials if the economy does not turn around. He
 has repeatedly removed economic planners during his 32-year rule-including
 formerly close allies-and has often reshuffled the planning bureaucracy to deflect
 criticism and promote the appearance of reform. Continued poor economic
 performance could affect the political fortunes of several of Zhivkov's potential
 successors-probably boosting Party Secretary and Politburo member Alexandrov
 at the expense of Economic Council Director Doynov

 Eastern Europe-China:
 Party Ties Likely
 Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's recent
 overtures to Beijing have bolstered prospects for
 reviving Sino-East European party relations. Visits
 this fall to Beijing by the party leaders of Poland and
 East Germany give further impetus. F_~
 Unlike Moscow, Beijing does not see party relations
 with Eastern Europe as leading to reestablished party
 ties between China and the Soviet Union. The
 Chinese have been expanding economic and political
 relations with Eastern Europe for several years as part
 of their "independent foreign policy" of reducing
 tension with the Soviet Bloc and expanding relations
 with developing countries to balance China's opening
 to the West. Beijing hopes to increase its influence in
 Moscow's backyard and to encourage both East
 European independence of Moscow and East
 European-West European detente. China does not,
 however, want to upset Sino-US relations by giving
 the impression that Beijing is reassessing its ties to the
 West. For its part, Eastern Europe supports Moscow's
 move to reduce tensions within the Communist world
 and hopes improved relations with China will yield
 economic benefits as well as lead to greater Soviet
 diversity in dealing with the various East Bloc
 regimes. Ironically, the effort has produced some
 friction among the East European allies over which
 one should set the pace. F_~
 Unprecedented Visits
 Statements by several Chinese and East European
 officials in recent months suggest that they have been
 preparing to reestablish party relations suspended
 since the Sino-Soviet break of the mid-1960s.'
 Gorbachev's overtures to China in his Vladivostok
 speech of 28 July underscored Moscow's effort to
 reduce tensions with Beijing, and this conciliatory
 mood could facilitate the normalizing of Sino-East
 European party relations.
 ' For purposes of this analysis, Eastern Europe refers only to East
 Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. China
 already enjoys party ties to Romania and Yugoslavia; Albania does
 The landmark events on the road to reestablishing
 party ties have been the working visit by Poland's
 Wojciech Jaruzelski last month and the impending
 state visit by East Germany's Erich Honecker. Each is
 party chief as well as head of state, making the visits
 the highest level contacts with China in more than 20
 years by the East European parties that follow
 Moscow's foreign policy lead.
 Jaruzelski stopped over in Beijing for a three-day
 working visit as an add-on to an earlier scheduled visit
 to Mongolia and North Korea. Jaruzelski met with
 top Chinese state and party officials, including Deng
 Xiaoping, Premier Zhao Ziyang, Head of State Li
 Xiannian, and Party Chief Hu Yaobang. Zhao, Li,
 and Hu have accepted invitations to visit Poland and
 invited Jaruzelski to return on a formal visit. They
 also signed a cultural and scientific agreement.
 Honecker, who was invited for a longer stay, will be
 the official guest of both Hu and Li and probably will
 sign one or more economic cooperation agreements.
 Honecker, who considers himself Moscow's most
 valuable ally and revels in state visits abroad, must be
 furious with Jaruzelski for diminishing the uniqueness
 of his own trip. Western diplomats in Beijing also
 report that the Chinese were irritated at Jaruzelski
 and believe they were tricked by the Soviets, who
 knew that China could not turn down the Polish
 request. Consequently, the Chinese stopped short of
 reestablishing full party-to-party ties during
 Jaruzelski's visit.
 Chinese Motivations
 Beijing has stepped up its efforts to strengthen
 political and economic ties to Moscow's East
 European allies ever since Hu announced China's
 "independent foreign policy" at the 12th Party
 Congress in September 1982. We believe the Chinese
 seek to:

 Hungary, and Bulgaria to emulate Romania in
 pursuing foreign policies less subservient to

 opportunity to develop relations with another reform-

 East Germany has served most often as Moscow's
 East European stalking-horse in developing economic
 and political ties to China. Sino-East German
 government relations in many areas have expanded at
 an increasing tempo since 1983. Honecker's visit thus
 caps a series of exchanges in the past year-the
 highest level in more than 25 years-in which three
 East German Politburo members holding government
 East European Motivations
 Eastern Europe, in contrast, supports Moscow's
 efforts to use improvements in Sino-East European
 ties to promote Sino-Soviet reconciliation. We believe
 that the East Europeans hope as well that a
 diminution of the bitter factionalism that has plagued
 the Communist world since the two giants split in the
 mid-1960s might increase Soviet tolerance of diversity
 within Eastern Europe. The East Europeans also see
 China as a potentially vast market for their industrial
 goods and a supplier of raw materials and light
 manufactures.
 Each East European country-especially East
 Germany-has its own agenda with a broad range of
 political and economic objectives. On the political
 side, Honecker has striven to raise East Germany's
 profile in international affairs and to present himself
 as a Central European statesman and political
 interlocutor as sought after as West German
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited Beijing in 1984
 and hosted Hu in Bonn this past June. Similarly, we
 believe Jaruzelski welcomes the boost to his
 international image arising from being the first East
 European party head (with the notable exception of
 Romania's Nicolae Ceaucescu, who has always been a
 foreign policy maverick) to visit China. Even
 Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, in the past critical of
 Chinese reforms, recently met with a visiting Chinese
 official of ministerial rank and discussed expanding
 trade. The East European party leader most likely to
 visit China next is Hungary's Janos Kadar. According
 to Embassy sources in Budapest, Kadar may be
 planning such a trip even though he loathes flying. In
 posts have met with Hu during visits to Beiiine.
 Outlook
 We believe China will gradually normalize party
 relations with all of Eastern Europe, which should
 lead to increased senior party exchanges and
 attendance at one another's party congresses. China is
 scheduled to convene its next party congress in 1987,
 and the East Europeans will hold theirs in the early
 1990s. Party ties will complement existing
 government and economic relations, which will also
 continue to develop at an increasing rate. At the same
 time, the East Europeans will be on guard against
 Chinese efforts to use them against the Soviets.
 Honecker, for example, visited Moscow in early
 October, presumably to discuss, among other things,
 his forthcoming trip. For its part, Beijing will seek to
 reassure the West-and Washington in particular-
 that party relations with Eastern Europe do not
 foreshadow similar ties to Moscow. Deng and other
 senior Chinese leaders have recently stressed that any
 progress in Sino-Soviet relations depends on major
 Soviet concessions on Cambodia.)

 Poland: Legislating Against
 Dissent F-1
 The Polish Government has used the period since the
 abolition of martial law in July 1983 to amend old
 laws and pass new restrictive legislation to limit
 dissent. Moreover, it has not been deterred by
 domestic criticism. For example, church protests over
 revision of the liberal education law in 1985 were
 brushed aside by the government. The regime has
 privately told its critics the new harsh laws will not
 necessarily be broadly implemented but are intended
 as a wart. ing that the regime has the legal tools to use
 against tt oublemakers. The new restrictions have
 been used to conduct university purges, make
 preventive detentions before important anniversaries,
 and carry out widespread arrests of those involved in
 the illegal printing and dissemination of underground
 publications.
 The brunt of the new legislation is aimed at
 dissidents. A special criminal liability law and
 changes to the penal code increase the power of judges
 to speed up the trial process, to impose sentences
 immediately-especially when the accused is caught
 in the act-and to waive trials without appeal for a
 greater number of offenses. Other changes include
 harsher jail terms, fines, confiscation of property,
 changes in the parole procedure, and travel
 restrictions. General Baryla, the Politburo and
 Secretariat member in charge of security, announced
 earlier this year that more law-and-order legislation is
 being prepared.
 Clamping Down on Educators, Students,
 and the Media
 Amendments to the 1982 Higher Education Law
 provide for greater central government control over
 university activities. The Minister of Science and
 Higher Education is given authority to ensure
 teachers take a loyalty oath before employment,
 reassign troublesome instructors, and approve
 university election lists. Other changes allow rectors
 to call in police to stop protests-which are now
 grounds for expulsion-give the party's national
 student organization the exclusive right to represent
 students and require the revision of university
 charters to conform to a new model statute. In
 November 1985 the regime purged 70 university
 professors and is currently conducting a nationwide
 teacher verification program to be completed by the
 end of 1986.F___~
 There is also evidence that the regime is planning
 further legislation to tighten controls over the careers
 of university-trained professors.
 the regime is considering draft laws requiring
 one year of compulsory employment in the socialized
 sector for people exempt from military service.
 Moreover, graduates of vocational state-run schools or
 universities would be required to work in state-run
 enterprises or institutions for 10 years or repay the
 government for their education. Returning emigres
 would be subject to the same law; students visiting the
 West would be required to leave a deposit with the
 government to ensure their return. The current job
 verification policy, according to the official press, is
 partly aimed at forcing teachers back to the schools
 and out of more lucrative positions in the economic
 sector.
 New censorship and press laws further centralize
 control of the media, especially print journalism.
 Licenses are required for the use of all printing,
 recording, and film operations. Copiers, stamps, and
 seals must be registered and use permits are required.
 The 1982 law on dissemination of false information
 causing grave damage to Poland carries a sentence of
 five years imprisonment and remains part of the new
 penal code. F_~
 Weakening Workers' Rights
 Amendments to the Trade Union Act in July 1985
 eliminate the possibility of union pluralism. In
 addition, the unions are empowered to allocate
 housing, health, and vacation benefits. Former
 Solidarity members have had strong representation on
 some self-management councils.

 Hungary: Observations From
 a Summer Abroad
 The typical tourist's impression of Hungary is that of
 a land of plenty smoothly avoiding the difficulties that
 trouble so much of Eastern Europe in the 1980s. The
 first few days a visitor spends in Budapest seems to
 confirm this opinion. There are no lines outside the
 stores, which display a variety of Western consumer
 goods in their windows. There are many restaurants
 and cafes and even a few Western-style nightclubs
 that offer entertainment long into the night. Food is
 plentiful and sold in numerous markets and from
 many sidewalk stands. The shoppers who stroll down
 Budapest's pedestrian shopping district are well
 dressed in a Western style, and the streets are
 crowded with traffic. The new houses and apartment
 buildings rising in the Buda hills would fit in some of
 the best suburbs of Vienna or Munich.)
 These initial images, however, conceal as much as
 they reveal. The new homes that look so impressive on
 the outside can develop cracks and plumbing
 malfunctions as quickly as they do elsewhere in
 Eastern Europe                      told me that
 the wait for an apartment in  u apest is now 10
 years. The grocery markets are not able to maintain a
 consistent supply of some foods, and an indifferent
 food-processing industry ruins some of the goods that
 are available. Budapest's working-class districts are
 home to individuals who are obviously not affluent or
 attached to Western styles. The stores stock goods
 that are too expensive for working-class Hungarians
 to buy, and many restaurants feature meals that
 would cost an average worker a fifth or sixth of his
 monthly wage. The vast income inequalities that the
 country suffers from are readily apparent on the
 streets of Budapest, as the many who can barely
 afford an East German-built Trabant are passed by
 the few who can afford a BMW. Outside the large
 STAT
 cities, one is just as likely to see horses used for farm
 transportation as tractors or trucks. True, much of the
 bounty on display in Budapest is meant for the STAT
 Austrian and West German tourists who converge on
 the city in the summer, but the ready availability of
 these goods serves only to heighten the expectations of
 Hungarians.
 In short, Hungarian society is a mixture of
 contradictory and confusing features, a Communist
 country in which great wealth, substantial freedoms,
 and a good measure of satisfaction with the country's
 leader coexist with considerable poverty, police
 repression, and an increasing potential for political
 instability. It is also a society about which the
 leadership is very much concerned.
 Economic Problems
 Hungarian officials admit freely that they are
 concerned about the potential consequences of the
 country's economic difficulties. Hungary's high debt
 service obligations, outmoded industrial base, and
 uncompetitive export sector, among other factors,
 have contributed to economic stagnation throughout
 the 1980s. Individual Hungarians have suffered
 because wage increases have not kept pace with
 inflation during this period. Consumers stare at the
 prices of goods in shop windows, shake their heads,
 and walk on. Most find it necessary to take second      2o~"I
 jobs just to maintain their standard of living, and
 many have given up hope of seeing an improvement in
 living standards in their lifetime. This problem is
 compounded by the fact that not everyone is suffering
 equally from the stagnation. Those who have the skills
 and entrepreneurial spirit needed to succeed in the
 "second economy" (accepted private activities) or the
 "third economy" (blatantly illegal activities) can
 prosper. These people can build a new home without
 waiting for a state-built home, drive high-priced
 Western cars, shop in the costly Western-style
 boutiques, and eat in the most expensive private

 restaurants in Budapest. Indeed, their willingness to
 flaunt their prosperity is a major cause of the social
 tension that the regime is so worried about. The mass
 of Hungarians who are cut out of this new prosperity
 don't understand who these wealthy people are or how
 they make their money. Many suspect that the
 nouveaux riches resort to political contacts or
 corruption to get ahead.
 Despite the problems associated with the private
 sector, it seems unlikely that the regime will be able to
 cut back on private activities unless it is willing to
 endure the economic dislocation that this would
 entail. The private sector provides the economy with
 an important source of dynamism and fulfills many
 service needs that the state sector cannot. It also
 provides an important safety valve to absorb those
 who will need to find alternative work if the regime
 continues with its plan of restructuring the state
 sector. F--7
 Although an occasional rumor of a work stoppage by
 disgruntled workers reaches the US Embassy, the
 harried populace for the most part expresses its
 resentment verbally and in private. Still, officials
 point out that this is Hungary's first experience with
 anything other than continuous improvement in living
 standards since 1956, and no one is quite sure how
 people will react, especially if conditions do not
 improve in the coming years. Indeed, top economic
 policy makers are already trying to prepare the
 populace for the announcement of the 1987 plan,
 which does not include an increase in living standards
 among its provisions. F----]
 Political Uncertainties
 These economic problems and resulting social
 concerns come at a time when the political and
 economic decision making process appears almost
 paralyzed by confusion and indecision. Some officials
 complain that party leader Kadar is no longer
 interested in governing or capable of making the hard
 decisions that must be taken if Hungary is to climb
 out of its economic doldrums. This may be a part of
 the problem, but it is probably not the most important
 and is surely an oversimplification of the political and
 ideological disarray that characterizes Hungarian
 society.
 The political confusion seems to me to be a logical
 outgrowth of Kadarism, that style of leadership in
 which the party has permitted, indeed encouraged,

 Secret
 nonparty members and institutions to play a more
 active role in the political process and the economic
 system. This longstanding tendency has been
 intensified in recent years as the regime has sought to
 improve its legitimacy to make up for the damage
 done by the stagnating economy. The leadership has,
 among other things, introduced a new election format,
 spoken about enhancing the role of the National
 Assembly, introduced worker-management councils
 in enterprises, encouraged the trade unions to change
 their traditional role, announced new responsibilities
 for the Chamber of Commerce, and decentralized the
 local administrative structure-all within the last five
 years. F_
 One gets the impression that the central authorities,
 either following some master plan or simply reacting
 to events, spin out new responsibilities and new rights
 for these institutions without giving careful thought to
 how the changes will be implemented or to their
 ultimate cumulative effect. To this point, it is clear
 that the officials in control of these various
 organizations often don't seem to understand their
 new duties or disagree with them and do nothing to
 implement them. In some cases, it seems that
 managers simply cannot keep up with the rapidly
 changing policy directives. The net result is the spread
 of confusion, indecision, and a sense of drift
 throughout the political and economic systems. For
 example, no one in Hungary seems to understand
 exactly how the enterprise council reform is to work,
 or what it has meant to enterprise operation thus far.
 The managers of a shoe cooperative argued for 10
 minutes among themselves in trying to explain to me
 how they were elected by the co-op workers before the
 party secretary silenced them with his views on the
 matter. The director of the Chamber of Commerce
 was unable to explain to me how his organization
 would represent the interests of enterprise managers,
 a task that was recently assigned to the Chamber by
 the Council of Ministers. These clearly were not
 deliberate attempts to withhold information but real
 signs of puzzlement and disorganization.
 This sense of confusion extends even to the role of the
 party itself. A party historian told me that the party is
 the ultimate coordinator of interests in society,
 meshing and refining the demands of social groups as
 expressed by other institutions. The party does not
 favor any of these interests, I was told, but measures
 them against the interests of society as a whole. The
 leaders of these other organizations are
 uncomfortable with the lack of clear guidance that
 this passive role of the party presupposes, and with the
 prospect of advancing interests that may be at odds
 with party policy. At the same time, local party
 officials seem uncertain of their responsibilities and
 each apparently defines them according to his own
 preferences, further adding to the confusion. For
 example, newspaper and journal articles appear in
 Budapest that suggest serious consideration is being
 given at the highest levels to having the party
 "withdraw" from the economic system, particularly at
 the enterprise level. A party official in one of the
 outlying counties told me, however, that this is an
 "extreme view" and that the party is only encouraging
 other institutions to become more involved than they
 have been in the past, while the level of party activity
 Ideological Ambiguity
 This same confusion extends to ideology. There are no
 longer any clear distinctions between policies that are
 considered ideologically legitimate and those that are
 not. Everyone seems concerned with the income
 inequalities that plague society, but general
 agreement is lacking on what constitutes ill-gotten
 gains. Budapest officials tend to focus their ire on
 blatantly illegal activities, such as land speculation,
 while the more orthodox officials in outlying areas
 point to such things as privately operated boutiques as
 examples of improperly achieved income.)
 The party historian admitted to me that Marxism-
 Leninism holds little relevance for contemporary
 Hungary. The regime sees the more vague concept of
 socialism, defined simply as a type of political and
 economic organization that favors certain policy goals
 above others, as its guiding philosophical concept. Yet
 even this idea is being modified from its traditional
 meaning to make it more relevant to the current         25X1
 scene, and its claims more realistic and less utopian.
 Thus, the theory of socialism is being changed to fit
 reality in the hope that Hungarians will accept it as a

 Secret
 political and economic system that can solve certain,
 but not all, basic human problems. In the meantime,
 this doctrinal confusion contributes to the feeling of
 drift and indecision that permeates society.
 Local Politics
 Last year's competitive Council election, coupled with
 a decentralization of authority from county to local
 level, and the confusion that has immobilized
 institutional life in the country, have led to some
 interesting and important developments in local
 politics. For example, a new tax law, designed to fund
 municipal projects such as schools and swimming
 pools, requires that a majority of the households in a
 taxing district approve the expenditure of funds for
 each specific project. This means that local officials
 must now be more solicitous of voter opinion and must
 work to build a consensus behind their policy
 proposals.
 Local council meetings have become more contentious
 since the competitive elections, and these local bodies
 have more control over the expenditure of funds than
 ever before. The Patriotic People's Front (PPF)-the
 body that, among other things, organizes the
 parliamentary and local elections-now plays a major
 role in ensuring the accountability of these local
 officials. County and city officials told me that the
 PPF organizes meetings of voters three to four times
 each year at which elected councilmen must report on
 their activities and that it has the power to organize
 special referendums to determine popular support for
 controversial council decisions. The councilmen must
 also report to the PPF itself upon demand. F_~
 Conclusions
 The leadership is in a difficult position. It has
 unleashed the forces of political and economic change
 but is reluctant to see these changes run their course.
 Although the party has tentatively assigned new roles
 and tasks to old institutions, it has yet to emphasize
 that officials will not suffer sanctions if they make use
 of their new authority to advocate policies that run
 counter to those favored by the party. The party has

 also permitted market forces to influence economic
 activity to some extent but has been reluctant to
 rationalize the economic system as a whole.
 Far from promoting social stability, these limited and
 contradictory reforms have served to undermine the
 regime's credibility by presenting to the populace an
 image of indecisiveness and confusion. Not following
 through on these reforms may be as
 counterproductive in the long run as not having tried
 them at all. Remaining caught somewhere in the
 middle between encouraging words and real
 structural reform can only serve to sharpen existing
 social problems as the gap between the regime's words
 and deeds grows wider with each new policy
 Yet moving off center will be no easy task in itself.
 Most officials must realize that Hungary is on the
 verge of a political succession and will be unwilling to
 undertake new responsibilities and their attendant
 risks until that issue is resolved. The party leaders
 themselves, recognizing that Kadar's rule is drawing
 inevitably to a close, may not be doing all they could
 to enforce the recent policy changes for fear of
 becoming too closely identified with a particular
 policy. Finally, the omnipresent concern about Soviet
 attitudes toward further reform acts as an instinctive
 brake on moving too far and too quickly.
 Hungary's leaders face some difficult choices, and a
 protracted period of argument among those who have
 different policy priorities is likely, especially after
 Kadar passes from the scene. It seems, therefore,
 probable that Hungary will be characterized over the
 next several years by more drift and confusion during
 which much is said about further reform but little is
 accomplished. The decade of the 1980s has changed
 Hungary from a textbook example of how to deftly
 reform a Communist system into something more
 open and rational to a textbook example of how
 difficult and risky it is to enact meaningful structural
 reform in an East European state.F--~
