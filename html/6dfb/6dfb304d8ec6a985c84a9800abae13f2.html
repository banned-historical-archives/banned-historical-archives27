 INDIA
 Indira Gandhi's 11-year reign as India's
 prime minister-and the Congress Party's
 uninterrupted rule since independence in
 1947-came to an end this week with the
 announcement of results from last week's
 parliamentary election. The Congress
 Party was overwhelmingly defeated by the
 Janata or People's Party and its allies,
 and Janata leader Morarji Desai has been
 installed as India's new prime minister.
 Returns from all but 3 of the 542
 parliamentary constituencies gave the
 Janata Party 26 seats. The Congress
 Party won 154.1 Former agriculture
 minister Jagjivan Ram's Congress for
 Democracy, which was allied with the
 Janata group, won 28 seats.
 With the support of some independents
 and other allies, the new government may
 be able to marshal the two-thirds majority
 needed in parliament to overturn major
 constitutional changes enacted by the
 Congress Party during the past two years.
 On the other hand, ideological divergen-
 cies and competing ambitions among the
 four parties that formed the Janata Party
 two months ago could make it difficult for
 the new leadership group to reach agree-
 ment on policies and appointments.
 As her defeat became apparent, Gandhi
 rescinded the state of emergency imposed
 in June 1975 and began releasing the
 remaining political prisoners. Leaders of
 the victorious parties reportedly have
 hinted that retributive action may be
 taken against those who played leading
 roles during the emergency, particularly
 Gandhi's son Sanjay. The Congress Par-
 ty, meanwhile, has named Y. B. Chavan,
 who had held key cabinet posts in recent
 years, as its new leader in the parliament.
 Desai, who is 81 years old but apparent-
 ly in good health, was a leader of a conser-
 vative faction in the Congress Party until
 he broke with Gandhi in 1969. He was
 jailed for 18 months during the emergen-
 cy. He has been critical of India's 1971
 friendship treaty with the USSR and
 favors a more balanced foreign policy.
 Desai is a capable administrator but has
 been accused of being inflexible and
 puritanical.
 Two other key figures in the election
 campaign were Ram, a leader of India's
 large "untouchable" community who
 resigned from Gandhi's government and
 party last month, and Jayaprakash
 Narayan, a widely respected elder
 statesman. Ram had hoped to become
 prime minister, losing out only after
 Narayan met individually with the win-
 ning parties' members of parliament and
 ascertained that they preferred Desai.
 Ram's subsequent announcement that his
 party will not participate in the new
 government could foreshadow more
 serious disagreements.
 The victorious parties directed their
 electoral campaign at Gandhi's
 authoritarian rule, the ambitions of her
 son, and the excesses of the government's
 population control and slum clearance
 campaigns. The sterilization program
 may have been the most important cause
 of the Congress Party's defeat, and the
 new government is likely to be cautious
 about trying to control the growth of In-
 dia's   huge   population. F_
 PAKISTAN
 Violent demonstrations against the
 government of Prime Minister Bhutto
 continued this week as leaders of the op-
 position Pakistan National Alliance
 reiterated charges that the ruling party's
 landslide victory in the March 7
 parliamentary election was due to
 widespread fraud.
 Bhutto's opponents are still hoping the
 demonstrations will lead military leaders
 to conclude that order can be restored
 only by removing Bhutto from office and
 calling a new election. Thus far the dis-
 ruptions have provoked the Prime
 Minister to arrest most ,of the prominent
 alliance leaders and to place Karachi, the
 country's largest city and an opposition
 stronghold, under an army-enforced
 curfew.
 The curfew was imposed after rioting
 broke out during demonstrations in the
 city last weekend. Dozens have died in the
 Karachi disturbances, and the city was
 paralyzed by a one-day general strike
 called by the opposition on March 21.
 A nationwide strike has been called
 for March 26 to protest the rigging
 of the election and the convening of
 the parliament.

 Serious clashes have also occurred in
 Hyderabad, a staunchly pro-opposition
 city. Demonstrators also have been
 arrested in the North-West Frontier
 Province, another opposition stronghold.
 To bring down Bhutto, the opposition
 presumably would have to wage a
 stronger campaign than it has so far in
 Punjab Province, which has more than
 half oP Pakistan's population. Mobs in
 Lahore, the provincial capital, reportedly
 are using fire bombs against police, but
 the situation has not yet become serious
 enough for Bhutto to impose a curfew or
 use army troops directly against the
 demonstrators.
 Despite his strong actions against the
 National Alliance, Bhutto may still be
 attempting to work out a compromise.
 The US embassy believes, however, that
 his offer to free some of the arrested
 leaders is viewed by the opposition as a
 sign of weakness. Former air force com-
 mander Asghar Khan, the most promi-
 nent of those arrested last week, has re-
 fused to leave jail unless all political
 prisoners are freed, and opposition
 leaders have rejected Bhutto's latest  er
 to talk
 CHINA
 Top rational and provincial leaders ap-
 parently have been meeting in Peking
 since early this month. They may be dis-
 cussing matters relating to the rehabilita-
 tion of former vice premier Teng Hsiao-
 ping and other important personnel
 questions that have been troubling the
 regime for months.
 Teng was a vice chairman
 of the Chinese Communist Party and
 chief of staff of the army as well as a vice
 premier. Teng's rehabilitation is a vin-
 dication of old-line party officials, in-
 cluding Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying,
 the regime's number-two man, who sup-
 ported his pragmatic economic and ad-
 ministrative policies.
 Teng seems likely to reappear publicly
 soon, perhaps before April 5, the first an-
 niversary of the leftist-instigated riots in
 Peking that led to his purge. The positions
 that he is to hold, on the other hand, may
 not be announced right away.
 Supporters of Teng have been arguing
 that he should be promoted and replace
 party chairman Hua?Kuo-feng as premier.
 Hua, however, has not been in a hurry to
 fall in with this proposal. He was the chief
 beneficiary of Teng's purge and is almost
 certainly wary of Teng's important ties in
 both the party and the army-ties that
 Hua has yet to establish firmly, for
 himself.
 2     WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Since the meetings began in the capital,
 other difficult decisions have been made
 concerning personalities who were
 demonstrably too close to the four leftist
 Politburo members purged last fall.
 Peking's instructions apparently indicated
 that Chen Hsi-lien, another Politburo
 member, has been relieved of command of
 the key Peking Military Region. In the
 past, Chen had connections with the
 "gang of four" and was often rumored to
 be a leading opponent of Teng's
 rehabilitation.
 Two weeks ago, several officials were
 apparently purged in Liaoning Province
 in northeastern China. The group was
 charged with supporting the "gang of
 four" and with obstructing the nationwide
 campaign to root out their followers. The
 Liaoning officials had ties with Chen
 Hsi-lien and also with the discredited
 nephew of Mao Tse-tung.
 The new leaders in Peking evidently felt
 confident that other troubled provinces
 are sufficiently under control to permit
 them to move against the important
 leftists in Liaoning.

 NORTH KOREA-CHINA
 China and North Korea signed a trade
 agreement this month that covers trade in
 "major commodities" from 1977 to 1981.
 No details are available yet on the pact,
 which updates a similar agreement for the
 period 1971 to 1976. North Korea im-
 ports coking coal and petroleum products
 from China and exports iron ore,
 anthracite coal, and machinery to China.
 North Korea's continuing foreign debt
 problem has increased its dependence on
 China and the USSR. Both the Chinese
 and the Soviets appear anxious to avoid
 any increased tensions on the Korean
 peninsula and use trade and economic and
 military assistance to maintain their in-
 fluence in Pyongyang. In recent years,
 China has been more responsive to North
 Korean needs than have the Soviets.
 Moscow signed its most recent
 five-year trade agreement with North
 Korea about a year ago. It called for a
 40-percent increase over the previous
 period, but official Soviet trade statistics
 indicate that as of last September North
 Korean exports were well below expected
 levels. Pyongyang may have been divert-
 ing some of the exports to hard-currency
 importers to alleviate its debt problem.
 In January, a high-level North Korean
 delegation went to Moscow to resolve out-
 standing economic problems, and a new
 trade protocol for 1977 was signed shortly
 after the visit. The protocol may have
 projected lower trade levels based on a
 more realistic appraisal of the North
 Koreans' capability to meet export com-
 mitments
 PALESTINIANS
 l"
 The Palestine National Council-the
 policy-making parliamentary body of the
 Palestine   Liberation Organization
 -concluded a 10-day meeting in Cairo
 President Sadat (r) and Yasir Arafat at the meeting of the Palestine
 National Council last week             A _{e
 on March 20; the council last met in
 1974. The recent session produced no
 dramatic changes in Palestinian policy,
 but PLO chief Yasir Arafat apparently
 strengthened his political position.
 Some 290 representatives of various
 Palestinian groups attended as delegates,
 an increase of about 90 over the council's
 membership in 1974. The enlargement in
 part reflects an effort by Syria, Egypt,
 and other moderate Arab states to get the
 council to follow a line that would help
 facilitate the negotiations with Israel
 desired by the moderate Arabs. Arafat
 apparently resisted attempts to dilute his
 influence in the council by an even larger
 expansion.
 Arafat remained largely in control
 throughout the session and was easily
 re-elected as head of the PLO Executive
 Committee. The committee reportedly
 was given a relatively free hand to pursue
 a flexible strategy toward future peace
 negotiations.
 The delegates did not modify the
 hard-line  Palestine  National
 Convenant-which, among other things,
 calls for dismantling the state of
 Israel-and they again rejected concilia-
 tion with or recognition of Israel. A
 political declaration issued by the council
 does not, however, directly call for the
 destruction of the Jewish state nor refer to
 the secular democratic state concept that
 is anathema to the Israelis. Instead, the
 document mentions an "independent
 national state" on Palestinian
 soil-phrasing sufficiently vague to be
 open to several interpretations.
 Such wording appears designed to
 avoid even more serious splits between
 Palestinian moderates and hard liners and
 to allow Palestinian leaders maximum
 flexibility during the negotiating period
 ahead. The declaration probably was not
 as conciliatory as Egypt, and perhaps
 Syria, would have liked. In a meeting
 with Arafat after the council meeting,
 Egyptian President Sadat criticized the
 council for "showmanship" and "slogan-
 eering."
 This suggests that the influence of these
 two states over Arafat is not as great as
 they believed and that Arafat still must
 make concessions to the more militant
 Palestinians in order to preserve a
 semblance of unity in the movement. The
 declaration, for example, makes no
 specific reference to the establishment of
 links between the PLO and Jordan, an
 idea that Sadat has strongly advocated in

 ZAIRE  2 2 - 2
 The former Katangan soldiers who in-
 vaded southern Zaire from their exile
 bases in neighboring Angola two weeks
 ago remain in control of parts of their
 tribal homeland in Shaba Region.
 Government forces have little chance of
 dislodging the Katangans in the near
 future, and President Mobutu's regime, if
 it survives, faces the prospect of a long
 and costly counterinsurgency effort.
 There was apparently little fighting
 during the past week between government
 troops and the intruders, who the Zairian
 military estimates number between 1,500
 and 2,000 men. Heavy rain at times
 helped slow things down, although the
 Katangans do not appear to be in any
 hurry to extend their area of control, and
 the Zairian armed forces are still hobbled
 by fuel shortages, logistic and com-
 munica-tions problems, poor intelligence,
 and low morale among the troops.
 The main concentrations of invaders
 appear to be at Dilolo, Kasaji, Kisenge,
 and Sandoa. The Katangans are employ-
 ingguerrilla tactics; they move mostly at
 night and set up ambushes. They are
 veterans of such warfare and sharpened
 Iu, q ,.nWka
 their skills during the Angolan civil war
 by helping Agostinho Neto's ultimately
 victorious Popular Movement. The
 Katangans also arrived in Shaba well
 armed and well equipped, and they appear
 to be taking care to preserve their supply
 lines back to Angola.
 The ultimate aim of the Katangans is
 still unclear. "Liberation" of their home
 region from Mobutu's control is surely a
 primary goal shared by soldiers and
 leaders alike. Beyond that, some of the
 returned exiles may favor another
 regional secession attempt while others
 are out to overthrow Mobutu and gain
 control of all of Zaire. A Paris-based
 political organization that claims to speak
 for the invaders-the Congolese National
 Liberation Front-has said the goal is to
 topple Mobutu.
 Mobutu, for his part, is continuing to
 send additional troops to Shaba, and his
 commanders presumably plan eventually
 to undertake more extensive offensive
 operations against the Katangans. The
 main buildup points are Kamina, where
 there is a major military base, and
 Kolwezi, a vital industrial center. So far, a
 total of about 3,000 Zairian troops have
 been sent to Shaba since the invasion
 President Mobutu
 began on March 8.
 The hard-pressed Zairian,- President,
 who has been seeking diplomatic support
 from other African leaders, seems to have
 won a sympathetic hearing from the
 Nigerian government, which has been a
 strong supporter of Neto's regime. The
 Nigerians, who have vivid memories of
 their own war against Biafran
 secessionists, agreed last week to try to
 mediate the dispute between Zaire and
 Angola that underlies the Katangans' at-
 tack. This week, the Lagos government
 issued a public statement calling on both

 Power Rivalry Quickens in the Red Sea Area
 South Yemen, Somalia, and Ethiopia. He
 went on to visit several of the southern
 African states on the "front line" of the
 Rhodesian conflict.
 In addition to strengthening bilateral
 links between Havana and Tripoli, Castro
 and Libyan leader Qadhafi probably dis-
 cussed aiding Ethiopia. During his visit to
 Ethiopia Castro apparently offered to
 mediate between the Ethiopians and
 Somalis, who have long been at odds. He
 reportedly proposed an alliance among
 Ethiopia, Somalia, South Yemen, and an
 independent French Territory of the Afars
 and Issas.
 Ethiopian leader Mengistu endorsed
 this proposal in an interview with the
 Cuban press; he said he envisaged the
 alliance as an "anti-imperialist front"
 to counter Arab assistance to the Erit-
 rean secessionist movement on Ethiopia's
 Red Sea coast. The Somalis, however,
 have shown little interest in improv-
 ing relations with Ethiopia, where they
 have territorial claims and are support-

 Castro was in Somalia and South
 Yemen just before his visit to Ethiopia.
 He may have tried to dissuade the South
 Yemenis and Somalis from turning to
 Saudi Arabia and other wealthy oil states
 for badly needed economic assistance.
 The Saudis are already giving economic
 aid to South Yemen and are considering
 giving Somalia up to $300 million in an
 effort to reduce its dependence on the
 Soviets.
 Cuba, for its part, has maintained a
 limited presence in Somalia for a number
 of years. Between 200 and 300 Cuban ad-
 visers provide paramilitary training for
 the Somali militia and also have trained
 Somali and other guerrillas for operations
 in Ethiopia and possibly the FTAI. A
 handful of Cuban technicians staff Somali
 agricultural and technical assistance
 programs. The Cubans aid South Yemen
 on a comparable scale.
 Competition between Marxist countries
 and moderate Arab states for influence in
 the Red Sea region has intensified in re-
 cent weeks. Both sides appear to be pay-
 ing particular attention to the leftist
 regime in Somalia, which has long been
 pro-Soviet.
 Cuban President Fidel Castro has been
 touring Africa since March 1. One of
 his main objectives on the trip has been
 to promote closer ties between leftist
 countries near the Red Sea, particu-
 larly  Somalia  and  Ethiopia.  Presi-
 dent Numayri of Sudan, with Saudi Ara-
 bian and other Arab backing, has been
 working at the same time to entice
 both Somalia and South Yemen away
 from the Soviet orbit and into the
 moderate Arab camp. There are signs
 that this Arab effort may be having
 some success.

 Sudan's Numayri visited Somalia and
 South Yemen last week in preparation for
 a summit meeting in North Yemen this
 week: that included the leaders of all four
 countries. The purpose of the summit was
 to discuss the security of the Red Sea
 region. Numayri is seeking to persuade
 the South Yemenis, and particularly the
 Somalis, to limit Soviet and leftist in-
 fluence in the region.
 The sumthit invitation presented the
 Somalis with a clear-cut choice. By not
 attending, President Siad would have
 risked further isolating Somalia from its
 Arab neighbors. Turning his back on the
 efforts of Sudan and other moderate,
 pro-Western Arab states to turn the Red
 Sea into an "Arab lake"  also would
 jeopardize his hopes for Arab economic
 assistance. Attending the summit, on the
 other hand, carried a risk of offending
 Somalia's Soviet benefactors.
 Siad made a last-minute decision to
 participate in the summit after reportedly
 receiving another plea from Numayri.
 The Somali President's attendance was a
 signal to the Soviets that he disapproves
 of their growing ties with Ethiopia and
 that Somalia has other friends. It may
 CONGO
 The 11-man military committee that
 assumed power after the assassination of
 President Ngouabi late last week has
 moved quickly to assert its control. The
 country is tribally and ideologically divid-
 ed, however, and may be headed for
 another period of protracted turmoil.
 Ngouabi, a northerner, had been in
 power since 1968, when he led a military
 coup that ousted President Massamba-
 Debat, a southerner. In recent months,
 Ngouabi's standing had eroded becauseof
 his failure to come to grips with the coun-
 try's steadily deteriorating economic
 situation; he had even come under open
 criticism from some members of the
 government.
 The new junta reportedly includes
 Ngouabi's top military associates. Most
 of them are believed to be northerners like
 Ngouabi, and they are unlikely to deviate
 from the leftist course charted by the
 assassinated leader. Specific members
 of the military committee have not
 been publicly identified.
 The junta is apparently determined to
 deal harshly with suspected plotters even
 though such action risks exacerbating the
 country's deeply rooted tribal and
 regional tensions. The archbishop of
 Brazzaville, a southerner who was ar-
 rested last week as was Massamba-
 Debat, reportedly died while being in-
 terrogated by the committee; officially in-
 spired press reports have stated that he
 was killed by relatives of Ngouabi. Radio
 Brazzaville has announced that Massam-

 assassination plot, and he too may have

 USSR
 An official of the USSR State Planning
 Committee (Gosplan) recently confirmed
 that the Soviet government does not plan
 to publish a detailed book on its tenth
 five-year plan, which began last year and
 runs through 1980. Gosplan published the
 detailed version of the ninth five-year plan
 in 1972.
 The official asserted that Gosplan
 specialists are all occupied with drafting
 the 15-year plan for 1976 to 1990. An-
 other reason for the Soviets' unwilling-
 ness to publish the current plan may be
 the economic difficulties the country
 has been having.
 The official stated that economic data
 relating to the five-year plan could be ob-
 tained from articles published in the
 Soviet press. He added that perhaps too
 much economic information is now
 published in Soviet journals, suggesting
 that in the future less may be revealed in
 these sources as well.
 The official also said the 15-year plan
 was being redrafted to take account of
 Soviet "successes and failures" in 1976
 UNITED NATIONS 6
 A meeting that had been scheduled by
 the UN Conference on Trade and
 Development to focus on problems of the
 world's 29 least developed countries got
 caught up in the Arab-Israeli dispute last
 week with the result that the secretary
 general of UNCTAD canceled the
 meeting. The episode illustrates the dif-
 and is scheduled to be finished in May for
 internal Soviet discussion. He did not say
 whether the final version would be made
 public.
 Another official in the same Gosplan
 department commented that present dif-
 ficulties between the US and the USSR
 are causing many complications for him
 in dealing with US trade in the 15-year
 plan.
 The USSR had hoped to draw heavily
 on US equipment, technology, and credits
 in developing natural resources. General
 agreements had been signed with US
 firms for multibillion-dollar natural gas
 projects in eastern and western Siberia.
 The restrictions on US Eximbank lending
 and the subsequent Soviet decision not to
 implement the US-USSR trade agree-
 ment, however, have significantly reduced
 the chances of obtaining US participation
 in such projects.
 POLAND
 Poland is reportedly considering
 membership in the World Bank and the
 International Monetary Fund. Most com-
 munist countries have not joined these
 "capitalist" institutions largely because of
 the financial disclosures and other IMF
 faculties the developing countries as a
 group face in trying to integrate their
 varied economic and political objectives.
 The 29 countries whose problems were
 to have been considered were, of course,
 disappointed at the cancellation, but so
 far they have not voiced any criticism
 publicly. They are likely to place much of
 the blame on Arab nations, because Arab
 insistence that Israel be excluded from the
 meeting was the immediate cause of the
 cancellation.
 It was the UNCTAD secretariat's
 desire to have East European countries at-
 tend the meeting that started the im-
 broglio, however. The secretariat has
 requirements.
 Poland produces for export the kind of
 electric power generating equipment,
 sugar beet refining plants, and textile
 machinery that are in demand in the
 developing countries. The Poles are now
 excluded from participating in projects
 sponsored by the UN's development
 organization and funded by the World
 Bank because, under the bank's rules,
 bidders must be from member countries.
 To gain membership in the World Bank a
 country first has to join the International
 Monetary Fund.
 Membership in the IMF is probably
 also attractive to the Poles because of the
 balance-of-payments assistance the IMF
 offers to members. With this assistance,
 Poland would gain additional flexibility in
 dealing with its burgeoning hard-currency
 problems. Last year, Poland had a record
 $3.3-billion trade deficit with the
 developed West, and its total hard-curren-
 cy indebtedness reached $10.2 billion. By
 the end of 1976, Poland's debt-service
 ratio was almost 50 percent.
 Yugoslavia, Romania, Cuba, and Viet-
 nam are the only communist members of
 the two international financial in-
 stitutions. Cuba's membership predates
 its communist government; Vietnam took
 over the seat formerly held by South Viet-
 pressed the East Europeans to do more to
 help the developing countries and as an in-
 ducement reduced the level of aid
 donations required to qualify for atten-
 dance at the meeting.
 Israel, which has donated more aid to
 poor nations than several of the com-
 munist nations, qualified and accepted an
 invitation to attend. The Arabs threatened
 to challenge Israel's attendance or
 boycott the meeting unless the invitation
 to Israel was withdrawn. Caught between
 the Arabs' refusal to back down and
 Israel's refusal to withdraw, the secretary
 general postponed the meeting indefinite-

 The recent French municipal elections reflected the in-

 vulnerabilities of the ruling center-right parties, and the grow-
 ing challenge to President Giscard by Gaullist leader Chirac.

 France: Elections Show Leftist Gains
 The French municipal elections, which
 were completed last weekend, reinforced
 significant trends in the nation's politics.
 ? The Communist-Socialist alliance
 increased in strength; nationwide it
 won 52 percent of the vote, and the
 center-right coalition won 46 percent.
 ? President Giscard's political
 weakness was highlighted, as was that
 of his centrist and Gaullist allies.
 ? Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac's
 challenge to Giscard was heightened
 by Chirac's success in Paris.
 ? The governing coalition's losses
 nationwide showed that it will be
 vulnerable in the legislative election
 next March.
 In the run-off elections on March 20,
 the Communist-Socialist alliance won 28
 more cities from the center-right, giving
 the leftists control of more than 70 per-
 cent of the 221 municipalities with pop-
 ulations over 30,000. The governing coali-
 tion lost 60 cities that it had controlled.
 A majority of the newly elected mayors
 are Socialists, but Communist mayors
 will take over at least 20 municipali-
 ties, adding to the 50 they already con-
 trolled.
 In  Paris,  Gaullist  leader  Chirac
 emerged with a solid majority on the city
 council. Chirac, along with the other
 newly elected mayors, is to be installed
 in the mayoral post within two weeks of
 the Match 20 election. President Gis-
 card's hand-picked candidate for mayor
 of Paris, Michel d'Ornano, failed to win
 election to the city council, a blow
 to Giscard's personal prestige.

 concentrate on gaining the support it
 needs to win the 1978 legislative election.
 The left must win approximately 53
 percent of the vote to overcome ger-
 rymandering and gain control of the
 National Assembly in 1978. .The results of
 the municipal elections, although not
 directly comparable to balloting for the
 national legislature, show the left drawing
 closer to its goal and have given it a strong
 psychological boost.
 Comparative analyses of French
 economic conditions and voting trends in-
 dicate that the left's electoral gains since
 1962 have resulted from popular discon-
 tent with gaps in a generally prosperous
 system. Voter concern about high infla-
 tion and unemployment appears to
 strengthen the left's chances for 1978.
 Rising per capita income is also helping
 the left by reducing public concern about
 the possible economic consequences of
 a leftist victory.
 The  government's  austerity
 measures-the Barre plan-are designed
 to limit inflation at the cost of some
 reduced economic growth, but they may
 not be enough to preserve the right's hold
 on the assembly. An extrapolation of
 economic and voting trends since 1962 in-
 dicates the left could win about 54 percent
 of the first-round vote next March.
 Right's Weaknesses
 Although opinion polls in France have
 been pointing for some time to the possi-
 bility of a victory for the left in 1978,
 that prospect has not had the unifying
 effect on the right that the hope of gain-
 ing power has had on the left. The govern-
 ing majority-Gaullists, Independent Re-
 publicans, and centrists-is riven by ideo-
 logical, strategic, and personal differ-
 ences, many of which focus on attitudes
 toward the left. These problems have
 come to a head in the rivalry between
 Giscard and Chirac.
 Giscard apparently realizes that there is
 no immediate chance of success for his
 long-standing hope of forming a coalition
 government that would include moderate
 leftists. But he wants the 1978 campaign
 run on a reform platform-under the
 leadership of popular, nonpartisan Prime
 Minister Barre-that will not foreclose
 that option, The President reportedly
 believes he would gain something by
 working with a leftist government should
 the Communist-Socialist alliance win
 next year.
 Giscard hopes to blur party lines and
 significantly weaken the Gaullists. The
 President's failure to provide effective
 leadership, his relatively weak political
 base, his lack of personal popularity, and
 the conservative image of his Independent
 Republican Party make it difficult to
 achieve these goals.
 Chirac, on the other hand, wants to
 preserve and increase Gaullist
 power-and his own. He believes the
 government's only hope of success in 1978
 rests on a hard-hitting anti-left campaign
 under his leadership. While Chirac might
 advocate reforms if he were in power, he
 clearly believes that Giscard's platform
 now is only encouraging votes for the left.
 These ideological and strategic
 differences have been compounded by the
 personal confrontation between `the two
 men, in which each sees the other as
 responsible for the coalition's problems.
 The final shape of the city government in
 Paris will give some early indication of
 whether the two sides will be able to
 moderate their hostility; Chirac may
 prove willing to give the Giscard forces a
 meaningful role when he allocates
 municipal responsibilities.
 Both Giscard and Chirac
 agree there should not be
 national election. Chirac has
 probably
 an early
 let it be
 known that he will not direct Gaullist
 deputies to withdraw their support for the
 President in the assembly over the next
 year. The Gaullists need time to try to
 limit their expected losses in 1978.
 Giscard, for his part, expects that the con-
 tinued application of the Barre plan will
 strengthen the chances of his majority and
 especially those of his supporters.
 If Giscard and Chirac cannot control
 their rivalry, the coalition will face a very
 difficult time in the legislative election,
 and the government will be increasingly
 vulnerable to the left and to the Gaullists.

 The recession in Rhodesia, which is being aggravated by
 military demands on the economy, is expected to continue.
 I   qq
 Eroding confidence in the political
 future of Rhodesia on the part of white
 business interests and growing military
 drains on the economy probably will
 result in a third consecutive year with no
 economic growth. Economic pressures
 have been an important factor in Prime
 Minister Smith's attempt to achieve an
 accommodation with blacks willing to
 cooperate with his regime.
 The Rhodesian economy has-been hurt
 during the past two years by rising defense
 spending and inflation, high transport
 costs, white labor shortages, and, until
 recently, sagging exports. Manufacturing
 output, which accounts for about 25 per-
 cent of gross national product, is at its
 lowest. point in four years.
 Construction, both commercial and
 residential, has dropped off drastically,
 and there has been only very slight growth
 in agriculture.
 Mining is the only bright spot in the
 economy this year; production is up one
 third because of increased prices for
 mineral exports and the opening of new
 nickel and gold mines. Repeal of the Byrd
 Amendment by the US Congress will
 have little effect on these exports. All of
 Rhodesia's foreign sales transit South
 Africa and can be mixed with similar
 South African products.
 Military demands brought on by the
 growing guerrilla threat have deepened
 the recession. Budgeted expenditures for
 the military and police have more than
 tripled since fiscal year 1973; at $250
 million this year, they now account for
 Rhodesia: Economic Pressures
 one fourth of total government spending.
 Foreign exchange allocations for non-
 military needs-fuel, raw materials, and
 consumer and capital goods-have been
 cut sharply to make funds available for
 arms purchases, and this will have to con-
 tinue. The government has been forced to
 raise taxes and freeze government wages
 to finance military expenditures and hold
 down budget deficits.
 Increased transport costs-up an es-
 timated 50 percent since Mozambique
 closed its border to Rhodesian rail traffic
 a year ago- have used up more foreign
 exchange. The closure forced Rhodesia to
 reroute its foreign trade over longer
 routes through South Africa.
 Impact on Living Standards
 So far, the recession has not seriously
 disrupted the life style of the 278,000
 whites in Rhodesia. Supplies of food,
 shelter, and medicines have been un-
 affected. Declines in retail sales of other
 commodities probably reflect consumer
 caution more than shortages. Restricted
 auto travel because of gasoline rationing
 and guerrilla activity is the main in-
 convenience.
 Most whites remain in Rhodesia
 because of deep roots in the country and
 stringent limits on the amount of capital
 they can take out-reportedly $1,600 per
 family plus personal property. Of those
 who do leave, many are probably Por-
 tuguese who fledto Rhodesia in 1975 to
 escape black takeovers in Angola and
 Mozambique. A net outflow in 1976, the
 first in more than a decade, was due as
 much to a slowdown in immigration as to
 an increase in departures of Rhodesian
 citizens.
 10    WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Most troubling to the whites has been
 their heavy military obligation. All eligi-
 ble Rhodesians under 38 years of age
 must serve a three-month tour of active
 duty each year. Recent proposals to dou-
 ble the active duty stint and to tighten call-
 up and deferment procedures brought
 strong resistance from businessmen and
 the resignation of the minister of defense.
 Business not only is losing key employees
 but also must make up the differences
 between the low military pay and normal
 salaries.
 The uncertainty of whites over their
 future in Rhodesia is causing them to
 postpone investment and spending
 decisions. Foreign lenders and investors
 are also wary of committing funds in
 Rhodesia.
 The impact of economic problems on
 blacks has been mixed. Even in good
 times, less than I million of the country's
 2.5 million black workers are able to find
 work other than subsistence farming.
 They have borne the brunt of increased
 unemployment during the recession.
 On the positive side, some blacks are
 being hired to fill vacancies created by
 white military obligations. Blacks are be-
 ing trained and employed in office work
 and in technical trades.
 In addition, as a result of the recent
 repeal of some racial discrimination laws
 in a move to attract black political sup-
 port, blacks now are legally able to
 purchase land formerly reserved for
 whites. The practical effect of this change
 is likely to be small, however, because of
 the limited credit available to blacks for
 purchasing land.

 A campaign for important posts in the country's only
 political party has taken on a new sense of urgency as the
 President's health continues to deteriorate.
 As President Kenyatta's health con-
 tinues to decline, maneuvering among
 those who aspire to succeed him and their
 supporters is accelerating. At this time,
 the rival factions still appear inclined to
 keep their activities within constitutional
 limits. They are currently focused on elec-
 tions scheduled for April 3 in the coun-
 try's only political party, the Kenya
 Africa National Union.
 Should Kenyatta die or be medically
 certified as incapacitated, Vice President
 Moi would assume the presidency for 90
 days under the terms of the constitution.
 Several months ago, Moi-a member of
 the small Kalenjin tribal group-beat
 back a campaign by his opponents to
 divest him of this constitutional role. His
 adversaries include members of Kenyat-
 ta's inner circle who are determined to
 maintain the powerful position of their
 southern branch of the Kikuyu tribe,
 Kenya's largest, after Kenyatta dies.
 In recent months, Moi's opponents
 have switched their efforts and are now
 trying to secure a dominant position in the
 Kenya Africa National Union in an effort
 to prevent Moi, should he become interim
 president, from gaining control of the par-
 ty structure.
 Kenya: Succession Politics
 Under the constitution, an election
 must be held during the 90-day period
 after a vice president succeeds, provided
 at least two presidential candidates are
 nominated by different political parties.
 In the absence of another party, the can-
 didate from the National Union would be
 declared the elected president.
 In a further effort to undercut Moi, his
 rivals last year prevailed on Kenyatta to
 revitalize the moribund party by holding
 elections. They were held at the local level
 late last year, and Moi and his supporters
 held their own in that balloting. Senior
 party officials are to be selected on April
 3.
 The southern Kikuyu clique is han-
 dicapped in this election by its lack of
 many popular leaders other than Kenyat-
 ta. The situation is further complicated by
 a long-standing split between the southern
 and northern branches of the tribe.
 At present, the southern Kikuyu appear
 willing to concede the party vice presiden-
 cy to Moi, and are concentrating on try-
 ing to put Kikuyu tribal members or their
 allies into other top party jobs. So far,

 The Kikuyu insiders are focusing par-

 the national chairmanship, the third-
 ranking party job. The post is new and its
 duties are vague. An aggressive chairman,
 or one with aggressive backers, could

 One of the most contentious issues in the Law of the Sea

 realizes Kibaki's ascendancy could ensure

 to stabilize the political scene.
 More developments are in store before

 ~t b Law of the Sea: Seabed Mining Issues
 Recent informal discussions in Geneva
 among participants in the UN Law of the
 Sea Conference indicate that the
 developed and the developing countries
 remain sharply divided on the issue of
 deep seabed mining.
 The seabed mining issue has been one
 of the most contentious in the
 negotiations that began in 1973 for a new
 Law of the Sea treaty. The impasse on the
 subject is now effectively stalling the con-
 clusion of a treaty, which the conference
 participants agreed at the outset would be
 a package arrangement. Progress has
 been achieved on most other conference
 topics, including the territorial sea, the
 economic zone concept, and passage
 through straits.
 The Geneva meeting was called to seek
 compromises on such questions as access
 to the seabed, financing of the proposed
 Minister Kibaki, a northerner, are run-
 ning for the new post. It is unclear which
 candidate will eventually receive full
 Kikuyu backing, although it appears that
 Kibaki has been given at least a
 preliminary nod, while Gichuru's can-
 didacy was self-initiated.
 Kibaki is considered to be one of the
 outstanding members of the cabinet.
 Although he has reportedly been linked to
 Moi, he generally has avoided politics. As
 a result, he probably is one of the few
 Kikuyus who could generate support
 among both branches of the group. The
 international machinery for seabed ex-
 ploitation, and controls on production of
 seabed minerals before the next formal
 session of the full Law of the Sea con-
 ference in May.
 The developing countries argue that the
 seabed and its mineral nodules are the
 "common heritage of mankind" and that
 any financial benefits from their mining
 should belong to all people, primarily the
 needier nations. The developing countries
 have argued that an international authori-
 ty with broad and discretionary powers
 should be set up to supervise seabed
 development and eventually to exploit the
 seabed exclusively through its own mining
 entity.
 The demand for exclusive seabed ex-
 ploitation by the proposed international
 body is at the center of the dispute. The
 major industrialized states, which alone
 possess the technology to mine seabed
 nodules, insist that any treaty contain ex-
 plicit assurances that both states and their
 nationals and corporations-public and
 private-will have equal opportunities to
 exploit the seabed's resources.
 The developed states argue that they
 have already granted a major concession
 to developing-country demands by
 proposing a "banking system." Under
 this proposal, a mining entity would apply
 to the international authority for the right
 to mine two tracts; the authority would
 decide which one of the two the mining
 entity could exploit and reserve the second
 tract for its own mining activities.
 The developing countries do not accept
 the banking system as a sufficient com-
 promise. Most developing countries
 recognize that, at least for the short term,
 the financial and technological resources
 of the developed states are indispensable
 to seabed mining. The developing states

 continue to insist, however, that there can
 be no automatic guarantee of access for
 private entities and that any parallel ac-
 cess-if some form is eventually worked
 out-would  only be on an interim
 basis, probably from 20 to 25 years.
 Developing-country demands are ac-
 celerating on other aspects of the seabed
 mining issue as well. Most 'conference
 participants have informally accepted the
 principle of limiting seabed production of
 nickel to a portion of the growth in world
 demand for the mineral.
 At the Geneva meeting, however, some
 leading developing states wanted to im-
 pose explicit production limits for all
 nodule minerals-copper,  cobalt,
 manganese, and nickel. These production
 limits, moreover, would remain in effect
 until  comprehensive   commodity
 agreements on all these minerals are
 worked out internationally.
 The recent Geneva meetings reflected
 the willingness of the participants to work
 toward some resolution, even if positions
 remain far apart. The meetings also in-
 dicate, however, that the longer the sea-
 bed mining issues remain unsettled, the
 stronger the motivation will become for
 the developing states to link limited objec-
 tives in the Law of the Sea negotiations to
 the broader question of a readjusted

 Countries in Western Europe with large civil aircraft in-
 dustries are striving to be in a position to obtain a larger share
 of the expanded market expected in the early 1980s for short-
 and medium-range aircraft.
 q 2j Western Europe: Civil Aircraft Programs
 West European countries with large
 civil aircraft industries-the UK, France,
 West Germany, and the Netherlands-
 are searching for programs that will
 provide new employment opportunities
 and earn them a substantial share in the
 lucrative market for short- to medium-
 range aircraft that is likely in the early
 1980s.
 By then the aging Caravelles, Tridents,
 BAC-1l Is, and Boeing 727s that now fly
 the world airways will have to be replaced.
 About 2,300 new aircraft will be needed
 during the 1980s-about half in the US
 where domestic manufacturers have
 traditionally controlled the market, and

 most of the remainder in Europe where
 US manufacturers have had a four-to-one
 advantage in aircraft sales.
 By pushing for participation in the
 short- to medium-range aircraft market,
 the West European countries hope to
 reverse the decade-long decline in their
 share of Western civil aircraft sales.
 The major uncertainty is when this
 market will blossom. At first, it was ex-
 pected by 1978 or 1979. Current es-
 timates-which cite the slowdown in
 passenger traffic growth in recent years
 and the poor debt-to-equity ratios of
 many airlines-indicate that the market
 demand will increase in the early 1980s.
 For most of the past two years, the
 West Europeans have held regional
 negotiations on potential aircraft to serve
 this prospective market. In the past six
 month:;, however, European manufac-
 turers have turned more to negotiations
 with US companies for joint ventures.
 Many of the recent design proposals
 have been developed jointly by one or
 more European manufacturers and a US
 manufacturer. Aircraft designs now under
 consideration that involve or could in-
 volve some European participation in-
 clude:
 ? Vlercure 200. A program that
 may include the French firms
 Aerospatiale and Dassault, and the US
 McDonnell Douglas Corporation; it
 could be a first in transatlantic
 cooperation in civil aircraft produc-
 tion. The plane would have a 160-
 passenger capacity and a range of
 1,700 nautical miles.
 ? Boeing 7N7. This "family" of
 proposed  aircraft includes a  160-
 passenger version with an improved
 wing design and either CFM-56 or
 JT1OD engines. It would have a range
 of 1,800 nautical miles. This design, if
 built, would probably involve a
 program of international cooperation.
 ? A300 BIO. Still in an evolutionary
 design stage, this plane, which would
 be built by a European consortium,
 would probably have a range of 2,200
 nautical miles and a capacity for 200
 passengers-well above the projected
 range and capacity of the proposed
 Mercure 200.
 ? DC-X-200. This US design is un-
 likely to be produced if the proposed
 Mercure soon becomes a reality. Ten-
 tative specifications call for a plane
 with a capacity for 200 passengers and
 a range of 2,500 nautical miles.
 ? Boeing 7X7. This is a tentative
 US program with Italian and Japanese
 participation. The short-range version
 of this aircraft (2,700 nautical miles)
 could garner part of the short- to
 medium-range market.
 The French Contribution
 Pressured in part by layoffs caused by
 the near completion of the current Con-
 corde production run, the French govern-
 ment recently announced the program
 linking the US McDonnell Douglas Cor-
 poration with France's aircraft industry in
 development of the Mercure 200. Par-
 ticipation by the American company is
 dependent on a final assessment of the
 potential demand for the proposed air-
 craft. The result of the market survey is
 scheduled for release in the spring but
 could be delayed until the fall.
 The tentative accord calls for the
 French government-owned Aerospatiale
 to perform 40 percent of the work,
 Dassault-Breguet-a  private  French
 firm-to handle 5 percent, and
 McDonnell Douglas to handle 15 percent.
 The remaining 40 percent would be
 allocated among other West European
 manufacturers.
 Early indications are that the Mercure
 200, now also known as the advanced
 short-  to  medium-range  commercial
 transport, is not being as favorably re-
 ceived as its backers had hoped. Some
 airline executives are concerned that the
 aircraft is too small for the projected
 market, while others favor a tri-jet
 over the twin-engine design.
 Despite questions of salability, the
 French might decide to go forward with
 the Mercure 200 even without McDonnell
 Douglas for two reasons: they need a
 program to increase employment in the
 aerospace industry, and they need a vehi-
 cle for the CFM-56 engine, a joint
 development of a French firm and
 General Electric.
 Six CFM-56 engines are now in testing
 programs in the US and France, and cer-
 tification requirements will probably be
 completed in 1979. The French consider
 the CFM-56 program a major step to-
 ward international aviation cooperation.
 The British Role
 The British aircraft industry, which
 employs more than 200,000 workers, has
 suffered layoffs resulting from the phasing
 out of the Concorde program and indeci-
 sion over nationalization. Civil aviation
 officials are attempting to ensure that the
 industry will participate in the future
 market for short- to medium-range air-
 craft.
 British aviation officials have been
 holding preliminary discussions with US
 companies such as Boeing and McDonnell
 Douglas. Talks thus far have focused on
 participation in McDonnell Douglas'
 DC-X-200 and Boeing's 7N7 programs.
 West Germany and the Netherlands,
 with 50,000 people in their aerospace in-
 dustries, also have hopes of participating
 in the short- to medium-range aircraft
 market. They are pressing their European
 partners to move forward with the A300
 B10 program, even as they hold talks with
 Boeing over participation in the 7N7 and
 7X7 programs. Both countries remain
 cautious in their commitments.
 Given escalating costs and the need for
 aircraft with improved operating
 economy and quieter, cleaner burning
 engines, the major West European
 manufacturers will attach increasing im-
 portance to their negotiations with US
 companies over the next year or two.
 They will nevertheless retain the option
 of developing regionally produced air-
 craft. Because of the costly research and
 development involved and the difficulty in
 timing the market, such an effort would
 probably involve only consortium
 programs rather than aircraft produced
