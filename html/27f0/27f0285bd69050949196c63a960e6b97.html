 VIETNAM
 Vice President Ky's power base has eroded as a re-
 sult of dismissals, military resignations, and Ky's
 own seclusion.  This has contributed to an atmos-
 phere of growing crisis in Saigon.  The Paris talks
 remain on dead center, while in South Vietnam there
 are indications that the relative lull in hostili-
 ties may foreshadow a step-up in the tempo of fight-

 ISRAELI POWER STRUGGLE HEATS UP
 The unity of the Israeli Labor Party and of the gov-

 when Prime Minister Eshkol designated a new deputy
 prime minister--a surprise move aimed at blocking
 any attempt by Defense Minister Dayan to win control
 of the party and the government.
 SENEGAL DEALS WITH LABOR DEMANDS
 President Senghor has made some progress in coping
 with the deep-seated grievances that prompted labor
 participation in last month's antigovernment demon-
 strations.   His neglect of student demands, however,
 led to renewed student boycotts and the closing of
 all schools last week.

 Events last week disclosed no change in Hanoi's strategy of maintain-
 ing an inflexible stance in the Paris talks while pressing its primary
 objective of eroding the morale and authority of the Saigon government.
 Communist psychological warfare was highlighted by threats to hold the
 capital under daily bombardment for 100 days. Defense Minister Giap
 publicly characterized the current military situation as "one long battle of
 Dien Bien Phu" and Viet Cong propaganda is urging the South Vietnamese
 Army as well as police and civil servants to desert their posts "at this
 decisive moment."
 The pace of Communist military action in the past two weeks
 declined to the level that prevailed prior to the offensive in early May.
 The Communists, however, continued sporadic shelling of Saigon and
 directed heavy fire against Quang Tri city and allied bases along the
 Demilitarized Zone. They appear to be preparing for another coordinated
 offensive against Saigon to begin soon.
 This steady military and psychological pressure is being exerted
 against a background of seeming political disarray in Saigon. Vice Presi-
 dent Ky, whose position has been eroded by recent replacements and
 resignations, was obliged to issue a public denial of coup plotting and
 disunity in the leadership. Prime Minister Huong also denied disaffection
 in his cabinet but this did not still rumors that he has threatened to resign
 unless President Thieu coordinates more closely with him on appointments
 such as that of the controversial new mayor of Saigon.
 In China, continuing tension within the leadership was reflected in
 divergent lines in foreign policy and domestic affairs. Peking is making a
 deliberate effort to present a more moderate posture toward the outside
 world by reviving the pre - Cultural Revolution theme of the "five
 principles of peaceful coexistence" as the basis of its foreign policy. This
 line contrasts sharply with greater militancy in domestic propaganda aimed
 at arousing the "masses" against alleged enemies of the state and restoring
 the momentum of the Cultural Revolution.
 The five-nation Commonwealth defense conference in Kuala Lumpur
 last week scored a modest success in formulating guidelines for joint
 defense of Malaysia and Singapore through 1971, but the participants

 Evidence that Vice Presi-
 dent Ky's power base has eroded
 as a result of dismissals, mili-
 tary resignations, and Ky's own
 seclusion multiplied last week
 and contributed to an atmosphere
 of growing crisis in Saigon.   Al-
 though some of the resignations
 have not yet been acted on, Presi-
 dent Thieu may well be tempted to
 press his advantage and consoli-
 date his hold while Ky's support-
 ers remain disinclined to react
 forcibly.
 Ky, prompted by rumors of
 an irreparable breach between
 himself and Thieu and of coup
 plotting, declared on 17 June
 that a coup at this critical junc-
 ture would be unacceptable.   He
 explained in a nationwide tele-
 vision address that, although he
 was turning over his assignment
 as director of the People's Self-
 Defense Force to Prime Minister
 Huong, he was not abandoning his
 constitutional role as vice presi-
 dent, and he appealed for unity
 behind the government.
 Ky's public gesture has ap-
 parently done little to ease the
 underlying tension between him-
 self and Thieu.   Ky and his mili-
 tary associates probably remain
 deeply distrustful of Interior
 Minister Khiem's influence
 on Thieu and skeptical of the
 new Huong cabinet.  Huong himself
 has had to deny rumors of disaf-
 fection within his cabinet, but
 he has so far successfully weath-
 ered his first challenge by dis-
 missing Minister of State Phan
 Quang Dan for advocating direct
 talks with the National Libera-
 tion Front.
 Enemy shelling of Saigon,
 although diminished in recent
 days, has evoked some demands
 both for peace and for a step-
 up in the government's war ef-
 fort.  Pressure for a settlement
 has come primarily from leftist
 students but the moderate Bud-
 dhists have begun to talk of a
 peace campaign.  At the same
 time, however, many influential
 newspapers and assembly members
 are expressing dissatisfaction
 with the course of the Paris
 talks and with the partial bomb-
 ing halt, which leaves Hanoi im-
 mune to retaliation.
 There has been some criti-
 cism of the government's ina-
 bility to prevent attacks on Sai-
 gon.   The continuing enemy pres-
 sure and the government's moves
 to strengthen its local command,
 however, may have contributed to
 the relatively swift assembly
 passage last week of the general
 mobilization bill with all of
 the amendments proposed by Thieu
 to broaden its application.

 The War in the South
 Enemy military activity has
 declined during the past two weeks
 to the pace maintained in April
 just prior to the last Communist
 offensive.   It appears that the
 current lull may again foreshadow
 a major increase in the tempo of
 the fighting, especially in the
 Saigon area and in northern I
 Corps.
 Enemy propaganda during
 the past week has been promising
 an intensification of armed ac-
 tion in the capital--a line the
 Communists would probably not take
 if they did not intend to follow
 through with some spectacular new
 moves.   According to high-level
 prisoners an attack is planned
 for later this month using the
 North Vietnamese Army  (NVA)  7th
 Division as a spearhead force.
 It is clear from prisoner
 statements and captured documents
 that the Communists had planned
 to mount stronger ground pressure
 against Saigon during the past
 few weeks, but that allied spoil-
 ing operations inflicted heavy
 casualties before the enemy could
 get into position.   The surrender
 on 18 June of more than 100 troops
 from a Communist unit outside
 Saigon points up the enemy's dif-
 ficulty in keeping up the pres-
 sure.
 Several battalion-size for-
 mations from Viet Cong units that
 normally operate in the upper
 delta provinces have been engaged
 in the recent Saigon fighting.
 The shift of these forces north-
 ward is probably responsible to
 some extent for the slowdown in
 Communist action in the delta.
 Significant Communist mili-
 tary moves have also taken place
 in Quang Tri Province and in the
 area of the Demilitarized Zone
 (DMZ), apparently as part of
 preparations for a general in-
 tensification of pressure.  Pris-
 oner interrogations have now
 fairly well confirmed that at
 least two regiments of the NVA
 308th Division have moved into
 the Khe Sanh area.
 In addition,  there are in-
 dications of preparations for
 sustained offensive action across
 the zone.   Recent photography has
 revealed new road construction in
 the central DMZ area, suggesting
 plans to enlarge supply and troop
 infiltration terminals.  Parallel-
 ing this has been the employment
 of enemy helicopters in the
 area,  apparently in a logistic
 support role.
 Paris Talks
 The Paris talks remained
 on dead center this week with
 Hanoi refusing to discuss any

 reciprocity for a bombing halt.
 Hanoi Radio emphasized this hard
 line by denying Western press
 speculation that private deals
 on this issue were under considera-
 tion.
 In the ninth negotiating
 session in Paris,  the North Viet-
 namese deviated little from the
 harsh and propagandistic tone
 they have taken at previous meet-
 ings.   Xuan Thuy accused the US
 of creating "obstacles" that pre-
 vented progress, and claimed
 that the US had actually in-
 creased the number of air strikes
 against the North last month.
 He insisted that this pointed
 up Washington's  "lack of good
 faith," and asserted that Hanoi
 would not be pressured by calls
 for a resumption of the bombing
 of the entire North.
 North Vietnamese propaganda
 on the talks has continued to
 treat the fighting as a national
 war of independence and to justify
 Hanoi's right to support the
 South while not acknowledging
 any North Vietnamese Army pres-
 ence in the South.   Part of this
 effort was the resurrection of
 the Liberation Front's two-year-
 old threat to call in foreign
 Communist volunteers--a threat
 that was originally issued in
 1965 and has always been put for-
 ward as a conditional right.
 The new treatment preserves this
 condition and does not maintain
 that the call has been either
 issued or answered.

 POLICIES IN COMMUNIST CHINA MARKED BY DIVERGENT TRENDS
 The Chinese Communists are
 continuing their efforts to re-
 furbish Peking's image abroad by
 adopting a more reasonable public
 posture toward the outside world.
 This shift in tactics indicates
 that foreign policy is at least
 temporarily insulated from the
 political struggle and domestic
 confusion inside China.
 Chinese Posture Abroad
 Recent propaganda statements,
 which probably reflect a basic
 policy decision, have begun to
 stress moderate lines that have
 not been given emphasis since the
 Cultural Revolution erupted in
 1966.   This development has  fol-
 lowed a number of moves appar-
 ently calculated to repair dam-
 age done earlier to Chinese for-
 eign relations by "Red Guard"
 diplomacy.
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 illustrated Peking's new tacti-
 cal approach in a speech on 11
 June during the visit of the Ne-
 palese foreign minister in which
 he typified Sino-Nepalese rela-
 tions as "an example to friendship
 and good neighborliness between
 countries with different social
 systems."  Chen affirmed China's
 intentions to "promote the com-
 mon cause of the Afro-Asian peo-
 ples united against imperialism"
 by adhering to the "five princi-
 ples of peaceful coexistence."
 He emphasized that it was China

 Approved For Release 2007/03/06 : CIA-RDP79-00927A006500030001-9
 SECRET
 that "first initiated and carried
 out" these principles as the basis
 for its foreign relations.
 In his remarks, Chen betrayed
 increased concern over Moscow's
 efforts to isolate China even
 more.  He charged that "certain
 people," a clear reference to
 the Russians, are attempting to
 create a new anti-Chinese alli-
 ance by fabricating evidence of
 subversive activities abroad by
 Peking.
 This new line probably re-
 flects adherence to an "instruc-
 tion," attributed to Mao Tse-tung
 and issued on 29 May, ordering
 propaganda media to avoid all
 mention of China's influence on
 "international revolutionary
 movements."   In recent weeks, prop-
 aganda on Asian "armed struggles"
 has been sharply curtailed.
 Earlier, the emphasis was on the
 importance of relying on the
 thought of Mao as the fundamental
 guideline for "national libera-
 tion."
 The Chinese will probably
 seek to exploit the state visit
 by Tanzanian President Nyerere
 this week by highlighting Pe-
 king's friendly assistance to the
 "Afro-Asian world."   In recent
 months, a number of visiting Afri-
 can dignitaries have been given
 an effusive welcome by the Chi-
 nese and Peking has been devot-
 ing heavy propaganda coverage to
 its aid projects in Africa.
 Contentious Meetings in Peking
 25X1
 Chinese leaders
 are reported to have held an im-
 portant series of meetings during
 May.   They were supposedly attended

 MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE DEFENSE GUIDELINES FORMULATED
 The five-nation Commonwealth
 defense conference on 10-11 June
 in Kuala Lumpur achieved modest
 success in formulating guidelines
 for the joint defense of Malaysia-
 Singapore through 1971.   Specific
 military commitments after 1971,
 however, were studiously avoided.
 Britain emphasized its con-
 cern for the area by pointing to
 its promise to keep about 10,000
 military personnel there until
 the end of 1971.   It will, more-
 over, donate its facilities, ex-
 cept for such operational equip-
 ment as radars and missiles, which
 could be purchased.   The British
 also offered to provide advisory
 and training groups after 1971,
 and said they would bring in ele-
 ments of their own forces for
 training in the area after 1971.
 The conferees adopted a
 British suggestion to hold a ma-
 jor five-power military exercise
 in the area in 1970, and agreed
 in principle to hold additional
 exercises after 1971.   Such exer-
 cises presumably would demonstrate
 Britain's capacity to deploy its
 mobile forces.
 Australia and New Zealand
 agreed to keep forces in the area
 through 1971; Australia will main-
 25X6                tain two jet aircraft squadrons.
 For their part, Malaysia and
 Singapore affirmed their intention
 to cooperate closely in defense
 matters.   Singapore will build up
 a small air force and navy, and
 will cooperate with Malaysia in
 patrolling coastal waters.  Malay-
 sia will continue to base its navy
 in Singapore.
 A major point of contention
 at the meetings was the Malaysi-
 ans' initial insistence that the
 five powers assume joint responsi-
 bility for control of all bases
 and facilities, a stand they aban-
 doned after it was firmly rejected
 by Britain.   The conferees, how-
 ever, did agree to the concept of
 joint participation in an inte-
 grated air defense system.  Malay-
 sia hopes Australia will accept
 the military command position in
 this system.
 Specific defense arrangements
 are now to be worked out by three
 joint groups representing each of
 the military services.   Another
 ministerial-level conference is
 scheduled to meet in about a year.
 The success of these efforts will
 rest largely on the willingness
 of the leaders of Malaysia and
 Singapore to suppress their mutual
 suspicions and antagonisms.

 LAOTIAN POLITICAL ISSUES REVIVE
 Long-standing internal prob-
 lems are beginning to come to the
 surface again now that the rainy
 season has brought a decline in
 the fighting.
 The country may be faced
 with an unusually high budget in
 the coming fiscal year unless
 tax receipts from gold transac-
 tions, one of Vientiane's primary
 sources of revenue, increase sub-
 stantially or the government
 moves to increase other taxes.
 Gold imports have decreased sig-
 nificantly because of unsettled
 conditions in the world gold mar-
 ket.
 A large deficit would lead
 to inflation and might undermine
 US and other foreign support for
 the international currency sta-
 bilization fund in Laos.   Finance
 Minister Sisouk na Champassak is
 willing to make deep cuts in the
 military budget to maintain civil
 expenditures, but army leaders
 have made it clear that such a
 course is unacceptable.   Sisouk,
 who has been considered at times
 as Prime Minister Souvanna's heir
 apparent, has talked of quitting
 but a recent budgeting plan
 worked out with  US  assistance
 should ease the pressure on him.
 Meanwhile, the Paris talks
 have generated speculation over
 the possible return of the Com-
 munists to the government.   Prime
 Minister Souvanna has indicated
 that he will make a fresh effort
 to organize a broad-based politi-
 cal organization when he returns
 in early August from a six-week
 vacation in France.

 The East Germans are continuing to probe Western reaction to their
 new measures against the transit of West German citizens and freight. The
 bulk of traffic to Berlin is proceeding normally, however. Although the
 Russians continue to insist that East Germany's moves are justified, they
 seem anxious to keep tensions down.
 Pravda on 19 June published an authoritative and explicit com-
 mentary on recent appeals by President Johnson for better US-Soviet
 relations. The article implied that the USSR would respond favorably
 when the US showed real interest by acting to end "aggression" in
 Vietnam, support for Israeli policies, "ideological subversions" and trade
 discrimination against the USSR and its allies, and further "militarization"
 of the US and its allies. The Soviets have been at pains to put down any
 notion of a warming trend in US-Soviet relations. Anxieties about intellec-
 tual dissidence at home and in Eastern Europe account in large measure
 for this posture, which is reinforced by Moscow's need to show support
 for Hanoi and to parry Peking's propaganda.
 In Prague, the Dubcek regime has taken a number of important steps
 to implement its action program, including the signing of an agreement to
 share power among all political parties. The Soviets will probably object;
 last week, Pravda printed an unusually strong personal attack on a liberal
 Czechoslovak party leader.
 Meetings have resumed in Budapest of the committee preparing for
 the forthcoming world Communist conference in Moscow. Rumanian ob-
 servers are present, which suggests that nothing controversial is contem-
 plated.
 A mood of public apathy was apparent in France as the first stage of
 the parliamentary elections approached. The voting on 23 and 30 June is
 likely to reflect the polarization of political forces between the Gaullists
 and the Communists.
 The UN Security Council this week passed--with Algeria, Brazil,
 France, India, and Pakistan abstaining--the resolution extending to non-
 nuclear countries security assurances against nuclear attack. The measure is
 intended to encourage t e signing of the nonproliferation treaty, soon to
 be opened for signatures.

 EAST GERMANS USING ACCESS ISSUE TO GAIN RECOGNITION
 The Soviet Union has sanc-
 tioned East Germany's assertion of
 greater authority over traffic on
 the autobahns to Berlin, except
 for Allied traffic which is still
 governed by Four Power agreements.
 Unlike earlier pressures on
 Berlin, the present situation is
 not accompanied by hints of an im-
 pending crisis.  Although the Rus-
 sians continue to insist that the
 East German moves are justified,
 Moscow seems anxious to dampen any
 suggestions of tension.
 Two resolutions--on the docu-
 mentation for personal travel and
 on increased taxes and restrictions
 on freight--announced at the East
 Germany parliament session on 11
 June are broad enough to be used
 to choke the flow of traffic to
 Berlin. Under the new regulations,
 travelers are now required to pur-
 chase East German visas and to ex-
 change an increased amount of West
 Marks for East Marks in order to
 enter East Germany.  After 15
 July, West Germans will have to
 have passports.   The new freight
 taxes go into effect on 1 July.
 The East German regime prob-
 ably believes that it had to act
 now to secure as many attributes
 of sovereignty as possible.  Ul-
 bricht sees Bonn's Ostpolitik
 threatening to undercut East Ger-
 many's role in Europe and the
 stability of his regime endangered
 by an ever-lessening cohesion
 within the Warsaw Pact.   Any set-
 tlement coming from the Paris ne-
 gotiations on Vietnam also would
 tend to hasten European detente
 and.Eastern European disunity.
 Foreign Minister Brandt on
 18 June had a nine-hour talk with
 the Soviet ambassador to East Ger-
 many, the details of which Brandt
 has declined to discuss in public.
 The East German broadcasts during
 Brandt's visit suggest that they
 were not informed in advance by
 the Soviets, and the effect may
 be to embarrass Pankow in its
 attempts to assert its sover-
 eignty.
 In Bonn, policy making is com-
 plicated by divisions that have ap-
 peared between the two coalition
 partners during the search for ef-
 fective countermeasures.   Christian
 Democratic militants are calling
 for "active steps," while the So-
 cial Democrats want to avoid jeop-
 ardizing the country's detente pol-
 icy toward Eastern Europe.   Chancel-
 lor Kiesinger is seeking to mollify
 both groups.
 The chances for immediate,
 effective countermeasures seem to
 have been dealt a setback with
 Bonn's decision on 17 June not to
 apply interzonal trade sanctions
 lest they also affect West Berlin.
 Allied officials have stressed
 that broadly supported Western
 countermeasures, such as restric-
 ting East German travel abroad,
 are contingent upon Bonn's lead.
 Bonn has moved to offset the
 impact of the East German decrees.
 it will reimburse travelers and
 shippers for the new visa fees and
 freight charges, and has approved
 a program to increase economic aid
 to West Berlin.   Governing Mayor
 Schuetz, while welcoming the pledge
 of new aid, has questioned whether
 it will be enough to sustain the
 city's viability.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA i1OVES AHEAD ON REFORMS
 Czechoslovakia this week
 took some important steps toward
 reform despite continuing Soviet
 pressure designed to forestall
 or prevent implementation of
 Prague's action program.   Czech-
 oslovakia also solidified its
 relations with Hungary by renew-
 ing a 20-year friendship and
 mutual assistance treaty and
 again hinted that it is prepared
 to improve relations with the
 West.
 On 15 June, party leader
 Dubcek signed an agreement that
 will enable the other political
 parties within the National Front
 to join with the Communists in
 formulating and implementing
 state policies.  Although the
 Communist Party will retain its
 "leading role," the agreement
 "confirms" that power "must not
 be a monopoly of any single
 party," and provides that each
 member of the front will have
 the right to develop its own pro-
 gram according to its own re-
 quirements.
 By concluding this agreement,
 the Czechoslovak party has cast
 off the traditional communist
 view that the front must act only
 as a "transmission belt."  The
 Soviets, who earlier had objected
 to such a conception of the front,
 probably regard this agreement
 as an unacceptable "revision" of
 Marxism, but have yet to comment.
 Discussions in the National
 Assembly suggest that the Czech-
 oslovaks will accept the forma-
 tion of even more political par-
 ties so long as they operate
 within the framework of an en-
 larged National Front.  The con-
 stitutional-legal committee of
 the assembly also recommended that
 local and national elections be
 further postponed until after a
 proposed Czech-Slovak federative
 arrangement is effected.   Elec-
 tions probably will take place
 sometime in 1969.
 The Czechoslovaks earlier
 took legislative action, based
 on other aspects of the party's
 action program, which will not
 sit well with Moscow.   National
 Assembly committees discussed a
 bill designed to remove nearly
 all travel restrictions and ap-
 proved another that provides for
 the "rehabilitation" of persons
 unjustly imprisoned or killed.
 In addition, the government ended
 one aspect of its control over
 the publishing industry by abol-
 ishing the Center for Book Culture
 and also granted permission for
 the Greek Catholic Church, which
 had been "abolished" in 1950, to
 resume its activity.  Moreover,
 the cabinet directed the appropri-
 ate ministry to present a new
 and presumably more liberal bill
 to end press censorship.
 On 1-4 June, Moscow made its
 first public attack on a high-
 ranking Czechoslovak party of-
 ficial.  A candidate member of
 the Soviet central committee,
 writing in Pravda, accused
 Cestmir Cisar, a Czechoslovak
 party secretary, of being a

 "revisionist" and "opportunist."
 The article, apparently misrep-
 resenting a speech Cisar made
 on 6 May, suggests that the So-
 viets withheld their criticism
 until they believed it necessary
 to remind Prague of its promises
 to preserve the essentials of
 Communist control.
 In Budapest, both Dubcek
 and Premier Cernik were again
 equivocal concerning Prague's
 intentions toward West Germany,
 but both held out the possibility
 that diplomatic ties eventually
 will be established.   Dubcek
 urged acceptance of a "realistic
 arrangement" between the two
 Germanies, but added that it is
 in Prague's interest to "normal-
 ize" relations with Bonn.   He
 also said that Prague demands
 "nothing else" from Bonn than
 that it "break with the heritage
 of nationalism" and that it en-
 sure that neo-Nazi forces not
 gain preponderance.
 Cernik had earlier stated
 that Czechoslovakia wants to
 improve its economic ties with
 European Common Market members,
 but he stopped short of suggest-
 ing that Prague is seeking rela-
 tions with the EEC.   Prague is
 also reported to have taken the
 initiative toward making signifi-
 cant improvements in its rela-
 tions with Austria.
 Early in the week, Soviet
 Marshal Yakubovsky, the Warsaw
 Pact's commander, arrived in
 Czechoslovakia to assume control
 of the command-staff exercise
 now under way.   Just before
 leaving for Prague, Yakubovsky
 said that only communications
 troops would be in the exercise
 and as of 20 June, no Pact com-
 bat troops had been detected mov-
 ing into Czechoslovakia.   He
 also said that the exercise
 would take place in Czechoslo-
 vakia, Poland, the USSR, and
 East Germany, and would involve
 units from these four countries
 and from Hungary.
 This was the first indica-
 tion of East German involvement
 and contradicted a Czechoslovak
 Defense Ministry spokesman's
 statement earlier in the month
 that East Germany would not
 participate in the exercise.
 The confusing pronouncements
 point up the ad hoc nature of
 the exercise, the motive for
 which appears more political
 than military.

 FRENCH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS APPROACH
 The two-stage national legis-
 lative elections on 23 and 30
 June are expected to take place
 in an atmosphere of relative calm.
 Only about 200,000 of the original
 10 million strikers remain off
 the job and these are concentrated
 in a few concerns--the metallurgi-
 cal, electric, and electronics in-
 dustries and the state-controlled
 radio and television service. The
 students, too, have been quelled,
 at least temporarily, since the
 police invaded and occupied their
 sanctuaries in the Odeon Theater
 and the Sorbonne.
 Although the election cam-
 paign has been marked by scat-
 tered incidents of violence un-
 usual in France, the political at-
 mosphere as a whole has been sub-
 dued.   The strange mood of public
 apathy probably stems from the
 belief that the elections will
 not solve any of the basic prob-
 lems that generated the crisis.
 The trend of the elections
 has been toward a polarization of
 the country's political forces be-
 tween the Gaullists and the Com-
 munists.   The orthodox Gaullists,
 running for electoral purposes
 under the label of the Union for
 the Defense of the Republic  (UDR),
 have exploited this trend by pre-
 senting themselves as the only
 viable alternative to a Communist
 dictatorship.   The UDR will run
 candidates in every constituency,
 as will the Communist Party. The
 Communists welcome the govern-
 ment's policy of presenting the
 elections as a clear choice between
 left and right, and hope to emerge
 as the unchallenged leader of the
 left, which they claim is insig-
 nificant without them.
 Public opinion polls on the
 first-ballot preferences of the
 voters show a small but perceptible
 trend toward the Gaullists--both
 the UDR and the Gaullist-allied
 Independent Republicans--and toward
 the small, far-left Unified So-.
 cialist Party.  Conversely, the
 center, the Federation of the Left,
 and the Communists all appear to
 be losing slightly in comparison
 with first-round results in 1967.
 In one poll, a large majority of
 those preferring either the Gaul-
 lists or the Communists indicated
 that there was little or no chance
 that they would change their mind.
 Approximately one fifth of those
 queried expressed no preference at
 all)
 The editor-in-chief of the
 influential daily, Le Monde, who
 is an authority on tie Communists,
 commented that a substantial num-
 ber of Communist voters preferred
 to keep their political preferences
 to themselves, which could account
 for the apparent lack of Communist
 ro ress in winning public support.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The potential for serious clashes between Arab and Israeli forces has
 increased during the week. Egyptian troops are reported to have moved
 into a disputed area at the northern end of the Suez Canal, and the
 Israelis have threatened retaliation. Israel is also stiffening its attitude
 regarding recent incidents along the Jordanian cease-fire line and has
 indicated it will employ artillery more freely in future exchanges.
 In Athens, Premier Papadopoulos carried out an extensive cabinet
 reshuffle. Key ministries are unaffected, however, as most appointments
 involved second-echelon ministries. The most significant feature of the
 shift is that no junta members are among the new appointees, reflecting
 Papadopoulos' confidence in his own position.
 In Africa, the new government in Sierra Leone may severely limit the
 activities of the Peace Corps or even ask it to leave the country. The
 cabinet is debating the future of the corps and is focusing particular
 criticism on the rural development work of the volunteers. Freetown's
 press has tried to link the activities of the Peace Corps with US intel-
 ligence.
 Peking has been going all out to make Tanzania's President Nyerere
 feel welcome during his four-day visit. Nyerere's high-level delegation
 includes his three ministers of state, the inspector-general of police, and
 the armed forces commander. Talks on additional Chinese aid are likely to
 cover diesel locomotives for the Tan-Zam railroad, jet fighters for Tan-
 zania's fledgling air force, and Chinese personnel for the Tanzanian civil
 service in anticipation of a withdrawal of British administrators.
 London is continuing its efforts to get peace talks started again to
 end the Nigerian civil war. Lord Shepherd, minister of state for Common-
 wealth affairs, who has been talking to the Biafrans in London, arrived in
 Lagos on 20 June to present his proposals to the federal government.
 Neither protagonist seems likely to react positively, however, and pros-
 pects for any sort of talks still appear dim. Meanwhile, the USSR is
 reported to be willing to step up its arms shipments to Lagos if the British
 halt such supplies            to continuing domestic pressure.                            25X1

 USSR EMPHASIZES TRAINING IN MILITARY AID TO EGYPT
 The major emphasis now in
 Moscow's military aid to Egypt,
 a year after the June war made
 the need obvious, is on teaching
 the Egyptians how to use their
 Soviet-supplied equipment.
 The USSR has doubled the
 number of its military advisers
 and technicians in Egypt to an
 estimated 1,500, most of whom ap-
 pear to be engaged in training.
 Soviet instructors are said
 to be with line units of the army
 down to brigade level and to be
 teaching at basic training schools
 as well.   Soviet advisers also
 are attached to signal, mainte-
 nance, reconnaissance, and trans-
 port units.
 The Soviets' goal appears to
 be to teach the Egyptians the ef-
 fective use of equipment and per-
 sonnel.   The quantity of equipment
 provided apparently will be gov-
 erned by this consideration. When
 President Nasir goes to Moscow
 next month, military aid will prob-
 ably be a major topic of discussion.
 The Soviet assessment of the ef-
 fectiveness of its training pro-
 gram in Egypt during the past year
 is likely to be an important de-
 terminant of future military as-
 sistance.
 Soviet military aid deliveries
 to Egypt over the past three months
 have dropped from six to about two
 shiploads per month.  About 75 per-
 cent of the estimated $300 million
 worth of military equipment lost by
 the Egyptians now has been replaced,
 including most of the aircraft an
 at least half of the tanks.

 ISRAELI P0tIER STRUGGLE HEATS UP
 The unity of the Israel Labor
 Party and of the governing coali-
 tion it dominates was strained
 this week by a political maneuver
 of Prime Minister Eshkol.   Eshkol
 designated a new deputy prime min-
 ister in a surprise move aimed at
 blocking any attempt by Defense
 Minister Moshe Dayan to win con-
 trol of the party and the govern-
 ment.             The prime minister also
 announced that Minister of Labor
 Yigal Allon would be head of a
 new ministry for immigrant absorp-
 tion as well as deputy prime min-
 ister.
 Allon, a hero of the 1948-
 49 War of Independence, is the
 leader of one of the three par-
 ties that merged in January 1968
 to create the Israel Labor Party.
 Eshkol heads the largest constitu-
 ent group, the former MAPAI party,
 and Dayan is the leader of the
 third.
 The maneuver has aligned
 Eshkol's "old guard" MAPAI lead-
 ership with Allon's faction, and
 the two probably can command a
 majority within the new Israel
 Labor Party.   The step may mean
 that Allon is Eshkol's preferred
 successor to party and government
 leadership, although the 73-year-
 old prime minister shows no sign
 of planning to step down prior
 to the parliamentary election in
 1969.
 Dayan's followers were caught
 flat-footed by the move and are
 crying foul, claiming they were
 not consulted.   They boycotted
 the special meeting of the party
 leadership bureau on 14 June at
 which Eshkol's proposal was ap-
 proved.   The larger secretariat,
 in which Dayan's faction has
 greater strength, was scheduled to
 meet on 20 June.   It was not clear
 beforehand whether Dayan's faction
 would acquiesce grudgingly and
 bide its time or would attempt
 to force an immediate showdown
 with Eshkol.
 Dayan himself has shown no
 sign of wishing to take up the
 gauntlet now.   He may make some
 gesture of protest, but previously
 he has shown every indication of
 appreciating that his ambition to
 lead the country probably can be
 achieved only through securing
 control of the Israel Labor Party,
 the locus of political power.
 At least four of the five
 other parties in the governing co-
 alition have also criticized Esh-
 kol's failure to consult them be-
 fore making his move.  Formed as
 a "national unity government" on
 the eve of the 1967 war, the co-
 alition has since become a shaky
 alliance that is virtually certain
 to break up prior to the election
 in 1969.   Eshkol's present maneu-
 ver could provide the occasion
 for one or more of the parties to
 withdraw.   The cabinet is sched-
 uled to have a full discussion
 of the proposal within a week or
 so.

 SENEGAL DEALS WITH LABOR DEMANDS
 President Senghor has con-
 centrated on handling the deep-
 seated grievances of the labor
 movement in the aftermath of last
 month's student and labor strikes.
 His neglect of student demands
 prompted a three-day student boy-
 cott of Dakar lycees last week
 which led to the closing of all
 Senegalese schools until October.
 The boycott probably was also in-
 fluenced by renewed student bel-
 ligerency in France.
 After several preparatory
 meetings, representatives of gov-
 ernment, labor, and employers met
 on 12 June to consider the com-
 prehensive list of labor demands
 submitted to Senghor shortly be-
 fore the May crisis.   In a speech
 to the nation the next day, Seng-
 hor announced agreement on an im-
 mediate 15-percent increase in
 the basic minimum wage scale and
 promised various other improve-
 ments.
 He emphasized that increased
 production and stronger austerity
 measures would be required to
 finance the programs without a
 tax increase, and announced a sym-
 bolic cutback in the generous and
 much-criticized salaries and
 benefits of deputies.  Although
 many of the labor demands remain
 to be negotiated, the increased
 minimum wage as well as the full
 participation of militant leftist
 labor leaders in the negotiations
 should temporarily forestall
 further labor agitation.
 While Senghor ignored the
 students to deal with labor prob-
 lems, rumors began to circulate
 that the University of Dakar,
 where the May demonstrations
 began, would remain closed next
 year.   When lycees opened on
 12 June for the first time since
 May, Dakar students, apparently
 led by final-year students who
 saw no point in taking exams if
 there were to be no university
 to attend next year, launched a
 half-hearted strike.   Although
 Senghor avoided using force to
 disperse the students, one non-
 student demonstrator reportedly
 was killed by a policeman on
 14 June.   Probably fearing that
 the incident would again cause
 labor leaders to rally to the
 student cause, Senghor promptly
 closed all schools, earning angry
 criticism from parents.
 Late on 13 June, Senghor
 made his first meaningful gesture
 to the students.   In response to
 their basic dissatisfaction with
 the French-structured education
 system, he announced that the
 University of Dakar, which is
 administered and heavily funded
 by France, would be reformed
 to meet African requirements.
 He did not announce when the
 university would be reopened.
 If the proposed reforms are
 undertaken, it seems unlikely that
 France would continue to under-
 write the university.   Senegal's
 already strained budget will be
 heavily taxed by the concessions
 to labor and by the cost of re-
 pairing damages incurred during
 the May demonstrations, and would
 probably not stretch to cover
 the loss of the large French sub-
 sidy to the university.

 CONGO'S IMPROVED ECONOMY STILL FACES LONG-RANGE PROBLEMS
 The reforms that Kinshasa
 initiated last June to correct
 the Congo's distorted financial
 system have been fairly success-
 ful, but falling copper prices
 and years of economic deteriora-
 tion will cause stagnation for
 some time.
 Wage and price increases have
 been held within the reform guide-
 lines suggested by the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund, foreign ex-
 change holdings have risen sub-
 stantially, and the free-market
 value of the Congolese currency
 has stabilized after many years
 of decline.   Although improvements
 in the government budget situa-
 tion did not match expectations
 and a deficit continued during
 the reform's first year, it was
 not in itself large enough to af-
 fect adversely the other finan-
 cial gains.  Agricultural and
 mineral output, however, has not
 yet increased much.
 Congolese authorities recently
 announced a second phase of the
 reform program designed to stimu-
 late economic growth.   Kinshasa
 recognizes that private capital
 will play an important role in
 achieving this goal and has moved
 to improve the investment climate
 for foreign businessmen, especially
 Belgians.   The governor of the
 Congo National Bank stated that,
 beginning in 1969, profits earned
 in the Congo can be repatriated.
 For his part, President Mo-
 butu has resolved many long-stand-
 ing disputes that his government
 has had with Brussels.  For ex-
 ample, the differences between
 the state-owned airlines, Air
 Congo and Sabena, which for many
 years have hampered the opera-
 tions of Air Congo, were settled
 in early June.   In addition, Mo-
 butu has named expatriates to re-
 place some of the inept Congolese
 officials who had been running
 government-owned public services.
 Despite rejuvenation efforts,
 however, the Congo's economy is
 still subject to long-range prob-
 lems.   Even with the additional
 expatriates, there will be a
 paucity of skills for many years.
 The transport system has so de-
 teriorated after years of neglect
 that even if agricultural and
 mineral production could be in-
 creased, only a small portion
 could be carried to ocean ports.
 Moreover, the financial gains
 of last year are likely to dis-
 sipate.  Much of the recent suc-
 cess is attributable to the high
 copper prices that resulted from
 the prolonged US copper strike.
 Now that copper prices have fallen,
 Kinshasa will be faced with grow-
 ing budget deficits and a worsen-
 ing balance-of-payments situation.
 Lack of economic improvement
 will not necessarily cause se-
 rious political problems.  A
 few prestigious development proj-
 ects may be enough for Mobutu
 or any successor as long as he
 has a modicum of control over the
 entire country.   The populace will
 probably,  as in the past, absorb
 large doses of economic punish-
 ment without significant politi-
 cal reaction.  Violence and a
 new round of chaos is always pos-
 sible, however.   A new uprising,
 another period of xenophobia, or
 the passing of Mobutu could lead
 to further disruptions in eco-

 MOROCCAN COMMUNISTS SEEK LEGAL STATUS
 The banned but tolerated
 Moroccan Communist Party, which
 has expanded its activities in
 recent years and continues to
 enjoy contacts in ruling circles,
 is now making a bid for legality.
 On 5 June the Communists sub-
 mitted to the government the
 statutes of a new party--the
 "Party of Liberation and Social-
 ism"--for recognition as a legal
 political entity.   They allegedly
 had decided on this move last
 fall, but considered then that
 the time was not propitious.
 Under Moroccan law,  the organiza-
 tion automatically would achieve
 legality unless the government
 disapproves the petition within
 90 days.
 The move follows on the heels
 of a significant Communist victory
 in student polls.   Early last
 month the Communists won 48   of
 the 60 seats on the council
 of the major, left-wing student
 union at the University of Rabat.
 Non-Communist forces rallied and
 stopped further Communist inroads
 in student elections elsewhere,
 but the party may be girding for
 a major contest when the student
 congress meets this summer.
 Although the Moroccan Com-
 munist Party acted circumspectly
 after being banned in 1959, it has
 been operating openly for some
 months now.   Early this year it
 installed an $80,000 printing
 press acquired from East Germany
 complete with several technicians
 to supervise its installation and
 operation. Its newspaper, an
 Arabic-language weekly published
 as the private organ of its secre-
 tary general, has appeared more
 regularly.   In April it played
 host to a delegation of the French
 Communist Party which openly met
 with prominent non-Communist
 Moroccans such as former premier
 Abdallah Ibrahim, as well as
 labor leaders and intellectuals.
 Many Moroccan Communists also
 appeared at the reception on
 15 May celebrating the opening
 of the Soviet Consulate General
 in Casablanca.
 The Moroccan Communists'
 principal assets are their ready
 access to the King and the high
 positions several of them hold
 within the government.

 Postelectoral shenanigans and student disorders dominated the news
 from Latin America last week.
 Although the elections in Panama were held more than five weeks
 ago, the make-up of the 42-man National Assembly has still not been
 determined. The vote-counting in the important provinces of Panama and
 Colon has been delayed by President-elect Arias,
 In Mexico, the government party continues to deny a small opposi-
 tion party its victory in the local elections in Baja California on 2 June.
 The mayoralty races in Tijuana and Mexicali, which apparently were won
 by the opposition, have been nullified, and the opposition has been
 "awarded" only one seat in the state legislature.
 On 18 June in Ecuador, the electoral tribunal suspended the official
 counting of presidential votes when it discovered many irregularities in
 returns from Guayas Province. Followers of Jose Maria Velasco, whose
 unofficial victory depended heavily on majorities in Guayas, have begun
 protest demonstrations
 Student groups and labor unions in Uruguay, united in protest against
 the imposition of a state of siege by President Pacheco's beleaguered
 government, embarked on a series of demonstrations and a 24-hour general
 strike. Fear of serious bloodshed induced both demonstrators and police
 to soft-pedal provocations and resulting suppressions, however, and the
 confrontation is still a standoff.
 In Brazil on 18 June, student. demonstrators again tangled with Rio
 de Janeiro police. The students showed considerably better organization
 than in earlier clashes. Irate police officials have declared that no further
 disorders will be tolerated, but the students seem determined to continue
 their protest and may provoke even more serious incidents.

 LIBERAL PARTY MAJORITY LIKELY IN CANADIAN VOTING
 Prime Minister Trudeau's
 Liberal Party appears likely to
 win a small parliamentary major-
 ity in the election on 25 June.
 The prime minister has established
 a :rapport with his audiences
 throughout most of the country.
 He has kept the campaign focused
 on issues of his choosing--for-
 eign policy questions and the
 issue of national unity.
 In contrast, the campaign
 of Progressive Conservative
 leader Robert Stanfield has been
 poorly organized.   The Conserva-
 tives have not succeeded in mak-
 ing economic problems, on which
 the Liberals are most vulnerable,
 the dominant theme in the cam-
 paign.   The Conservatives have
 been hurt, too, by a revamping
 of the electoral districts, which
 eliminated seats in their rural
 strongholds.
 The leftist New Democratic
 Party appears likely at least to
 hold its present representation--
 22 of the 264 seats--although its
 popular vote may fall below the
 1965 peak.   The strong showing
 that party leader Tommy Douglas
 made in a two-hour television
 debate with Trudeau and Stanfield
 has helped head off serious in-
 roads into the party's strength.
 The New Democrats have made
 criticism of US investment in
 Canada the central theme of their
 vote-getting effort.   Both Trudeau
 and Stanfield have almost ignored
 the issue, however, and it has
 not figured as prominently in
 this campaign as in some previous
 ones.
 Trudeau's strong profeder-
 alist stand, combined with Stan-
 field's equivocal position on the
 granting of greater autonomy to
 Quebec, will probably gain the
 Liberals some seats in English
 Canada although it may cost them
 ground in Quebec.   In the more
 rural areas of the province, Tru-
 deau's reputation as a social re-
 former also hurts the party.   It
 now appears, however, that only
 an unexpectedly heavy turnout
 against the Liberals in rural
 Quebec can deny Trudeau a parlia-
 mentary majority.
 The three party leaders
 have supported a comprehensive
 review of Canada's foreign and
 military commitments, and have
 favored recognition of Communist
 China.   The Vietnam issue has
 not played a significant part
 in the campaign.   Several weeks
 ago at a press conference, Tru-
 deau said that the US should
 stop all bombing of North Viet-
 nam.                                                            He appeared a bit taken
 back by widespread international
 reporting of his remarks and
 has not pursued the subject.

 Early on 19 June the congress
 approved a bill providing for the

 President Pacheco has been unable

 events, coupled with a crippling
 strike in the government banking

 In spite of the government's
 action, Uruguayan labor leaders
 succeeded in instigating a strike
 on 18 June in which thousands of
 workers participated.   The govern-
